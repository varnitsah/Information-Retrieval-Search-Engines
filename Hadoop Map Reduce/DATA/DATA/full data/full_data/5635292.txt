5635292	the naturalist in la plata  by  w h hudson cmzs   joint author of argentine ornithology   with illustrations by j smit  third edition  new york d appleton and company 1895     preface   the plan i have followed in this work has been to sift and arrange the facts i have gathered concerning the habits of the animals best known to me preserving those only which in my judgment appeared worth recording in some instances a variety of subjects have linked themselves together in my mind and have been grouped under one heading consequently the scope of the book is not indicated by the list of contents this want is however made good by an index at the end  it is seldom an easy matter to give a suitable name to a book of this description i am conscious that the one i have made choice of displays a lack of originality also that this kind of title has been used hitherto for works constructed more or less on the plan of the famous naturalist on the amazons after i have made this apology the reader on his part will readily admit that in treating of the natural history of a district so well known and often described as the southern portion of la plata which has a temperate climate and where nature is neither exuberant nor grand a personal narrative would have seemed superfluous  the greater portion of the matter contained in this volume has already seen the light in the form of papers contributed to the field with other journals that treat of natural history and to the monthly magazineslongmans the nineteenth century the gentlemans magazine and others i am indebted to the editors and proprietors of these periodicals for kindly allowing me to make use of this material  of all animals birds have perhaps afforded me most pleasure but most of the fresh knowledge i have collected in this department is contained in a larger work argentine ornithology of which dr p l sclater is part author as i have not gone over any of the subjects dealt with in that work birdlife has not received more than a fair share of attention in the present volume     contents   chapter i the desert pampas  chapter ii cub puma or lion of america  chapter iii wave of life  chapter iv some

chapter i  the desert pampas   during recent years we have heard much about the great and rapid changes now going on in the plants and animals of all the temperate regions of the globe colonized by europeans these changes if taken merely as evidence of material progress must be a matter of rejoicing to those who are satisfied and more than satisfied with our system of civilization or method of outwitting nature by the removal of all checks on the undue increase of our own species to one who finds a charm in things as they exist in the unconquered provinces of natures dominions and who not being overanxious to reach the end of his journey is content to perform it on horseback or in a waggon drawn by bullocks it is permissible to lament the altered aspect of the earths surface together with the disappearance of numberless noble and beautiful forms both of the animal and vegetable kingdoms for he cannot find it in his heart to love the forms by which they are replaced these are cultivated and domesticated and have only become useful to man at the cost of that grace and spirit which freedom and wildness give in numbers they are manytwentyfive millions of sheep in this district fifty millions in that a hundred millions in a thirdbut how few are the species in place of those destroyed and when the owner of many sheep and much wheat desires varietyfor he possesses this instinctive desire albeit in conflict with and overborne by the perverted instinct of destructionwhat is there left to him beyond his very own except the weeds that spring up in his fields under all skies ringing him round with oldworld monotonous forms as tenacious of their undesired union with him as the rats and cockroaches that inhabit his house  we hear most frequently of north america new zealand and australia in this connection but nowhere on the globe has civilization written strange defeatures more markedly than on that great area of level country called by english writers the pampas but by the spanish more appropriately la pampafrom the quichua word signifying open space or countrysince it forms in most part one continuous plain extending on its eastern border from the river parana in latitude 32 degrees to the patagonian formation on the river colorado and comprising about two hundred thousand square miles of humid grassy country  this district has been colonized by europeans since the middle of the sixteenth century but down to within a very few years ago immigration was on too limited a scale to make any very great change and speaking only of the pampean country the conquered territory was a long thinlysettled strip purely pastoral and the indians with their primitive mode of warfare were able to keep back the invaders from the greater portion of their ancestral huntinggrounds not twenty years ago a ride of two hundred miles starting from the capital city buenos ayres was enough to place one well beyond the furthest southwestern frontier outpost in 1879 the argentine government determined to rid the country of the aborigines or at all events to break their hostile and predatory spirit once for all with the result that the entire area of the grassy pampas with a great portion of the sterile pampas and patagonia has been made available to the emigrant there is no longer anything to deter the starvelings of the old world from possessing themselves of this new land of promise flowing like australia with milk and tallow if not with honey any emasculated migrant from a genoese or neapolitan slum is now competent to fight the wilderness out there with his eightshilling fowlingpiece and the implements of his trade the barbarians no longer exist to frighten his soul with dreadful war cries they have moved away to another more remote and shadowy region called in their own language alhuemapu and not known to geographers for the results so long and ardently wished for have swiftly followed on general rocas military expedition and the changes witnessed during the last decade on the pampas exceed in magnitude those which had been previously effected by three centuries of occupation  in view of this wave of change now rapidly sweeping away the old order with whatever beauty and grace it possessed it might not seem inopportune at the present moment to give a rapid sketch from the field naturalists point of view of the great plain as it existed before the agencies introduced by european colonists had done their work and as it still exists in its remoter parts  the humid grassy pampean country extends roughly speaking halfway from the atlantic ocean and the plata and paraná rivers to the andes and passes gradually into the monte formation or sterile pampaa sandy more or less barren district producing a dry harsh ligneous vegetation principally thorny bushes and low trees of which the chañar gurliaca decorticans is the most common hence the name of chañarsteppe used by some writers and this formation extends southwards down into patagonia scientists have not yet been able to explain why the pampas with a humid climate and a soil exceedingly rich have produced nothing but grass while the dry sterile territories on their north west and south borders have an arborescent vegetation darwins conjecture that the extreme violence of the pampero or southwest wind prevented trees from growing is now proved to have been illfounded since the introduction of the eucalyptus globulus for this noble tree attains to an extraordinary height on the pampas and exhibits there a luxuriance of foliage never seen in australia  to this level areamy parish of selborne or at all events a goodly portion of itwith the sea on one hand and on the other the practically infinite expanse of grassy desertanother sea not in vast fluctuations fixed but in comparative calmi should like to conduct the reader in imagination a country all the easier to be imagined on account of the absence of mountains woods lakes and rivers there is indeed little to be imaginednot even a sense of vastness and darwin touching on this point in the journal of a naturalist aptly saysat sea a persons eye being six feet above the surface of the water his horizon is two miles and fourfifths distant in like manner the more level the plain the more nearly does the horizon approach within these narrow limits and this in my opinion entirely destroys the grandeur which one would have imagined that a vast plain would have possessed  i remember my first experience of a hill after having been always shut within these narrow limits it was one of the range of sierras near cape corrientes and not above eight hundred feet high yet when i had gained the summit i was amazed at the vastness of the earth as it appeared to me from that modest elevation persons born and bred on the pampas when they first visit a mountainous district frequently experience a sensation as of a ball in the throat which seems to prevent free respiration  in most places the rich dry soil is occupied by a coarse grass three or four feet high growing in large tussocks and all the year round of a deep green a few slender herbs and trefoils with long twining stems maintain a frail existence among the tussocks but the strong grass crowds out most plants and scarcely a flower relieves its uniform everlasting verdure there are patches sometimes large areas where it does not grow and these are carpeted by small creeping herbs of a livelier green and are gay in spring with flowers chiefly of the composite and papilionaceous kinds and verbenas scarlet purple rose and white on moist or marshy grounds there are also several lilies yellow white and red two or three flags and various other small flowers but altogether the flora of the pampas is the poorest in species of any fertile district on the globe on moist clayey ground flourishes the stately pampa grass gynerium argenteum the spears of which often attain a height of eight or nine feet i have ridden through many leagues of this grass with the feathery spikes high as my head and often higher it would be impossible for me to give anything like an adequate idea of the exquisite loveliness at certain times and seasons of this queen of grasses the chief glory of the solitary pampa everyone is familiar with it in cultivation but the gardenplant has a sadly decaying draggled look at all times and to my mind is often positively ugly with its dense withering mass of coarse leaves drooping on the ground and bundle of spikes always of the same dead white or dirty creamcolour now colourthe various ethereal tints that give a blush to its cloudlike purityis one of the chief beauties of this grass on its native soil and travellers who have galloped across the pampas at a season of the year when the spikes are dead and white as paper or parchment have certainly missed its greatest charm the plant is social and in some places where scarcely any other kind exists it covers large areas with a sea of fleecywhite plumes in late summer and in autumn the tints are seen varying from the most delicate rose tender and illusive as the blush on the white underplumage of some gulls to purple and violaceous at no time does it look so perfect as in the evening before and after sunset when the softened light imparts a mistiness to the crowding plumes and the traveller cannot help fancying that the tints which then seem richest are caught from the level rays of the sun or reflected from the coloured vapours of the afterglow  the last occasion on which i saw the pampa grass in its full beauty was at the close of a bright day in march ending in one of those perfect sunsets seen only in the wilderness where no lines of house or hedge mar the enchanting disorder of nature and the earth and sky tints are in harmony i had been travelling all day with one companion and for two hours we had ridden through the matchless grass which spread away for miles on every side the myriads of white spears touched with varied colour blending in the distance and appearing almost like the surface of a cloud hearing a swishing sound behind us we turned sharply round and saw not forty yards away in our rear a party of five mounted indians coming swiftly towards us but at the very moment we saw them their animals came to a dead halt and at the same instant the five riders leaped up and stood erect on their horses backs satisfied that they had no intention of attacking us and were only looking out for strayed horses we continued watching them for some time as they stood gazing away over the plain in different directions motionless and silent like bronze men on strange horseshaped pedestals of dark stone so dark in their copper skins and long black hair against the faroff ethereal sky flushed with amber light and at their feet and all around the cloud of white and faintlyblushing plumes that farewell scene was printed very vividly on my memory but cannot be shown to another nor could it be even if a ruskins pen or a turners pencil were mine for the flight of the seamew is not more impossible to us than the power to picture forth the image of nature in our souls when she reveals herself in one of those special moments which have special grace in situations where her wild beauty has never been spoiled by man  at other hours and seasons the general aspect of the plain is monotonous and in spite of the unobstructed view and the unfailing verdure and sunshine somewhat melancholy although never sombre and doubtless the depressed and melancholy feeling the pampa inspires in those who are unfamiliar with it is due in a great measure to the paucity of life and to the profound silence the wind as may well be imagined on that extensive level area is seldom at rest there as in the forest it is a bard of many breathings and the strings it breathes upon give out an endless variety of sorrowful sounds from the sharp fitful sibilations of the dry wiry grasses on the barren places to the long mysterious moans that swell and die in the tall polished rushes of the marsh it is also curious to note that with a few exceptions the resident birds are comparatively very silent even those belonging to groups which elsewhere are highly loquacious the reason of this is not far to seek in woods and thickets where birds abound most they are continually losing sight of each other and are only prevented from scattering by calling often while the muffling effect on sound of the close foliage to which may be added a spirit of emulation where many voices are heard incites most species especially those that are social to exert their voices to the utmost pitch in singing calling and screaming on the open pampas birds which are not compelled to live concealed on the surface can see each other at long distances and perpetual calling is not needful moreover in that still atmosphere sound travels far as a rule their voices are strangely subdued natures silence has infected them and they have become silent by habit this is not the case with aquatic species which are nearly all migrants from noisier regions and mass themselves in lagoons and marshes where they are all loquacious together it is also noteworthy that the subdued birdvoices some of which are exceedingly sweet and expressive and the notes of many of the insects and batrachians have a great resemblance and seem to be in accord with the aeolian tones of the wind in reeds and grasses a stranger to the pampas even a naturalist accustomed to a different fauna will often find it hard to distinguish between bird frog and insect voices  the mammalia is poor in species and with the single exception of the wellknown vizcacha lagostomus trichodactylus there is not one of which it can truly be said that it is in any special way the product of the pampas or in other words that its instincts are better suited to the conditions of the pampas than to those of other districts as a fact this large rodent inhabits a vast extent of country north west and south of the true pampas but nowhere is he so thoroughly on his native heath as on the great grassy plain there to some extent he even makes his own conditions like the beaver he lives in a small community of twenty or thirty members in a village of deepchambered burrows all with their pitlike entrances closely grouped together and as the village endures for ever or for an indefinite time the earth constantly being brought up forms a mound thirty or forty feet in diameter and this protects the habitation from floods on low or level ground again he is not swift of foot and all rapacious beasts are his enemies he also loves to feed on tender succulent herbs and grasses to seek for which he would have to go far afield among the giant grass where his watchful foes are lying in wait to seize him he saves himself from this danger by making a clearing all round his abode on which a smooth turf is formed and here the animals feed and have their evening pastimes in comparative security for when an enemy approaches he is easily seen the note of alarm is sounded and the whole company scuttles away to their refuge in districts having a different soil and vegetation as in patagonia the vizcachas curious unique instincts are of no special advantage which makes it seem probable that they have been formed on the pampas  how marvellous a thing it seems that the two species of mammaliansthe beaver and the vizcachathat most nearly simulate mens intelligent actions in their social organizing instincts and their habitations which are made to endure should belong to an order so low down as the rodents and in the case of the latter species it adds to the marvel when we find that the vizcacha according to waterhouse is the lowest of the order in its marsupial affinities  the vizcacha is the most common rodent on the pampas and the rodent order is represented by the largest number of species the finest is the socalled patagonian haredolichotis patagonicaa beautiful animal twice as large as a hare with ears shorter and more rounded and legs relatively much longer the fur is grey and chestnut brown it is diurnal in its habits lives in kennels and is usually met with in pairs or small flocks it is better suited to a sterile country like patagonia than to the grassy humid plain nevertheless it was found throughout the whole of the pampas but in a country where the wisdom of a sir william harcourt was never needed to slip the leash this king of the rodentia is now nearly extinct  a common rodent is the coypúmyiopotamus coypúyellowish in colour with bright red incisors a rat in shape and as large as an otter it is aquatic lives in holes in the banks and where there are no banks it makes a platform nest among the rushes of an evening they are all out swimming and playing in the water conversing together in their strange tones which sound like the moans and cries of wounded and suffering men and among them the mothercoypú is seen with her progeny numbering eight or nine with as many on her back as she can accommodate while the others swim after her crying for a ride  with reference to this animal which as we have seen is prolific a strange thing once happened in buenos ayres the coypú was much more abundant fifty years ago than now and its skin which has a fine fur under the long coarse hair was largely exported to europe about that time the dictator rosas issued a decree prohibiting the hunting of the coypú the result was that the animals increased and multiplied exceedingly and abandoning their aquatic habits they became terrestrial and migratory and swarmed everywhere in search of food suddenly a mysterious malady fell on them from which they quickly perished and became almost extinct  what a blessed thing it would be for poor rabbitworried australia if a similar plague should visit that country and fall on the right animal on the other hand what a calamity if the infection widespread incurable and swift as the wind in its course should attack the toonumerous sheep and who knows what mysterious unheardof retributions that revengeful deity nature may not be meditating in her secret heart for the loss of her wild fourfooted children slain by settlers and the spoiling of her ancient beautiful order  a small pampa rodent worthy of notice is the cavia australis called cui in the vernacular from its voice a timid social mousecoloured little creature with a low gurgling language like running babbling waters in habits resembling its domestic pied relation the guinea pig it loves to run on clean ground and on the pampas makes little ratroads all about its hidingplace which little roads tell a story to the fox and such like therefore the little cavys habits and the habits of all cavies i fancy are not so well suited to the humid grassy region as to other districts with sterile ground to run and play upon and thickets in which to hide  a more interesting animal is the ctenomys magellanica a little less than the rat in size with a shorter tail pale grey fur and red incisors it is called tucotuco from its voice and oculto from its habits for it is a dweller underground and requires a loose sandy soil in which like the mole it may swim beneath the surface consequently the pampa with its heavy moist mould is not the tucos proper place nevertheless wherever there is a stretch of sandy soil or a range of dunes there it is found living not seen but heard for all day long and all night sounds its voice resonant and loud like a succession of blows from a hammer as if a company of gnomes were toiling far down underfoot beating on their anvils first with strong measured strokes then with lighter and faster and with a swing and rhythm as if the little men were beating in time to some rude chant unheard above the surface how came these isolated colonies of a species so subterranean in habits and requiring a sandy soil to move in so far from their proper districtthat sterile country from which they are separated by wide unsuitable areas they cannot perform long overland journeys like the rat perhaps the dunes have travelled carrying their little cattle with them  greatest among the carnivores are the two catmonarchs of south america the jaguar and puma whatever may be their relative positions elsewhere on the pampas the puma is mightiest being much more abundant and better able to thrive than its spotted rival versatile in its preying habits its presence on the pampa is not surprising but probably only an extreme abundance of large mammalian prey which has not existed in recent times could have tempted an animal of the river and forestloving habits of the jaguar to colonize this cold treeless and comparatively waterless desert there are two other important cats the grasscat not unlike felis catus in its robust form and dark colour but a larger more powerful animal inexpressibly savage in disposition the second felis geoffroyi is a larger and more beautiful animal coloured like a leopard it is called woodcat and as the name would seem to indicate is an intruder from wooded districts north of the pampas  there are two canines one is azaras beautiful grey foxlike dog purely a fox in habits and common everywhere the other is far more interesting and extremely rare it is called aguará its nearest ally being the aguaráguazú the canis jubatus or maned wolf of naturalists found north of the pampean district the aguará is smaller and has no mane it is like the dingo in size but slimmer and with a sharper nose and lias a much brighter red colour at night when camping out i have heard its dismal screams but the screamer was sought in vain while from the gauchos of the frontier i could only learn that it is a harmless shy solitary animal that ever flies to remoter wilds from its destroyer man they offered me a skinwhat more could i want simple souls it was no more to me than the skin of a dead dog with long bright red hair those who love dead animals may have them in any number by digging with a spade in that vast sepulchre of the pampas where perished the hosts of antiquity i love the living that are above the earth and how small a remnant they are in south america we know and now yearly becoming more precious as it dwindles away  the pestiferous skunk is universal and there are two quaintlooking weasels intensely black in colour and grey on the back and flat crown one the galictis barbara is a large bold animal that hunts in companies and when these longbodied creatures sit up erect glaring with beady eyes grinning and chattering at the passerby they look like little friars in black robes and grey cowls but the expression on their round faces is malignant and bloodthirsty beyond anything in nature and it would perhaps be more decent to liken them to devils rather than to humans  on the pampas there is strictly speaking only one ruminant the cervus campestris which is common the most curious thing about this animal is that the male emits a rank musky odour so powerful that when the wind blows from it the effluvium comes in nauseating gusts to the nostrils from a distance exceeding two miles it is really astonishing that only one small ruminant should be found on this immense grassy area so admirably suited to herbivorous quadrupeds a portion of which at the present moment affords sufficient pasture to eighty millions of sheep cattle and horses in la plata the author of the mammoth and the flood will find few to quarrel with his doctrine  of edentates there are four the giant armadillo does not range so far and the delicate little pink fairy armadillo the truncated chlamydophorus is a dweller in the sanddunes of mendoza and has never colonized the grassy pampas the tatusia hybrida called little mule from the length of its ears and the dasypus tricinctus which when disturbed rolls itself into a ball the wedgeshaped head and wedgeshaped tail admirably fitting into the deepcut shell side by side and the quirquincho dasypus minutus all inhabit the pampa are diurnal and feed exclusively on insects chiefly ants wherever the country becomes settled these three disappear owing to the dulness of their senses especially that of sight and to the diurnal habit which was an advantage to them and enabled them to survive when rapacious animals which are mostly nocturnal were their only enemies the fourth and most important is the hairy armadillo with habits which are in strange contrast to those of its perishing congeners and which seem to mock many hardandfast rules concerning animal life it is omnivorous and will thrive on anything from grass to flesh found dead and in all stages of decay or captured by means of its own strategy furthermore its habits change to suit its conditions thus where nocturnal carnivores are its enemies it is diurnal but where man appears as a chief persecutor it becomes nocturnal it is much hunted for its flesh dogs being trained for the purpose yet it actually becomes more abundant as population increases in any district and if versatility in habits or adaptiveness can be taken as a measure of intelligence this poor armadillo a survival of the past so old on the earth as to have existed contemporaneously with the giant glyptodon is the superior of the largebrained cats and canines  to finish with the mammalia there are two interesting opossums both of the genus didelphys but in habits as wide apart as cat from otter one of these marsupials appears so much at home on the plains that i almost regret having said that the vizcacha alone gives us the idea of being in its habits the product of the pampas this animaldidelphys crassicaudatahas a long slender wedge shaped head and body admirably adapted for pushing through the thick grass and rushes for it is both terrestrial and aquatic therefore well suited to inhabit low level plains liable to be flooded on dry land its habits are similar to those of a weasel in lagoons where it dives and swims with great ease it constructs a globular nest suspended from the rushes the fur is soft of a rich yellow reddish above and on the sides and under surfaces varying in some parts to orange in others exhibiting beautiful copper and terracotta tints these lovely tints and the metallic lustre soon fade from the fur otherwise this animal would be much sought after in the interests of those who love to decorate themselves with the spoils of beautiful dead animalsbeast and bird the other opossum is the black and white didelphys azarae and it is indeed strange to find this animal on the pampas although its presence there is not so mysterious as that of the tucotuco it shuffles along slowly and awkwardly on the ground but is a great traveller nevertheless tschudi met it mountaineering on the andes at an enormous altitude and true to its lawless nature it confronted me in patagonia where the books say no marsupial dwells in every way it is adapted to an arboreal life yet it is everywhere found on the level country far removed from the conditions which one would imagine to be necessary to its existence for how many thousands of years has this marsupial been a dweller on the plain all its best faculties unexercised its beautiful grasping hands pressed to the ground and its prehensile tail dragged like an idle rope behind it yet if one is brought to a tree it will take to it as readily as a duck to water or an armadillo to earth climbing up the trunk and about the branches with a monkeylike agility how reluctant nature seems in some cases to undo her own work how long she will allow a specialized organ with the correlated instinct to rest without use yet ready to flash forth on the instant bright and keenedged as in the ancient days of strife ages past before peace came to dwell on earth  the avifauna is relatively much richer than the mammalia owing to the large number of aquatic species most of which are migratory with their breeding or subsistenceareas on the pampas in more senses than one they constitute a floating population and their habits have in no way been modified by the conditions of the country the order including storks ibises herons spoonbills and flamingoes counts about eighteen species and the most noteworthy birds in it are two great ibises nearly as large as turkeys with mighty resonant voices the duck order is very rich numbering at least twenty species including two beautiful upland geese winter visitors from magellanic lands and two swans the lovely blacknecked and the pure white with rosy bill of rails or ralline birds there are ten or twelve ranging from a small spotted creature no bigger than a thrush to some large majestic birds one is the courlan called crazy widow from its mourning plumage and long melancholy screams which on still evenings may be heard a league away another is the graceful variegated ypicaha fond of social gatherings where the birds perform a dance and make the desolate marshes resound with their insane humanlike voices a smaller kind porphyriops melanops has a nightcry like a burst of shrill hysterical laughter which has won for it the name of witch while another rallus rythyrhynchus is called little donkey from its braying cries strange eerie voices have all these birds of the remaining aquatic species the most important is the spurwinged crested screamer a noble bird as large as a swan yet its favourite pastime is to soar upwards until it loses itself to sight in the blue ether whenca it pours forth its resounding choral notes which reach the distant earth clarified and with a rhythmic swell and fall as of chiming bells it also sings by night counting the hours the gauchos say and where they have congregated together in tens of thousands the mighty roar of their combined voices produces an astonishingly grand effect  the largest aquatic order is that of the limicolsesnipes plover and their allieswhich has about twentyfive species the vociferous spurwinged lapwing the beautiful black and white stilt a true snipe and a painted snipe are strictly speaking the only residents and it is astonishing to find that of the fiveandtwenty species at least thirteen are visitors from north america several of them having their breedingplaces quite away in the arctic regions this is one of those facts concerning the annual migration of birds which almost stagger belief for among them are species with widely different habits upland marsh and seashore birds and in their great biannual journey they pass through a variety of climates visiting many countries where the conditions seem suited to their requirements nevertheless in september and even as early as august they begin to arrive on the pampas the golden plover often still wearing his black nuptial dress singly and in pairs in small flocks and in clouds they comecurlew godwit plover tatler tringapiping the wild notes to which the greenlander listened in june now to the gaucho herdsman on the green plains of la plata then to the wild indian in his remote village and soon further south to the houseless huanacohunter in the grey wilderness of patagonia  here is a puzzle for ornithologists in summer on the pampas we have a godwitlimosa hudsonica in march it goes north to breed later in the season flocks of the same species arrive from the south to winter on the pampas and besides this godwit there are several other north american species which have colonies in the southern hemispere with a reversed migration and breeding season why do these southern birds winter so far south do they really breed in patagonia if so their migration is an extremely limited one compared with that of the northern birdsseven or eight hundred miles on the outside in one case against almost as many thousands of miles in the other considering that some species which migrate as far south as patagonia breed in the arctic regions as far north as latitude 82 degrees and probably higher still it would be strange indeed if none of the birds which winter in patagonia and on the pampas were summer visitors to that great austral continent which has an estimated area twice as large as that of europe and a climate milder than the arctic one the migrants would have about six hundred miles of sea to cross from tierra del fuego but we know that the golden plover and other species which sometimes touch at the bermudas when travelling fly much further than that without resting the fact that a common argentine titlark a nonmigrant and a weak flyer has been met with at the south shetland islands close to the antarctic continent shows that the journey may be easily accomplished by birds with strong flight and that even the winter climate of that unknown land is not too severe to allow an accidental colonist like this small delicate bird to survive the godwit already mentioned has been observed in flocks at the falkland islands in may that is three months after the same species had taken its autumal departure from the neighbouring mainland can it be believed that these late visitors to the falklands were breeders in patagonia and had migrated east to winter in so bleak a region it is far more probable that they came from the south officers of sailing ships beating round cape horn might be able to settle this question definitely by looking out and listening at night for flights of birds travelling north from about the first week in january to the end of february and in september and october travelling south probably not fewer than a dozen species of the plover order are breeders on the great austral continent also other aquatic birdsducks and geese and many passerine birds chiefly of the tyrant family  should the long projected australasian expedition to the south polar regions ever be carried to a successful issue there will probably be important results for ornithology in spite of the astounding theory which has found a recent advocate in canon tristram that all life originated at the north pole whence it spread over the globe but never succeeded in crossing the deep sea surrounding the antarctic continent which has consequently remained till now desolate a giant ash and ice of death nor is it unlikely that animals of a higher class than birds exist there and the discovery of new mammalians differing in type from those we know would certainly be glad tidings to most students of nature  land birds on the pampas are few in species and in numbers this may be accounted for by the absence of trees and other elevations on which birds prefer to roost and nest and by the scarcity of food insects are few in dry situations and the large perennial grasses which occupy most of the ground yield a miserable yearly harvest of a few minute seeds so that this district is a poor one both for soft and hard billed birds hawks of several genera in moderate numbers are there but generally keep to the marshes eagles and vultures are somewhat unworthily represented by carrionhawks polyborinae the lordly carancho almost eaglelike in size black and crested with a very large pale blue hooked beakhis battle axe and his humble follower and jackal the brown and harrierlike chimango these nest on the ground are versatile in their habits carrioneaters also killers on their own account and like wild dogs sometimes hunt in bands which gives them an advantage they are the unfailing attendants of all fleshhunters human or feline and also furiously pursue and persecute all eagles and true vultures that venture on that great sea of grass to wander thereafter for ever lost and harried the hagars and ishmaels of their kind  the owls are few and all of wideranging species the most common is the burrowingowl found in both americas not a retiring owl this but all day long in cold and in heat it stands exposed at the mouth of its kennel or on the vizcachas mound staring at the passerby with an expression of grave surprise and reprehension in its round yellow eyes male and female invariably together standing stiff and erect almost touchingof all birds that pair for life the most darby and joan like  of the remaining land birds numbering about forty species a few that are most attractive on account of their beauty engaging habits or large size may be mentioned here on the southern portion of the pampas the military starling sturnella is found and looks like the european starling with the added beauty of a scarlet breast among resident pampas birds the only one with a touch of brilliant colouring it has a pleasing careless song uttered on the wing and in winter congregates in great flocks to travel slowly northwards over the plains when thus travelling the birds observe a kind of order and the flock feeding along the ground shows a very extended fronta representation in birdlife of the thin red lineand advances by the hindmost birds constantly flying over the others and alighting in the front ranks  among the tyrantbirds are several species of the beautiful wingbanded genus snowwhite in colour with black on the wings and tail these are extremely graceful birds and strong flyers and in desert places where man seldom intrudes they gather to follow the traveller calling to each other with low whistling notes and in the distance look like white flowers as they perch on the topmost stems of the tall bending grasses  the most characteristic pampean birds are the tinamouscalled partridges in the vernacularthe rufous tinamou large as a fowl and the spotted tinamou which is about the size of the english partridge their habits are identical both lay eggs of a beautiful winepurple colour and in both species the young acquire the adult plumage and power of flight when very small and fly better than the adults they have small heads slender curved beaks unfeathered legs and feet and are tailless the plumage is deep yellowish marked with black and brown above they live concealed skulking like rails through the tall grass fly reluctantly and when driven up their flight is exceedingly noisy and violent the bird soon exhausting itself they are solitary but many live in proximity frequently calling to each other with soft plaintive voices the evening callnotes of the larger bird are flutelike in character and singularly sweet and expressive  the last figure to be introduced into this sketchwhich is not a catalogueis that of the rhea glyptodon toxodon mylodon megatherium have passed away leaving no descendants and only pigmy representatives if any but among the feathered inhabitants of the pampa the grand archaic ostrich of america survives from a time when there were also giants among the avians vain as such efforts usually are one cannot help trying to imagine something of the past history of this majestic bird before man came to lead the long chase now about to end so mournfully its fleetness great staying powers and beautiful strategy when hunted make it seem probable that it was not without pursuers other than the felines among its ancient enemies longwinded and tenacious of their quarry and these were perhaps of a type still represented by the wolf or houndlike aguará and aguaraguazú it might be supposed that when almost all the larger forms both mammal and bird were overtaken by destruction and when the existing rhea was on the verge of extinction these longlegged swift canines changed their habits and lost their bold spirit degenerating at last into hunters of small birds and mammals on which they are said to live  the rhea possesses a unique habit which is a puzzle to us although it probably once had some significancenamely that of running when hunted with one wing raised vertically like a great saila veritable ship of the wilderness in every way it is adapted to the conditions of the pampas in a far greater degree than other pampean birds only excepting the rufous and spotted tinamous its commanding stature gives it a wide horizon and its dim pale bluishgrey colour assimilates to that of the haze and renders it invisible at even a moderate distance its large form fades out of sight mysteriously and the hunter strains his eyes in vain to distinguish it on the blue expanse its figure and carriage have a quaint majestic grace somewhat unavian in character and peculiar to itself there are few more strangely fascinating sights in nature than that of the old blacknecked cock bird standing with raised agitated wings among the tall plumed grasses and calling together his scattered hens with hollow boomings and long mysterious suspirations as if a wind blowing high up in the void sky had found a voice rheahunting with the bolas on a horse possessing both speed and endurance and trained to follow the bird in all his quick doublings is unquestionably one of the most fascinating forms of sport ever invented by man the quarry has even more than that fair chance of escape without which all sport degenerates into mere butchery unworthy of rational beings moreover in this unique method of hunting the ostrich the capture depends on a preparedness for all the shifts and sudden changes of course practised by the bird when closely followed which is like instinct or intuition and finally in a dexterity in casting the bolas at the right moment with a certain aim which no amount of practice can give to those who are not to the manner born  this wild mirth of the desert which the gaucho has known for the last three centuries is now passing away for the rheas fleetness can no longer avail him he may scorn the horse and his rider what time he lifts himself up but the cowardly murderous methods of science and a systematic war of extermination have left him no chance and with the rhea go the flamingo antique and splendid and the swans in their bridal plumage and the rufous tinamousweet and mournful melodist of the eventide and the noble crested screamer that clarionvoiced watchbird of the night in the wilderness those and the other large avians together with the finest of the mammalians will shortly be lost to the pampas utterly as the great bustard is to england and as the wild turkey and bison and many other species will shortly be lost to north america what a wail there would be in the world if a sudden destruction were to fall on the accumulated arttreasures of the national gallery and the marbles in the british museum and the contents of the kings librarythe old prints and mediaeval illuminations and these are only the work of human hands and brainsimpressions of individual genius on perishable material immortal only in the sense that the silken cocoon of the dead moth is so because they continue to exist and shine when the artists hands and brain are dustand man has the long day of life before him in which to do again things like these and better than these if there is any truth in evolution but the forms of life in the two higher vertebrate classes are natures most perfect work and the life of even a single species is of incalculably greater value to mankind for what it teaches and would continue to teach than all the chiselled marbles and painted canvases the world contains though doubtless there are many persons who are devoted to art but blind to some things greater than art who will set me down as a philistine for saying so and above all others we should protect and hold sacred those types natures masterpieces which are first singled out for destruction on account of their size or splendour or rarity and that false detestable glory which is accorded to their most successful slayers in ancient times the spirit of life shone brightest in these and when others that shared the earth with them were taken by death they were left being more worthy of perpetuation like immortal flowers they have drifted down to us on the ocean of time and their strangeness and beauty bring to our imaginations a dream and a picture of that unknown world immeasurably far removed where man was not and when they perish something of gladness goes out from nature and the sunshine loses something of its brightness nor does their loss affect us and our times only the species now being exterminated not only in south america but everywhere on the globe are so far as we know untouched by decadence they are links in a chain and branches on the tree of life with their roots in a past inconceivably remote and but for our action they would continue to flourish reaching outward to an equally distant future blossoming into higher and more beautiful forms and gladdening innumerable generations of our descendants but we think nothing of all this we must give full scope to our passion for taking life though by so doing we ruin the great work of time not in the sense in which the poet used those words but in one truer and wider and infinitely sadder only when this sporting rage has spent itself when there are no longer any animals of the larger kinds remaining the loss we are now inflicting on this our heritage in which we have a lifeinterest only will be rightly appreciated it is hardly to be supposed or hoped that posterity will feel satisfied with our monographs of extinct species and the few crumbling bones and faded feathers which may possibly survive half a dozen centuries in some happilyplaced museum on the contrary such dreary mementoes will only serve to remind them of their loss and if they remember us at all it will only be to hate our memory and our agethis enlightened scientific humanitarian age which should have for a motto let us slay all noble and beautiful things for tomorrow we die     chapter ii  the puma ob lion of america   the puma has been singularly unfortunate in its biographers formerly it often happened that writers were led away by isolated and highly exaggerated incidents to attribute very shining qualities to their favourite animals the lion of the old world thus came to be regarded as brave and i magnanimous above all beasts of the fieldthe bayard of the fourfooted kind a reputation which these prosaic and sceptical times have not suffered it to keep precisely the contrary has happened with the puma of literature for although to those personally acquainted with the habits of this lesser lion of the new world it is known to possess a marvellous courage and daring it is nevertheless always spoken of in books of natural history as the most pusillanimous of the larger carnivores it does not attack man and azara is perfectly correct when he affirms that it never hurts or threatens to hurt man or child even when it finds them sleeping this however is not a full statement of the facts the puma will not even defend itself against man how natural then to conclude that it is too timid to attack a human being or to defend itself but scarcely philosophical for even the most cowardly carnivores we knowdogs and hyaenas for instancewill readily attack a disabled or sleeping man when pressed by hunger and when driven to desperation no animal is too small or too feeble to make a show of resistance in such a case even the armadillo defends itself as the gaucho proverb says besides the conclusion is in contradiction to many other wellknown facts puttingaside the pumas passivity in the presence of man it is a bold hunter that invariably prefers large to small game in desert places killing peccary tapir ostrich deer huanaco c all powerful wellarmed or swift animals huanaco skeletons seen in patagonia almost invariably have the neck dislocated showing that the puma was the executioner those only who have hunted the huanaco on the sterile plains and mountains it inhabits know how wary keenscented and fleet of foot it is i once spent several weeks with a surveying party in a district where pumas were very abundant and saw not less than half a dozen deer every day freshly killed in most cases and all with dislocated necks where prey is scarce and difficult to capture the puma after satisfying its hunger invariably conceals the animal it has killed covering it over carefully with grass and brushwood these deer however had all been left exposed to the caracaras and foxes after a portion of the breast had been eaten and in many cases the flesh had not been touched the captor having satisfied itself with sucking the blood it struck me very forcibly that the puma of the desert pampas is among mammals like the peregrine falcon of the same district among birds for there this wideranging raptor only attacks comparatively large birds and after fastidiously picking a meal from the flesh of the head and neck abandons the untouched body to the polybori and other hawks of the more ignoble sort  in pastoral districts the puma is very destructive to the larger domestic animals and has an extraordinary fondness for horseflesh this was first noticed by molina whose natural history of chili was written a century and a half ago in patagonia i heard on all sides that it was extremely difficult to breed horses as the colts were mostly killed by the pumas a native told me that on one occasion while driving his horses home through the thicket a puma sprang out of the bushes on to a colt following behind the troop killing it before his eyes and not more than six yards from his horses head in this instance my informant said the puma alighted directly on the colts back with one fore foot grasping its bosom while with the other it seized the head and giving it a violent wrench dislocated the neck the colt fell to the earth as if shot and he affirmed that it was dead before it touched the ground  naturalists have thought it strange that the horse once common throughout america should have become extinct over a continent apparently so well suited to it and where it now multiplies so greatly as a fact wherever pumas abound the wild horse of the present time introduced from europe can hardly maintain its existence formerly in many places horses ran wild and multiplied to an amazing extent but this happened i believe only in districts where the puma was scarce or had already been driven out by man my own experience is that on the desert pampas wild horses are exceedingly scarce and from all accounts it is the same throughout patagonia  next to horseflesh sheep is preferred and where the puma can come at a flock he will not trouble himself to attack horned cattle in patagonia especially i found this to be the case i resided for some time at an estancia close to the town of el carmen on the rio negro which during my stay was infested by a very bold and cunning puma to protect the sheep from his attacks an enclosure was made of upright willowpoles fifteen feet long while the gate by which he would have to enter was close to the house and nearly six feet high in spite of the difficulties thus put in the way and of the presence of several large dogs also of the watch we kept in the hope of shooting him every cloudy night he came and after killing one or more sheep got safely away one dark night he killed four sheep i detected him in the act and going up to the gate was trying to make out his invisible form in the gloom as he flitted about knocking the sheep over when suddenly he leaped clear over my head and made his escape the bullets i sent after him in the dark failing to hit him yet at this place twelve or fourteen calves belonging to the milch cows were every night shut into a small brushwood pen at a distance from the house where the enemy could easily have destroyed every one of them when i expressed surprise at this arrangement the owner said that the puma was not fond of calves flesh and came only for the sheep frequently after his nocturnal visits we found by tracing his footprints in the loose sand that he had actually used the calves pen as a place of concealment while waiting to make his attack on the sheep  the puma often kills fullgrown cows and horses but exhibits a still greater daring when attacking the jaguar the largest of american carnivores although compared with its swift agile enemy as heavy as a rhinoceros azara states that it is generally believed in la plata and paraguay that the puma attacks and conquers the jaguar but he did not credit what he heard which was not strange since he had already set the puma down as a cowardly animal because it does not attempt to harm man or child nevertheless it is well known that where the two species inhabit the same district they are at enmity the puma being the persistent persecutor of the jaguar following and harassing it as a tyrantbird harasses an eagle or hawk moving about it with such rapidity as to confuse it and when an opportunity occurs springing upon its back and inflicting terrible wounds with teeth and claws jaguars with scarred backs are frequently killed and others not long escaped from their tormentors have been found so greatly lacerated that they were easily overcome by the hunters  in kingsleys american standard natural history it is stated that the puma in north california has a feud with the grizzly bear similar to that of the southern animal with the jaguar in its encounter with the grizzly it is said to be always the victor and this is borne out by the finding of the bodies of bears which have evidently perished in the struggle  how strange that this most cunning bold and bloodthirsty of the felidae the persecutor of the jaguar and the scourge of the ruminants in the regions it inhabits able to kill its prey with the celerity of a rifle bullet never attacks a human being even the cowardly carrionfeeding dog will attack a man when it can do so with impunity but in places where the puma is the only large beast of prey it is notorious that it is there perfectly safe for even a small child to go out and sleep on the plain at the same time it will not fly from man though the contrary is always stated in books of natural history except in places where it is continually persecuted nor is this all it will not as a rule even defend itself against man although in some rare instances it has been known to do so  the mysterious gentle instinct of this ungentle species which causes the gauchos of the pampas to name it mans friendamigo del cristianohas been persistently ignored by all travellers and naturalists who have mentioned the puma they have thus made it a very incongruous creature strong enough to kill a horse yet so cowardly withal that it invariably flies from a human beingeven from a sleeping child possibly its real reputation was known to some of those who havo spoken about it if so they attributed what they heard to the love of the marvellous and the romantic natural to the nonscientific mind or else preferred not to import into their writings matter which has so great a likeness to fable and might have the effect of imperilling their reputation for sobermindedness  it is however possible that the singular instinct of tho southern puma which is unique among animals in a state of nature is not possessed by the entire species ranging as it does over a hundred degrees of latitude from british north america to tierra del fuego the widely different conditions of life in the various regions it inhabits must necessarily have caused some divergence concerning its habits in the dense forests of the amazonian region where it must have developed special instincts suited to its semiarboreal life scarcely anything has been recorded everyone is however familiar with the dreaded cougar catamount or panthersometimes called painterof north american literature thrilling descriptions of encounters with this imaginary maneating monster being freely scattered through the backwoods or border romances many of them written by authors who have the reputation of being true to nature it may be true that this cougar of a cold climate did occasionally attack man or as it is often stated follow him in the forest with the intention of springing on him unawares but on this point nothing definite will ever be known as the pioneers hunters of the past were only anxious to shoot cougar and not to study its instinct and disposition it is now many years since audubon and bachman wrote this animal which has excited so much terror in the minds of the ignorant and timid has been nearly exterminated in all the atlantic states and we do not recollect a single wellauthenticated instance where any hunters life fell a sacrifice in a cougar hunt it might be added i believe that no authentic instance has been recorded of the puma making an unprovoked attack on any human being in south america also the traveller in the wilderness is sometimes followed by a puma but he would certainly be very much surprised if told that it follows with the intention of springing on him unawares and devouring his flesh  i have spoken of the comparative ease with which the puma overcomes even large animals comparing it in this respect with the peregrine falcon but all predacious species are liable to frequent failures sometimes to fatal mishaps and even the cunning swiftkilling puma is no exception its attacks are successfully resisted by the ass which does not like the horse lose his presence of mind but when assaulted thrusts his head well down between its forelegs and kicks violently until the enemy is thrown or driven off pigs when in large herds also safely defy the puma massing themselves together for defence in their wellknown manner and presenting a serried line of tusks to the aggressor during my stay in patagonia a puma met its fate in a manner so singular that the incident caused considerable sensation among the settlers on the rio negro at the time a man named linares the chief of the tame indians settled in the neighbourhood of el carmen while riding near the river had his curiosity aroused by the appearance and behaviour of a young cow standing alone in the grass her head armed with long and exceedingly sharp horns much raised and watching his approach in a manner which betokened a state of dangerous excitement she had recently dropped her calf and he at once conjectured that it had been attacked and perhaps killed by some animal of prey to satisfy himself on this point he began to search for it and while thus engaged the cow repeatedly charged him with the greatest fury presently he discovered the calf lying dead among the long grass and by its side lay a fullgrown puma also dead and with a large wound in its side just behind the shoulder the calf had been killed by the puma for its throat showed the wounds of large teeth and the puma had been killed by the cow when he saw it he could he affirmed scarcely believe the evidence of his own senses for was an unheardof thing that a puma should be injured by any other animal his opinion was that it had come down from the hills in a starving condition and having sprung upon the calf the taste of blood had made it for a moment careless of its own safety and during that moment the infuriated cow had charged and driving one of her long sharp horns into some vital part killed it instantly  the puma is with the exception of some monkeys the most playful animal in existence the young of all the felidae spend a large portion of their time in characteristic gambols the adults however acquire a grave and dignified demeanour only the female playing on occasions with her offspring but this she always does with a certain formality of manner as if the relaxation were indulged in not spontaneously but for the sake of the young and as being a necessary part of their education some writer has described the lions assumption of gaiety as more grim than its most serious moods the puma at heart is always a kitten taking unmeasured delight in its frolics and when as often happens one lives alone in the desert it will amuse itself by the hour fighting mock battles or playing at hideandseek with imaginary companions and lying in wait and putting all its wonderful strategy in practice to capture a passing butterfly azara kept a young male for four months which spent its whole time playing with the slaves this animal he says would not refuse any food offered to it but when not hungry it would bury the meat in the sand and when inclined to eat dig it up and taking it to the watertrough wash it clean i have only known one puma kept as a pet and this animal in seven or eight years had never shown a trace of illtemper when approached he would lie down purring loudly and twist himself about a persons legs begging to be caressed a string or handkerchief drawn about was sufficient to keep him in a happy state of excitement for an hour and when one person was tired of playing with him he was ready for a game with the next comer  i was told by a person who had spent most of his life on the pampas that on one occasion when travelling in the neighbourhood of cape corrientes his horse died under him and he was compelled to continue his journey on foot burdened with his heavy native horsegear at night he made his bed under the shelter of a rock on the slope of a stony sierra a bright moon was shining and about nine oclock in the evening four pumas appeared two adults with their two halfgrown young not feeling the least alarm at their presence he did not stir and after a while they began to gambol together close to him concealing themselves from each other among the rocks just as kittens do and frequently while pursuing one another leaping over him he continued watching them until past midnight then fell asleep and did not wake until morning when they had left him  this man was an englishman by birth but having gone very young to south america he had taken kindly to the semibarbarous life of the gauchos and had imbibed all their peculiar notions one of which is that human life is not worth very much what does it matter they often say and shrug their shoulders when told of a comrades death so many beautiful horses die i asked him if he had ever killed a puma and he replied that he had killed only one and had sworn never to kill another he said that while out one day with another gaucho looking for cattle a puma was found it sat up with its back against a stone and did not move even when his companion threw the noose of his lasso over its neck my informant then dismounted and drawing his knife advanced to kill it still the puma made no attempt to free itself from the lasso but it seemed to know he said what was coming for it began to tremble the tears ran from its eyes and it whined in the most pitiful manner he killed it as it sat there unresisting before him but after accomplishing the deed felt that he had committed a murder it was the only thing ho had ever done in his life he added which filled him with remorse when he remembered it this i thought a rather startling declaration as i knew that he had killed several individuals of his own species in duels fought with knives in the fashion of the gauchos  all who have killed or witnessed the killing of the pumaand i have questioned scores of hunters on this pointagree that it resigns itself in this unresisting pathetic manner to death at the hands of man claudio gay in his natural history of chili says when attacked by man its energy and daring at once forsake it and it becomes a weak inoffensive animal and trembling and uttering piteous moans and shedding abundant tears it seems to implore compassion from a generous enemy the enemy is not often generous but many gauchos have assured me when speaking on this subject that although they kill the puma readily to protect their domestic animals they consider it an evil thing to take its life in desert places where it is mans only friend among the wild animals  when the hunter is accompanied by dogs then the puma instead of drooping and shedding tears is roused to a sublime rage its hair stands erect its eyes shine like balls of green flame it spits and snarls like a furious torn cat the hunters presence seems at such times to be ignored altogether its whole attention being given to the dogs and its rage directed against them in patagonia a sheepfarming scotchman with whom i spent some days showed me the skulls of five pumas which he had shot in the vicinity of his ranche one was of an exceptionally large individual and i here relate what he told me of his encounter with this animal as it shows just how the puma almost invariably behaves when attacked by man and dogs he was out on foot with his flock when the dogs discovered the animal concealed among the bushes he had left his gun at home and having no weapon and finding that the dogs dared not attack it where it sat in a defiant attitude with its back against a thorny bush he looked about and found a large dry stick and going boldly up to it tried to stun it with a violent blow on the head but though it never looked at him its fiery eyes gazing steadily at the dogs all the time he could not hit it for with a quick side movement it avoided every blow the small heed the puma paid him and the apparent ease with which it avoided his bestaimed blows only served to rouse his spirit and at length striking with increased force his stick came to the ground and was broken to pieces for some moments he now stood within two yards of the animal perfectly defenceless and not knowing what to do suddenly it sprang past him actually brushing against his arm with its side and began pursuing the dogs round and round among the bushes in the end my informants partner appeared on the scene with his rifle and the puma was shot  in encounters of this kind the most curious thing is that the puma steadfastly refuses to recognize an enemy in man although it finds him acting in concert with its hated canine foe about whose hostile intentions it has no such delusion  several years ago a paragraph which reached me in south america appeared in the english papers relating an incident characteristic of the puma in a wild beast show in this country the animal was taken out of its cage and led about the grounds by its keeper followed by a large number of spectators suddenly it was struck motionless by some object in the crowd at which it gazed steadily with a look of intense excitement then springing violently away it dragged the chain from the keepers hand and dashed in among the people who immediately fled screaming in all directions their fears were however idle the object of the pumas rage being a dog which it had spied among the crowd  it is said that when taken adult pumas invariably pine away and die when brought up in captivity they invariably make playful affectionate pets and are gentle towards all human beings but very seldom overcome their instinctive animosity towards the dog  one of the very few authentic instances i have met with of this animal defending itself against a human being was related to me at a place on the pampas called saladillo at the time of my visit there jaguars and pumas were very abundant and extremely destructive to the cattle and horses sheep it had not yet been considered worth while to introduce but immense herds of pigs were kept at every estancia these animals being able to protect themselves one gaucho had so repeatedly distinguished himself by his boldness and dexterity in killing jaguars that he was by general consent made the leader of every tigerhunt one day the comandante of the district got twelve or fourteen men together the tigerslayer among them and started in search of a jaguar which had been seen that morning in the neighbourhood of his estancia the animal was eventually found and surrounded and as it was crouching among some clumps of tall pampas grass where throwing a lasso over its neck would be a somewhat difficult and dangerous operation all gave way to the famous hunter who at once uncoiled his lasso and proceeded in a leisurely manner to form the loop while thus engaged he made the mistake of allowing his horse which had grown restive to turn aside from the hunted animal the jaguar instantly taking advantage of the oversight burst from its cover and sprang first on to the haunches of the horse then seizing the hunter by his poncho dragged him to the earth and would no doubt have quickly despatched him if a lasso thrown by one of the other men had not closed round its neck at this critical moment it was quickly dragged off and eventually killed but the discomfited hunter did not stay to assist at the finish he arose from the ground unharmed but in a violent passion and blaspheming horribly for he knew that his reputation which he priced above everything had suffered a great blow and that he would be mercilessly ridiculed by his associates getting on his horse he rode away by himself from the scene of his misadventure of what happened to him on his homeward ride there were no witnesses but his own account was as follows and inasmuch as it told against his own prowess it was readily believed before riding a league and while his bosom was still burning with rage a puma started up from the long grass in his path but made no attempt to run away it merely sat up he said and looked at him in a provokingly fearless manner to slay this animal with his knife and so revenge himself on it for the defeat he had just suffered was his first thought he alighted and secured his horse by tying its fore feet together then drawing his long heavy knife rushed at the puma still it did not stir raising his weapon he struck with a force which would have split the animals skull open if the blow had fallen where it was intended to fall but with a quick movement the puma avoided it and at the same time lifted a foot and with lightning rapidity dealt the aggressor a blow on the face its unsheathed claws literally dragging down the flesh from his cheek laying the bone bare after inflicting this terrible punishment and eyeing its fallen foe for a few seconds it trotted quietly away the wounded man succeeded in getting on to his horse and reaching his home the hanging flesh was restored to its place and the ghastly rents sewn up and in the end he recovered but he was disfigured for life his temper also completely changed he became morose and morbidly sensitive to the ridicule of his neighbours and he never again ventured to join them in their hunting expeditions i inquired of the comandante and of others whether any case had come to their knowledge in that district in which the puma had shown anything beyond a mere passive friendliness towards man in reply they related the following incident which had occurred at the saladillo a few years before my visit the men all went out one day beyond the frontier to form a cerco as it is called to hunt ostriches and other game the hunters numbering about thirty spread themselves round in a vast ring and advancing towards the centre drove the animals before them during the excitement of the chase which followed while they were all engaged in preventing the ostriches deer c from doubling back and escaping it was not noticed that one of the hunters had disappeared his horse however returned to its home during the evening and on the next morning a fresh hunt for the lost man was organized he was eventually found lying on the ground with a broken leg where he had been thrown at the beginning of the hunt he related that about an hour after it had become dark a puma appeared and sat near him but did not seem to notice him after a while it became restless frequently going away and returning and finally it kept away so long that he thought it had left him for good about midnight he heard the deep roar of a jaguar and gave himself up for lost by raising himself on his elbow he was able to see the outline of the beast crouching near him but its face was turned from him and it appeared to be intently watching some object on which it was about to spring presently it crept out of sight then he heard snarlings and growlings and the sharp yell of a puma and he knew that the two beasts were fighting before morning he saw the jaguar several times but the puma renewed the contest with it again and again until morning appeared after which he saw and heard no more of them  extraordinary as this story sounds it did not seem so to me when i heard it for i had already met with many anecdotes of a similar nature in various parts of the country some of them vastly more interesting than the one i have just narrated only i did not get them at first hand and am consequently not able to vouch for their accuracy but in this case it seemed to me that there was really no room for doubt all that i had previously heard had compelled me to believe that the puma really does possess a unique instinct of friendliness for man the origin of which like that of many other wellknown instincts of animals must remain a mystery the fact that the puma never makes an unprovoked attack on a human being or eats human flesh and that it refuses except in some very rare cases even to defend itself does not seem really less wonderful in an animal of its bold and sanguinary temper thau that it should follow the traveller in the wilderness or come near him when he lies sleeping or disabled and even occasionally defend him from its enemy the jaguar we know that certain sounds colours or smells which are not particularly noticed by most animals produce an extraordinary effect on some species and it is possible to believe i think that the human form or countenance or the odour of the human body may also have the effect on the puma of suspending its predatory instincts and inspiring it with a gentleness towards man which we are only accustomed to see in our domesticated carnivores or in feral animals towards those of their own species wolves when pressed with hunger will sometimes devour a fellow wolf as a rule however rapacious animals will starve to death rather than prey on one of their own kind nor is it a common thing for them to attack other species possessing instincts similar to their own the puma we have seen violently attacks other large carnivores not to feed on them but merely to satisfy its animosity and while respecting man it is within the tropics a great hunter and eater of monkeys which of all animals most resemble men we can only conclude with humboldt that there is something mysterious in the hatreds and affections of animals  the view here taken of the pumas character imparts i think a fresh interest to some things concerning the species which have appeared in historical and other works and which i propose to discuss briefly in this place  there is a remarkable passage in byrons narrative of the loss of the wager which was quoted by admiral fitzroy in his voyage of the beagle to prove that tho puma inhabits tierra del fuego and the adjacent islands no other large beast of prey being known in that part of america i heard he says a growling close by me which made me think it advisable to retire as soon as possible the woods were so gloomy i could see nothing but as i retired this noise followed me close till i got out of them some of our men did assure me that they had seen a very large beast in the woods   i proposed to four of the people to go to the end of the bay about two miles distant from the bell tent to occupy the skeleton of an old indian wigwam which i had discovered in a walk that way on our first landing this we covered to windward with seaweed and lighting a fire laid ourselves down in hopes of finding a remedy for our hunger in sleep but we had not long composed ourselves before one of our company was disturbed by the blowing of some animal at his face and upon opening his eyes was not a little astonished to see by the glimmering of the fire a large beast standing over him he had presence of mind enough to snatch a brand from the fire which was now very low and thrust it at the nose of tho animal which thereupon made off    in the morning we were not a little anxious to know how our companions had fared and this anxiety was increased upon our tracing the footsteps of the beast in the sand in a direction towards the bell tent the impression was deep and plain of a large round foot well furnished with claws upon acquainting the people in the tent with the circumstances of our story we found that they had been visited by the same unwelcome guest  mr andrew murray in his work on the geographical distribution of mammals gives the straits of magellan as the extreme southern limit of the pumas range and in discussing the above passage from byron he writes this reference however gives no support to the notion of the animal alluded to having been a puma    the description of the footprints clearly shows that the animal could not have been a puma none of the cat tribe leave any trace of a claw in their footprints   the dogs on the other hand leave a very welldefined clawmark    commodore byron and his party had therefore suffered a false alarm the creature which had disturbed them was doubtless one of the harmless domestic dogs of the natives  the assurance that the bold hardy adventurer and his men suffered a false alarm and were thrown into a great state of excitement at the appearance of one of the wretched domestic dogs of the fuegians with which they were familiar comes charmingly it must be said from a closet naturalist who surveys the world of savage beasts from his london study he apparently forgets that commodore byron lived in a time when the painful accuracy and excessive minuteness we are accustomed to was not expected from a writer whenever he happened to touch on any matters connected with zoology  this kind of criticism which seizes on a slight inaccuracy in one passage and totally ignores an important statement in anotheras for instance that of the great beast seen in the woodsmight be extended to other portions of the book and byrons entire narrative made to appear as purely a work of the imagination as peter wilkins adventures in those same antarctic seas  mr j w boddam whetham in his work across central america 1877 gives an anecdote of the puma which he heard at sacluk in guatemala and which strangely resembles some of the stories i have heard on the pampas he writes the following event most extraordinary if true is said to have occurred in this forest to a mahoganycutter who had been out marking trees as he was returning to his hut he suddenly felt a soft body pressing against him and on looking down saw a cougar which with tail erect and purring like a cat twisted itself in and out of his legs and glided round him turning up its fierce eyes as if with laughter horrorstricken and with faltering steps he kept on and the terrible animal still circled about now rolling over and now touching him with a paw like a cat playing with a mouse at last the suspense became too great and with a loud shout he struck desperately at the creature with his axe it bounded on one side and crouched snarling and showing its teeth just as it was about to spring the mans companion who had heard his call appeared in the distance and with a growl the beast vanished into the thick bushes  now after allowing for exaggeration if there is no foundation for stories of this character it is really a very wonderful coincidence that they should be met with in countries so widely separated as patagonia and central america pumas doubtless are scarce in guatemala and as in other places where they have met with nothing but persecution from man they are shy of him but had this adventure occurred on the pampas where they are better known the person concerned in it would not have said that the puma played with him as a cat with a mouse but rather as a tame cat plays with a child nor probably would he have been terrified into imagining that the animal even after its caresses had met with so rough a return was about to spring on him  in clavigeros history of lower california it is related that a very extraordinary state of things was discovered to exist in that country by the first missionaries who settled there at the end of the seventeenth century and which was actually owing to the pumas the author says that there were no bears or tigers jaguars these had most probably been driven out by their old enemies but the pumas had increased to a prodigious extent so that the whole peninsula was overrun by them and this was owing to the superstitious regard in which they were held by the natives who not only did not kill them but never ventured to disturb them in any way the indians were actually to some extent dependent on the pumas success in hunting for their subsistence they watched the movements of the vultures in order to discover the spot in which the remains of any animal it had captured had been left by the puma and whenever the birds were seen circling about persistently over one place they hastened to take possession of the carcass discovered in this way the domestic animals imported by the missionaries were quickly destroyed by the virtual masters of the country and against these enemies the jesuits preached a crusade in vain for although the indians readily embraced christianity and were baptized they were not to be shaken in their notions concerning the sacred chimbicá as the puma was called the missions languished in consequence the priests existed in a state of semistarvation depending on provisions sent to them at long intervals from the distant mexican settlements and for many years all their efforts to raise the savages from their miserable condition were thrown away at length in 1701 the mission of loreto was taken charge of by one padre ugarte described by clavigero as a person of indomitable energy and great physical strength and courage a true muscular christian who occasionally varied his method of instruction by administering corporal chastisements to his hearers when they laughed at his doctrines or at the mistakes he made in their language while preaching to them ugarte like his predecessors could not move the indians to hunt the puma but he was a man of action with a wholesome belief in the efficacy of example and his opportunity came at last  one day while riding in the wood he saw at a distance a puma walking deliberately towards him alighting from his mule he took up a large stone and advanced to meet the animal and when sufficiently near hurled the missile with such precision and force that he knocked ifc down senseless after killing it he found that the heaviest part of his task remained as it was necessary for the success of his project to carry the beast still warm and bleeding to the indian village but mow his mule steadfastly refused to approach it father ugarte was not however to be defeated and partly by stratagem partly by force he finally succeeded in getting the puma on to the mules back after which he rode in triumph to the settlement the indians at first thought it all a trick of their priest who was so anxious to involve them in a conflict with the pumas and standing at a distance they began jeering at him and exclaiming that he had found the animal dead but when they were induced to approach and saw that it was still warm and bleeding they were astonished beyond measure and began to watch the priest narrowly thinking that he would presently drop down and die in sight of them all it was their belief that death would quickly overtake the slayer of a puma as this did not happen the priest gained a great influence over them and in the end they were persuaded to turn their weapons against the chimbicá  clavigero has nothing to say concerning the origin of this californian superstition but with some knowledge of the pumas character it is not difficult to imagine what it may have been no doubt these savages had been very well acquainted from ancient times with the animals instinct of friendliness toward man and its extreme hatred of other carnivores which prey on the human species and finding it ranged on their side as it were in the hard struggle of life in the desert they were induced to spare it and even to regard it as a friend and such a feeling among primitive men might in the course of time degenerate into such a superstition as that of the californians  i shall in conclusion relate here the story of maldonada which is not generally known although familiar to buenos ayreans as the story of lady godivas ride through coventry is to the people of that town the case of maldonada is circumstantially narrated by rui diaz de guzman in his history of the colonization of the plata he was a person high in authority in the young colonies and is regarded by students of south american history as an accurate and soberminded chronicler of the events of his own times he relates that in the year 1536 the settlers at buenos ayres having exhausted their provisions and being compelled by hostile indians to keep within their pallisades were reduced to the verge of starvation the governor mendoza went off to seek help from the other colonies up the river deputing his authority to one captain ruiz who according to all accounts displayed an excessively tyrannous and truculent disposition while in power the people were finally reduced to a ration of sis ounces of flour per day for each person but as the flour was putrid and only made them ill they were forced to live on any small animals they could capture including snakes frogs and toads some horrible details are given by rui diaz and other writers one del barco centenera affirms that of two thousand persons in the town eighteen hundred perished of hunger during this unhappy time beasts of prey in large numbers were attracted to the settlement by the effluvium of the corpses buried just outside the pallisades and this made the condition of the survivors more miserable still since they could venture into the neighbouring woods only at the risk of a violent death nevertheless many did so venture and among these was the young woman maldonada who losing herself in the forest strayed to a distance and was eventually found by a party of indians and carried by them to their village  some months later captain ruiz discovered her whereabouts and persuaded the savages to bring her to the settlement then accusing her of having gone to the indian village in order to betray the colony he condemned her to be devoured by wild beasts she was taken to a wood at a distance of a league from the town and left there tied to a tree for the space of two nights and a day a party of soldiers then went to the spot expecting to find her bones picked clean by the beasts but were greatly astonished to find maldonada still alive without hurt or scratch she told them that a puma had come to her aid and had kept at her side defending her life against all the other beasts that approached her she was instantly released and taken back to the town her deliverance through the action of the puma probably being looked on as direct interposition of providence to save her  rui diaz concludes with the following paragraph in which he affirms that he knew the woman maldonada which may be taken as proof that she was among the few that survived the first disastrous settlement and lived on to more fortunate times his pious pun on her name would be lost in a translationde esta manera quedo libre la que ofrecieron a las fieras la cual mujer yo la conoci y la llamaban la maldonada que mas bien se le podia llamar la biendonada pues por este suceso se ha de ver no haber merecido el castigo á que la ofrecieron  if such a thing were to happen now in any portion of southern south america where the pumas disposition is best known it would not be looked on as a miracle as it was and that unavoidably in the case of maldonada     chapter iii  a wave of life   for many years while living in my own home on the pampas i kept a journal in which all my daily observations on the habits of animals and kindred matters were carefully noted turning back to 18723 i find my jottings for that season contain a history of one of those waves of lifefor i can think of no better name for the phenomenon in questionthat are of such frequent occurrence in thinlysettled regions though in countries like england seen very rarely and on a very limited scale an exceptionally bounteous season the accidental mitigation of a check or other favourable circumstance often causes an increase so sudden and inordinate of small prolific species that when we actually witness it we are no longer surprised at the notion prevalent amongst the common people that mice frogs crickets c are occasionally rained down from the clouds  in the summer of 18723 we had plenty of sunshine with frequent showers so that the hot months brought no dearth of wild flowers as in most years the abundance of flowers resulted in a wonderful increase of humble bees i have never known them so plentiful before in and about the plantation adjoining my house i found during the season no fewer than seventeen nests  the season was also favourable for mice that is of course favourable for the time being unfavourable in the long run since the shortlived undue preponderance of a species is invariably followed by a long period of undue depression these prolific little creatures were soon so abundant that the dogs subsisted almost exclusively on them the fowls also from incessantly pursuing and killing them became quite rapacious in their manner whilst the sulphur tyrantbirds pitangus and the guira cuckoos preyed on nothing but mice  the domestic cats as they invariably do in such plentiful seasons absented themselves from the house assuming all the habits of their wild congeners and slinking from the sight of maneven of a former fireside companionwith a shy secrecy in their motions an apparent affectation of fear almost ludicrous to see foxes weasels and opossums fared sumptuously even for the common armadillo dasypus villosus it was a season of affluence for this creature is very adroit in capturing mice this fact might seem surprising to anyone who marks the uncouth figure toothless gums and the motionsanything but light and gracefulof the armadillo and perhaps fancying that to be a dexterous mouser an animal should bear some resemblance in habits and structure to the felidas but animals like men are compelled to adapt themselves to their surroundings new habits are acquired and the exact corelation between habit and structure is seldom maintained  i kept an armadillo at this time and good cheer and the sedentary life he led in captivity made him excessively fat but the mousing exploits of even this individual were most interesting occasionally i took him into the fields to give him a taste of liberty though at such times i always took the precaution to keep hold of a cord fastened to one of his hind legs for as often as he came to a kennel of one of his wild fellows he would attempt to escape into it he invariably travelled with an ungainly trotting gait carrying his nose beaglelike close to the ground his sense of smell was exceedingly acute and when near his prey he became agitated and quickened his motions pausing frequently to sniff the earth till discovering the exact spot where the mouse lurked he would stop and creep cautiously to it then after slowly raising himself to a sitting posture spring suddenly forwards throwing his body like a trap over the mouse or nest of mice concealed beneath the grass  a curious instance of intelligence in a cat was brought to my notice at this time by one of my neighbours a native his children had made the discovery that some excitement and fun was to be had by placing a long hollow stalk of the giant thistle with a mouse in itand every hollow stalk at this time had one for a tenantbefore a cat and then watching her movements smelling her prey she would spring at one end of the stalkthe end towards which the mouse would be moving at the same time but would catch nothing for the mouse instead of running out would turn back to run to the other end whereupon the cat all excitement would jump there to seize it and so the contest would continue for a long time an exhibition of the cleverness and the stupidity of instinct both of the pursuer and the pursued there were several cats at the house and all acted in the same way except one when a stalk was placed before this cat instead of becoming excited like the others it went quickly to one end and smelt at the opening then satisfied that its prey was inside it deliberately bit a long piece out of the stalk with its teeth then another strip and so on progressively until the entire stick had been opened up to within six or eight inches of the further end when the mouse came out and was caught every stalk placed before this cat was demolished in the same businesslike way but the other cats though they were made to look on while the stick was being broken up by their fellow could never learn the trick  in the autumn of the year countless numbers of storks ciconia maguari and of shorteared owls otus brachyotus made their appearance they had also come to assist at the general feast  remembering the opinion of mr e newman quoted by darwin that twothirds of the humble bees in england are annually destroyed by mice i determined to continue observing these insects in order to ascertain whether the same thing occurred on the pampas i carefully revisited all the nests i had found and was amazed at the rapid disappearance of all the bees i was quite convinced that the mice had devoured or driven them out for the weather was still warm and flowers and fruit on which humble bees feed were very abundant  after cold weather set in the storks went away probably on account of the scarcity of water for the owls remained so numerous were they during the winter that any evening after sunset i could count forty or fifty individuals hovering over the trees about my house unfortunately they did not confine their attentions to the mice but became destructive to the birds as well i frequently watched them at dusk beating about the trees and bushes in a systematic manner often a dozen or more of them wheeling together about one tree like so many moths about a candle and one occasionally dashing through the branches until a pigeonusually the zenaida maculataor other bird was scared from its perch the instant the bird left the tree they would all give chase disappearing in the darkness i could not endure to see the havoc they were making amongst the ovenbirds furnarius rufusa species for which i have a regard and affection almost superstitious so i began to shoot the marauders very soon however i found it was impossible to protect my little favourites night after night the owls mustered in their usual numbers so rapidly were the gaps i made in their ranks refilled i grew sick of the cruel war in which i had so hopelessly joined and resolved not without pain to let things take their course a singular circumstance was that the owls began to breed in the middle of winter the fieldlabourers and boys found many nests with eggs and young birds in the neighbourhood i saw one nest in july our coldest month with three halfgrown young birds in it they were excessively fat and though it was noonday had their crops full there were three mice and two young cavies cavia australis lying untouched in the nest  the shorteared owl is of a wandering disposition ard performs long journeys at all seasons of the year in search of districts where food is abundant and perhaps these winterbreeders came from a region where scarcity of prey or some such cause had prevented them from nesting at their usual time in summer  the gradual increase or decrease continually going on in many species about us is little remarked but the sudden infrequent appearance in vast numbers of large and comparatively rare species is regarded by most people as a very wonderful phenomenon not easily explained on the pampas whenever grasshoppers mice frogs or crickets become excessively abundant we confidently look for the appearance of multitudes of the birds that prey on them however obvious may be the cause of the first phenomenonthe sudden inordinate increase during a favourable year of a species always prolificthe attendant one always creates astonishment for how it is asked do these largo birds seldom seen at other times receive information in the distant regions they inhabit of an abundance of food in any particular locality years have perhaps passed during which scarcely an individual of these kinds has been seen all at once armies of the majestic white storks are seen conspicuously marching about the plain in all directions while the night air resounds with the solemn hootings of innumerable owls it is plain that these birds have been drawn from over an immense area to one spot and the question is how have they been drawn  many large birds possessing great powers of flight are when not occupied with the business of propagation incessantly wandering from place to place in search of food they are not as a rule regular migrants for their wanderings begin and end irrespective of seasons and where they find abundance they remain the whole year they fly at a very great height and traverse immense distances when the favourite food of any one of these species is plentiful in any particular region all the individuals that discover it remain and attract to them all of their kind passing overhead this happens on the pampas with the stork the shorteared owl the hooded gull and the dominican or blackbacked gullthe leading species among the feathered nomads a few first appear like harbingers these are presently joined by new comers in considerable numbers and before long they are in myriads inconceivable numbers of birds are doubtless in these regions continually passing over us unseen it was once a subject of very great wonder to me that flocks of blacknecked swans should almost always appear flying by immediately after a shower of rain even when none had been visible for a long time before and when they must have come from a very great distance when the reason at length occurred to me i felt very much disgusted with myself for being puzzled over so very simple a matter after rain a flying swan may be visible to the eye at a vastly greater distance than during fair weather the sun shining on its intense white plumage against the dark background of a raincloud making it exceedingly conspicuous the fact that swans are almost always seen after rain shows only that they are almost always passing  whenever we are visited by a duststorm on the pampas myriads of hooded gullslarus macnlipennisappear flying before the dark dustcloud even when not a gull has been seen for months duststorms are of rare occurrence and come only after a long drought and the watercourses being all dry the gulls cannot have been living in the region over which the storm passes yet in seasons of drought gulls must be continually passing by at a great height seeing but not seen except when driven together and forced towards the earth by the fury of the storm  by august 1873 the owls had vanished and they had indeed good cause for leaving the winter had been one of continued drought the dry grass and herbage of the preceding year had been consumed by the cattle and wild animals or had turned to dust and with the disappearance of their food and cover the mice had ceased to be the faminestricken cats sneaked back to the house it was pitiful to see the little burrowing owls for these birds not having the powerful wings and prescient instincts of the vagrant otus brachyotus are compelled to face the poverty from which the others escape just as abundance had before made the domestic cats wild scarcity now made the burrowing owls tame and fearless of man they were so reduced as scarcely to be able to fly and hung about the houses all day long on the lookout for some stray morsel of food i have frequently seen one alight and advance within two or three yards of the doorstep probably attracted by the smell of roasted meat the weather continued dry until late in spring so reducing the sheep and cattle that incredible numbers perished during a month of cold and rainy weather that followed the drought  how clearly we can see in all this that the tendency to multiply rapidly so advantageous in normal seasons becomes almost fatal to a species in seasons of exceptional abundance cover and food without limit enabled the mice to increase at such an amazing rate that the lesser checks interposed by predatory species were for a while inappreciable but as the mice increased so did their enemies insectivorous and other species acquired the habits of owls and weasels preying exclusively on them while to this innumerable army of residents was shortly added multitudes of wandering birds coming from distant regions no sooner had the herbage perished depriving the little victims of cover and food than the effects of the war became apparent in autumn the earth so teemed with them that one could scarcely walk anywhere without treading on mice while out of every hollow weedstalk lying on the ground dozens could be shaken but so rapidly had they devoured by the trained army of persecutors that in spring it was hard to find a survivor even in the barns and houses the fact that species tend to increase in a geometrical ratio makes these great and sudden changes frequent in many regions of the earth but it is not often they present themselves so vividly as in the foregoing instance for here scene after scene in one of natures silent passionless tragedies opens before us countless myriads of highly organized beings rising into existence only to perish almost immediately scarcely a hardpressed remnant remaining after the great reaction to continue the species     chapter iv  some curious animal weapons   strictly speaking the only weapons of vertebrates are teeth claws horns and spurs horns belong only to the ruminants and the spur is a rare weapon there are also many animals in which teeth and claws are not suited to inflict injury or in which the proper instincts and courage to use and develop them are wanted and these would seem to be in a very defenceless condition defenceless they are in one sense but as a fact they are no worse off than the wellarmed species having either a protective colouring or a greater swiftness or cunning to assist them in escaping from their enemies and there are also many of these practically toothless and clawless species which have yet been provided with other organs and means of offence and defence out of natures curious armoury and concerning a few of these species i propose to speak in this place  probably such distinctive weapons as horns spurs tusks and spines would be much more common in nature if the conditions of life always remained the same but these things are long in fashioning meanwhile conditions are changing climate soil vegetation vary foes and rivals diminish or increase the old go and others with different weapons and a new strategy take their place and just as a skilful man fighting the wilderness fashions a plough from a huntingknife turns his implements into weapons of war and for everything he possesses discovers a use never contemplated by its maker so does natureonly with an ingenuity exceeding that of manuse the means she has to meet all contingencies and enable her creatures seemingly so illprovided to maintain their fight for life natural selection like an angry man can make a weapon of anything and using the word in this wide sense the mucous secretions the huanaco discharges into the face of an adversary and the pestilential drops distilled by the skunk are weapons and may be as effectual in defensive warfare as spines fangs and tushes  i do not know of a more striking instance in the animal kingdom of adaptation of structure to habit than is afforded by the hairy armadillodasypus villosus he appears to us roughly speaking to resemble an anteater saddled with a dish cover yet this creature with the cunning avhich nature has given it to supplement all deficiencies has discovered in its bony encumbrance a highly efficient weapon of offence most other edentates are diurnal and almost exclusively insectivorous some feeding only on ants they have unchangeable habits very limited intelligence and vanish before civilization the hairy armadillo alone has struck out a line for itself like its fast disappearing congeners it is an insecteater still but does not like them seek its food on the surface and in the anthill only all kinds of insects are preyed on and by means of its keen scent it discovers worms and larvae several inches beneath the surface its method of taking worms and grubs resembles that of probing birds for it throws up no earth but forces its sharp snout and wedgeshaped head down to the required depth and probably while working it moves round in a circle for the hole is conical though the head of the animal is flat where it has found a rich huntingground the earth is seen pitted with hundreds of these neat symmetrical bores it is also an enemy to groundnesting birds being fond of eggs and fledglings and when unable to capture prey it will feed on carrion as readily as a wild dog or vulture returning night after night to the carcase of a horse or cow as long as the flesh lasts failing animal food it subsists on vegetable diet and i have frequently found their stomachs stuffed with clover and stranger still with the large hard grains of the maize swallowed entire  it is not therefore strange that at all seasons and even when other animals are starving the hairy armadillo is always fat and vigorous in the desert it is diurnal but where man appears it becomes more and more nocturnal and in populous districts does not go abroad until long after dark yet when a district becomes thickly settled it increases in numbers so readily does it adapt itself to new conditions it is not to be wondered at that the gauchos keen observers of nature as they are should make this species the hero of many of their fables of the uncle remus type representing it as a versatile creature exceedingly fertile in expedients and duping its sworn friend the fox in various ways just as brer rabbit serves the fox in the north american fables  the hairy armadillo will doubtless long survive all the other armadillos and on this account alone it will have an everincreasing interest for the naturalist i have elsewhere described how it captures mice when preying on snakes it proceeds in another manner a friend of mine a careful observer who was engaged in cattlebreeding amongst the stony sierras near cape corrientes described to me an encounter he witnessed between an armadillo and a poisonous snake while seated on the hillside one day he observed a snake about twenty inches in length lying coiled up on a stoue five or six yards beneath him byandby a hairy armadillo appeared trotting directly towards it apparently the snake perceived and feared its approach for it quickly uncoiled itself and began gliding away instantly the armadillo rushed on to it and squatting close down began swaying its body backward and forward with a regular sawing motion thus lacerating its victim with the sharp deepcut edges of its bony covering the snake struggled to free itself biting savagely at its aggressor for its head and neck were disengaged its bites made no impression and very soon it dropped its head and when its enemy drew off it was dead and very much mangled the armadillo at once began its meal taking the tail in its mouth and slowly progressing towards the head but when about a third of the snake still remained it seemed satisfied and leaving that portion trotted away  altogether in its rapacious and varied habits this armadillo appears to have some points of resemblance with the hedgehog and possibly like the little european mammal it resembles it is not harmed by the bite of venomous snakes  i once had a cat that killed every snake it found purely for sport since it never ate them it would jump nimbly round and across its victim occasionally dealing it a blow with its cruel claws the enemies of the snake are legion burrowing owls feed largely on them so do herons and storks killing them with a blow of their javelin beaks and swallowing them entire the sulphur tyrantbird picks up the young snake by the tail and flying to a branch or stone uses it like a flail till its life is battered out the bird is highly commended in consequence reminding one of very ancient words happy shall he be that taketh thy little ones and dasheth them against the stones in arraying such a variety of enemies against the snake nature has made ample amends for having endowed it with deadly weapons besides the power possessed by venomous snakes only seems to us disproportionate it is not really so except in occasional individual encounters venomous snakes are always greatly outnumbered by nonvenomous ones in the same district at any rate this is the case on the pampas the greater activity of the latter counts for more in the result than the deadly weapons of the former  the large teguexin lizard of the pampas called iguana by the country people is a notable snakekiller snakes have in fact no more formidable enemy for he is quick to see and swift to overtake them he is practically invulnerable and deals them sudden death with his powerful tail the gauchos say that dogs attacking the iguana are sometimes known to have their legs broken and i do not doubt it a friend of mine was out riding one day after his cattle and having attached one end of his lasso to the saddle he let it trail on the ground he noticed a large iguana lying apparently asleep in the sun and though he rode by it very closely it did not stir but no sooner had he passed it than it raised its head and fixed its attention on the forty feet of lasso slowly trailing by suddenly it rushed after the rope and dealt it a succession of violent blows with its tail when the whole of the lasso several yards of which had been pounded in vain had been dragged by the lizard with uplifted head continued gazing after it with the greatest astonishment never had such a wonderful snake crossed its path before  molina in his natural history of chill says the vizcacha uses its tail as a weapon but then molina is not always reliable i have observed vizcachas all my life and never detected them making use of any weapon except their chisel teeth the tail is certainly very curious being straight at the base then curving up outwardly and slightly down again at the tip resembling the spout of a china teapot the under surface of the straight portion of the base is padded with a thick naked corneous skin and when the animal performs the curious sportive antics in which it occasionally indulges it gives rapid loudsounding blows on the ground with this part of the tail the peculiar form of the tail also makes it a capital support enabling the vizcacha to sit erect with ease and security  the frog is a most timid inoffensive creature saving itself when pursued by a series of saltatory feats unparalleled amongst vertebrates consequently when i find a frog i have no hesitation in placing my hands upon it and the cold sensation it gives one is the worse result i fear it came to pass however that i once encountered a frog that was not like other frogs for it possessed an instinct and weapons of offence which greatly astonished me i was out snipe shooting one day when peering into an old disused burrow two or three feet deep i perceived a burlylooking frog sitting it it was larger and stouterlooking than our common rana though like it in colour and i at once dropped on to my knees and set about its capture though it watched me attentively the frog remained perfectly motionless and this greatly surprised me before i was sufficiently near to make a grab it sprang straight at my hand and catching two of my fingers round with its fore legs administered a hug so sudden and violent as to cause an acute sensation of pain then at the very instant i experienced this feeling which made me start back quickly it released its hold and bounded out and away i flew after it and barely managed to overtake it before it could gain the water holding it firmly pressed behind the shoulders it was powerless to attack me and i then noticed the enormous development of the muscles of the fore legs usually small in frogs bulging out in this individual like a second pair of thighs and givingit a strangely bold and formidable appearance on holding my gun within its reach it clasped the barrel with such energy as to bruise the skin of its breast and legs after allowing it to partially exhaust itself in these fruitless huggings i experimented by letting it seize my hand again and i noticed that invariably after each squeeze it made a quick violent attempt to free itself believing that i had discovered a frog differing in structure from all known species and possessing a strange unique instinct of selfpreservation i carried my captive home intending to show it to dr burmeister the director of the national museum at buenos ayresunfortunately after i had kept it some days it effected its escape by pushing up the glass cover of its box and i have never since met with another individual like it that this singular frog has it in its power to seriously injure an opponent is of course out of the question but its unexpected attack must be of great advantage the effect of the sudden opening of an umbrella in the face of an angry bull gives i think only a faint idea of the astonishment and confusion it must cause an adversary by its leap quick as lightning and the violent hug it administers and in the confusion it finds time to escape i cannot for a moment believe that an instinct so admirable correlated as it is with the structure of the fore legs can be merely an individual variation and i confidently expect that all i have said about my lost frog will some day be confirmed by others rana luctator would be a good name for this species  the toad is a slowmoving creature that puts itself in the way of persecution yet strange to say the acrid juice it exudes when irritated is a surer protection to it than venomous fangs are to the deadliest snake toads are in fact with a very few exceptions only attacked and devoured by snakes by lizards and by their own venomous relative ceratophrys ornata possibly the cold sluggish natures of all these creatures protects them against the toads secretion which would be poison to most warmblooded animals but i am not so sure that all fish enjoy a like immunity i one day noticed a goodsized fish bagras floating belly upmost on the water it had apparently just died and had such a glossy wellnourished look about it and appeared so full i was curious to know the cause of its death on opening it i found its stomach quite filled with a very large toad it had swallowed the toad looked perfectly fresh not even a faint discoloration of the skin showing that the gastric juices had begun to take effect the fish in fact must have died immediately after swallowing the toad the country people in south america believe that the milky secretion exuded by the toad possesses wonderful curative properties it is their invariable specific for shinglesa painful dangerous malady common amongst them and to cure it living toads are applied to the inflamed parb i dare say learned physicians would laugh at this cure but then if i mistake not the learned have in past times laughed at other specifics used by the vulgar but which now have honourable places in the pharmacopoeia pepsine for example more than two centuries ago very ancient times for south america the gauchos were accustomed to take the lining of the rheas stomach dried and powdered for ailments caused by impaired digestion and the remedy is popular still science has gone over to them and the ostrichhunter now makes a double profit one from the feathers and the other from the dried stomachs which he supplies to the chemists of buenos ayres yet he was formerly told that to take the stomach of the ostrich to improve his digestion was as wild an idea as it would be to swallow birds feathers in order to fly  i just now called ceratophrys ornata venomous though its teeth are not formed to inject poison into the veins like serpents teeth it is a singular creature known as escuerzo in the vernacular and though beautiful in colour is in form hideous beyond description the skin is of a rich brilliant green with chocolatecoloured patches oval in form and symmetrically disposed the lips are bright yellow the cavernous mouth pale flesh colour the throat and undersurface dull white the body is lumpy and about the size of a large mans fist the eyes placed on the summit of a disproportionately large head are embedded in hornlike protuberances capable of being elevated or depressed at pleasure when the creature is undisturbed the eyes which are of a pale gold colour look out as from a couple of watch towers but when touched on the head or menaced the prominences sink down to a level with the head closing the eyes completely and giving the creature the appearance of being eyeless the upper jaw is armed with minute teeth and there are two teeth in the centre of the lower jaw the remaining portions of the jaw being armed with two exceedingly sharpedged bony plates in place of a tongue it has a round muscular process with a rough flat disc the size of a halfpenny  it is common all over the pampas ranging as far south as the rio colorado in patagonia in the breeding season it congregates in pools and one is then struck by their extraordinary vocal powers which they exercise by night the performance in no way resembles the series of percussive sounds uttered by most batrachians the notes it utters are long as of a wind instrument not unmelodious and so powerful as to make themselves heard distinctly a mile off on still evenings after the amorous period these toads retire to moist places and sit inactive buried just deep enough to leave the broad green back on a level with the surface and it is then very difficult to detect them in this position they wait for their preyfrogs toads birds and small mammals often they capture and attempt to swallow things too large for them a mistake often made by snakes in very wet springs they sometimes come about houses and lie in wait for chickens and ducklings in disposition they are most truculent savagely biting at anything that comes near them and when they bite they hang on with the tenacity of a bulldog poisoning the blood with their glandular secretions when teased the creature swells itself out to such an extent one almost expects to see him burst he follows his tormentors about with slow awkward leaps his vast mouth wide open and uttering an incessant harsh croaking sound a gaucho i knew was once bitten by one he sat down on the grass and dropping his hand at his side had it seized and only freed himself by using his hunting knife to force the creatures mouth open he washed and bandaged the wound and no bad result followed but when the toad cannot be shaken off then the result is different one summer two horses were found dead on the plain near my home one while lying down had been seized by a fold in the skin near the belly the other had been grasped by the nose while cropping grass in both instances the vicious toad was found dead with jaws tightly closed still hanging to the dead horse perhaps they are sometimes incapable of letting go at will and like honey bees destroy themselves in these savage attacks     chapter v  fear in birds   the statement that birds instinctively fear man is frequently met with in zoological works written since the origin of species appeared but almost the only reasonabsolutely the only plausible reason all the rest being mere suppositiongiven in support of such a notion is that birds in desert islands show at first no fear of man but afterwards finding him a dangerous neighbour they become wild and their young also grow up wild it is thus assumed that the habit acquired by the former has become hereditary in the latteror at all events that in time it becomes hereditary instincts which are few in number in any species and practically endure for ever are not presumably acquired with such extraordinary facility  birds become shy where persecuted and the young even when not disturbed learn a shy habit from the parents and from other adults they associate with i have found small birds shyer in desert places where the human form was altogether strange to them than in thicklysettled districts large birds are actually shyer than the small ones although to the civilized or shooting man they seem astonishingly tame where they have never been fired at i have frequently walked quite openly to within twentyfive or thirty yards of a flock of flamingoes without alarming them this however was when they were in the water or on the opposite side of a stream having no experience of guns they fancied themselves secure as long as a strip of water separated them from the approaching object when standing on dry land they would not allow so near an approach sparrows in england aro very much tamer than the sparrows i have observed in desert places where they seldom see a human being nevertheless young sparrows in england are very much tamer than old birds as anyone may see for himself during the past summer while living near kew gardens i watched the sparrows a great deal and fed forty or fifty of them every day from a back window the bread and seed was thrown on to a low roof just outside the window and i noticed that the young birds when first able to fly were always brought by the parents to this feeding place and that after two or three visits they would begin to come of their own accord at such times they would venture quite close to me showing as little suspicion as young chickens the adults however although so much less shy than birds of other species were extremely suspicious snatching up the bread and flying away or if they remained hopping about in a startled manner craning their necks to view me and making so many gestures and motions and little chirps of alarm that presently the young would become infected with fear the lesson was taught them in a surprisingly short time their suspicion was seen to increase day by day and about a week later they were scarcely to be distinguished in behaviour from the adults it is plain that with these little birds fear of man is an associate feeling and that unless it had been taught them his presence would trouble them as little as does that of horse sheep or cow but how about the larger species used as food and which have had a longer and sadder experience of mans destructive power  the rhea or south american ostrich philosophers tell us is a very ancient bird on the earth and from its great size and inability to escape by flight and its excellence as food especially to savages who prefer fat rankflavoured flesh it must have been systematically persecuted by man as long as or longer than any bird now existing on the globe if fear of man ever becomes hereditary in birds we ought certainly to find some trace of such an instinct in this species i have been unable to detect any though i have observed scores of young rheas in captivity taken before the parent bird had taught them what to fear i also once kept a brood myself captured just after they had hatched out with regard to food they were almost or perhaps quite independent spending most of the time catching flies grasshoppers and other insects with surprising dexterity but of the dangers encompassing the young rhea they knew absolutely frothing they would follow me about as if they took me for their parent and whenever i imitated the loud snorting or rasping warningcall emitted the old bird in moments of danger they would to me in the greatest terror though no animal was in sight and squatting at my feet endeavour to conceal themselves by thrusting their heads and long necks up my trousers if i had caused a person to dress in white or yellow clothes for several consecutive days and had then uttered the warning cry each time he showed himself to the birds i have no doubt that they would soon have acquired a habit of running in terror from him even without the warning cry and that the fear of a person in white or yellow would have continued all their lives up to within about twenty years ago rheas were seldom or never shot in la plata and patagonia but were always hunted on horseback and caught with the bolas the sight of a mounted man would set them off at once while a person on foot could walk quite openly to within easy shooting distance of them yet their fear of a horseman dates only two hundred years backa very short time when we consider that before the indian borrowed the horse from the invader he must have systematically pursued the rhea on foot for centuries the rhea changed its habits when the hunter changed his and now if an estanciero puts down ostrich hunting on his estate in a very few years the birds although wild birds still become as fearless and familiar as domestic animals i have known old and illtempered males to become a perfect nuisance on some estancias running after and attacking every person whether on foot or on horseback that ventured near them an old instinct of a whole race could not be thus readily lost here and there on isolated estates wherever a proprietor chose to protect his birds for half a dozen years  i suppose the talegallusthe bestknown brushturkeymust be looked on as an exception to all other birds with regard to the point i am considering for this abnormal form buries its eggs in the huge mound made by the male and troubles herself no more about them when the young is fully developed it simply kicks the coffin to pieces in which its mother interred it and burrowing its way up to the sunshine enters on the pleasures and pains of an independent existence from earliest infancythat is if a species born into the world in full possession of all the wisdom of the ancients can be said ever to know infancy at all events from mr bartletts observations on the young hatched in the zoological gardens it appears that they took no notice of the old birds but lived quite independently from the moment they came out of the ground even flying up into a tree and roosting separately at night i am not sure however that these observations are quite conclusive for it is certain that captivity plays strange pranks with the instincts of some species and it is just possible that in a state of nature the old birds exercise at first some slight parental supervision and like all other species have a peculiar cry to warn the young of the dangers to be avoided if this is not so then the young talegallus must fly or hide with instinctive tear from every living thing that approaches it i at any rate find it hard to believe that it has a knowledge independent of experience of the different habits of man and kangaroo and discriminates at first sight between animals that are dangerous to it and those that are not this interesting point will probably never be determined as most unhappily the australians are just now zealously engaged in exterminating their most wonderful bird for the sake of its miserable flesh and with less excuse than the maories could plead with regard to the moa since they cannot deny that they have mutton and rabbit enough to satisfy hunger  whether birds fear or have instinctive knowledge of any of their enemies is a much larger question species that run freely on the ground from the time of quitting the shell know their proper food and avoid whatever is injurious have all young birds a similarly discriminating instinct with regard to their enemies darwin says fear of any particular enemy is certainly an instinctive quality as may be seen in nestling birds here even man seems to be included among the enemies feared instinctively and in another passage he says young chickens have lost wholly from habit that fear of the dog and cat which no doubt was originally instinctive in them my own observations point to a contrary conclusion and i may say that i have had unrivalled opportunities for studying the habits of young birds  animals of all classes old and young shrink with instinctive fear from any strange object approaching them a piece of newspaper carried accidentally by the wind is as great an object of terror to an inexperienced young bird as a buzzard sweeping down with death in its talons among birds not yet able to fly there are however some curious exceptions thus the young of most owls and pigeons are excited to anger rather than fear and puffing themselves up snap and strike at an intruder with their beaks other fledglings simply shrink down in the nest or squat close on the ground their fear apparently being in proportion to the suddenness with which the strange animal or object comes on them but if the deadliest enemy approaches with slow caution as snakes doand snakes must be very ancient enemies to birdsthere is no fear or suspicion shown even when the enemy is in full view and about to strike this it will be understood is when no warningcry is uttered by the parent bird this shrinking and in some cases hiding from an object corning swiftly towards them is the wildness of young birds which darwin says again is greater in wild than in domestic species of the extreme tameness of the young rhea i have already spoken i have also observed young tinamous plovers coots c hatched by fowls and found them as incapable of distinguishing friend from foe as the young of domestic birds the only difference between the young of wild and tame is that the former are as a rule much more sprightly and active but there are many exceptions and if this greater alertness and activity is what is meant by wildness then the young of some wild birdsrhea crested screamer care actually much tamer than our newlyhatched chickens and ducklings  to return to what may be seen in nestling birds n very young and before their education has begun if quietly approached and touched they open their bills and take food as readily from a man as from the parent bird but if while being thus fed the parent returns and emits the warning note they instantly cease their hungercries close their gaping mouths and crouch down frightened in the nest this fear caused by the parent birds warning note begins to manifest itself even before the young are hatchedand my observations on this point refer to several species in three widely separated orders when the little prisoner is hammering at its shell and uttering its feeble peep as if begging to be let out if the warning note is uttered even at a considerable distance the strokes and complaining instantly cease and the chick will then remain quiescent in the shell for a long time or until the parent by a changed note conveys to it an intimation that the danger is over another proof that the nestling has absolutely no instinctive knowledge of particular enemies but is taught to fear them by the parents is to be found in the striking contrast between the habits of parasitical and genuine young in the nest and after they have left it while still unable to find their own food i have had no opportunities of observing the habits of the young cuckoo in england with regard to this point and do not know whether other observers have paid any attention to the matter or not but i am very familiar with the manners of the parasitical starling or cowbird of south america the warning cries of the foster parent have no effect on the young cowbird at any time until they are able to fly they will readily devour worms from the hand of a man even when the old birds are hovering close by and screaming their danger notes and while their own young if the parasite has allowed any to survive in the nest are crouching down in the greatest fear after the cowbird has left the nest it is still stupidly tame and more than once i have seen one carried off from its elevated perch by a milvago hawk when if it had understood the warning cry of the foster parent it would have dropped down into the bush or grass and escaped but as soon as the young cowbirds are able to shift for themselves and begin to associate with their own kind their habits change and they become suspicious and wild like other birds  on this pointthe later period at which the parasitical young bird acquires fear of manand also bearing on the whole subject under discussion i shall add here some observations i once made on a dove hatched and reared by a pigeon at my home on the pampas a very large ombú tree grew not far from the dovecote and some of the pigeons used to make their nests on the lower horizontal branches one summer a dove of the most common species zenaida maculata in size a third less than the domestic pigeon chanced to drop an egg in one of these nests and a young dove was hatched and reared and in due time when able to fly it was brought to the dovecote i watched it a great deal and it was evident that this fosteryoung though with the pigeons was not nor ever would be of them for it could not take kiudly to their flippant flirty ways whenever a male approached it and with guttural noises and strange gestures made a pompous declaration of amorous feelings the dove would strike vigorously at its undesirable lover and drive him off big as he was and as a rule it would sit apart afoot or so from the others the dove was also a male but its male companions with instinct tainted by domestication were ignorant alike of its sex and different species now it chanced that my pigeons never being fed and always finding their own living on the plain like wild birds were although still domestic not nearly so tame as pigeons usually are in england they would not allow a person to approach within two or three yards of them without flying and if grain was thrown to them they would come to it very suspiciously or not at all and of course the young pigeons always acquired the exact degree of suspicion shown by the adults as soon as they were able to fly and consort with the others but the foundling zenaida did not know what their startled gestures and notes of fear meant when a person approached too near and as he saw none of his own kind he did not acquire their suspicious habit on the contrary he was perfectly tame although by parentage a wild bird and showed no more fear of a man than of a horse throughout the winter it remained with the pigeons going afield every day with them and returning to the dovecote but as spring approached the slight tie which united him to them began to be loosened their company grew less and less congenial and he began to lead a solitary life but he did not go to the trees yet he came to the house and his favourite perch was on the low overhanging roof of a vinecovered porch just over the main entrance here he would pass several hours every day taking no notice of the people passing in and out at all times and when the weather grew warm he would swell out his breast and coo mournfully by the hour for our pleasure  we can no doubt learn best by observing the behaviour of nestlings and young birds nevertheless i find much even in the confirmed habits of adults to strengthen me in the belief that fear of particular enemies is in nearly all casesfor i will not say allthe result of experience and tradition  hawks are the most open violent and persistent enemies birds have and it is really wonderful to see how well the persecuted kinds appear to know the power for mischief possessed by different raptorial species and how exactly the amount of alarm exhibited is in proportion to the extent of the danger to be apprehended some raptors never attack birds others only occasionally still others prey only on the young and feeble and speaking of la plata district where i have observed hawks from the milvago chimangochiefly a carrioneaterto the destructive peregrine falcon there is a very great variety of predatory habits and all degrees of courage to be found yet all these raptors are treated differently by species liable to be preyed on and have just as much respect paid them as their strength and daring entitles them to and no more so much discrimination must seem almost incredible to those who are not very familiar with the manners of wild birds i do not think it could exist if the fear shown resulted from instinct or inherited habit there would be no end to the blunders of such an instinct as that and in regions where hawks are extremely abundant most of the birds would bo in a constant state of trepidation on the pampas the appearance of the comparatively harmless chimango excites not the least alarm among small birds yet at a distance it closely resembles a henharrier and it also readily attacks young sick and wounded birds all others know how little they have to fear from it when it appears unexpectedly sweeping over a hedge or grove with a rapid flight it is sometimes mistaken for a more dangerous species there is then a little flutter of alarm some birds springing into the air but in two or three seconds of time they discover their mistake and settle down quietly again taking no further notice of the despised carrioneater on the other hand i have frequently mistaken a harrier circus cinereus in the brown state of plumage for a chimango and have only discovered my mistake by seeing the commotion among the small birds the harrier i have mentioned also the c macropterus feed partly on small birds which they flush from the ground and strike down with their claws when the harrier appears moving along with a loitering flight near the surface it is everywhere attended by a little whirlwind of alarm small birds screaming or chirping excitedly and diving into the grass or bushes but the alarm does not spread far and subsides as soon as the hawk has passed on its way buzzards buteo and urubitinga are much more feared and create a more widespread alarm and they ars certainly more destructive to birds than harriers another curious instance is that of the sociable hawk rostrhanrus sociabilis this bird spends the summer and breeds in marshes in la plata and birds pay no attention to it for it feeds exclusively on watersnails ampullaria but when it visits woods and plantations to roost during migration its appearance creates as much alarm as that of a true buzzard which it closely resembles woodbirds unaccustomed to see it do not know its peculiar preying habits and how little they need fear its presence i may also mention that the birds of la plata seem to fear the kitelike elanus less than other hawks and i believe that its singular resemblance to the common gull of the district in its size snowywhite plumage and manner of flight has a deceptive effect on most species and makes them so little suspicious of it  the wideranging peregrine falcon is a common species in la plata although oddly enough not included in any notice of the avifauna of that region before 1888 the consternation caused among birds by its appearance is vastly greater than that produced by any of the raptors i have mentioned and it is unquestionably very much more destructive to birds since it preys exclusively on them and as a rule merely picks the flesh from the head and neck and leaves the untouched body to its jackal the carrionhawk when the peregrine appears speeding through the air in a straight line at a great height the feathered world as far as one able to see is thrown into the greatest commotion all birds from the smallest up to species large as duck ibis and curlew rushing about in the air as if distracted when the falcon has disappeared in the sky and the wave of terror attending its progress subsides behind it the birds still continue wild and excited for some time showing how deeply they have been moved for as a rule fear is exceedingly transitory in its effects on animals  i must before concluding this part of my subject mention another raptor also a true falcon but differing from the peregrine in being exclusively a marshhawk in size it is nearly a third less than the male peregrine which it resembles in its sharp wings and manner of flight but its flight is much more rapid the whole plumage is uniformly of a dark grey colour unfortunately though i have observed it not fewer than a hundred times i have never been able to procure a specimen nor do i find that it is like any american falcon already described so that for the present it must remain nameless judging solely from the effect produced by the appearance of this hawk it must be even more daring and destructive than its larger relation the peregrine it flies at a great height and sometimes descends vertically and with extraordinary velocity the wings producing a sound like a deeptoned horn the sound is doubtless produced at will and is certainly less advantageous to the hawk than to the birds it pursues no doubt it can afford to despise the wingpower of its quarry and i have sometimes thought that it takes a tyrannous delight in witnessing the consternation caused by its hollow trumpeting sound this may be only a fancy but some hawks do certainly take pleasure in pursuing and striking birds when not seeking prey the peregrine has been observed baird says capturing birds only to kill and drop them many of the felidae we know evince a similar habit only these prolong their pleasure by practising a more refined and deliberate cruelty  the sudden appearance overhead of this hawk produces an effect wonderful to witness i have frequently seen all the inhabitants of a marsh struck with panic acting as if demented and suddenly grown careless to all other dangers and on such occasions i have looked up confident of seeing the sharpwinged death suspended above them in the sky all birds that happen to be on the wing drop down as if shot into the reeds or water ducks away from the margin stretch out their necks horizontally and drag their bodies as if wounded into closer cover not one bird is found bold enough to rise up and wheel about the maraudera usual proceeding in the case of other hawks while at every sudden stoop the falcon makes threatening to dash down on his prey a low cry of terror rises from the birds beneath a sound expressive of an emotion so contagious that it quickly runs like a murmur all over the marsh as if a gust of wind had swept moaning through the rushes as long as the falcon hangs overhead always at a height of about forty yards threatening at intervals to dash down this murmuring sound made up of many hundreds of individual cries is heard swelling and dying away and occasionally when he drops lower than usual rising to a sharp scream of terror  sometimes when i have been riding over marshy ground one of these hawks has placed himself directly over my head within fifteen or twenty yards of me and it has perhaps acquired the habit of following a horseman in this way in order to strike at any birds driven up on one occasion my horse almost trod on a couple of snipe squatting terrified in the short grass the instant they rose the hawk struck at one the end of his wing violently smiting my cheek as he stooped and striking at the snipe on a level with the knees of my horse the snipe escaped by diving under the bridle and immediately dropped down on the other side of me and the hawk rising up flew away  to return i think i am justified in believing that fear of hawks like fear of men is in very nearly all cases the result of experience and tradition nevertheless i think it probable that in some species which have always lived in the open continually exposed to attack and which are preferred as food by raptors such as duck snipe and plover the fear of the falcon may be an inherited habit among passerine birds i am also inclined to think that swallows show inherited fear of hawks swallows and hummingbirds have least to fear from raptors yet while hummingbirds readily pursue and tease hawks thinking as little of them as of pigeons or herons swallows everywhere manifest the greatest terror at the approach of a true falcon and they also fear other birds of prey though in a much less degree it has been said that the european hobby occasionally catches swallows on the wing but this seems a rare and exceptional habit and in south america i have never seen any bird of prey attempt the pursuit of a swallow the question then arises how did this unnecessary fear so universal in swallows originate can it be a survival of a far pasta time when some wideranging small falcon aerial in habits as the swallow itself preyed by preference on hirundines only   noteherbert spencer who accepts darwins inference explains how the fear of man acquired by experience becomes instinctive in birds in the following passage it is well known that in newlydiscovered lands not inhabited by man birds are so devoid of fear as to allow themselves to be knocked over with sticks but that in the course of generations they acquire such a dread of man as to fly on his approach and that this dread is manifested by young as well as by old now unless this change be ascribed to the killingoff of the least fearful and the preservation and multiplication of the most fearful which considering the comparatively small number killed by man is an inadequate cause it must be ascribed to accumulated experience and each experience must be held to have a share in producing it we must conclude that in each bird that escapes with injuries inflicted by man or is alarmed by the outcries of other members of the flock gregarious creatures of any intelligence being necessarily more or less sympathetic there is established an association of ideas between the human aspect and the pains direct and indirect suffered from human agency and we must further conclude that the state of consciousness which compels the bird to take flight is at first nothing more than an ideal reproduction of those painful impressions which before followed mans approach that such ideal reproduction becomes more vivid and more massive as the painful experiences direct or sympathetic increase and that thus the emotion in its incipient state is nothing else than an aggregation of the revived pains before experience  as in the course of generations the young birds of this race begin to display a fear of man before yet they have been injured by him it is an unavoidable inference that the nervous system of the race has been organically modified by these experiences we have no choice but to conclude that when a young bird is led to fly it is because the impression produced in its senses by the approaching man entails through an incipiently reflex action a partial excitement of all those nerves which in its ancestors had been excited under the like conditions that this partial excitement has its accompanying painful consciousness and that the vague painful consciousness thus arising constitutes emotion properemotion undecomposable into specific experiences and therefore seemingly homogeneous essays vol i p 320  it is comforting to know that the unavoidable inference is after all erroneous and that the nervous system in birds has not yet been organically altered as a result of mans persecution for in that case it would take long to undo the mischief and we should be indeed far from that better friendship with the children of the air which many of us would like to see     chapter vi  parental and early instincts   under this heading i have put together several notes from my journals on subjects which have no connection with each other except that they relate chiefly to the parental instincts of some animals i have observed and to the instincts of the young at a very early period of life  while taking bats one day in december i captured a female of our common buenos ayrean species molossus bonariensis with her two young attached to her so large that it seemed incredible she should be able to fly and take insects with such a weight to drag her down the young were about a third less in size than the mother so that she had to carry a weight greatly exceeding that of her own body they were fastened to her breast and belly one on each side as when first born and possibly the young bat does not change its position or move like the young developed opossum to other parts of the body until mature enough to begin an independent life on forcibly separating them from their parent i found that they were not yet able to fly but when set free fluttered feebly to the ground this bat certainly appeared more burdened with its young than any animal i had ever observed i have seen an old female opossum didelphys azarae with eleven young large as old ratsthe mother being less than a cat in sizeall clinging to various parts of her body yet able to climb swiftly and with the greatest agility in the higher branches of a tree the actual weight was in this case relatively much greater than in that of the female bat but then the opossum never quitted its hold on the tree and it also supplemented its handlike feet furnished with crooked claws with its teeth and long prehensile tail the poor bat had to seek its living in the empty air pursuing its prey with the swiftness of a swallow and it seemed wonderful to me that she should have been able to carry about that great burden with her one pair of wings and withal to be active enough to supply herself and her young with food  in the end i released her and saw her fly away and disappear among the trees after which i put back the two young bats in the place i had taken them from among the thickclustering foliage of a small acacia tree when set free they began to work their way upwards through the leaves and slender twigs in the most adroit manner catching a twig with their teeth then embracing a whole cluster of leaves with their wings just as a person would take up a quantity of loose clothes and hold them tight by pressing them against the chest the body would then emerge above the clasped leaves and a higher twig would be caught by the teeth and so on successively until they had got as high as they wished when they proceeded to hook themselves to a twig and assume the inverted position side by side after which one drew in its head and went to sleep while the other began licking the end of its wing where my finger and thumb had pressed the delicate membrane later in the day i attempted to feed them with small insects but they rejected my friendly attentions in the most unmistakable manner snapping viciously at me every time i approached them in the evening i stationed myself close to the tree and presently had the satisfaction of seeing the mother return flying straight to the spot where i had taken her and in a few moments she was away again and over the trees with her twins  assuming that these two young bats had before i found them existed like parasites clinging to the parent their adroit actions when liberated and their angry demonstrations at my approach were very astonishing for in all other mammals born in a perfectly helpless state like rodents weasels edentates and even marsupials the instincts of selfpreservation are gradually developed after the period of activity begins when the mother leads them out and they play with her and avith each other in the bat the instincts must ripen to perfection without exercise or training and while the animal exists as passively as a fruit on its stem  i have observed that the helpless young of some of the mammals i have just mentioned seem at first to have no instinctive understanding of the language of alarm and fear in the parent as all youngbirds have even before their eyes are open nor is it necessary that they should have such an instinct since in most cases they are well concealed in kennels or other safe places but when through some accident they are exposed the want of such an instinct makes the task of protecting them doubly hard for the parent i once surprised a weasel galictis barbara in the act of removing her young or conducting them rather and when she was forced to quit them although still keeping close by and uttering the most piercing cries of anger and solicitude the young continued piteously crying out in their shrill voices and moving about in circles without making the slightest attempt to escape or to conceal themselves as young birds do  some field mice breed on the surface of the ground in illconstructed nests and their young are certainly the most helpless things in nature it is possible that where this dangerous habit exists the parent has some admirable complex instincts to safeguard her young in addition to the ordinary instincts of most animals of this kind this idea was suggested to me by the action of a female mouse which i witnessed by chance while walking in a field of stubble one day in autumn near buenos ayres i suddenly heard issuing from near my feet a chorus of shrill squealing voicesthe familiar excessively sharp little needles of sound emitted by young blind and naked mice when they are disturbed or in pain looking down i saw close to my foot a nest of themthere were nine in all wriggling about and squealing for the parent frightened at my step had just sprung from them overturning in her hurry to escape the slight looselyfelted dome of fine grass and thistledown which had covered them i saw her running away but after going six or seven yards she stopped and turning partly round so as to watch me waited in fear and trembling i remained perfectly motionlessa sure way to allay fear and suspicion in any wild creatureand in a few moments she returned but with the utmost caution frequently pausing to start and tremble and masking her approach with corn stumps and little inequalities in the surface of the ground until reaching the nest she took one of the young in her mouth and ran rapidly away to a distance of eight or nine yards and concealed it in a tuft of dry grass  leaving it she returned a second time in the same cautious manner and taking another ran with it to the same spot and concealed it along with the first it was curious that the first young mouse had continued squealing after being hidden by the mother for i could hear it distinctly the air being very still but when the second mouse had been placed with it the squealing ceased a third time the old mouse came and then instead of going to the same spot as i had expected she ran off in an opposite direction and disappeared among the dry weeds a fourth was carried to the same place as the third and in this way they were all removed to a distance of some yards from the nest and placed in couples until the last and odd one remained in due time she came for it and ran away with it in a new direction and was soon out of sight and although i waited fully ten minutes she did not return nor could i afterwards find any of the young mice when i looked for them or even hear them squeal  i have frequently observed newlyborn lambs on the pampas and have never failed to be surprised at the extreme imbecility they display in their actions although this may be due partly to inherited degeneracy caused by domestication this imbecile condition continues for two sometimes for three days during which time the lamb apparently acts purely from instincts which are far from perfect but after that experience and its dam teach it a better way when born its first impulse is to struggle up on to its feet its second to suck but here it does not discriminate like the newlyhatched bird that picks up its proper food or it does not know what to suck it will take into its mouth whatever comes near in most cases a tuft of wool on its dams neck and at this it will continue sucking for an indefinite time it is highly probable that the strongsmelling secretion of the sheeps udder attracts the lamb at length to that part and that without something of the kind to guide it in many cases it would actually starve without finding the teats i have often seen lambs many hours after birth still confining their attention to the most accessible locks of wool on the neck or fore legs of the dams and believe that in such cases the long time it took them to find the source of nourishment arose from a defective sense of smell its next important instinct which comes into play from the moment it can stand on its feet impels it to follow after any object receding from it and on the other hand to run from anything approaching it if the dam turns round and approaches it from even a very short distance it will start back and run from her in fear and will not understand her voice when she bleats to it at the same time it will confidently follow after a man dog horse or any other animal moving from it a very common experience on the pampas in the sheepcountry is to see a lamb start up from sleep and follow the rider running along close to the heels of the horse this is distressing to a merciful man tor he cannot shake the little simpleton off and if he rides on no matter how fast it will keep up him or keep him in sight for half a mile or a mile and never recover its dam the gaucho who is not merciful frequently saves himself all trouble and delay by knocking it senseless with a blow of his whiphandle and without checking his horse i have seen a lamb about two days old start up from sleep and immediately start off in pursuit of a puff ball about as big as a mans head carried past it over the smooth turf by the wind and chase it for a distance of five hundred yards until the dry ball was brought to a stop by a tuft of coarse grass this blundering instiuct is quickly laid aside when the lamb has learned to distinguish its dam from other objects and its dams voice from other sounds when four or five days old it will start from sleep but instead of rushing blindly away after any receding object it first looks about it and will then recognize and run to its dam  i have often been struck with the superiority of the pampa or creollathe old native breed of sheepin the greater vigour of the young when born over the improved european varieties the pampa descends to us from the first sheep introduced into la plata about three centuries ago and is a tall gaunt bony animal with lean dry flesh like venison and long straight wool like goats hair in their struggle for existence in a country subject to sudden great changes of temperature to drought and failure of grass they have in a great measure lost the qualities which make the sheep valuable to man as a food and woolproducing animal but on the other hand they have to some extent recovered the vigour of a wild animal being hardy enough to exist without any shelter and requiring from their master man only protection from the larger carnivores they are keenscented swift of foot and wonderfully active and thrive where other breeds would quickly starve i have often seen a lamb dropped on the frosty ground in bitterly cold windy weather in midwinter and in less than five seconds struggle to its feet and seem as vigorous as any dayold lamb of other breeds the dam impatient at the short delay and not waiting to give it suck has then started off at a brisk trot after the flock scattered and galloping before the wind like huanacos rather than sheep with the lamb scarcely a minute in the world running freely at her side notwithstanding its great vigour it has been proved that the pampa sheep has not so far outgrown the domestic taint as to be able to maintain its own existence when left entirely to itself during the first half of this century when cattlebreeding began to be profitable and wool was not worth the trouble of shearing and the gaucho workman would not eat mutton when beef was to be had some of the estancieros on the southern pampas determined to get rid of their sheep which were of no value to them and many flocks were driven a distance out and lost in the wilds out of many thousands thus turned loose to shift for themselves not one pair survived to propagate a new race of feral sheep in a short time pumas wild dogs and other beasts of prey had destroyed them all the sterling qualities of the pampa sheep had their value in other times at present the improved kinds are alone considered worth having and the original sheep of the country is now rapidly disappearing though still found in remote and poor districts especially in the province of cordova and probably before long it will become extinct together with the curious pugnosed cow of the pampas  i have had frequent opportunities of observing the young from one to three days old of the cervus campestristhe common deer of the pampas and the perfection of its instincts at that tender age seem very wonderful in a ruminant when the doe with fawn is approached by a horseman even when accompanied with dogs she stands perfectly motionless gazing fixedly at the enemy the fawn motionless at her side and suddenly as if at a preconcerted signal the fawn rushes directly away from her at its utmost speed and going to a distance of six hundred to a thousand yards conceals itself in a hollow in the ground or among the long grass lying down very close with neck stretched out horizontally and will thus remain until sought by the dam when very young if found in its hidingplace it will allow itself to be taken making no further effort to escape after the fawn has run away the doe still maintains her statuesque attitude as if resolved to await the onset and only when the dogs are close to her she also rushes away but invariably in a direction as nearly opposite to that taken by the fawn as possible at first she runs slowly with a limping gait and frequently pausing as if to entice her enemies on like a partridge duck or plover when driven from its young but as they begin to press her more closely her speed increases becoming greater the further she succeeds in leading them from the startingpoint  the alarmcry of this deer is a peculiar whistling bark a low but farreaching sound but when approaching a doe with young i have never been able to hear it nor have i seen any movement on the part of the doe yet it is clear that in some mysterious way she inspires the fawn with sudden violent fear while the fawn on its side instead of being affected like the young in other mammals and sticking closer to its mother acts in a contrary way and runs from her  of the birds i am acquainted with the beautiful jacana parra jacana appears to come into the world with its faculties and powers in the most advanced state it is in fact ready to begin active life from the very moment of leaving the shell as i once accidentally observed i found a nest on a small mound of earth in a shallow lagoon containing four eggs with the shells already chipped by the birds in them two yards from the small nest mound there was a second mound covered with coarse grass i got off my horse to examine the nest and the old birds excited beyond measure fluttered round me close by pouring out their shrill rapidlyreiterated cries in an unbroken stream sounding very much like a policemans rattle while i was looking closely at one of the eggs lying on the palm of my hand all at once the cracked shell parted and at the same moment the young bird leaped from my hand and fell into the water i am quite sure that the young birds sudden escape from the shell and my hand was the result of a violent effort on its part to free itself and it was doubtless inspired to make the effort by the loud persistent screaming of the parent birds which it heard while in the shell stooping to pick it up to save it from perishing i soon saw that my assistance was not required for immediately on dropping into the water it put out its neck and with the body nearly submerged like a wounded duck trying to escape observation it swam rapidly to the second small mound i have mentioned and escaping from the water concealed itself in the grass lying close and perfectly motionless like a young plover  in the case of the pampa or creolla sheep i have shown that during its long rough life in la plata this variety has in some measure recovered the natural vigour and ability to maintain existence in adverse circumstances of its wild ancestors as much can be said of the creolla fowl of the pampas and some observations of mine on the habits of this variety will perhaps serve to throw light on a vexed question of natural historynamely the cackling of the hen after laying an instinct which has been described as useless and disadvantageous in fowls that live unconfined and which are allowed to lay where they like the instinct as we know it is certainly detrimental since eggeating dogs and pigs soon learn the cause of the outcry and acquire a habit of rushing off to find the egg when they hear it the question then arises does the wild jungle fowl possess the same pernicious instinct  the creolla is no doubt the descendant of the fowl originally introduced about three centuries ago by the first colonists in la plata and has probably not only been uncrossed with any other improved variety such as are now fast taking its place and has lived a much freer life than is usual with the fowl in europe it is a rather small lean extremely active bird lays about a dozen eggs and hatches them all and is of a yellowish red coloura hue which is common i believe in the old barndoor fowl of england the creolla fowl is strong on the wing and much more carnivorous and rapacious in habits than other breeds mice frogs and small snakes are eagerly hunted and devoured by it at my home on the pampas a number of these fowls were kept and were allowed to range freely about the plantation which was large and the adjacent grounds where there were thickets of giant cardoon thistle redweed thorn apple c they always nested at a distance from the house and it was almost impossible ever to find their eggs on account of the extreme circumspection they observed in going to and from their nests and when they succeeded in escaping foxes skunks weasels and opossums which strange to say they often did they would rear their chickens away out of sight and hearing of the house and only bring them home when winter deprived them of their leafy covering and made food scarce during the summer in my rambles about the plantation t would occasionally surprise one of these halfwild hens with her brood her distracted screams and motions would then cause her chicks to scatter and vanish in all directions and until the supposed danger was past they would lie as close and wellconcealed as young partridges these fowls in summer always lived in small parties each party composed of one cock and as many hens as he could collectusually three or four each family occupied its own feeding ground where it would pass a greater portion of each day the hen would nest at a considerable distance from the feeding ground sometimes as far as four or five hundred yards away after laying an egg she would quit the nest not walking from it as other fowls do but flying the flight extending to a distance of from fifteen to about fifty yards after which still keeping silence she would walk or run until arrived at the feeding ground she would begin to cackle at once the cock if within hearing would utter a responsive cackle whereupon she would run to him and cackle no more frequently the cackling callnote would not be uttered more than two or three times sometimes only once and in a much lower tone than in fowls of other breeds  if we may assume that these fowls in their long semiindependent existence in la plata have reverted to the original instincts of the wild gallus bankiva we can see here how advantageous the cackling instinct must be in enabling the hen in dense tropical jungles to rejoin the flock after laying an egg if there are eggeating animals in the jungle intelligent enough to discover the meaning of such a short subdued cackling call they would still be unable to find the nest by going back on the birds scent since she flies from the nest in the first place and the wild bird probably flies further than the creolla hen of la plata the clamorous cackling of our fowls would appear then to be nothing more than a perversion of a very useful instinct     chapter vii  the mephitic skunk   it might possibly give the reader some faint conception of the odious character of this creature for adjectives are weak to describo it when i say that in talking to strangers from abroad i have never thought it necessary to speak of sunstroke jaguars or the assassins knife but have never omitted to warn them of the skunk minutely describing its habits and personal appearance  i knew an englishman who on taking a first gallop across the pampas saw one and quickly dismounting hurled himself bodily on to it to effect its capture poor man he did not know that the little animal is never unwilling to be caught men have been blinded for ever by a discharge of the fiery liquid full in their faces on a mucous membrane it burns like sulphuric acid say the unfortunates who have had the experience how does nature protect the skunk itself from the injurious effects of its potent fluid i have not unfrequently found individuals stoneblind sometimes moving so briskly about that the blindness must have been of long standingvery possibly in some cases an accidental drop discharged by the animal itself has caused the loss of sight when coming to close quarters with a skunk by covering up the face ones clothes only are ruined but this is not all one has to fear from an encounter the worst is that effluvium after which crushed garlic is lavender which tortures the olfactory nerves and appears to pervade the whole system like a pestilent ether nauseating one until seasickness seems almost a pleasant sensation in comparison  to those who know the skunk only from reputation my words might seem too strong many however who have come to close quarters with the little animal will think them ridiculously weak and consider what must the feelings be of one who has had the following experiencenot an uncommon experience on the pampas there is to be a dance at a neighbouring house a few miles away he has been looking forward to it and dressing himself with due care mounts his horse and sets out full of joyous anticipations it is a dark windy evening but there is a convenient bridlepath through the dense thicket of giant thistles and striking it he puts his horse into a swinging gallop unhappily the path is already occupied by a skunk invisible in the darkness that in obedience to the promptings of its insane instinct refuses to get out of it until the flying hoofs hit it and sand it like a wellkicked football into the thistles but the forefoot of the horse up as high as his knees perhaps have been sprinkled and the rider after coming out into the open dismounts and walks away twenty yards from his animal and literally smells himself all over and with a feeling of profound relief pronounces himself not the minutest drop of the diabolical spray has touched his dancing shoes springing into the saddle he proceeds to his journeys end is warmly welcomed by his host and speedily forgetting his slight misadventure mingles with a happy crowd of friends in a little while people begin exchanging whispers and significant glances men are seen smiling at nothing in particular the hostess wears a clouded face the ladies cough and put their scented handkerchiefs to their noses and presently they begin to feel faint and retire from the room our hero begins to notice that there is something wrong and presently discovers its cause he unhappily has been the last person in the room to remark that familiar but most abominable odour rising like a deadly exhalation from the floor conquering all other odours and every moment becoming more powerful a drop has touched his shoe after all and fearing to be found out and edging towards the door he makes his escape and is speedily riding home again knowing full well that his sudden and early departure from the scene will be quickly discovered and set down to the right cause  in that not always trustworthy book the natural history of chili molina tells us how they deal with the animal in the transandine regions when one appears he says some of the company begiu by caressing it until an opportunity offers for one of them to seize it by the tail in this position the muscles become contracted the animal is unable to eject its fluid and is quickly despatched one might just as well talk of caressing a cobra de capello yet this laughable fiction finds believers all over south and north america professor baird gravely introduces it into his great work on the mammalia i was once talking about animals in a rancho when a person present an argentine officer told that while visiting an indian encampment he had asked the savages how they contrived to kill skunks without making even a life in the desert intolerable a grave old cacique informed him that the secret was to go boldly up to the animal take it by the tail and despatch it for he said when you fear it not at all then it respects your courage and dies like a lambsweetly the officer continuing his story said that on quitting the indian camp he started a skunk and glad of an opportunity to test the truth of what he had heard dismounted and proceeded to put the indian plan in practice here the story abruptly ended and when i eagerly demanded to hear the sequel the amateur hunter of furs lit a cigarette and vacantly watched the ascending smoke the indians aro grave jokers they seldom smile and this old traditional skunkjoke which has run the length of a continent finding its way into many wise books is their revenge on a superior race  i have shot a great many eagles and occasionally a carancho polyborus tharus with the plumage smelling strongly of skunk which shows that these birds pressed by hunger often commit the fearful mistake of attacking the animal my friend mr ernest gibson of buenos ayres in a communication to the ibis describes an encounter he actually witnessed between a carancho and a skunk riding home one afternoon he spied a skunk shuffling along in the erratic manner usual to that odoriferous quadruped following it at a very short distance was an eaglevulture evidently bent on mischief every time the bird came near the bushy tail rose menacingly then the carancho would fall behind and after a few moments hesitation follow on again at length growing bolder it sprung forward seizing the threatening tail with its claw but immediately after began staggering about with dishevelled plumage tearful eyes and a profoundly woebegone expression on its vulture face the skunk after turning and regarding its victim with an itoldyouso look for a few moments trotted unconcernedly off  i was told in patagonia by a man named molinos who was frequently employed by the government as guide to expeditions in the desert that everywhere throughout that country the skunk is abundant some years ago he was sent with two other men to find and treat with an indian chief whose whereabouts were not known far in the interior molinos was overtaken by a severe winter his horses died of thirst and fatigue and during the three bitterest months of the year he kept himself and his followers alive by eating the flesh of skunks the only wild animal that never failed them no doubt on those vast sterile plains where the skunk abounds and goes about by day and by night careless of enemies the terrible nature of its defensive weapon is the first lesson experience teaches to every young eagle fox wild cat and puma  dogs kill skunks when made to do so but it is not a sport they delight in one moonlight night at home i went out to where the dogs twelve in number were sleeping while i stood there a skunk appeared and deliberately came towards me passing through the dogs where they lay and one by one as he passed them they rose up and with their tails between their legs skulked off when made to kill skunks often they become seasoned but always perform the loathsome task expeditiously then rush away with frothing mouths to rub their faces in the wet clay and rid themselves of the fiery sensation at one time i possessed only one dog that could be made to face a skunk and as the little robbers were very plentiful and continually coining about the house in their usual open bold way it was rather hard for the poor brute this dog detested them quite as strongly as the others only he was more obedient faithful and brave whenever i bade him attack one of them he would come close up to me and look up into my face with piteous pleading eyes then finding that he was not to be let off from the repulsive task he would charge upon the doomed animal with a blind fury wonderful to see seizing it between his teeth he would shake it madly crushing its bones then hurl it several feet from him only to rush again and again upon it to repeat the operation doubtless with a caligulalike wish in his frantic breast that all the skunks on the globe had but one backbone  i was once on a visit to a sheepfarming brother far away on the southern frontier of buenos ayres and amongst the dogs i found there was one most interesting creature he was a great lumbering stupid goodtempered brute so greedy that when you offered him a piece of meat he would swallow half your arm and so obedient that at a word he would dash himself against the horns of a bull and face death and danger in any shape but my brother told me he would not face a skunkhe would die first one day i took him out and found a skunk and for upwards of half an hour i sat on my horse vainly cheering on my cowardly follower and urging him to battle the very sight of the enemy gave him a fit of the shivers and when the irascible little enemy began to advance against us going through the performance by means of which he generally puts his foes to flight without resorting to malodorous measuresstamping his little feet in rage jumping up spluttering and hissing and flourishing his brush like a warlike banner above his headthen hardly could i restrain my dog from turning tail and flying home in abject terror my cruel persistence was rewarded at last continued shouts cheers and handclappings began to stir the brute to a kind of frenzy torn by conflicting emotions he began to revolve about the skunk at a lumbering gallop barking howling and bristling up his hair and at last shutting his eyes and with a yell of desperation he charged i fully expected to see the enemy torn to pieces in a few seconds but when the dog was still four or five feet from him the fatal discharge came and he dropped down as if shot dead for some time he lay on the earth perfectly motionless watched and gently bedewed by the victorious skunk then he got up and crept whining away gradually he quickened his pace finally breaking into a frantic run in vain i followed him shouting at the top of my lungs he stayed not to listen and very speedily vanished from sighta white speck on the vast level plain at noon on the following day he made his appearance gaunt and befouled with mud staggering forward like a galvanized skeleton too worn out even to eat he flung himself down and for hours lay like a dead thing sleeping off the effects of those few drops of perfume  dogs i concluded like men have their idiosyncrasies but i had gained my point and proved once moreif any proof were neededthe truth of that noble panegyric of bacons on our faithful servant and companion     chapter viii  mimicry and warning colours in grasshoppers   there is in la plata a large handsome grasshopper zoniopoda tarsata the habits of which in its larva and imago stages are in strange contrast like those in certain lepidoptera in which the caterpillars form societies and act in concert the adult has a greenish protective colouring brown and green banded thighs bright red hind wings seen only during flight it is solitary and excessively shy in its habits living always in concealment among the dense foliage near the surface of the ground the yonng are intensely black like grasshoppers cut out of jet or ebony and gregarious in habit living in bands of forty or fifty to three or four hundred and so little shy that they may sometimes be taken up by handfuls before they begin to scatter in alarm their gregarious habits and blacknessof all hues in nature the most obvious to the sightwould alone be enough to make them the most conspicuous of insects but they have still other habits which appear as if specially designed to bring them more prominently into notice thus they all keep so close together at all times as to have their bodies actually touching and when travelling move so slowly that the laziest snail might easily overtake and pass one of their bands and even disappear beyond their limited horizon in a very short time  they often select an exposed weed to feed on clustering together on its summit above the surrounding verdure an exceedingly conspicuous object to every eye in the neighbourhood they also frequently change their feedingground at such times they deliberately cross wide roads and other open spaces barren of grass where moving so slowly that they scarcely seem to move at all they look at a distance like a piece of black velvet lying on the ground thus in every imaginable way they expose themselves and invite attack yet in spite of it all i have never detected birds preying on them and i have sometimes kept one of these black societies under observation near my house for several days watching them at intervals in places where the trees overhead were the resort of icterine and tyrant birds guira cuckoos and other species all great hunters after grasshoppers a young grasshopper is moreover a morsel that seldom comes amiss to any bird whether insect or seed eater and as a rule it is extremely shy nimble and inconspicuous it seems clear that although the young zoniopoda does not mimic in its form any black protected insect it nevertheless owes its safety to its blackness together with the habit it possesses of exposing itself in so open and bold a manner blackness is so common in large protected insects as for instance in the unpalatable leafcutting ants scorpions mygale spiders wasps and other dangerous kinds that it is manifestly a warning colour the most universal and best known in nature and the grasshopper i believe furthermore mimics the fearless demeanour of the protected or venomous species which birds and other insecteaters know and respect it might be supposed that the young zoniopoda is itself unpalatable but this is scarcely probable for when the deceptive black mask is once dropped the excessive shyness love of concealment and protective colouring of the insect show that it is much sought after by birds  while setting this down as an undoubted case of mimicry although it differs in some respects from all other cases i have seen reported i cannot help remarking that this most useful word appears to be in some danger of losing the meaning originally attached to it in zoology there are now very few cases of an accidental resemblance found between two species in nature which are not set down by someone to mimicry some in which even the wildest imagination might well fail to see any possible benefit to the supposed mimic in cases where the outward resemblance of some feeble animal to a widely different and wellprotected species or to some object like a leaf or stick and where such resemblance is manifestly advantageous and has reacted on and modified the life habits it is conceivable that slight spontaneous variations in the structure and colouring of the unprotected species have been taken advantage of by the principle of natural selection and a case of mimicry set up to become more and more perfect in time as successive casual variations in the same direction increased the resemblance  the stickinsect is perhaps the most perfect example where resemblance to an inanimate object has been the result aimed at so to speak by nature the resemblance of the volucella fly to the humblebee on which it is parasitical is the most familiar example of one species growing like another to its own advantage since only by means of its deceptive likeness to the humblebee is it able to penetrate into the nest with impunity these two cases with others of a similar character were first called cases of mimicry by kirby and spence in their everdelightful introduction to entomologyan old book but curiously enough in these days of popular treatises on all matters of the kind still the only general work on insects in the english language which one who is not an entomologist can read with pleasure  a second case of mimicry not yet noticed by any naturalist is seen in another grasshopper also common in la plata rhomalea speciosa of thunberg this is an extremely elegant insect the head and thorax chocolate with creamcoloured markings the abdomen steelblue or purple a colour i have not seen in any other insects of this family the fore wings have a protective colouring the hind wings are bright red when at rest with the red and purple tints concealed it is only a very pretty grasshopper but the instant it takes wing it becomes the facsimile of a very common wasp of the genus pepris these wasps vary greatly in size some being as large as the hornet they are solitary and feed on the honey of flowers and on fruit and besides being furnished with stings like other waspsthough their sting is nok so venomous as in other generathey also when angry emit a most abominable odour and are thus doubly protected against their enemies their excessive tameness slow flight and indolent motions serve to show that they are not accustomed to be interfered with all these strongsmelling wasps have steelblue or purple bodies and bright red wings so exactly does the rhomalea grasshopper mimic the pepris when flying that i have been deceived scores of times i have even seen it on the leaves and after it has flown and settled once more i have gone to look at it again to make sure that my eyes had not deceived me it is curious to see how this resemblance has reacted on and modified the habits of the grasshopper it is a great flyer and far more aerial in its habits than any other insect i am acquainted with in this family living always in trees instead of on or near the surface of the ground it is abundant in orchards and plantations round buenos ayres where its long and peculiarly soft breezy note may be heard all summer if the ancient athenians possessed so charming an insect as this their great regard for the grasshopper was not strange i only wish that the athenians of south america as my fellowtownsmen sometimes call themselves in moments of exaltation had a feeling of the samo kindthe regard which does not impale its object on a pinfor the pretty lighthearted songster of their groves and gardens  when taken in the hand it has the habit common to most grasshoppers of pouring out an inky fluid from its mouth only the discharge is unusually copious in this species it has another habit in defending itself which is very curious when captured it instantly curls its body round as a wasp does to sting the suddenness of this action has more than once caused me to drop an insect i had taken actually thinking for the moment that i had taken hold of a wasp whether birds would be deceived and made to drop it or not is a question it would not be easy to settle but the instinct certainly looks like one of a series of small adaptations all tending to make the resemblance to a wasp more complete and effective      chapter ix  dragonfly storms   one of the most curious things i have encountered in my observations on animal life relates to a habit of the larger species of dragonflies inhabiting the pampas and patagonia dragonflies are abundant throughout the country wherever there is water there are several species all more or less brilliantly coloured the kinds that excited my wonder from their habits are twice as large as the common widely distributed insects being three inches to four inches in length and as a rule they are sobercoloured although there is one speciesthe largest among thementirely of a brilliant scarlet this kind is however exceedingly rare all the different kinds of the large dragonflies when travelling associate together and occasionally in a flight composed of countless thousands one of these brillianthued individuals will catch the eye appearing as conspicuous among the others as a poppy or scarlet geranium growing alone in an otherwise flowerless field the most common speciesand in some cases the entire flight seems to be composed of this kind onlyis the aeschna bonariensis raml the prevailing colour of which is pale blue but the really wonderful thing about them all alike is that they appear only when flying before the southwest wind called pamperothe wind that blows from the interior of the pampas the pampero is a dry cold wind exceedingly violent it bursts on the plains very suddenly and usually lasts only a short time sometimes not more than ten minutes it comes irregularly and at all seasons of the year but is most frequent in the hot season and after exceptionally sultry weather it is in summer and autumn that the large dragonflies appear not with the wind butand this is the most curious part of the matterin advance of it and inasmuch as these insects are not seen in the country at other times and frequently appear in seasons of prolonged drought when all the marshes and watercourses for many hundreds of miles are dry they must of course traverse immense distances flying before the wind at a speed of seventy or eighty miles an hour on some occasions they appear almost simultaneously with the wind going by like a flash and instantly disappearing from sight you have scarcely time to see them before the wind strikes you as a rule however they make their appearance from five to fifteen minutes before the wind strikes and when they are in great numbers the air to a height of ten or twelve feet above the surface of the ground is all at once seen to be full of them rushing past with extraordinary velocity in a northeasterly direction in very oppressive weather and when the swiftly advancing pampero brings no moving mountains of mingled cloud and dust and is consequently not expected the sudden apparition of the dragonfly is a most welcome one for then an immediate burst of cold wind is confidently looked for in the expressive vernacular of the gauchos the large dragonfly is called hijo del pamperoson of the southwest wind  it is clear that these great and frequent dragonfly movements are not explicable on any current hypothesis regarding the annual migrations of birds the occasional migrations of butterflies or the migrations of some mammals like the reindeer and buffalo of arctic america which according to rae and other observers perform long journeys north and south at regular seasons from a sense of polarity neither this hypothetical sense in animals nor historical memory will account for the dragonfly storms as the phenomenon of the pampas might be called since the insects do not pass and repass between breeding and subsistence areas but all journey in a northeasterly direction and of the countless millions flying like thistledown before the great pampero wind not one solitary traveller ever returns  the cause of the flight is probably dynamical affecting the insects with a sudden panic and compelling them to rush away before the approaching tempest the mystery is that they should fly from the wind before it reaches them and yet travel in the same direction with it when they pass over the level treeless country not one insect lags behind or permits the wind to overtake it but on arriving at a wood or large plantation they swarm into it as if seeking shelter from some swiftpursuing enemy and on such occasions they sometimes remain clinging to the trees while the wind spends its force this is particularly the case when the wind blows up at a late hour of the day then on the following morning the dragonflies are seen clustering to the foliage in such numbers that many trees are covered with them a large tree often appearing as if hung with curtains of some brown glistening material too thick to show the green leaves beneath  in patagonia where the phenomenon of dragonfly storms is also known an englishman residing at the rio negro related to me the following occurrence which he witnessed there a race meeting was being held near the town of el carmen on a high exposed piece of ground when shortly before sunset a violent pampero wind came up laden with dense dustclouds a few moments before the storm broke the air all at once became obscured with a prodigious cloud of dragonflies about a hundred men most of them on horseback were congregated on the course at the time and the insects instead of rushing by in their usual way settled on the people in such quantities that men and horses were quickly covered with clinging masses of them my informant saidand this agrees with my own observationthat he was greatly impressed by the appearance of terror shown by the insects they clung to him as if for dear life so that he had the greatest difficulty in ridding himself of them  weissenborn in londons magazine of natural history n s vol iii describes a great migration of dragonflies which he witnessed in germany in 1839 and also mentions a similar phenomenon occurring in 1816 and extending over a large portion of europe but in these cases the movement took place at the end of may and the insects travelled due south their migrations were therefore similar to those of birds and butterflies and were probably due to the same cause i have been unable to find any mention of a phenomenon resembling the one with which we are so familiar on the pampas and which strangely enough has not been recorded by any european naturalists who have travelled there     chapter x  mosquitoes and parasite problems   there cannot be a doubt that some animals possess an instinctive knowledge of their enemiesor at all events of some of their enemiesthough i do not believe that this faculty is so common as many naturalists imagine the most striking example i am acquainted with is seen in gnats or mosquitoes and in the minute south american sandflies simulia when a dragonfly appears in a place where they are holding their aerial pastimes the sudden appearance of a ghost among human revellers could not produce a greater panic i have spoken in the last chapter of periodical storms or waves of dragonflies in the plata region and mentioned incidentally that the appearance of these insects is most welcome in oppressively hot weather since they are known to come just in advance of a rush of cool wind in la plata we also look for the dragonfly and rejoice at its coming for another reason we know that the presence of this noble insect will cause the clouds of stinging gnats and flies which make life a burden to vanish like smoke  when a flight of dragonflies passes over the country many remain along the route as i have said sheltering themselves wherever trees occur and after the storm blows over these strangers and stragglers remain for some days hawking for prey in the neighbourhood it is curious to note that they do not show any disposition to seek for watercourses it may be that they feel lost in a strange region or that the panic they have suffered in their long flight before the wind has unsettled their instincts for it is certain that they do not like the dragonfly in mrs brownings poem return to dream upon the river they lead instead a kind of vagabond existence hanging about the plantations and roaming over the surrounding plains it is then remarked that gnats and sandflies apparently cease to exist even in places where they have been most abundant they have not been devoured by the dragonflies which are perhaps very few in number they have simply got out of the way and will remain in close concealment until their enemies take their departure or have all been devoured by martins tyrant birds and the big robberflies or devils dykesno name is bad enough for themof the family asilidaa during these peaceful gnatless days if a person thrusts himself into the bushes or herbage in some dark sheltered place he will soon begin to hear the thin familiar sounds as of horns of elfland faintly blowing and presently from the ground and the under surface of every leaf the ghostlike withered little starvelings will appear in scores and in hundreds to settle on him fear not having blunted their keen appetites  when riding over the pampas on a hot still day with a pertinacious cloud of gnats or sandflies hovering just above my head and keeping me company for miles i have always devoutly wished for a stray dragonfly to show himself frequently the wish has been fulfilled the dragonfly apparently sagacious of his quarry from afar sweeping straight at his prey and instantly as if by miracle the stinging rain has ceased and the noxious cloud vanished from overhead to be reformed no more this has always seemed very extraordinary to me for in other matters gnats do not appear to possess even that proverbial small dose of intellect for which we give most insects credit before the advent of the dragonfly it has perhaps happened that i have been vigorously striking at them making it very unpleasant for them and also killing and disabling many hundredsa larger number than the most voracious dragonfly could devour in the course of a whole day and yet after brushing and beating them off until my arms have ached with the exertion they have continued to rush blindly on their fate exhibiting not the faintest symptom of fear i suppose that for centuries mosquitoes have in this way been brushed and beaten away with hands and with tails without learning caution it is not in their knowledge that there are hands and tails a large animal is simply a field on which they confidently settle to feed sounding shrill flourishes on their little trumpets to show how fearless they are but the dragonfly is very ancient on the earth and if during the devonian epoch when it existed it preyed on some bloodsucking insect from which or culicidae have come then these stupid little insects have certainly had ample time in which to learn well at least one lesson  there is not in all organic nature to my mind any instance of wasted energy comparable in magnitude with the mosquitos thirst for blood and the instincts and elaborate bloodpumping apparatus with which it is related the amount of pollen given off by some windfertilized treesso great in some places that it covers hundreds of square miles of earth and water with a film of yellow duststrikes us as an amazing waste of material on the part of nature but in these cases we readily see that this excessive prodigality is necessary to continue the species and that a sufficient number of flowers would not be impregnated unless the entire trees were bathed for days in the fertilizing cloud in which only one out of many millions of floating particles can ever hit the mark the mosquito is able to procreate without ever satisfying its ravenous appetite for blood to swell its grey threadlike abdomen to a coral bead is a delight to the insect but not necessary to its existence like food and water to ours it is the great prize in the lottery of life which few can ever succeed in drawing in a hot summer when one has ridden perhaps for half a day over a lowlying or wet district through an atmosphere literally obscured with a fog of mosquitoes this fact strikes the mind very forcibly for in such places it frequently is the case that mammals do not exist or are exceedingly rare in europe it is different there as reaumur said possibly one gnat in every hundred may be able to gratify its appetite for blood but of the gnats in many districts in south america it would be nearer the mark to say that only one in a hundred millions can ever do so  curtis discovered that only the female mosquito bites or sucks blood the male being without tongue or mandibles and he asks what then does the male feed on he conjectures that it feeds on flowers but had he visited some swampy places in hot countries where flowers are few and the insects more numerous than the sands on the seashore he would most probably have said that the males subsist on decaying vegetable matter and moisture of slime it is however more important to know what the female subsists on we know that she thirsts for warm mammalian blood that she seeks it with avidity and is provided with an admirable organ for its extractiononly unfortunately for her she does not get it or at all events the few happy individuals that do get it are swamped in the infinite multitude of those that are doomed by nature to total abstinence  i should like to know whether this belief of curtis shared by westwood and other distinguished entomologists but originally put forward merely as a conjecture has ever been tested by careful observation and experiment if not then it is strange that it should have crept into many important works where it is stated not as a mere guess but as an established fact thus van beneden in his work on parasites while classing female mosquitoes with his miserable wretches yet says if blood fails them they live like the males on the juices of flowers if this be so it is quite certain that the juices fail to satisfy them and that like dr tanner who was ravenously hungry during his forty days fast in spite of his frequent sips of water the mosquito still craves for something better than a cool vegetarian diet i cannot help thinking though the idea may seem fanciful that mosquitoes feed on nothing we know that the ephemerae take no refreshment in the imago state the mouth being aborted or atrophied in these shortlived creatures but we also know that they belong to an exceedingly ancient tribe and possibly after the earth had ceased to produce their proper nourishment there came in their history a long hungry period which did not kill them but lasted until their feeding instincts became obsolete the mouth lost its use and their life in its perfect state dwindled to its present length  in any case how unsatisfactory is the mosquitoes existence and what a curious position they occupy in nature let us suppose that owing to some great change in the conditions of the earth rapacious birds were no longer able to capture prey and that by a corresponding change in their organizations they were able to subsist on the air they breathed with perhaps an occasional green leaf and a sip of water and yet retained the old craving for solid food and the old predatory instincts and powers undiminished they would be in the position of mosquitoes in the imago state and if then fifty or a hundred individuals were to succeed every year in capturing something and making one hearty meal these few fortunate diners would bear about the same proportion to all the raptors on the globe as the mosquitoes that succeed in sucking blood to their unsuccessful fellows in the case of the hawks the effect of the few meals on the entire rapacious family or order would certainly be nil and it is impossible to believe for a moment that the comparatively infinitesimal amount of blood sucked by mosquitoes can serve to invigorate the species the wonder is that the machinery which accomplishes nothing should continue in such perfect working order  when we consider the insects delicate organ so admirably fitted for the purpose to which it is applied it becomes difficult to believe that it could have been so perfected except in a condition of things utterly unlike the present there must have been a time when mosquitoes found their proper nourishment and when warm mammalian blood was as necessary to their existence as honey is to that of the bee or insect food to the dragonfly  this applies to many bloodsucking insects besides mosquitoes and with special force to the tick tribes ixodes which swarm throughout central and south america for in these degraded spiders the whole body has been manifestly modified to fit it for a parasitical life while the habits of the insect during its blind helpless waiting existence on trees and its sudden great development when it succeeds in attaching itself to an animal body also point irresistibly to the same conclusion in the sunny uplands they act writes captain burton like the mosquitoes of the hot humid beiramar the nuisance is general it seems to be in the air every blade of grass has its colony clusters of hundreds adhere to the twigs myriads are found in the bush clumps lean and flat when growing to the leaves the tick catches man or beast brushing by fattens rapidly and at the endof a weeks good living drops off plena cruoris when on trees belt says they instinctively place themselves on the extreme tips of leaves and shoots with their hind legs stretching out each foot armed with two hooks or claws with which to lay hold of any animal brushing by during this wretched incomplete existence from which in most cases it is never destined to emerge its greatest length is about onefourth of an inch but where it fastens itself to an animal the abdomen increases to a globe as big as a mediumsized barcelona nut being silverygrey or white in colour it becomes when thus distended very conspicuous on any dark surface i have frequently seen black smoothhaired dogs with their coats turned into a perfect garden of these white spiderflowers or mushrooms the white globe is leathery and nothing can injure it and the poor beast cannot rub bite or scratch it off as it is anchored to his flesh by eight sets of hooks and a triangle of teeth  the ticks inhabiting regions rich in bird and insect life but with few mammals are in the same condition as mosquitoes as far as the supply of blood goes and like the mosquitoes they are compelled and able to exist without the nourishment best suited to them they are natures miserable castaways parasitical tribes lost in a great dry wilderness where no blood is and every marshborn mosquito piping of the hunger gnawing its vitals and every forest tick blindly feeling with its grapplingirons for the beast that never brushes by seems to tell us of a world peopled with gigantic forms mammalian and reptilian which once afforded abundant pasture to the parasite and which the parasite perhaps assisted to overthrow  it is almost necessary to transport oneself to the vast tickinfested wilderness of the new world to appreciate the full significance of a passage in belts naturalist in nicaragua in which it is suggested that mans hairless condition was perhaps brought about by natural selection in tropical regions where he was greatly troubled with parasites of this kind it is certain that if in such a country as brazil he possessed a hairy coat affording cover to the tick and enabling it to get a footing on the body his condition would be a very sad one savages abhor hairs on the body and even pluck them off their faces this seems like a survival of an ancient habit acquired when the whole body was clothed with hair and if primitive man ever possessed such a habit nature only followed his lead in giving him a hairless offspring  is it not also probable that the small amount of mammalian life in south america and the aquatic habits of nearly all the large animals in the warmer districts is due to the persecutions of the tick  the only way in which a large animal can rid itself of the pest is by going into the water or wallowing in the mud and this perhaps accounts for the more or less aquatic habits of the jaguar aguaráguazú the large cervus paluclosus tapir capybara and peccary monkeys which are most abundant are a notable exception but these animals have the habit of attending to each others skins and spend a great deal of their time in picking off the parasites but how do birds escape the ticks since these parasites do not confine their attacks to any one class of aninials but attach themselves impartially to any living thing coming within reach of their hooks from snake to man my own observations bearing on this point refer less to the ixodes than to the minute beterouge which is excessively abundant in the plata district where it is known as bicho colorado and in size and habits resembles the english leptus autumnalis it is so small that notwithstanding its bright scarlet colour it can only be discerned by bringing the eye close to it and being moreover exceedingly active and abundant in all shady places in summermaking life a misery to careless human beingsit must be very much more dangerous to birds than the larger sedentary ixodes the beterouge invariably lodges beneath the wings of birds where the loose scanty plumage affords easy access to the skin domestic birds suffer a great deal from its persecutions and their young if allowed to run about in shady places die of the irritation wild birds however seem to be very little troubled and most of those i have examined have been almost entirely free from parasites probably they are much more sensitive than the domestic birds and able to feel and pick off the insects with their beaks before they have penetrated into the skin i believe they are also able to protect themselves in another way namely by preventing the parasites from reaching their bodies at all i was out under the trees one day with a pet ovenbird furnarius rufus which had full liberty to range about at will and noticed that at short intervals it went through the motions of picking something from its toes or legs though i could see nothing on them at length i approached my eyes to within a few inches of the birds feet and discovered that the large dry branch on which it stood was covered with a multitude of parasites all running rapidly about like foraging ants and whenever one came to the birds feet it at once ran up the leg every time this happened so far as i could see the bird felt it and quickly and deftly picked it off with the point of its bill it seemed very astonishing that the horny covering of the toes and legs should be so exquisitely sensitive for the insects are so small and light that they cannot be felt on the hand even when a score of them are running over it but the fact is as i have stated and it is highly probable i think that most wild birds keep themselves free from these little torments in the same way  some observations of mine on a species of ornithomyiaa fly parasitical on birdsmight possibly be of use in considering the question of the anomalous position in nature of insects possessing the instincts and aptitudes of parasites and organs manifestly modified to suit a parasitical mode of life yet compelled and able to exist free feeding perhaps on vegetable juices or like the ephemerae on nothing at all for it must be borne in mind that i do not assert that these occasional or accidental parasites as some one calls them explaining nothing do not feed on such juices i do not know what they feed on i only know that the joyful alacrity with which gnats and stinging flies of all kinds abandon the leaves supposed to afford them pasture to attack a warmblooded animal serves to show how strong the impulse is and how ineradicable the instinct which must have had an origin perhaps the habits of the birdfly i have mentioned will serve to show how in some cases the free life of some bloodsucking flies and other insects might have originated  kirby and spence in their introduction mention that one or two species of ornithomyia have been observed flying about and alighting on men and in one case the fly extracted blood and was caught the species being thus placed beyond doubt this circumstance led the authors to believe that the insect when the bird it is parasitical on dies takes to flight and migrates from body to body occasionally tasting blood until coming to the right bodyto wit that of a bird or of a particular species of birdit once more establishes itself permanently in the plumage i fancy that the insect sometimes leads a freer life and ranges much more than the authors imagined and i refer to kirby and spence with apologies to those who regard the introduction as out of date only because i am not aware that we have any later observations on the subject  there is in la plata a small very common dendrocolaptine birdanumbius acuticaudatusmuch infested by an ornithomyia a pretty pale insect half the size of a housefly and elegantly striped with green it is a very large parasite for so small a bird yet so cunning and alert is it and so swiftly is it able to swim through the plumage that the bird is unable to rid itself of so undesirable a companion the bird lives with its mate all the year round much of the time with its grownup young in its nesta large structure in which so much buildingmaterial is used that the bird is called in the vernacular leñatero or firewoodgatherer on warm bright days without wind during the absence of the birds i have frequently seen a company of from half a dozen to a dozen or fifteen of the parasitical fly wheeling about in the air above the nest hovering and gambolling together just like houseflies in a room in summer but always on the appearance of the birds returning from their feedingground they would instantly drop down and disappear into the nest how curious this instinct seems the fly regards the bird which affords it the warmth and food essential to life as its only deadly enemy and with an inherited wisdom like that of the mosquito with regard to the dragonfly or of the horsefly with regard to the monedula wasp vanishes like smoke from its presence and only approaches the bird secretly from a place of concealment  the parasitical habit tends inevitably to degrade the species acquiring it dulling its senses and faculties especially those of sight and locomotion but the ornithomyia seems an exception its dependent life having had a contrary effect the extreme sensitiveness keenness of sight and quickness of the bird having reacted on the insect giving it a subtlety in its habits and motions almost without a parallel even among free insects a man with a bloodsucking flatbodied flying squirrel concealing itself among his clothing and gliding and dodging all over his body with so much artifice and rapidity as to defeat all efforts made to capturo it or knock it off would be a case parallel to that of the birdfly on the small bird it might be supposed that the firewoodgatherer like some ants that keep domestic pets makes a pet of the fly for it is a very pretty insect barred with green and with rainbow reflections on its wingsand birds are believed by some theorists to possess aesthetic tastes but the discomfort of having such a vampire on the body would i imagine be too great to allow a kindly instinct of that nature to grow up moreover i have on several occasions seen the bird making frantic efforts to capture one of the flies which had incautiously flown up from the nest at the wrong moment bird and fly seem to know each other wonderfully well  here then we have a parasitical insect specialized in the highest degree yet retaining all its pristine faculties unimpaired its love of liberty and of associating in numbers together for sportive exercises and well able to take care of itself during its free intervals and probably when thrown on the world as when nests are blown down or the birds get killed or change their quarters as they often do it is able to exist for some time without avian blood let us then imagine some of these orphaned colonies unable to find birds but through a slight change in habits or organization able to exist in the imago state without sucking blood until they laid their eggs and succeeding generations still better able to stand the altered conditions of life until they become practically independent like gnats multiplying greatly and disporting themselves in clouds over forests yet still retaining the old hunger for blood and the power to draw it and ready at any moment to return to the ancestral habit it might be said that if such a result were possible it would have occurred but that we find no insect like the ornithomyia existing independently with the birdfly it has not occurred as far as we know but in the past history of some independent parasites it is possible that something similar to the imaginary case i have sketched may have taken place the bushtick is a more highly specialized certainly a more degraded creature than the birdfly and the very fact of its existence seems to show that it is possible for even the lowest of the fallen race of parasites to start afresh in life under new conditions and to reascend in the scale of being although still bearing about it the marks of former degeneracy  the connection between the flea and the mammal it feeds on is even less close than that which exists between the ornithomyia and bird the fact that fleas are so common and universalfor in all lands we have them like the poor always with us and that they are found on all mammals from the king of beasts to the small modest mouseseems to show a great amount of variability and adaptiveness as well as a very high antiquity it has often been reported that fleas have been found hopping on the ground in desert places where they could not have been dropped by man or beast and it has been assumed that these independent fleas must like gnats and ticks subsist on vegetable juices there is no doubt that they are able to exist and propagate for one or two years after being deprived of their proper aliment houses shut up for a year or longer are sometimes found infested with them possibly in the absence of vegetable juices they flourish on dust i have never detected them hopping on the ground in uninhabited places although i once found them in patagonia in a hamlet which had been attacked and depopulated by the indians about twenty months before my visit on entering one of the deserted huts i found the floor literally swarming with fleas and in less than ten seconds my legs to the height of my knees were almost black with their numbers this proves that they are able toincrease greatly for a period without blood but i doubt that they can go on existing and increasing for an indefinite time perhaps their true position with regard to the parasitical habit is midway between that of the strict parasite which never leaves the body and that of independent parasites like the culex and the ixodes and all those which are able to exist free for ever and are parasitical only when the opportunity offers  entomologists regard the flea as a degraded fly certainly it is very much more degraded than the birdborne ornithomyia with its subtle motions and instinct its power of flight and social pastimes the poor pulex has lost every trace of wings nevertheless in its fallen condition it has developed some remarkable qualities and saltatory powers which give it a lower kind of glory and compared with another parasite with which it shares the human species it is almost a noble insect darwin has some remarks about the smallness of the brain of an ant assuming that this insect possesses a very high intelligence but i doubt very much that the ant which moves in a groove is mentally the superior of the unsocial flea the last is certainly the most teachable and if fleas were generally domesticated and made pets of probably there would be as many stories about their marvellous intelligence and fidelity to man as we now hear about our overpraised friend the dog  with regard to size the flea probably started on its downward course as a comparatively large insect probably larger than the ornithomyia that insect has been able to maintain its existence without dwindling like the leptus into a mere speck through the great modification in organs and instinct which adapt it so beautifully to the feathery element in which it moves the bushtick wingless from the beginning and diverging in another direction has probably been greatly increased in size by its parasitical habit this seems proven by the fact that as long as it is parasitical on nothing it remains small but when able to fasten itself to an animal it rapidly developes to a great size again the big globe of its abdomen is coriaceous and elastic and is probably as devoid of sensation as a ball of indiarubber the insect being made fast by hooks and teeth to its victim all efforts to remove it only increase the pain it causes and animals that know it well do not attempt to rub scratch or bite it off therefore the great size and the conspicuous colour of the tick are positive advantages to it the flea without the subtlety and highlyspecialized organs of the ornithomyia or the stickfast powers and leathery body of the ixodes can only escape its vigilant enemies by making itself invisible hence every variation ie increase in jumpingpower and diminished bulk tending towards this result has been taken advantage of by natural selection     chapter xi  humblebees and other matters   two humblebees bombus thoracicus and b violaceus are found on the pampas the first with a primrose yellow thorax and the extremity of the abdomen bright rufous slightly resembles the english b terrestris the rarer species which is a trifle smaller than the first is of a uniform intense black the body having the appearance of velvet the wings being of a deep violaceous blue  a census of the humblebees in any garden or field always shows that the yellow bees outnumber the black in the proportion of about seven to one and i have also found their nests for many years in the same proportion about seven nests of the yellow to one nest of the black species in habits they are almost identical and when two species so closely allied are found inhabiting the same locality it is only reasonable to infer that one possesses some advantage over the other and that the least favoured species will eventually disappear in this case where one so greatly outnumbers the other it might be thought that the rarer species is dying out or that on the contrary it is a newcomer destined to supplant the older more numerous species yet during the twenty years i have observed them there has occurred no change in their relative positions though both have greatly increased in numbers during that time owing to the spread of cultivation and yet it would scarcely be too much to expect some marked change in a period so long as that even through the slowworking agency of natural selection for it is not as if there had been an exact balance of power between them in the same period of time i have seen several species once common almost or quite disappear while others very low down as to numbers have been exalted to the first rank in insect life especially these changes have been numerous rapid and widespread  in the district where as a boy i chased and caught tinamous and also chased ostriches but failed to catch them the continued presence of our two humblebees sucking the same flowers and making their nests in the same situations has remained a puzzle to my mind  the site of the nest is usually a slight depression in the soil in the shelter of a cardoon bush the bees deepen the hollow by burrowing in the earth and when the spring foliage sheltering it withers up they construct a domeshaped covering of small sticks thorns and leaves bitten into extremely minute pieces they sometimes take possession of a small hole or cavity in the ground and save themselves the labour of excavation  their architecture closely resembles that of b terrestris they make rudelyshaped oval honeycells varying from half an inch to an inch and a half in length the smaller ones being the first made later in the season the old cocoons are utilized for storing honey the wax is chocolatecoloured and almost the only difference i can find in the economy of the two species is that the black bee uses a large quantity of wax in plastering the interior of its nest the eggcell of the yellow bee always contains from twelve to sixteen eggs that of the black bee from ten to fourteen and the eggs of this species are the largest though the bee is smallest at the entrance on the edge of the mound one bee is usually stationed and when approached it hums a shrill challenge and throws itself into a menacing attitude the sting is exceedingly painful  one summer i was so fortunate as to discover two nests of the two kinds within twelve yards of each other and i resolved to watch them very carefully in order to see whether the two species ever came into collision as sometimes happens with ants of different species living close together several times i saw a yellow bee leave its own nest and hover round or settle on the neighbouring one upon which the sentinel black bee would attack and drive it off one day while watching i was delighted to see a yellow bee actually enter its neighbours nest the sentinel being off duty in about five minutes time it came out again and flew away unmolested i concluded from this that humblebees like their relations of the hive occasionally plunder each others sweets on another occasion i found a black bee dead at the entrance of the yellow bees nest doubtless this individual had been caught in the act of stealing honey and after it had been stung to death it had been dragged out and left there as a warning to others with like felonious intentions  there is one striking difference between the two species the yellow bee is inodorous the black bee when angry and attacking emits an exceedingly powerful odour curiously enough this smell is identical in character with that made when angry by all the wasps of the south american genus peprisdark blue wasps with red wings this odour at first produces a stinging sensation on the nerve of smell but when inhaled in large measure becomes very nauseating on one occasion while i was opening a nest several of the bees buzzing round my head and thrusting their stings through the veil i wore for protection gave out so pungent a smell that i found it unendurable and was compelled to retreat  it seems strange that a species armed with a venomous sting and possessing the fierce courage of the humblebee should also have this repulsive odour for a protection it is in fact as incongruous as it would be were our soldiers provided with guns and swords first and after with phials of assafoatida to be uncorked in the face of an enemy  why or how animals came to be possessed of the power of emitting pestiferous odours is a mystery we only see that natural selection has in some mstances chiefly among insects taken advantage of it to furnish some of the weaker more unprotected species with a means of escape from their enemies the most stinking example i know is that of a large hairy caterpillar i have found on dry wood in patagonia and which when touched emits an intensely nauseous effluvium happily it is very volatile but while it lasts it is even more detestable than that of the skunk  the skunk itself offers perhaps the one instance amongst the higher vertebrates of an animal in which all the original instincts of selfpreservation have died out giving place to this lower kind of protection all the other members of the family it belongs to are cunning swift of foot and when overtaken fiercetempered and well able to defend themselves with their powerful wellarmed jaws  for some occult reason they are provided with a gland charged with a malodorous secretion and out of this mysterious liquor nature has elaborated the skunks inglorious weapon the skunk alone when attacked makes no attempt to escape or to defend itself by biting but thrown by its agitation into a violent convulsion involuntarily discharges its foetid liquor into the face of an opponent when this animal had once ceased to use so good a weapon as its teeth in defending itself degenerating at the same time into a slowmoving creature without fear and without cunning the strength and vileness of its odour would be continually increased by the cumulative process of natural selection and how effective the protection has become is shown by the abundance of the species throughout the whole american continent it is lucky for mankindespecially for naturalists and sportsmenthat other species have not been improved in the same direction  but what can we say of the common deer of the pampas cervus campestris the male of which gives out an effluvium quite as farreaching although not so abominable in character as that of the mephitis it comes in disagreeable whiffs to the human nostril when the perfumer of the wilderness is not even in sight yet it is not a protection on the contrary it is the reverse and like the dazzling white plumage so attractive to birds of prey a direct disadvantage informing all enemies for leagues around of its whereabouts it is not therefore strange that wherever pumas are found deer are never very abundant the only wonder is that like the ancient horse of america they have not become extinct  the gauchos of the pampas however give a reason for the powerful smell of the male deer and after some hesitation i have determined to set it down here for the reader to accept or reject as he thinks proper i neither believe nor disbelieve it for although i do not put great faith in gaucho natural history my own observations have not infrequently confirmed statements of theirs which a sceptical person would have regarded as wild indeed to give one instance i heard a gaucho relate that while out riding he had been pursued for a considerable distance by a large spider his hearers laughed at him for a romancer but as i myself had been attacked and pursued both when on foot and on horseback by a large wolfspider common on the pampas i did not join in the laugh they say that the effluvium of c campestris is abhorrent to snakes of all kinds just as pyrethrum powder is to most insects and even go so far as to describe its effect as fatal to them according to this the smell is therefore a protection to the deer in places where venomous snakes are extremely abundant as in the sierra district on the southern pampas of buenos ayres the gaucho frequently ties a strip of the male deers skin which retains its powerful odour for an indefinite time round the neck of a valuable horse as a protection it is certain that domestic animals are frequently lost here through snakebites the most common poisonous speciesthe craspedocephalus alternatus called vivora de la cruz in the vernacularhas neither bright colour nor warning rattle to keep off heavy hoofs and is moreover of so sluggish a temperament that it will allow itself to be trodden on before stirring with the result that its fangs are not infrequently struck into the nose or foot of browsing beast considering then the conditions in which c campestris is placedand it might also be supposed that venomous snakes have in past times been much more numerous than they are nowit is not impossible to believe that the powerful smell it emits has been made protective especially when we see in other species how repulsive odours have been turned to account by the principle of natural selection  after all perhaps the wild naturalist of the pampas knows what he is about when he ties a strip of deerskin to the neck of his steed and turns him loose to graze among the snakes  the gaucho also affirms that the deer cherishes a wonderful animosity against snakes that it becomes greatly excited when it sees one and proceeds at once to destroy it they say by running round and round it in a circle emitting its violent smell in larger measure until the snake dies of suffocation it is hard to believe that the effect can be so great but that the deer is a snake hater and killer is certainly true in north america ceylon and other districts deer have been observed excitedly leaping on serpents and killing them with their sharp cutting hoofs     chapter xii  a noble wasp  monedula punctata   naturalists like kings and emperors have their favourites and as my zoological sympathies which are wider than my knowledge embrace all classes of beings there are of course several insects for which i have a special regard a few in each of the principal orders my chief favourite among the hymenopteras is the one representative of the curious genus monedula known in la plata it is handsome and has original habits but it is specially interesting to me for another reason i can remember the time when it was extremely rare on the pampas so rare that in boyhood the sight of one used to be a great event to me and i have watched its rapid increase year by year till it has come to be one of our commonest species its singular habits and intelligence give it a still better claim to notice it is a big showy loudbuzzing insect with pink head and legs wings with brown reflections and body encircled with alternate bands of black and pale gold and has a preference for large composite flowers on the honey of which it feeds its young is however an insecteater but the monedula does not like other burrowing or sand wasps put away a store of insects or spiders partially paralyzed as a provision for the grub till it reaches the pupa state it actually supplies the grub with freshcaught insects as long as food is required killing the prey it captures outright and bringing it in to its young so that its habits in this particular are more bird than wasplike  the wasp lays its solitary egg at the extremity of a hole it excavates for itself on a bare hard piece of ground and many holes are usually found close together when the grubfor i have never been able to find more than one in a holehas come out from the egg the parent begins to bring in insects carefully filling up the mouth of the hole with loose earth after every visit without this precaution which entails a vast amount of labour i do not believe one grub out of every fifty would survive so overrun are these barren spots of ground used as breedingplaces with hunting spiders ants and tigerbeetles the grub is a voracious eater but the diligent mother brings in as much as it can devour i have often found as many as six or seven insects apparently fresh killed and not yet touched by the pampered little glutton coiled up in the midst of them waiting for an appetite  the monedula is an adroit flycatcher for though it kills numbers of fireflies and other insects flies are always preferred possibly because they are so little encumbered with wings and are also more easily devoured it occasionally captures insects on the wing but the more usual method is to pounce down on its prey when it is at rest at one time before i had learnt their habits i used frequently to be startled by two or three or more of these wasps rushing towards my face and continuing hovering before it loudly buzzing attending me in my walks about the fields the reason of this curious proceeding is that the monedula preys largely on stinging flies having learnt from experience that the stinging fly will generally neglect its own safety when it has once fastened on a good spot to draw blood from when a man or horse stands perfectly motionless the wasps take no notice but the moment any movement is made of hand tail or stamping hoof they rush to the rescue expecting to find a stinging fly on the other hand the horse has learnt to know and value this flyscourge and will stand very quietly with half a dozen loud avasps hovering in an alarming manner close to his head well knowing that every fly that settles on him will be instantly snatched away and that the boisterous monedula is a better protection even than the tailwhich by the way the horse wears very long in buenos ayres  i have in conclusion to relate an incident i onco witnessed and which does not show the monedula in a very amiable light i was leaning over a gate watching one of these wasps feeding on a sunflower a small leafcutting bee was hurrying about with its shrill busy hum in the vicinity and in due time came to the sunflower and settled on it the monedula became irritated possibly at the shrill voice and bustling manner of its neighbour and after watching it for a few moments on the flower deliberately rushed at and drove it off the leafcutter quickly returned howeverfor bees are always extremely averse to leaving a flower unexploredbut was again driven away with threats and demonstrations on the part of the monedula the little thing went off and sunned itself on a leaf for a time then returned to the flower only to be instantly ejected again other attempts were made but the big wasp now kept a jealous watch on its neighbours movements and would not allow it to come within several inches of the flower without throwing itself into a threatening attitude the defeated bee retired to sun itself once more apparently determined to wait for the big tyrant to go away but the other seemed to know what was wanted and spitefully made up its mind to stay where it was the leafcutter then gave up the contest suddenly rising up into the air it hovered hawklike above the monedula for a moment then pounced down on its back and clung there furiously biting until its animosity was thoroughly appeased then it flew off leaving the other master of the field certainly but greatly discomposed and perhaps seriously injured about the base of the wings i was rather surprised that they were not cut quite off for a leafcutting bee can use its teeth as deftly as a tailor can his shears  doubtless to bees as to men revenge is sweeter than honey but in the face of mental science can a creature as low down in the scale of organization as a leafcutting bee be credited with anything so intelligent and emotional as deliberate anger and revenge which implies the need of retaliation to satisfy the feelings of the person or bee offended according to bain mental and moral science only the highest animalsstags and bulls he mentionscan be credited with the developed form of anger which he describes as an excitement caused by pain reaching the centres of activity and containing an impulse knowingly to inflict suffering on another sentient being here if man only is meant the spark is perhaps accounted for but not the barrel of gunpowder the explosive material is however found in the breast of nearly every living creature the bullranking high according to bain though i myself should place him nearly on a level mentally with the majority of the lower animals both vertebrate and insectis capable of a wrath exceeding that of achilles and yet the fact that a red rag can manifestly have no associations personal or political for the bull shows how uniutcllectual his anger must be another instance of misdirected anger in nature not quite so familiar as that of the bull and red rag is used as an illustration by one of the prophets my heritage is unto me as a speckled bird the birds round about are against it i have frequently seen the birds of a thicket gather round some singularly marked accidental visitor and finally drive him with great anger from the neighbourhood possibly association comes in a little here since any bird even a small one strikingly coloured or marked might be looked on as a bird of prey  the fleshfly laying its eggs on the carrionflower is only a striking instance of the mistakes all instincts are liable to never more markedly than in the inherited tendency to fits of frenzied excitement the feeling is frequently excited by the wrong object and explodes at inopportune moments     chapter xiii  natures night lights  remarks about fireflies and other matters   it was formerly supposed that the light of the firefly in any family possessing the luminous power was a safeguard against the attacks of other insects rapacious and nocturnal in their habits this was kirby and spences notion but it might just as well be plinys for all the attention it would receive from modern entomologists just at present any observer who lived in the predarwin days is regarded as one of the ancients the reasons given for the notion or theory in the celebrated introduction to entomology were not conclusive nevertheless it was not an improbable supposition of the authors while the theory which has taken its place in recent zoological writings seems in every way even less satisfactory  let us first examine the antiquated theory as it must now be called by bringing a raptorial insect and a firefly together we find that the flashing light of the latter does actually scare away the former and is therefore for the moment a protection as effectual as the campfire the traveller lights in a district abounding with beasts of prey notwithstanding this fact and assuming that we have here the whole reason of the existence of the lightemitting power a study of the fireflys habits compels us to believe that the insect would be just as well off without the power as with it probably it experiences some pleasure in emitting flashes of light during its evening pastimes but this could scarcely be considered an advantage in its struggle for existence and it certainly does not account for the possession of the faculty  about the habits of pyrophorus the large tropical firefly which has the seat of its luminosity on the upper surface of the thorax nothing definite appears to be known but it has been said that this instinct is altogether nocturnal the pyrophorus is only found in the subtropical portion of the argentine country and i have never met with it with the widelyseparated cratomorphus and the tortoiseshaped aspisoma which emit the light from the abdomen i am familiar one species of cratomorphusa long slender insect with yellow wingcases marked with two parallel black linesis the firefly known to every one and excessively abundant in the southern countries of la plata this insect is strictly diurnal in its habitsas much so in fact as diurnal butterflies they are seen flying about wooing their mates and feeding on composite and umbelliferous flowers at all hours of the day and are as active as wasps during the full glare of noon birds do not feed on them owing to the disagreeable odour resembling that of phosphorus they emit and probably because they are to be uneatable but their insect enemies are not so squeamish and devour them readily just as they also do the blisterfly which one would imagine a morsel fitted to disagree with any stomach one of their enemies is the monedula wasp another a fly of the rapacious asilidas family and this fly is also a wasp in appearance having a purple body and bright red wings like a pepris and this mimetic resemblance doubtless serves it as a protection against birds a majority of raptorial insects are however nocturnal and from all these enemies that go about under cover of night the firefly as kirby and spence rightly conjectured protects itself or rather is involuntarily protected by means of its frequent flashing light we are thus forced to the conclusion that while the common house fly and many other diurnal insects spend a considerable portion of the daylight in purely sportive exercises the firefly possessing in its light a protection from nocturnal enemies puts off its pastimes until the evening then when its carnival of two or three hours duration is over retires also to rest putting out its candle and so exposing itself to the dangers which surround other diurnal species during the hours of darkness i have spoken of the fireflys pastimes advisedly for i have really never been able to detect it doing anything in the evening beyond flitting aimlessly about like house flies in a room hovering and revolving in company by the hour apparently for amusement thus the more closely we look at the facts the more unsatisfactory does the explanation seem that the firefly should have become possessed of so elaborate a machinery producing incidentally such splendid results merely as a protection against one set of enemies for a portion only of the period during which they are active is altogether incredible  the current theory which we owe to belt is a prettier one certain insects also certain batrachians reptiles c are unpalatable to the rapacious kinds it is therefore a direct advantage to these unpalatable species to be distinguishable from all the persecuted and the more conspicuous and wellknown they are the less likely are they to be mistaken by birds insectivorous mammals c for eatable kinds and caught or injured hence we find that many such species have acquired for their protection very brilliant or stronglycontrasted colourswarning colourswhich insecteaters come to know  the firefly a softbodied slowflying insect is easily caught and injured but it is not fit for food and therefore says the theory lest it should be injured or killed by mistake it has a fiery spark to warn enemiesbirds bats and rapacious insectsthat it is uneatable  the theory of warning colours is an excellent one but it has been pushed too far we have seen that one of the most common fireflies is diurnal in habits or at any rate that it performs all the important business of its life by day when it has neither bright colour nor light to warn its bird enemies and out of every hundred species of insecteating birds at least ninetynine are diurnal raptorial insects as i have said feed freely on fireflies so that the supposed warning is not for them and it would be hard to believe that the magnificent display made by luminous insects is useful only in preventing accidental injuries to them from a few crepuscular bats and goatsuckers and to believe even this we should first have to assume that bats and goatsuckers are differently constituted from all other creatures for in other animalsinsects birds and mammaliansthe appearance of fire by night seems to confuse and frighten but it certainly cannot be said to warn in the sense in which that word is used when we speak of the brilliant colours of some butterflies or even of the gestures of some venomous snakes and of the sounds they emit  thus we can see that while the old theory of kirby and spence had some facts to support it the one now in vogue is purely fanciful until some better suggestion is made it would perhaps be as well to consider the luminous organ as having no very close and direct relation to present habits of life about their present habits however especially their crepuscular habits there is yet much to learn one thing i have observed in them has always seemed very strange to me occasionally an individual insect is seen shining with a very large and steady light or with a light which very gradually decreases and increases in power and at such times it is less active than at others remaining for long intervals motionless on the leaves or moving with a very slow flight in south america a firefly displaying this abnormal splendour is said to be dying and it is easy to imagine how such a notion originated the belief is however erroneous for sometimes on very rare occasions all the insects in one place are simultaneously affected in the same way and at such times they mass themselves together in myriads as if for migration or for some other great purpose mr biggwither in south brazil and dalbertis in new guinea noticed these firefly gatherings i also once had the rare good fortune to witness a phenomenon of the kind on a very grand scale riding on the pampas one dark evening an hour after sunset and passing from high ground overgrown with giant thistles to a low plain covered with long grass bordering a stream of water i found it all ablaze with myriads of fireflies i noticed that all the insects gave out an exceptionally large brilliant light which shone almost steadily the long grass was thickly studded with them while they literally swarmed in the air all moving up the valley with a singularly slow and languid flight when i galloped down into this river of phosphorescent fire my horse plunged and snorted with alarm i succeeded at length in quieting him and then rode slowly through compelled to keep my mouth and eyes closed so thickly did the insects rain on to my face the air was laden with the sickening phosphorous smell they emit but when i had once got free of the broad fiery zone stretching away on either hand for miles along the moist valley i stood still and gazed back for some time on a scene the most wonderful and enchanting i have ever witnessed  the fascinating and confusing effect which the appearance of fire at night has on animals is a most interesting subject and although it is not probable that anything very fresh remains to be said about it i am tempted to add here the results of my own experience  when travelling by night i have frequently been struck with the behaviour of my horse at the sight of natural fire or appearance of fire always so different from that caused by the sight of fire artificially created the steady gleam from the open window or door of a distant house or even the unsteady windtossed flame of some lonely campfire has only served to rouse a fresh spirit in him and the desire to reach it whereas those infrequent displays of fire which nature exhibits such as lightning or the ignis fatuus or even a cloud of fireflies has always produced a disquieting effect experience has evidently taught the domestic horse to distinguish a light kindled by man from all others and knowing its character he is just as well able as his rider to go towards it without experiencing that confusion of mind caused by a glare in the darkness the origin and nature of which is a mystery the artificiallylighted fire is to the horse only the possible goal of the journey and is associated with the thought of rest and food wild animals as a rule at any rate in thinlysettled districts do not know the meaning of any fire it only excites curiosity and fear in them and they are most disturbed at the sight of fires made by man which are brighter and steadier than most natural fires we can understand this sensation in animals since we ourselves experience a similar one although in a less degree and not associated with fear in the effect which mere brightness has on us both by day and night  on riding across the monotonous grey patagonian uplands where often for hours one sees not the faintest tinge of bright colour the intense glowing crimson of a cactusfruit or the broad shining white bosom of the patagonian eaglebuzzard buteo erythronotus perched on the summit of a distant bush has had a strangely fascinating effect on me so that i have been unable to take my eyes off it as long as it continued before me or in passing through extensive desolate marshes the dazzling white plumage of a stationary egret has exercised the same attraction at night we experience the sensation in a greater degree when the silver sheen of the moon makes a broad path on the water or when a meteor leaves a glowing track across the sky while a still more familiar instance is seen in the powerful attraction on the sight of glowing embers in a darkened room the mere brightness or vividness of the contrast fascinates the mind but the effect on man is comparatively weak owing to his fiery education and to his familiarity with brilliant dyes artificially obtained from nature how strong this attraction of mere brightness even where there is no mystery about it is to wild animals is shown by birds of prey almost invariably singling out white or brightplumaged birds for attack where bright and sobercoloured kinds are mingled together by night the attraction is immeasurably greater than by day and the light of a fire steadily gazed at quickly confuses the mind the fires which travellers make for their protection actually serve to attract the beasts of prey but the confusion and fear caused by the bright glare makes it safe for the traveller to lie down and sleep in the light mammals do not lose their heads altogether because they are walking on firm ground where muscular exertion and an exercise of judgment are necessary at every step whereas birds floating buoyantly and with little effort through the air are quickly bewildered incredible numbers of migratory birds kill themselves by dashing against the windows of lighthouses on bright moonlight nights the voyagers are comparatively safe but during dark cloudy weather the slaughter is very great over six hundred birds were killed by striking a lighthouse in central america in a single night on insects the effect is the same as on the higher animals on the ground they are attracted by the light but keep like wolves and tigers at a safe distance from it when rushing through the air and unable to keep their eyes from it they fly into it or else revolve about it until coming too close their wings are singed  i find that when i am on horseback going at a swinging gallop a bright light affects me far more powerfully than when i am trudging along on foot a person mounted on a bicycle and speeding over a level plain on a dark night with nothing to guide him except the idea of the direction in his mind would be to some extent in the position of the migratory bird an exceptionally brilliant ignis fatuus flying before him would affect him as the gleam of a lamp placed high above the surface affects the migrants he would not be able to keep his eyes from it but would quickly lose the sense of direction and probably end his career much as the bird does by breaking his machine and perhaps his bones against some unseen obstruction in the way      chapter xiv  facts and thoughts about spiders   some time ago while turning over a quantity of rubbish in a littleused room i disturbed a large black spider rushing forth just in time to save itself from destruction through the capsizing of a pile of books it paused for one moment took a swift comprehensive glance at the position then scuttled away across the floor and was lost in an obscure corner of the room this incident served to remind me of a fact i was nearly forgetting that england is not a spiderless country a foreigner however intelligent coming from warmer regions might very easily make that mistake in buenos ayres the land of my nativity earth teems with these interesting little creatures they abound in and on the water they swarm in the grass and herbage which everywhere glistens with the silvery veil they spin over it indeed it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that there is an atmosphere of spiders for they are always floating about invisible in the air their filmy threads are unfelt when they fly against you and often enough you are not even aware of the little arrested aeronaut hurrying over your face with feet lighter than the lightest thistledown  it is somewhat strange that although where other tribes of living creatures are concerned i am something of a naturalist spiders i have always observed and admired in a nonscientific spirit and this must be my excuse for mentioning the habits of some spiders without giving their specific namesan omission always vexing to the severelytechnical naturalist they have ministered to the love of the beautiful the grotesque and the marvellous in me but i have never collected a spider and if i wished to preserve one should not know how to do it i have been familiar with the face of these monsters so long that i have even learnt to love them and i believe that if emerson rightly predicts that spiders are amongst the things to be expelled from earth by the perfected man of the future then a great charm and element of interest will be lost to nature though loving them i cannot of course feel the same degree of affection towards all the members of so various a family the fairy gossamer scarce seen a creature of wind and sunshine the gemlike epeira in the centre of its starry web even the terrestrial salticus with its pumalike strategy certainly appeal more to our aesthetic feelings than does the slow heavy mygale looking at a distance of twenty yards away as he approaches you like a gigantic cockroach mounted on stilts the rash fury with which the female wolfspider defends her young is very admirable but the admiration she excites is mingled with other feelings when we remember that the brave mother proves to her consort a cruel and cannibal spouse  possibly my affection for spiders is due in a great measure to the compassion i have always felt for them pity tis said is akin to love and who can help experiencing that tender emotion that considers the heavy affliction nature has laid on the spiders in compensation for the paltry drop of venom with which she unasked endowed them and here of course i am alluding to the wasps these insects with a refinement of cruelty prefer not to kill their victims outright but merely maim them then house them in cells where the grubs can vivisect them at leisure this is one of those revolting facts the fastidious soul cannot escape from in warm climates for in and out of open windows and doors all day long all the summer through comes the busy beautiful masonwasp a long body wonderfully slim at the waist bright yellow legs and thorax and a dark crimson abdomenwhat object can be prettier to look at but in her life this wasp is not beautiful at home in summer they were the pests of my life for nothing would serve to keep them out one day while we were seated at dinner a clay nest which a wasp had succeeded in completing unobserved detached itself from the ceiling and fell with a crash on to the table where it was shattered to pieces scattering a shower of green halfliving spiders round it i shall never forget the feeling of intense repugnance i experienced at the sight coupled with detestation of the pretty but cruel little architect there is amongst our wasps even a more accomplished spiderscourge than the masonwasp and i will here give a brief account of its habits on the grassy pampas dry bare spots of soil are resorted to by a class of spiders that either make or take little holes in the ground to reside in and from which they rush forth to seize their prey they also frequently sit inside their dens and patiently wait there for the intrusion of some bungling insect now in summer to a dry spot of ground like this comes a small wasp scarcely longer than a bluebottle fly body and wings of a deep shining purplish blue colour with only a white mark like a collar on the thorax it flirts its blue wings hurrying about here and there and is extremely active and of a slender graceful figurethe type of an assassin it visits and explores every crack and hole in the ground and if you watch it attentively you will at length see it on arriving at a hole give a little start backwards it knows that a spider lies concealed within presently having apparently matured a plan of attack it disappears into the hole and remains there for some time then just when you are beginning to think that the little blue explorer has been trapped out it rushes flying in terror apparently from the spider who issues close behind in hot pursuit but before they are three inches away from the hole quick as lightning the wasp turns on its follower and the two become locked together in a deadly embrace looking like one insect they spin rapidly round for a few moments then up springs the waspvictorious the wretched victim is not dead its legs move a little but its soft body is paralyzed and lies collapsed flabby and powerless as a stranded jellyfish and this is the invariable result of every such conflict in other classes of beings even the weakest hunted thing occasionally succeeds in inflicting pain on its persecutor and the small trembling mouse unable to save itself can sometimes make the cat shriek with paiu but there is no weak spot in the wasps armour no fatal error of judgment not even an accident ever to save the wretched victim from its fate and now comes the most iniquitous part of the proceeding when the wasp has sufficiently rested after the struggle it deliberately drags the disabled spider back into its own hole and having packed it away at the extremity lays an egg alongside of it then coming out again gathers dust and rubbish with which it fills up and obliterates the hole and having thus concluded its machiavellian task it flies cheerfully off in quest of another victim  the extensive epeira family supply the masonwasps and other spiderkillers with the majority of their victims these spiders have soft plump succulent bodies like pats of butter they inhabit trees and bushes chiefly where their geometric websbetray their whereabouts they are timid comparatively innocuous and reluctant to quit the shelter of their green bower made of a rolledup leaf so that there are many reasons why they should be persecuted they exhibit a great variety of curious forms many are also very richly coloured but even their brightest huesorange silver scarlethave not been given without regard to the colouring of their surroundings greenleafed bushes arc frequented by vividly green epeiras but the imitative resemblance does not quite end here the green spiders method of escape when the bush is roughly shaken is to drop itself down on the earth where it lies simulating death in falling it drops just as a green leaf would drop that is not quite so rapidly as a round solid body like a beetle or spider now in the bushes there is another epeira in size and form like the last but differing in colour for instead of a vivid green it is of a faded yellowish whitethe exact hue of a dead driedup leaf this spider when it lets itself dropfor it has the same protective habit as the otherfalls not so rapidly as a green freshly broken off leaf or as the green spider would fall but with a slower motion precisely like a leaf withered up till it has become almost light as a feather it is not difficult to imagine how this comes about either a thicker line or a greater stiffness or tenacity of the viscid fluid composing the web and attached to the point the spider drops from causes one to fall slower than the other but how many tentative variations in the stiffness of the web material must there have been before the precise degree was attained enabling the two distinct species differing in colour to complete their resemblance to falling leavesa fresh green leaf in one case and a dead withered leaf in the other  the tetragnathaa genus of the epeira family and known also in englandare small spiders found on the margin of streams their bodies are slender oblong and resembling a canoe in shape and when they sit lengthwise on a stem or blade of grass their long hairlike legs arranged straight before and behind them it is difficult to detect them so closely do they resemble a discoloured stripe on the herbage a species of tetragnatha with a curious modification of structure abounds on the pampas the long leg of this spider is no thicker than a bristle from a pigs back but at the extremity it is flattened and broad giving it a striking resemblance to an oar these spiders are only found in herbage overhanging the borders of streams they are very numerous and having a pugnacious temper are incessantly quarrelling and it frequently happens that in these encounters or where they are pursuing each other through the leaves they drop into the water below i believe in fact that they often drop themselves purposely into it as the readiest means of escape when hard pressed when this happens the advantage of the modified structure of the legs is seen the fallen spider sitting boatlike on the surface throws out its long legs and dipping the broad ends into the water literally rows itself rapidly to land  the gossamerspider most spiritual of living things of which there are numerous species some extremely beautiful in colouring and markings is the most numerous of our spiders only when the declining sun flings a broad track of shiny silver light on the plain does one get some faint conception of the unnumbered millions of these buoyant little creatures busy weaving their gauzy veil over the earth and floating unseen like an ethereal vital dust in the atmosphere  this spider carries within its diminutive abdomen a secret which will possibly serve to vex subtle intellects for a long time to come for it is hard to believe that merely by mechanical force even aided by currents of air a creature half as big as a barley grain can instantaneously snoot out filaments twenty or thirty inches long and by means of which it floats itself in the air  naturalists are now giving a great deal of attention to the migrations of birds in different parts of the world might not insect and spider migrations be included with advantage to science in their observations the common notion is that the gossamer makes use of its unique method of locomotion only to shift its quarters impelled by want of food or unfavourable conditionsperhaps only by a roving disposition i believe that besides these incessant flittings about from place to place throughout the summer the gossamerspiders have great periodical migrations which are as a rule invisible since a single floating web cannot be remarked and each individual rises and floats away by itself from its own locality when influenced by the instinct when great numbers of spiders rise up simultaneously over a large area then sometimes the movement forces itself on our attention for at such times the whole sky may be filled with visible masses of floating web all the great movements of gossamers i have observed have occurred in the autumn or at any rate several weeks after the summer solstice and like the migrations of birds at the same season of the year have been in a northerly direction i do not assert or believe that the migratory instinct in the gossamer is universal in a moist island like england for instance where the condition of the atmosphere is seldom favourable and where the little voyagers would often be blown by adverse winds to perish far out at sea it is difficult to believe that such migrations take place but where they inhabit a vast area of land as in south america extending without interruption from the equator to the cold magellanic regions and where there is a long autumn of dry hot weather then such an instinct as migration might have been developed for this is not a faculty merely of a few birds the impulse to migrate at certain seasons affects birds insects and even mammals in a few birds only is it highly developed but the elementary feeling out of which the wonderful habit of the swallow has grown exists widely throughout animated nature on the continent of europe it also seems probable that a great autumnal movement of these spiders takes place although i must confess i have no grounds for this statement except that the floating gossamer is called in germany der fliegender summerthe flying or departing summer  i have stated that all migrations of gossamers i have witnessed have been in the autumn excepting in one instance these flights occurred when the weather was still hot and dry the exceptionally late migration was on march 22a full month after the departure of martins hummingbirds flycatchers and most other true birdmigrants it struck me as being so remarkable and seems to lend so much force to the idea i have suggested that i wish to give here an exact copy of the entries made at the time and on the spot in my notebook  march 22 this afternoon while i was out shooting the gossamerspiders presented an appearance quite new to me walking along a stream the conchitas near buenos ayres i noticed a broad white line skirting the low wet ground this i found was caused by gossamer web lying in such quantities over the earth as almost to hide the grass ad thistles under it the white zone was about twenty yards wide and outside it only a few scattered webs were visible on the grass its exact length i did not ascertain but followed it for about two miles without finding the end the spiders were so numerous that they continually baulked one another in their efforts to rise in the air as soon as one threw out its lines they would become entangled with those of another spider lanced out at the same moment both spiders would immediately seem to know the cause of the trouble for as soon as their lines fouled they would rush angrily towards each other each trying to drive the other from the elevation notwithstanding these difficulties numbers were continually floating off on the breeze which blew from the south  i noticed three distinct species one with a round scarlet body another velvet black with large square cephalothorax and small pointed abdomen the third and most abundant kind were of different shades of olive green and varied greatly in size the largest being fully a quarter of an inch in length apparently these spiders had been driven up from the low ground along the stream where it was wet and had congregated along the borders of the dry ground in readiness to migrate  25th went again to visit the spiders scarcely expecting to find them as since first seeing them we have had much wind and rain to my surprise i found them in greatly increased numbers on the tops of cardoons posts and other elevated situations they were literally lying together in heaps most of them were large and of the olivecoloured species their size had probably prevented them from getting away earlier but they were now floating off in great numbers the weather being calm and tolerably dry today i noticed a new species with a grey body elegantly striped with black and pink legsa very pretty spider  26th went again today and found that the whole vast army of gossamers with the exception of a few stragglers sitting on posts and dry stalks had vanished they had taken advantage of the short spell of fine weather we are now having after an unusually wet and boisterous autumn to make their escape  here it seemed to me that a conjunction of circumstancesfirst the unfavourable season preventing migration at the proper time and secondly the strip of valley out of which the spiders had been driven to the higher ground till they were massed togetheronly served to make visible and evident that a vast annual migration takes place which we have only to look closely for to discover  one of the most original spiders in buenos ayresmentally original i meanis a species of pholcus a quiet inoffensive creature found in houses and so abundant that they literally swarm where they are not frequently swept away from ceilings and obscure corners certainly it seems a poor spider after the dynamical and migratory gossamer but it happens curiously enough that a study of the habits of this dusty domestic creature leads us incidentally into the realms of fable and romance it is remarkable for the extreme length of its legs and resembles in colour and general appearance a crane fly but is double the size of that insect it has a singular method of protecting itself when attacked or approached even gathering its feet together and fastening them to the centre of its web it swings itself round and round with the velocity of a whirligig so that it appears like a mist on the web offering no point for an enemy to strike at when a fly is captured the spider approaches it cautiously and spins a web round it continually narrowing the circle it describes until the victim is inclosed in a cocoonlike covering this is a common method with spiders but the intelligencefor i can call it by no other wordof the pholcus has supplemented this instinctive procedure with a very curious and unique habit the pholcus in spite of its size is a weak creature possessing little venom to despatch its prey with so that it makes a long and laborious task of killing a fly a fly when caught in a web is a noisy creature and it thus happens that when the daddylonglegsas angloargentines have dubbed this speciessucceeds in snaring a captive the shrill outrageous cries of the victim are heard for a long timeoften for ten or twelve minutes this noise greatly excites other spiders in the vicinity and presently they are seen quitting their webs and flurrying to the scene of conflict sometimes the captor is driven off and then the strongest or most daring spider carries away the fly but where a large colony are allowed to continue for a long time in undisturbed possession of a ceiling when one has caught a fly he proceeds rapidly to throw a covering of web over it then cutting it away drops it down and lets it hang suspended by a line at a distance of two or three feet from the ceiling the other spiders arrive on the scene and after a short investigation retreat to their own webs and when the coast is clear our spider proceeds to draw up the captive fly which is by this time exhausted with its struggles  now i have repeatedly remarked that all spiders when the shrill humming of an insect caught in a web is heard near them become agitated like the pholcus and will in the same way quit their own webs and hurry to the point the sound proceeds from this fact convinced me many years ago that spiders are attracted by the sound of musical instruments such as violins concertinas guitars c simply because the sound produces the same effect on them as the shrill buzzing of a captive fly i have frequently seen spiders come down walls or from ceilings attracted by the sound of a guitar softly played and by gently touching metal strings stretched on a piece of wood i have succeeded in attracting spiders on to the strings within two or three inches of my fingers and i always noticed that the spiders seemed to be eagerly searching for something which they evidently expected to find there moving about in an excited manner and looking very hungry and fierce i have no doubt that pelissons historical spider in the bastille came down in a mood and with a manner just as ferocious when the prisoner called it with musical sounds to be fed  the spiders i have spoken of up till now are timid inoffensive creatures chiefly of the epeira family but there are many others exceedingly highspirited and like some of the most touchy hymenopteras always prepared to greatly quarrel over matters of little moment the mygales of which we have several species are not to be treated with contempt one is extremely abundant on the pampas the mygale fusca a veritable monster covered with dark brown hair and called in the vernacular aranea peludahairy spider in the hot month of december these spiders take to roaming about on the open plain and are then everywhere seen travelling in a straight line with a slow even pace they are very great in attitudes and when one is approached it immediately throws itself back like a pugilist preparing for an encounter and stands up so erect on its four hind feet that the under surface of its body is displayed humblebees are commonly supposed to carry the palm in attitudinizing and it is wonderful to see the grotesque motions of these irascible insects when their nest is approached elevating their abdomens and two or three legs at a time so that they resemble a troupe of acrobats balancing themselves on their heads or hands and kicking their legs about in the air and to impress the intruder with the dangerous significance of this display they hum a shrill warning or challenge and stab at the air with their naked stings from which limpid drops of venom are seen to exude these threatening gestures probably have an effect in the case of the hairy spider i do not think any creature however stupid could mistake its meaning when it stands suddenly up a figure horribly grotesque then dropping down on all eights charges violently forwards their long shiny black sickleshaped falces are dangerous weapons i knew a native woman who had been bitten on the leg and who after fourteen years still suffered at intervals acute pains in the limb  the king of the spiders on the pampas is however not a mygale but a lycosa of extraordinary size light grey in colour with a black ring round its middle it is active and swift and irritable to such a degree that one can scarcely help thinking that in this species nature has overshot her mark  when a person passes near onesay within three or four yards of its lurkingplaceit starts up and gives chase and will often follow for a distance of thirty or forty yards i came once very nearly being bitten by one of these savage creatures riding at an easy trot over the dry grass i suddenly observed a spider pursuing me leaping swiftly along and keeping up with my beast i aimed a blow with my whip and the point of the lash struck the ground close to it when it instantly leaped upon and ran up the lash and was actually within three or four inches of my hand when i flung the whip from me  the gauchos have a very quaint ballad which tells that the city of cordova was once invaded by an army of monstrous spiders and that the townspeople went out with beating drums and flags flying to repel the invasion and that after firing several volleys they were forced to turn and fly for their lives i have no doubt that a sudden great increase of the manchasing spiders in a year exceptionally favourable to them suggested this fable to some rhyming satirist of the town  in conclusion of this part of my subject i will describe a single combat of a very terrible nature i once witnessed between two little spiders belonging to the same species one had a small web against a wall and of this web the other coveted possession after vainly trying by a series of strategic movements to drive out the lawful owner it rushed on to the web and the two envenomed httle duellists closed in mortal combat they did nothing so vulgar and natural as to make use of their falces and never once actually touched each other but the fight was none the less deadly rapidly revolving about or leaping over or passing under each other each endeavoured to impede or entangle his adversary and the dexterity with which each avoided the cunningly thrown snare trying at the same time to entangle its opponent was wonderful to see at length after this equal battle had raged for some time one of the combatants made some fatal mistake and for a moment there occurred a break in his motions instantly the other perceived his advantage and began leaping backwards and forwards across his struggling adversary with such rapidity as to confuse the sight producing the appearance of two spiders attacking a third one lying between them he then changed his tactics and began revolving round and round his prisoner and very soon the poor vanquished wretchthe aggressor let us hope in the interests of justicewas closely wrapped in a silvery cocoon which unlike the cocoon the caterpillar weaves for itself was also its windingsheet  in the foregoing pages i have thrown together some of the most salient facts i have noted but the spiderworld still remains to me a wonderland of which i know comparatively nothing nor is any very intimate knowledge of spiders to be got from books though numberless lists of new species are constantly being printed for they have not yet had like the social bees and ants many loving and patient chroniclers of their ways the hubens and lubbocks have been many the moggridges few but even a very slight study of these most versatile and accomplished of natures children gives rise to some interesting reflections one fact that strikes the mind very forcibly is the worldwide distribution of groups of species possessing highly developed instincts one is the zebrastriped salticus with its unique strategythat is to say unique amongst spiders it is said that the australian savage approaches a kangaroo in the open by getting up in sight of its prey and standing perfectly motionless till he is regarded as an inanimate object and every time the animals attention wanders advancing a step or two until sufficiently near to hurl his spear the salticus approaches a fly in the same manner till near enough to make its spring another is the trapdoor spider another the dolomedes that runs over the surface of the water in pursuit of its prey and dives down to escape from its enemies and strangest of all the argyroneta that has its luminous dwelling at the bottom of streams and just as a mason carries bricks and mortar to its building so does this spider carry down bubbles of air from the surface to enlarge its mysterious house in which it lays its eggs and rears its young community of descent must be supposed of species having such curious and complex instincts but how came these feeble creatures unable to transport themselves over seas and continents like the aerial gossamer to be so widely distributed and inhabiting regions with such different conditions this can only be attributed to the enormous antiquity of the species and of this antiquity the earliness in which the instinct manifests itself in the young spiders is taken as evidence  a more important matter the intelligence of spiders has not yet received the attention it deserves the question of insect intelligencenaturalists are agreed that insects do possess intelligenceis an extremely difficult one probably some of our conclusions on this matter will have to be reconsidered for instance we regard the order hymenoptera as the most intelligent because most of the social insects are included in it but it has not yet been proved probably never will be proved that the social instincts resulted from intelligence which has lapsed whether ants and bees were more intelligent than other insects during the early stages of their organic societies or not it will hardly be disputed by any naturalist who has observed insects for long that many solitary species display more intelligence in their actions than those that live in communities  the nature of the spiders food and the difficulties in the way of providing for their wants impose on them a life of solitude hunger perpetual watchfulness and the sense of danger have given them a character of mixed ferocity and timidity but these very conditions which have made it impossible for them to form societies like some insects and progress to a state of things resembling civilization in men have served to develop the mind that is in a spider making of him a very clever barbarianthe spiders only weapon of defencehis falcesare as poor a protection against the assaults of his insect foes as are teeth and fingernails in man employed against wolves bears and tigers and the spider is here even worse off than man since his enemies are winged and able to sweep down instantly on him from above they are also protected with an invulnerable shield and are armedwith deadly stings like man also the spider has a soft unprotected body while his muscular strength compared with that of the insects he has to contend with is almost nil his position in nature then with relation to his enemies is like that of man only the spider has this disadvantage that he cannot combine with others for protection that he does protect himself and maintains his place in nature is due not to special instincts which are utterly insufficient but to the intelligence which supplements them at the same time this superior cunning is closely related with and probably results indirectly from the web he is provided with and which is almost of the nature of an artificial aid let us take the imaginary case of a manlike monkey or of an arboreal man born with a cord of great length attached to his waist which could be either dragged after him or carried in a coil after many accidents experience would eventually teach him to put it to some use practice would make him more and more skilful in handling it and indirectly it would be the means of developing his latent mental faculties he would begin by using it as the monkey does its prehensile tail to swing himself from branch to branch and finally to escape from an enemy or in pursuit of his prey he would be able by means of his cord to drop himself with safety from the tallest trees or fly down the steepest precipices he would coil up his cord to make a bed to lie on and also use it for binding branches together when building himself a refuge in a close fight he would endeavour to entangle an adversary and at last he would learn to make a snare with it to capture his prey to all these and to a hundred other uses the spider has put his web and when we see him spread his beautiful geometric snare held by lines fixed to widely separated points while he sits concealed in his weblined retreat amongst the leaves where every touch on the farreaching structure is telegraphed to him by the communicating line faithfully as if a nerve had been touched we must admire the wonderful perfection to which he has attained in the use of his cord by these means he is able to conquer creatures too swift and strong for him and make them his prey when we see him repairing damages weighting his light fabric in windy weather with pebbles or sticks as a fisher weights his net and cutting loose a captive whose great strength threatens the destruction of the web then we begin to suspect that he has above his special instinct a reason that guides modifies and in many ways supplements it it is not however only on these great occasions when the end is sought by unusual means that spiders show their intelligence for even these things might be considered by some as merely parts of one great complex instinct but at all times in all things the observer who watches them closely cannot fail to be convinced that they possess a guiding principle which is not mere instinct what the stick or stone was to primitive man when he had made the discovery that by holding it in his hand he greatly increased the force of his blow the possession of a web has been to the spider in developing that spark of intellect which it possesses in common with all animal organisms     chapter xv  the deathfeigning instinct   most people are familiar with the phenomenon of deathfeigning commonly seen in coleopterous insects and in many spiders this highly curious instinct is also possessed by some vertebrates in insects it is probably due to temporary paralysis occasioned by sudden concussion for when beetles alight abruptly though voluntarily they assume that appearance of death which lasts for a few moments some species indeed are so highly sensitive that the slightest touch or even a sudden menace will instantly throw them into this motionless deathsimulating condition curiously enough the same causes which produce this trance in slowmoving species like those of scarabseus for example have a precisely contrary effect on species endowed with great activity rapacious beetles when disturbed scuttle quickly out of sight and some waterbeetles spin about the surface in circles or zigzag lines so rapidly as to confuse the eye our common longlegged spiders pholcus when approached draw their feet together in the middle of the web and spin the body round with such velocity as to resemble a whirligig  certain mammals and birds also possess the deathsimulating instinct though it is hardly possible to believe that the action springs from the same immediate cause in vertebrates and in insects in the latter it appears to be a purely physical instinct the direct result of an extraneous cause and resembling the motions of a plant in mammals and birds it is evident that violent emotion and not the rough handling experienced is the final cause of the swoon  passing over venomous snakes skunks and a few other species in which the presence of danger excites only anger fear has a powerful and in some cases a disabling effect on animals and it is this paralyzing effect of fear on which the deathfeigning instinct found only in a few widelyseparated species has probably been built up by the slow cumulative process of natural selection  i have met with some curious instances of the paralyzing effect of fear i was told by some hunters in an outlying district of the pampas of its effect on a jaguar they started and which took refuge in a dense clump of dry reeds though they could see it it was impossible to throw the lasso over its head and after vainly trying to dislodge it they at length set fire to the reeds still it refused to stir but lay with head erect fiercely glaring at them through the flames finally it disappeared from sight in the black smoke and when the fire had burnt itself out it was found dead and charred in the same spot  on the pampas the gauchos frequently take the blacknecked swan by frightening it when the birds are feeding or resting on the grass two or three men or boys on horseback go quietly to leeward of the flock and when opposite to it suddenly wheel and charge it at full speed uttering loud shouts by which the birds are thrown into such terror that they are incapable of flying and are quickly despatched  i have also seen gaucho boys catch the silverbill lichenops perspicillata by hurling a stick or stone at the bird then rushing at it when it sits perfectly still disabled by fear and allows itself to be taken i myself once succeeded in taking a small bird of another species in the same way  amongst mammals our common fox canis azarae and one of the opossums didelphys azarae are strangely subject to the deathsimulating swoon for it does indeed seem strange that animals so powerful fierce and able to inflict such terrible injury with their teeth should also possess this safeguard apparently more suited to weak inactive creatures that cannot resist or escape from an enemy and to animals very low down in the scale of being when a fox is caught in a trap or run down by dogs he fights savagely at first but byandby relaxes his efforts drops on the ground and apparently yields up the ghost the deception is so well carried out that dogs are constantly taken in by it and no one not previously acquainted with this clever trickery of nature but would at once pronounce the creature dead and worthy of some praise for having perished in so brave a spirit now when in this condition of feigning death i am quite sure that the animal does not altogether lose consciousness it is exceedingly difficult to discover any evidence of life in the opossum but when one withdraws a little way from the feigning fox and watches him very attentively a slight opening of the eye may be detected and finally when left to himself he does not recover and start up like an animal that has been stunned but slowly and cautiously raises his head first and only gets up when his foes are at a safe distance yet i have seen gauchos who are very cruel to animals practise the most barbarous experiments on a captive fox without being able to rouse it into exhibiting any sign of life this has greatly puzzled me since if deathfeigning is simply a cunning habit the animal could not suffer itself to be mutilated without wincing i can only believe that the fox though not insensible as its behaviour on being left to itself appears to prove yet has its body thrown by extreme terror into that benumbed condition which simulates death and during which it is unable to feel the tortures practised on it  the swoon sometimes actually takes place before the animal has been touched and even when the exciting cause is at a considerable distance i was once riding with a gaucho when we saw on the open level ground before us a fox not yet fully grown standing still and watching our approach all at once it dropped and when we came up to the spot it was lying stretched out with eyes closed and apparently dead before passing on my companion who said it was not the first time he had seen such a thing lashed it vigorously with his whip for some moments but without producing the slightest effect  the deathfeigning instinct is possessed in a very marked degree by the spotted tinamou or common partridge of the pampas nothura maculosa when captured after a few violent struggles to escape it drops its head gasps two or three times and to all appearances dies if when you have seen this you release your hold the eyes open instantly and with startling suddenness and a noise of wings it is up and away and beyond your reach for ever possibly while your grasp is on the bird it does actually become insensible though its recovery from that condition is almost instantaneous birds when captured do sometimes die in the hand purely from terror the tinamou is excessively timid and sometimes when birds of this species are chasedfor gaucho boys frequently run them down on horsebackand when they find no burrows or thickets to escape into they actually drop down dead on the plain probably when they feign death in their captors hand they are in reality very near to death     chapter xvi  hummingbirds   hummingbirds are perhaps the very loveliest things in nature and many celebrated writers have exhausted their descriptive powers in vain efforts to picture them to the imagination the temptation was certainly great after describing the rich setting of tropical foliage and flower to speak at length of the wonderful gem contained within it but they would in this case have been wise to imitate that modest novelwriter who introduced a blank space on the page where the description of his matchless heroine should have appeared after all that has been written the first sight of a living hummingbird so unlike in its beauty all other beautiful things comes like a revelation to the mind to give any true conception of it by means of mere wordpainting is not more impossible than it would be to bottle up a supply of the living sunbeams themselves and convey them across the atlantic to scatter them in a sparkling shower over the face of england  doubtless many who have never seen them in a state of nature imagine that a tolerably correct idea of their appearance can be gained from goulds colossal monograph the pictures there however only represent dead hummingbirds a dead robin is for purposes of birdportraiture as good as a live robin the same may be said of even many brilliantplumaged species less aerial in their habits than hummingbirds in butterflies the whole beauty is seldom seen until the insect is dead or at any rate captive it was not when wallace saw the ornithoptera croesus flying about but only when he held it in his hands and opened its glorious wings that the sight of its beauty overcame him so powerfully the special kind of beauty which makes the first sight of a hummingbird a revelation depends on the swift singular motions as much as on the intense gemlike and metallic brilliancy of the plumage  the minute exquisite form when the bird hovers on misty wings probing the flowers with its coral spear the fanlike tail expanded and poising motionless exhibits the feathers shot with many hues and the next moment vanishes or all but vanishes then reappears at another flower only to vanish again and so on successively showing its splendours not continuously but like the intermitted flashes of the fireflythis forms a picture of airy grace and loveliness that baffles description all this glory disappears when the bird is dead and even when it alights to rest on a bough sitting still it looks like an exceedingly attenuated kingfisher without the pretty plumage of that bird but retaining its stiff artificial manner no artist has been so bold as to attempt to depict the bird as it actually appears when balanced before a flower the swift motion of the wings obliterates their form making them seem like a mist encircling the body yet it is precisely this formless cloud on which the glittering body hangs suspended which contributes most to give the hummingbird its wonderful spritelike or extranatural appearance how strange then to find birdpainters persisting in their efforts to show the hummingbird flying when they draw it stiff and upright on its perch the picture is honest if ugly the more ambitious representation is a delusion and a mockery  coming to the actual colouringthe changeful tints that glow with such intensity on the scalelike feathers it is curious to find that gould seems to have thought that all difficulties here had been successfully overcome the new process he spoke so confidently about might no doubt be used with advantage in reproducing the coarser metallic reflections on a black plumage such as we see in the corvine birds but the glittering garment of the hummingbird like the silvery lace woven by the epeira gemmed with dew and touched with rainbowcoloured light has never been and never can be imitated by art  on this subject one of the latest observers of hummingbirds mr everard im thurn in his work on british guiana has the following passagehardly more than one point of colour is in reality ever visible in any one hummingbird at one and the same time for each point only shows its peculiar and glittering colour when the light falls upon it from a particular direction a true representation of one of these birds would show it in somewhat sombre colours except just at the one point which when the bird is in the position chosen for representation meets the light at the requisite angle and that point alone should be shown in full brilliance of colour a flowery shrub is sometimes seen surrounded by a cloud of hummingbirds all of one species and each of course in a different position if someone would draw such a scene as that showing a different detail of colour in each bird according to its position then some idea of the actual appearance of the bird might be given to one who had never seen an example  it is hardly to be expected that anyone will carry out the above suggestion and produce a monograph with pages ten or fifteen feet wide by eighteen feet long each one showing a cloud of hummingbirds of one species flitting about a flowery bush but even in such a picture as that would be the birds suspended on unlovely angular projections instead of hazy semicircles of indistinctness and each with an immovable fleck of brightness on the otherwise sombre plumage would be as unlike living hummingbirds as anything in the older monographs  whether the glittering iridescent tints and singular ornaments for which this family is famous result from the cumulative process of conscious or voluntary sexual selection as darwin thought or are merely the outcome of a superabundant vitality as dr a r wallace so strongly maintains is a question which science has not yet answered satisfactorily the tendency to or habit of varying in the direction of rich colouring and beautiful or fantastic ornament might for all we know to the contrary have descended to hummingbirds from some diminutive curiouslyshaped brighttinted flying reptile of arboreal habits that lived in some faroff epoch in the worlds history it is not at all events maintained by anyone that all birds sprang originally from one reptilian stock and the true position of hummingbirds in a natural classification has not yet been settled for no intermediate forms exist connecting them with any other group to the ordinary mind they appear utterly unlike all other feathered creatures and as much entitled to stand apart as for instance the pigeon and ostrich families it has been maintained by some writers that they are anatomically related to the swifts although the differences separating the two families appear so great as almost to stagger belief in this notion now however the very latest authority on this subject dr schufeldt has come to the conclusion that swifts are only greatly modified passeres and that the hummingbirds should form an order by themselves  leaving this question and regarding them simply with the ornithological eye that does not see far below the surface of things when we have sufficiently admired the unique beauty and marvellous velocity of hummingbirds there is little more to be said about them they are lovely to the eyeindescribably so and it is not strange that gould wrote rapturously of the time when he was at length permitted to revel in the delight of seeing the hummingbird in a state of nature the feeling he wrote which animated him with regard to these most wonderful works of creation it was impossible to describe and could only be appreciated by those who have made natural history a study and who pursue the investigations of her charming mysteries with ardour and delight this we can understand but to what an astonishing degree the feeling was carried in him when after remarking that enthusiasm and excitement with regard to most things in life become lessened and eventually deadened by time in most of us he was able to add not so however i believe with those who take up the study of the family of hummingbirds it can only be supposed that he regarded natural history principally as a science of dead animalsa necrology and collected hummingbirds just as others collect roman coins birds eggs old weapons or blue china their zeal in the pursuit and faith in its importance increasing with the growth of their treasures until they at last come to believe that though all the enthusiasms and excitements which give a zest to the lives of other men fade and perish with time it is not so with their particular pursuit the more rational kind of pleasure experienced by the ornithologist in studying habits and disposition no doubt results in a great measure from the fact that the actions of the feathered people have a savour of intelligence in them whatever his theory or conviction about the origin of instincts may happen to be or even if he has no convictions on the subject it must nevertheless seem plain to him that intelligence is after all in most cases the guiding principle of life supplementing and modifying habits to bring them into closer harmony with the environment and enlivening every day with countless little acts which result from judgment and experience and form no part of the inherited complex instincts the longer he observes any one species or individual the more does he find in it to reward his attention this is not the case however with hummingbirds which possess the avian body but do not rank mentally with birds the pleasure one takes in their beauty soon evaporates and is succeeded by no fresh interest so monotonous and mechanical are all their actions and we accordingly find that those who are most familiar with them from personal observation have very little to say about them a score of hummingbirds of as many distinct species are less to the student of habits than one little brownplurnaged bird haunting his garden or the rushbed of a neighbouring stream and doubtless for a reason similar to that which makes a lovely human face uninformed by intellect seem less permanently attractive than many a homelier countenance he grows tired of seeing the feathered fairies perpetually weaving their aerial balletdance about the flowers and finds it a relief to watch the little finch or wren or flycatcher of shy temper and obscure protective colouring perhaps it possesses a graceful form and melodious voice to give it aesthetic value but even without such accessories he can observe it day by day with increasing interest and pleasure and it only adds piquancy to the feeling to know that the little bird also watches him with a certain amount of intelligent curiosity and a great deal of suspicion and that it studiously endeavours to conceal from him all the little secrets its life which he is bent on discovering  it has frequently been remarked that humming birds are more like insects than birds in disposition some species on quitting their perch perform wide beelike circles about the tree before shooting away in a straight line their aimless attacks on other species approaching or passing near them even on large birds like hawks and pigeons is a habit they have in common with many solitary woodboring bees they also like dragonflies and other insects attack each other when they come together while feeding and in this case their action strangely resembles that of a couple of butterflies as they revolve about each other and rise vertically to a great height in the air again like insects they are undisturbed at the presence of man while feeding or even when engaged in building and incubation and like various solitary bees wasps c they frequently come close to a person walking or standing to hover suspended in the air within a few inches of his face and if then struck at they often insectlike return to circle round his head all other birds even those which display the least versatility and in districts where man is seldom seen show as much caution as curiosity in his presence they recognize in the upright unfamiliar form a living being and a possible enemy mr whiteley who observed hummingbirds in peru says it is an amusing sight to watch the lesbia nuna attempting to pass to a distant spot in a straight line during a high wind which acting on the long tail feathers carries it quite away from the point aimed at insects presenting a large surface to the wind are always blown from their course in the same way for even in the most windy districts they never appear to learn to guide themselves and i have often seen a butterfly endeavouring to reach an isolated flower blown from it a dozen times before it finally succeeded or gave up the contest birds when shaping their course unless young and inexperienced always make allowance for the force of the wind hummingbirds often fly into open rooms impelled apparently by a fearless curiosity and may then be chased about until they drop exhausted or are beaten down and caught and as gould says if then taken into the hand they almost immediately feed on any sweet or pump up any liquid that may be offered to them without betraying either fear or resentment at the previous treatment wasps and bees taken in the same way endeavour to sting their captor as most people know from experience nor do they cease struggling violently to free themselves but the dragonfly is like the hummingbird and is no sooner caught after much illtreatment than it will greedily devour as many flies and mosquitoes as one likes to offer it only in beings very low in the scale of nature do we see the instinct of selfpreservation in this extremely simple condition unmixed with reason or feeling and so transient in its effects the same insensibility to danger is seen when hummingbirds are captured and confined in a room and when before a day is over they will flutter about their captors face and even take nectar from his lips  some observers have thought that hummingbirds come nearest to humblebees in their actions i do not think so mr bates writes they do not proceed in that methodical manner which bees follow taking the flowers seriatim but skip about from one part of a tree to another in the most capricious manner i have observed humblebees a great deal and feel convinced that they arc among the most highly intelligent of the social hymenoptera hummingbirds to my mind have a much closer resemblance to the solitary woodboring bees and to dragonflies it must also be borne in mind that insects have very little time in which to acquire experience and that a large portion of their life in the imago state is taken up with the complex business of reproduction  the trochilidae although confined to one continent promise to exceed all other familieseven the cosmopolitan finches and warblersin number of species at present over five hundred are known or as many as all the species of birds in europe together and good reasons exist for believing that very many morenot less perhaps than one or two hundred speciesyet remain to be discovered the most prolific region and where hummingbirds are most highly developed is known to be west brazil and the eastern slopes of the bolivian and peruvian andes this is precisely the least known portion of south america the few naturalists and collectors who have reached it have returned laden with spoil to tell us of a region surpassing all others in the superabundance and beauty of its bird life nothing however which can be said concerning these vast unexplored areas of tropical mountain and forest so forcibly impresses us with the idea of the unknown riches contained in them as the story of the loddigesia mirabilis this is perhaps the most wonderful hummingbird known and no one who had not previously seen it figured could possibly form an idea of what it is like from a mere description an outline sketch of it would probably be taken by most people as a fantastic design representing a birdform in combination with leaves in size and shape resembling poplar leaves but on leafstalks of an impossible length curving and crossing each other so as to form geometrical figures unlike anything in nature yet this bird a single specimen was obtained in peru half a century ago and for upwards of twenty years after its discovery gould tried to obtain others offering as much as fifty pounds for one but no second specimen ever gladdened his eyes nor was anything more heard of it until stolzmann refound it in the year 1880  the addition of many new species to the long list would however be a matter of small interest unless fresh facts concerning their habits and structure were at the same time brought to light but we can scarcely expect that the as yet unknown species will supply any link connecting the trochilidae with other existing families of birds the eventual conclusion will perhaps be that this family has come down independently from an exceedingly remote past and with scarcely any modification while within certain very narrow limits hummingbirds vary more than other families outside of these limits they appear relatively stationary and conversely other birds exhibit least variability in the one direction in which hummingbirds vary excessively on account of a trivial difference in habit they have sometimes been separated in two subfamilies the phaethornithinae found in shady tropical forests and the trochilinae comprising hummingbirds which inhabit open sunny placesand to this division they mostly belong in both of these purely arbitrary groups however the aerial habits and manner of feeding poised in the air are identical although the birds living in shady forests where flowers are scarce obtain their food principally from the under surfaces of leaves in their procreant habits the uniformity is also very great in all cases the nest is small deep cupshaped or conical composed of soft felted materials and lined inside with vegetable down the eggs are white and never exceed two in number broadly speaking they resemble each other as closely in habits as in structure the greatest differences in habit in the most widely separated genera being no greater than may be found in two wrens or sparrows of the same genus  this persistence of character in hummingbirds both as regards structure and habit seems the more remarkable when we consider their very wide distribution over a continent so varied in its conditions and where they range from the lowest levels to the limit of perpetual snow on the andes and from the tropics to the wintry magellanic district also that a majority of genera inhabit very circumscribed areasthese facts as dr wallace remarks clearly pointing to a very high antiquity  it is perhaps a law of nature that when a species or group fits itself to a place not previously occupied and in which it is subject to no opposition from beings of its own class or where it attains so great a perfection as to be able easily to overcome all opposition the character eventually loses its original plasticity or tendency to vary since improvement in such a case would be superfluous and becomes so to speak crystallized in that form which continues thereafter unaltered it is at any rate clear that while all other birds rub together in the struggle for existence the hummingbird owing to its aerial life and peculiar manner of seeking its food is absolutely untouched by this kind of warfare and is accordingly as far removed from all competition with other birds as the solitary savage is removed from the struggle of life affecting and modifying men in crowded communities the lower kind of competition affecting hummingbirds that with insects and within the family of species with species has probably only served to intensify their unique characteristics and perhaps to lower their intelligence  not only are they removed from that indirect struggle for existence which acts so powerfully on other families but they are also by their habits and the unequalled velocity of their flight placed out of reach of that direct war waged on all other small birds by the rapacious kindsbirds mammals and reptiles one result of this immunity is that hummingbirds are excessively numerous albeit such slow breeders for as we have seen they only lay two eggs and not only so but the second egg is often dropped so long after incubation has begun in the first that only one is really hatched yet belt expressed the opinion that in nicaragua where he observed hummingbirds they outnumbered all the other birds together considering how abundant birds of all kinds are in that district and that most of them have a protective colouring and lay several eggs it would be impossible to accept such a statement unless we believed that hummingbirds have practically no enemies  another result of their immunity from persecution is the splendid colouring and strange and beautiful feather ornaments distinguishing them above all other birds and excessive variation in this direction is due it seems to me to the very causes which serve to check variation in all other directions in their plumage as martin long ago wrote nature has strained at every variety of effect and revelled in an infinitude of modifications how wonderful their garb is with colours so varied so intense yet seemingly so evanescentthe glittering mantle of powdered gold the emerald green that changes to velvet black ruby reds and luminous scarlets dull bronze that brightens and burns like polished brass and pale neutral tints that kindle to rose and lilaccoloured flame and to the glory of prismatic colouring are added feather decorations such as the racketplumes and downy muffs of spathura the crest and frills of lophornis the sapphire gorget burning on the snowwhite breast of oreotrochilus the fiery tail of cometes and amongst grotesque forms the long pointed crestfeathers representing horns and flowingwhite beard adorning the piebald goatlike face of oxypogon  excessive variation in this direction is checked in nearly all other birds by the need of a protective colouring few kinds so greatly excelling in strength and activity as to be able to maintain their existence without it bright feathers constitute a double danger for not only do they render their possessor conspicuous but just as the butterfly chooses the gayest flower so do hawks deliberately single out from many obscure birds the one with brilliant plumage but the rapacious kinds do not waste their energies in the vain pursuit of hummingbirds these are in the position of neutrals free to range at will amidst the combatants insulting all alike and flaunting their splendid colours with impunity they are natures favourites endowed with faculties bordering on the miraculous and all other kinds gentle or fierce ask only to be left alone by them     chapter xvii  the crested screamer  chalina chavarria   amongst the feathered notables from all parts of the world found gathered at the zoological gardens in london is the crested screamer from south america it is in many respects a very singular species and its large size great strength and majestic demeanour with the surprising docility and intelligence it displays when domesticated give it a character amongst birds somewhat like that of the elephant amongst mammals briefly and roughly to describe it in size it is like a swan in shape like a lapwing only with a powerful curved gallinaceous beak it is adorned with a long pointed crest and a black neckring the plumage being otherwise of a pale slaty blue while the legs and the naked skin about the eyes are bright red on each wing in both sexes there are two formidable spurs the first one on the second joint is an inch and a half long nearly straight triangular and exceedingly sharp the second spur on the last joint being smaller broad and curved and roughly resembling in shape and size a lions claw there is another stinking peculiarity the skin is emphysematousthat is bloated and yielding to pressure it crackles when touched and the surface when the feathers are removed presents a swollen bubbly appearance for under the skin there is a layer of airbubbles extending over the whole body and even down the legs under the horny tesselated skin to the toes the legs thus having a somewhat massive appearance  and now just a few words about the position of the screamer in systematic zoology it is placed in the family palamedeidae which contains only three species but about the order it belongs to there is much disagreement it was formerly classed with the rails and in popular books of natural history still keeps its place with them now the railtribe says professor parker speaking on this very matter has for a long time been burdened on paper with a very false army list everything alive that has had the misfortune to be possessed of large unwieldy feet has been added to this feebleminded cowardly group until it has become a mixed multitude with discordant voices and with manners and customs having no consonance or relation he takes the screamer from the railtribe and classes it with the geese as also does professor huxley and concludes his study with these wordsamongst living birds there is not one possessing characters of higher interest none that i am acquainted with come nearer in some important points to the lizard and there are parts of the organization which make it very probable that it is one of the nearest living relations of the marvellous archaeopteryxan intermediate form between birds and reptiles belonging to the upper jurassic period  the screamers right to dwell with the geese has not been left unchallenged the late professor garrod finds that from considerations of pterylosis visceral anatomy myology and osteology the screamer cannot be placed along with the anserine birds he finds that in some points it resembles the ostrich and rhea and concludes it seems therefore to me that summing these results the screamer must have sprung from the primary avian stock as an independent offshoot at much the same time as did most of the other important families this time he further tells us was when there occurred a general breakup of the ancient terrestrial birdtype when the acquisition of wings brought many intruders into domains already occupied calling forth a new struggle for existence and bringing out many special qualities by means of natural selection  with this archaeological question i have little to do and only quote the above great authorities to show that the screamer appears to be nearly the last descendant of an exceedingly ancient family with little or no relationship to other existing families and that its pedigree has been hopelessly lost in the night of an incalculable antiquity i have only to speak of the bird as a part of the visible world and as it appears to the nonscientific lover of nature for curiously enough while anatomists nave been laboriously seeking for the screamers affinities in that biological field which is as wide as the earth and deep as the sea travellers and ornithologists have told us almost nothing about its strange character and habits  though dressed with quakerlike sobriety and without the elegance of form distinguishing the swan or peacock this bird yet appeals to the aesthetic feelings in man more than any species i am acquainted with voice is one of its strong points as one might readily infer from the name nevertheless the name is not an appropriate one for though the bird certainly does scream and that louder than the peacock its scream is only a powerful note of alarm uttered occasionally while the notes uttered at intervals in the night or in the daytime when it soars upwards like the lark of some faroff imaginary epoch in the worlds history when all tilings larks included were on a gigantic scale are properly speaking singing notes and in quality utterly unlike screams sometimes when walking across regents park i bear the resounding cries of the bird confined there attempting to sing above the concert of cranes the screams of eagles and macaws the howling of dogs and wolves and the muffled roar of lions one can hear it all over the park but those loud notes only sadden me exile and captivity have taken all joyousness from the noble singer and a moist climate has made him hoarse the long clear strains are no more and he hurries through his series of confused shrieks as quickly as possible as if ashamed of the performance a lark singing high up in a sunny sky and a lark singing in a small cage hanging against a shady wall in a london street produce very different effects and the spluttering medley of shrill and harsh sounds from the street singer scarcely seems to proceed from the same kind of bird as that matchless melody filling the blue heavens there is even a greater difference in the notes of the crested screamer when heard in regents park and when heard on the pampas where the bird soars upwards until its bulky body disappears from sight and from that vast elevation pours down a perpetual rain of jubilant sound  screamer being a misnomer i prefer to call the bird by its vernacular name of chajá or chakar a more convenient spelling  with the chakar the sexes are faithful even in very large flocks the birds all being ranged in couples when one bird begins to sing its partner immediately joins but with notes entirely different in quality both birds have some short deep notes the other notes of the female being long powerful notes with a trill in them but over them sounds the clear piercing voice of the male ringing forth at the close with great strength and purity the song produces the effect of harmony but comparing it with human singing it is less like a duo than a terzetto composed of bass contralto and soprano  at certain times in districts favourable to them the chakars often assemble in immense flocks thousands of individuals being sometimes seen congregated together and in these gatherings the birds frequently all sing in concert they invariablythough without risingsing at intervals during the night counting the hours as the gauchos say the first song being at about nine oclock the second at midnight and the third just before dawn but the hours vary in different districts  i was once travelling with a party of gauchos when about midnight it being intensely dark a couple of chakars broke out singing right ahead of us thus letting us know that we were approaching a watercourse where we intended refreshing our horses we found it nearly dry and when we rode down to the rill of water meandering over the broad dry bed of the river a flock of about a thousand chakars set up a perfect roar of alarm notes all screaming together with intervals of silence after then they rose up with a mighty rush of wings they settled down again a few hundred yards off and all together burst forth in one of their grand midnight songs making the plains echo for miles around  there is something strangely impressive in these spontaneous outbursts of a melody so powerful from one of these large flocks and though accustomed to hear these birds from childhood i have often been astonished at some new effect produced by a large multitude singing under certain conditions travelling alone one summer day i carne at noon to a lake on the pampas called kakela sheet of water narrow enough for one to see across chakars in countless numbers were gathered along its shores but they were all ranged in welldefined flocks averaging about five hundred birds in each flock these flocks seemed to extend all round the lake and had probably been driven by the drought from all the plains around to this spot presently one flock near me began singing and continued their powerful chant for three or four minutes when they ceased the next flock took up the strains and after it the next and so on until the notes of the flocks on the opposite shore came floating strong and clear across the waterthen passed away growing fainter and fainter until once more the sound approached me travelling round to my side again the effect was very curious and i was astonished at the orderly way with which each flock waited its turn to sing instead of a general outburst taking place after the first flock had given the signal on another occasion i was still more impressed for here the largest number of birds i have ever found congregated at one place all sung together this was on the southern pampas at a place called gualicho where i had ridden for an hour before sunset over a marshy plain where there was still much standing water in the rushy pools though it was at the height of the dry season this whole plain was covered with an endless flock of chakars not in close order but scattered about in pairs and small groups in this desolate spot i found a small rancho inhabited by a gaucho and his family and i spent the night with them the birds were all about the house apparently as tame as the domestic fowls and when i went out to look for a spot for my horse to feed on they would not fly away from me but merely moved a few steps out of my path about nine oclock we were eating supper in the rancho when suddenly the entire multitude of birds covering the marsh for miles around burst forth into a tremendous evening song it is impossible to describe the effect of this mighty rush of sound but let the reader try to imagine halfamillion voices each far more powerful than that one which makes itself heard all over regents park bursting forth on the silent atmosphere of that dark lonely plain one peculiarity was that in this mighty noise which sounded louder than the sea thundering on a rocky coast i seemed to be able to distinguish hundreds even thousands of individual voices forgetting my supper i sat motionless and overcome with astonishment while the air and even the frail rancho seemed to be trembling in that tempest of sound when it ceased my host remarked with a smile we are accustomed to this señorevery evening we have this concert it was a concert well worth riding a hundred miles to hear but the chakar country is just now in a transitional state and the precise conditions which made it possible for birds so large in size to form such immense congregations are rapidly passing away in desert places the bird subsists chiefly on leaves and seeds of aquatic plants but when the vast level area of the pampas was settled by man the ancient stiff grassvegetation gave place to the soft clovers and grasses of europe and to this new food the birds took very kindly other circumstances also favoured their increase they were never persecuted for the natives do not eat them though they are really very goodthe flesh being something like wild goose in flavour a higher civilization is changing all this the country is becoming rapidly overrun with emigrants especially by italians the pitiless enemies of all birdlife  the chakars like the skylark love to soar upwards when singing and at such times when they have risen till their dark bulky bodies appear like floating specks on the blue sky or until they disappear from sight altogether the notes become wonderfully etherealized by distance to a soft silvery sound and it is then very delightful to listen to them  it seems strange that so ponderous a fowl with only six feet and a half spread of wings should possess a power of soaring equal to that of vultures and eagles even the vulture with its marvellous wing power soars chiefly from necessity and when its crop is full finds no pleasure in scaling the heavens by invisible stairs the chakar leaves its grassplot after feeding and soars purely for recreation taking so much pleasure in its aerial exercises that in bright warm weather in winter and spring it spends a great part of the day in the upper regions of the air on the earth its air is grave and its motions measured and majestic and it rises with immense labour the wings producing a sound like a high wind but as the bird mounts higher sweeping round as it ascends just as vultures and eagles do it gradually appears to become more buoyant describing each succeeding circle with increasing grace i can only account for this magnificent flight beginning so laboriously by supposing that the bubble space under the skin becomes inflated with an air lighter than atmospheric air enabling a body so heavy with wings disproportionately short to float with such ease and evident enjoyment at the vast heights to which the bird ascends the heavenward flight of a large bird is always a magnificent spectacle that of the chakar is peculiarly fascinating on account of the resounding notes it sings while soaring and in which the bird seems to exult in its sublime power and freedom  i was once very much surprised at the behaviour of a couple of chakars during a thunderstorm on a still sultry day in summer i was standing watching masses of black cloud coming rapidly over the sky while a hundred yards from me stood the two birds also apparently watching the approaching storm with interest presently the edge of the cloud touched the sun and a twilight gloom fell on the earth the very moment the sun disappeared the birds rose up and soon began singing their long resounding notes though it was loudly thundering at the time while vivid flashes of lightning lit the black cloud overhead at short intervals i watched their flight and listened to their notes till suddenly as they made a wide sweep upwards they disappeared in the cloud and at the same moment their voices became muffled and seemed to come from an immense distance the cloud continued emitting sharp flashes of lightning but the birds never reappeared and after six or seven minutes once more their notes sounded loud and clear above the muttering thunder i suppose they had passed through the cloud into the clear atmosphere above it but i was extremely surprised at their fearlessness for as a rule when soaring birds see a storm coming they get out of its way flying before it or stooping to the earth to seek shelter of some kind for most living things appear to have a wholesome dread of thunder and lightning  when taken young the chakar becomes very tame and attached to man showing no inclination to go back to a wild life there was one kept at an estancia called mangrullos on the western frontier of buenos ayres and the people of the house gave me a very curious account of it the bird was a male and had been reared by a soldiers wife at a frontier outpost called la esperanza about twentyfive miles from mangrullos four years before i saw the bird the indians had invaded the frontier destroying the esperanza settlement and all the estancias for some leagues around for some weeks after the invasion the chakar wandered about the country visiting all the ruined estancias apparently in quest of human beings and on arriving at mangrullos which had not been burnt and was still inhabited it settled down at ones and never afterwards showed any disposition to go away it was extremely tame associating by day with the poultry and going to roost with them at night oh a high perch probably for the sake of companionship for in a wild state the bird roosts on the ground it was friendly towards all the members of the household except one a peon and against this person from the first the bird always displayed the greatest antipathy threatening him with its wings puffing itself out and hissing like an angry goose the man had a swarthy beardless face and it was conjectured that the chakar associated him in its mind with the savages who had destroyed its early home  close to the house there was a lagoon never dry which was frequently visited by flocks of wild chakars whenever a flock appeared the tame bird would go out to join them and though the chakars are mildtempered birds and very rarely quarrel albeit so well provided with formidable weapons they invariably attacked the visitor with great fury chasing him back to the house and not ceasing their persecutions till the poultryyard was reached they appeared to regard this tame bird that dwelt with man as a kind of renegade and hated him accordingly  before he had been long at the estancia it began to be noticed that he followed the broods of young chickens about very assiduously apparently taking great interest in their welfare and even trying to entice them to follow him a few newlyhatched chickens were at length offered to him as an experiment and he immediately took charge of them with every token of satisfaction conducting them about in search of food and imitating all the actions of a hen finding him so good a nurse large broods were given to him and the more the fosterchickens were the better he seemed pleased it was very curious to see this big bird with thirty or forty little animated balls of yellow cotton following him about while he moved majestically along setting down his feet with the greatest care not to tread on them and swelling himself up with jealous anger at the approach of a cat or dog  the intelligence docility and attachment to man displayed by the chakar in a domestic state with perhaps other latent aptitudes only waiting to be developed by artificial selection seem to make this species one peculiarly suited for mans protection without which it must inevitably perish it is sad to reflect that all our domestic animals have descended to us from those ancient times which we are accustomed to regard as dark or barbarous while the effect of our modern socalled humane civilization has been purely destructive to animal life not one type do we rescue from the carnage going on at an everincreasing rate over all the globe to australia and america north and south we look in vain for new domestic species while even from africa with its numerous fine mammalian forms and where england has been the conquering colonizing power for nearly a century we take nothing even the sterling qualities of the elephant the unique beauty of the zebra appeal to us in vain we are only teaching the tribes of that vast continent to exterminate a hundred noble species they would not tame with grief and shame even with dismay we call to mind that our country is now a stupendous manufactory of destructive engines which we are rapidly placing in the hands of all the savage and semisavage peoples of the earth thus ensuring the speedy destruction of all the finest types in the animal kingdom     chapter xviii  the woodhewer family  dendrocolaptidae   the south american treecreepers or woodhewers as they are sometimes called although confined exclusively to one continent their range extending from southern mexico to the magellanic islands form one of the largest families of the order passeres no fewer than about two hundred and ninety species referable to about fortysix genera having been already described as they are mostly small inconspicuous thicketfrequenting birds shy and fond of concealment to excess it is only reasonable to suppose that our list of this family is more incomplete than of any other family of birds known thus in the southern plata and north patagonian districts supposed to be exhausted where my observations have been made and where owing to the open nature of the country birds are more easily remarked than in the forests and marshes of the tropical region i have made notes on the habits of five species of which i did not preserve specimens and which as far as i know have never been described and named probably long before the whole of south america has been exhausted there will be not less than four to five hundred dendrocolaptine species known and yet with the exception of that dry husk of knowledge concerning size form and colouration which classifiers and cataloguers obtain from specimens very little indeedscarcely anything in factis known about the treecreepers and it would not be too much to say that there are many comparatively obscure and uninteresting species in europe any one of which has a larger literature than the entire treecreeper family no separate work about these birds has seen the light even in these days of monographs but the reason of this comparative neglect is not far to seek in the absence of any knowledge except of the most fragmentary kind of the lifehabits of exotic species the monographmakers of the old world naturally take up only the most important groupsie the groups which most readily attract the travellers eye with their gay conspicuous colouring and which have acquired a wide celebrity we thus have a succession of splendid and expensive works dealing separately with such groups as woodpeckers trogons hummingbirds tanagers kingfishers and birds of paradise for with these even if there be nothing to record beyond the usual dreary details and technicalities concerning geographical distribution variations in size and markings of different species c the little interest of the letterpress is compensated for in the accompanying plates which are now produced on a scale of magnitude and with so great a degree of perfection as regards brilliant colouring spirited attitudes and general fidelity to nature that leaves little further improvement in this direction to be looked for the treecreepers being without the inferior charm of bright colour offer no attraction to the birdpainter whose share in the work of the pictorial monograph is of course allimportant yet even the very slight knowledge we possess of this family is enough to show that in many respects it is one richly endowed possessing characters of greater interest to the student of the instincts and mental faculties of birds than any of the gailytinted families i have mentioned  there is in the dendrocolaptidae a splendid harvest for future observers of the habits of south american birds some faint idea of its richness may perhaps be gathered from the small collection of the most salient facts known to us about them i have brought together and put in order in this place and i am here departing a little from the plan usually observed in this book which is chiefly occupied with matters of personal knowledge seasoned with a little speculation but in this case i have thought it best to supplement my own observations with those of others footnote azara dorbigny darwin bridges frazer leotaud gaumer wallace bates cunningham stolzmann jelski durnford gibson burrows doering white c who have collected and observed birds in south america so as to give as comprehensive a survey of the family as i could  it is strange to find a passerine family numerous as the treecreepers uniformly of one colour or nearly so for with few exceptions these birds have a brown plumage without a particle of bright colour but although they possess no brilliant or metallic tints in some species as we shall see there are tints approaching to brightness notwithstanding this family likeness in colour any person not an ornithologist looking at a collection of specimens comprising many genera would hear with surprise and almost incredulity that they all belonged to one family so great is the diversity exhibited in their structure in size they vary from species smaller than the goldencrested wren to others larger than the woodcock but the differences in size are as nothing compared with those shown in the form of the beak between the minute straight conical titlike beaks of the laptasthenuraa tit in appearance and habitsand the extravagantly long swordshaped bill of nasica or the excessively attenuated sickleshaped organ in xiphorynchus the divergence is amazing compared with what is found in other families while between these two extremes there is a heterogeneous assemblage of birds with beaks like creepers nuthatches finches tyrantbirds woodpeckers crows and even curlews and ibises in legs feet and tails there are corresponding differences there are tails of all lengths and all forms soft and stiff square acuminated broad and fanlike narrow and spinelike and many as in the woodpeckers and used as in that bird to support the body in climbing an extremely curious modification is found in sittosoma the tailfeathers in this genus are long and graduated and the shafts projecting beyond the webs at the ends curve downwards and form stiff hooks concerning the habits of these birds it has only been reported that they climb on the trunks of trees probably they are able to run vertically up or down with equal facility and even to suspend themselves by their featherhooks when engaged in dislodging insects another curious variation is found in sylviothorhynchus a small wrenlike bird and the only member known of the genus with a tail resembling that of the lyrebird the extravagantly long feathers being so narrow as to appear almost like shafts destitute of webs this tail appears to be purely ornamental  this extreme variety in structure indicates a corresponding diversity in habits and assuming it to be a true doctrine that habits vary first and structure afterwards anyone might infer from a study of their forms alone that these birds possess a singular plasticity or tendency to vary in their habitsor in other words that they are exceptionally intelligent and that such a conclusion would be right i believe a study of their habits will serve to show  the same species is often found to differ in its manner of life in different localities some species of xenops and magarornis like woodpeckers climb vertically on treetrunks in search of insect prey but also like tits explore the smaller twigs and foliage at the extremity of the branches so that the whole tree from its root to its topmost foliage is hunted over by them the sclerurus although an inhabitant of the darkest forest and provided with sharplycurved claws never seeks its food on trees but exclusively on the ground among the decaying fallen leaves but strangely enough when alarmed it flies to the trunk of the nearest tree to which it clings in a vertical position and remaining silent and motionless escapes observation by means of its dark protective colour the drymornis a large bird with feet and tail like a woodpecker climbs on treetrunks to seek its food but also possesses the widelydifferent habit of resorting to the open plain especially after a shower to feed on larvae and earthworms extracting them from a depth of three or four inches beneath the surface with its immense curved probing beak  again when we consider a large number of species of different groups we find that there is not with the treecreepers as with most families any special habit or manner of life linking them together but that on the contrary different genera and very frequently different species belonging to one genus possess habits peculiarly their own in other families even where the divergence is greatest what may be taken as the original or ancestral habit is seldom or never quite obsolete in any of the members this we see for instance in the woodpeckers some of which have acquired the habit of seeking their food exclusively on the ground in open places and even of nesting in the banks of streams yet all these wanderers even those which have been structurally modified in accordance with their altered way of life retain the primitive habit of clinging vertically to the trunks of trees although the habit has lost its use with the tyrant birdsa family showing an extraordinary amount of variationit is the same for the most divergent kinds are frequently seen reverting to the family habit of perching on an elevation from which to make forays after passing insects returning after each capture to the same stand the thrushes ranging all over the globe afford another striking example without speaking of their nesting habits their relationship appears in their love of fruit in their gait flight statuesque attitudes and abrupt motions  with the numerous dendrocolaptine groups so widely separated and apparently unrelated it would be difficult indeed to say which of their most striking habits is the ancestral one many of the smaller species live in trees or bushes and in their habits resemble tits warblers wrens and other kinds that subsist on small caterpillars spiders c gleaned from the leaves and smaller twigs the anumbius nests on trees but feeds exclusively on the ground in open places while other groundfeeders seek their food among dead leaves in dense gloomy forests coryphistera resembles the lark and pipit in its habits cinclodes the wagtail geobates a saxicola limnornis lives in reed beds growing in the water henicornis in reed beds growing out of the water and many other ground species exist concealed in the grass on dry plains homorus seeks its food by digging in the loose soil and dead leaves about the roots of trees while geositta furnarius and upercerthia obtain a livelihood chiefly by probing in the soil it would not be possible within the present limits to mention in detail all the different modes of life of those species or groups which do not possess the treecreeping habit after them comes a long array of genera in which this habit is ingrained and in which the greatly modified feet and claws are suited to a climbing existence as these genera comprise the largest half of the family also the largest birds in it we might expect to find in the treecreeping the parental habit of the dendrocolaptidae and that from these tropical forest groups have sprung the widelydiverging thicket ground marsh seabeach and rockfrequenting groups it happens however that these birds resemble each other only in their climbing feet in the form of their beaks they are as wide apart as are nuthatches woodpeckers crows and curlews they also differ markedly in the manner of seeking their food some dig like woodpeckers in decayed wood others probe only in soft rotten wood while the hummingbirdbilled xiphorhynchus with a beak too long and slender for probing explores the interior of deep holes in the trunks to draw out nocturnal insects spiders and centipedes from their concealment xiphocolaptes uses its swordlike beak as a lever thrusting it under and forcing up the loose bark while dendrornis with its stout corvine beak tears the bark off  in the nesting habits the diversity is greatest some ground species excavate in the earth like kingfishers only with greater skill making cylindrical burrows often four to five feet deep and terminating in a round chamber others build a massive ovenshaped structure of clay on a branch or other elevated site many of those that creep on trees nest in holes in the wood the marshfrequenting kinds attach spherical or oval domed nests to the reeds and in some cases woven grass and clay are so ingeniously combined that the structure while light as a basket is perfectly impervious to the wet and practically indestructible the most curious nests however are the large stick structures on trees and bushes in the building and repairing of which the birds are in many cases employed more or less constantly all the year round these stick nests vary greatly in form size and in other respects some have a spiral passageway leading from the entrance to the nest cavity and the cavity is in many cases only large enough to accommodate the bird but in the gigantic structure of homorus gutturalis it is so large that if the upper half of the nest or dome were removed a condor could comfortably hatch her eggs and rear her young in it this nest is spherical the allied homorus lophotis builds a nest equally large but with a small cavity for the eggs inside and outwardly resembling a gigantic powderflask lying horizontally among the lower branches of a spreading tree pracellodomtis sibilatrix a bird in size like the english house sparrow also makes a huge nest and places it on the twigs at the terminal end of a horizontal branch from twelve to fifteen feet above the ground but when finished the weight of the structure bears down the branchend to within one or two feet of the surface mr barrows who describes this nest says when other branches of the same tree are similarly loaded and other trees close at hand bear the same kind of fruit the result is very picturesque synallaxis phryganophila makes a stick nest about a foot in depth and from the top a tubular passage formed of slender twigs interlaced runs down the entire length of the nest like a rainpipe on the wall of a house and then becoming external slopes upward ending at a distance of two to three feet from the nest throughout south america there are several varieties of these fruitandstem or wateringpot shaped nests they are not however all built by birds of one genus while in the genus synallaxis many species have no tubular passageways attached to their nests one specieserythro thoraxin yucatan makes so large a nest of sticks that the natives do not believe that so small a bird can be the builder they say that when the tzapatan begins to sing all the birds in the forest repair to it each one carrying a stick to add to the structure only one a tyrantbird brings two sticks one for itself and one for the urubú or vulture that bird being considered too large heavy and ignorant of architecture to assist personally in the work  in the southern part of south america where scattered thorn trees grow on a dry soil these big nests are most abundant there are plains mr barrows writes within two miles of the centre of this town concepcion argentine republic where i have stood and counted from one point within a radius of twenty rods over two hundred of these curious nests varying in size from that of a small pumpkin to more than the volume of a barrel often a single tree will contain half a dozen nests or more and not unfrequently the nests of several different species are seen crowding each other out of shape on the same bush or tree  it would be a mistake to think that the widely different nesting habits i have mentioned are found in different genera i have just spoken of the big stick nests with or without passageways of the synallaxes yet the nest of one member of this group is simply a small straight tube of woven grass the aperture only large enough to admit the finger and open at both ends so that the bird can pass in and out without turning round another species scoops a circular hollow in the soil and builds over it a dome of fine woven grass it should be mentioned that the nesting habits of only about fifteen out of the sixtyfive species comprised in this genus are known to us in the genus furnarius the ovenshaped clay structure is known to be made by three species a fourth builds a nest of sticks in a tree a fifth burrows in the side of a bank like a kingfisher  the explanation of the most striking features of the dendrocolaptidae their monotonous brown plumage diversity of structure versatile habits and the marvellous development of the nestmaking instinct which they exhibit is to be found it appears to me in the fact that they are the most defenceless of birds they are timid unresisting creatures without strength or weapons their movements arc less quick and vigorous than those of other kinds and their flight is exceedingly feeble the arboreal species flit at intervals from one tree to another those that frequent thickets refuse to leave their chosen shelter while those inhabiting grassy plains or marshes study concealment and when forced to rise flutter away just above the surface like flyingfish frightened from the water and when they have gone thirty or forty yards dip into the grass or reeds again their life is thus one of perpetual danger in a far greater degree than with other passerine families such as warblers tyrants finches thrushes c while an exclusively insect diet laboriously extracted from secret places and inability to change their climate contribute to make their existence a hard one it has been with these birds as with human beings bred in misfortunes school and subjected to keen competition one of their most striking characteristics is a methodical plodding almost painful diligence of manner while seeking their food so that when viewed side by side with other species rejoicing in a gayer plumage and stronger flight they seem like sober labourers that never rest among holiday people bent only on enjoyment that they are able not only to maintain their existence but to rise to the position of a dominant family is due to an intelligence and adaptiveness exceeding that of other kinds and which has been strengthened and perhaps directly results from the hard conditions of their life  how great their adaptiveness and variability must be when we find that every portion of the south american continent is occupied by them for there is really no climate and no kind of soil or vegetation which does not possess its appropriate species modified in colour form and habits to suit the surrounding conditions in the tropical region so rich in bird life of all kinds in forest marsh and savanna they are everywhere abundantfood is plentiful there but when we go to higher elevations avd cold sterile deserts where their companion families of the tropics dwindle away and disappear the creepers are still present for they are evidently able to exist where other kinds would starve on the stony plateaus of the andes and on the most barren spots in patagonia where no other bird is seen there are small species of synallaxis which in their obscure colour and motions on the ground resemble mice rather than birds indeed the quichua name for one of these synallaxes is ukatchtuka or mousebird how different is the life habit here from what we see in the tropical groupsthe large birds with immense beaks that run vertically on the trunks of the great forest trees  at the extreme southern extremity of the south american continent we find several species of cinclodes seeking a subsistence like sandpipers on the beach they also fly out to sea and run about on the floating kelp exploring the fronds for the small marine animals on which they live in the dreary forests of tierra del fuego another creeper uxyurus is by far the commonest bird whether high up or low down in the most gloomy wet and scarcely penetrable ravines says darwin this little bird is to be met with and dr cunningham also relates that in these wintry savage woods he was always attended in his walks by parties of these little creepers which assembled to follow him out of curiosity  to birds placed at so great a disadvantage by a feeble flight and other adverse circumstances in the race of life bright colours would certainly prove fatal it is true that brown is not in itself a protective colour and the clear almost silky browns and bright chestnut tints in several species are certainly not protective but these species are sufficiently protected in other ways and can afford to be without a strictly adaptive colour so long as they are not conspicuous in a majority of cases however the colour is undoubtedly protective the brown hue being of a shade that assimilates very closely to the surroundings there are pale yellowish browns lined and mottled in species living amidst a sere scanty vegetation earthy browns in those frequenting open sterile or stony places while the species that creep on trees in forests are dark brown in colour and in many cases the feathers are mottled in such a manner as to make them curiously resemble the bark of a tree the genera lochmias and sclerurus are the darkest the plumage in these birds being nearly or quite black washed or tinged with rhubarb yellow their black plumage would render them conspicuous in the sunshine but they pass their lives in dense tropical forests where the sun at noon sheds only a gloomy twilight  if colour is ever tending to increase and to appear where it is absent as dr wallace believes then we ought to find it varying in the direction of greater brightness in some species in a family so numerous and variable as the dendrocolaptidae however feeble and in need of a protective colouring these birds may be in a majority of pases and this in effect we do find in many of the darkplumaged species that live in perpetual shade some parts are a very bright chestnut while in a few that live in such close concealment as to be almost independent of protective colouring the lower plumage has become pure white a large number of species have a bright or nearly bright guiar spot this is most remarkable in synallaxis phryganophila the chin being sulphuryellow beneath which is a spot of velvetblack and on either side a white patch the throat thus having three strongly contrasted colours arranged in four divisions the presence of this bright throat spot in so many species cannot very well be attributed to voluntary sexual selection although believers in that theory are of course at liberty to imagine that when engaged in courtship the male bird or rather male and female both as both sexes possess the spot hold up their heads vertically to exhibit it perhaps it would be safer to look on it as a mere casual variation which like the exquisitely pencilled feathers and delicate tints on the concealed sides and under surfaces of the wings of many species possessing outwardly an obscure protective colouring is neither injurious nor beneficial in any way either to the birds or to the theory it is more than probable however that in such small feeblewinged persecuted birds this spot of colour would prove highly dangerous on any conspicuous part of the body in some of the more vigorous active species we can see a tendency towards a brighter colouring on large exposed surfaces in automalus the tail is bright satiny rufous in pseudocolaptes the entire under surface is rufous of a peculiar vivid tint verging on orange or red in magarornis the bosom is black and beautifully ornamented with small leafshaped spots of a delicate strawcolour there are several other very pretty birds in this homely family but the finest of all is thripodectes flammulatus the whole body being tortoiseshell colour the wings and tail bright chesnut the powerful tanagerlike beak of this species seems also to show that it has diverged from its timid shadeloving congeners in another direction by becoming a seed and fruit eater  probably the sober and generally protective colouring of the treecreepers even with the variability and adaptiveness displayed in their habits superadded would be insufficient to preserve such feeble birds in the struggle of life without the further advantage derived from their wonderful nests it has been said of domed nests that they are a danger rather than a protection owing to their large size which makes it easy for carnivorous species that prey on eggs and young birds to find them while small open nests are usually well concealed this may be the case with covered nests made of soft materials loosely put together but it cannot be said of the solid structure the treecreeper bnilds and which as often as not the bird erects in the most conspicuous place it can find as if writes azara it desired all the world to admire its work the annual destruction of adult birds is very greatmore than double that i believe which takes place in other passerine families their eggs and young are however practically safe in their great elaborate nests or deep burrows and as a rule they lay more eggs than other kinds the full complement being seldom less than five in the species i am acquainted with while some lay as many as nine their nests are also made so as to keep out a greater pest than their carnivorous or eggdevouring enemiesnamely the parasitical starlings molothrus which are found throughout south america and are excessively abundant and destructive to birds nests in some districts in most cases in the big strongdomed nest or deep burrow all the eggs are hatched and all the young reared the thinning out process commencing only after the brood has been led forth into a world beset with perils with other families on the contrary the greatest amount of destruction falls on the eggs or fledglings i have frequently kept a dozen or twenty pairs of different specieswarblers finches tyrants starlings cunder observation during the breeding season and have found that in some cases no youngwere reared at all in other cases one or two young while as often as not the young actually reared were only parasitical starlings after all  i have still to speak of the voice of the treecreepers an important point in the study of these birds for though not accounted singers some species emit remarkable sounds moreover language in birds is closely related to the social instinct they seem to be rather solitary than gregarious and this seems only natural in birds so timid weakwinged and hard pressed it would also be natural to conclude from what has been said concerning their habits that they are comparatively silent for as a rule vigorous social birds are loquacious and loudvoiced while shy solitary kinds preservo silence except in the love season nevertheless the creepers are loquacious and have loud resonant voices this fact however does not really contradict a wellknown principle for the birds possess the social disposition in an eminent degree only the social habit is kept down in them by the conditions of a life which makes solitude necessary thus a large proportion of species are found to pair for life and the only reasonable explanation of this habit in birdsone which is not very common in the mammaliais that such species possess the social temper or feeling and live in pairs only because they cannot afford to live in flocks strictly gregarious species pair only for the breeding season in the creepers the attachment between the birds thus mated for life is very great and as azara truly says of anumbius so fond of each others society are these birds that when one incubates the other sits at the entrance to the nest and when one carries food to its young the other accompanies it even if it has found nothing to cany in these species that live in pairs when the two birds are separated they are perpetually calling to each other showing how impatient of solitude they are while even from the more solitary kind a highpitched callnote is constantly heard in the woods for these birds debarred from associating together satisfy their instinct by conversing with one another over long distances  the foregoing remarks apply to the dendrocolaptidae throughout the temperate countries of south americathe birds inhabiting extensive grassy plains and marshes and districts with a scanty or scattered tree and bush vegetation in the forest areas of the hotter regions it is different there the birds form large gatherings or wandering bands composed of all the different species found in each district associated with birds of other familieswoodpeckers tyrantbirds bush shrikes and many others these miscellaneous gatherings are not of rare occurrence but out of the breeding season are formed daily the birds beginning to assemble at about nine or ten oclock in the morning their number increasing through the day until it reaches its maximum between two and four oclock in the afternoon after which it begins to diminish each bird going off to its customary shelter or dwellingplace mr bates who first described these wandering bands says that he could always find the particular band belonging to a district any day he wished for when he failed to meet with it in one part of the forest he would try other paths until he eventually found it the great amazonian forests he tells us appear strangely silent and devoid of bird life and it is possible to ramble about for whole days without seeing or hearing birds but now and then the surrounding trees and bushes appear suddenly swarming with them the bustling crowd loses no time and always moving in concert each bird is occupied on its own account in searching bark or leaf or twig in a few moments the host is gone and the forest path remains deserted and silent as before stolzmann who observed them in peru says that the sound caused by the busy crowd searching through the foliage and the falling of dead leaves and twigs resembles that produced by a shower of rain the indians of the amazons mr bates writes have a curious belief to explain these bird armies they say that the papauira supposed to be a small grey bird fascinates all the others and leads them on a weary perpetual dance through the forest it seems very wonderful that birds at other times solitary should thus combine daily in large numbers including in their bands scores of widely different species and in size ranging from those no larger than a wren to others as big as a magpie it is certainly very advantageous to them as belt remarks they play into each others hands for while the larger creepers explore the trunks of big trees others run over the branches and cling to the lesser twigs so that every tree in their route from its roots to the topmost foliage is thoroughly examined and every spider and caterpillar taken while the winged insects driven from their lurkingplaces are seized where they settle or caught flying by the tyrant birds  i have observed the wandering bands only in patagonia where they are on a very small scale compared with those of the tropical forests in the patagonia thickets the small titlike creeper laptasthenura is the prime mover and after a considerable number of these have gathered creepers of other species and genera unite with them and finally the band as it moves through the thickets draws to itself other kindsflycatchers finches cmany of the birds running or hopping on the ground to search for insects in the loose soil or under dead leaves while others explore the thorny bushes my observations of these small bands lead me to believe that everywhere in south america the dendrocolaptidae are the first in combining to act in concert and that the birds of other families follow their march and associate with them knowing from experience that a rich harvest may be thus reaped in the same way birds of various kinds follow the movements of a column of hunting ants to catch the insects flying up from the earth to escape from their enemies swallows also learn to keep company with the traveller on horseback and crossing and recrossing just before the hoofs they catch the small twilight moths driven up from the grass  to return to the subject of voice the treecreepers do not possess melodious or at any rate mellow notes although in so numerous a family there is great variety of tone ranging from a small reedy voice like the faint stridulation of a grasshopper to the resounding laughterlike screaming concerts of homorus which may be heard distinctly two miles away as a rule the notes are loud ringing calls and in many species the cry rapidly reiterated resembles a peal of laughter with scarcely an exception they possess no set song but in most species that live always in pairs there are loud vehement gratulatory notes uttered by the two birds in concert when they meet after a brief separation this habit they possess in common with birds of other families as for instance the tyrants but in some creepers out of this confused outburst of joyous sound has been developed a musical performance very curious and perhaps unique among birds on meeting the male and female standing close together and facing each other utter their clear ringing concert one emitting loud single measured notes while the notes of its fellow are rapid rhythmical triplets their voices have a joyous character and seem to accord thus producing a kind of harmony this manner of singing is perhaps most perfect in the ovenbird furnarias and it is very curious that the young birds when only partially fledged are constantly heard in the nest or oven apparently practising these duets in the intervals when the parents are absent single measured notes triplets and long concluding trills are all repeated with wonderful fidelity although these notes are in character utterly unlike the hunger cry which is like that of other fledglings i cannot help thinking that this fact of the young birds beginning to sing like the adults while still confined in their dark cradle is one of very considerable significance especially when we consider the singular character of the performance and that it might even be found to throw some light on the obscure question of the comparative antiquity of the different and widely separated dendrocolaptine groups it is a doctrine in evolutionary science that the early maturing of instincts in the young indicates a high antiquity for the species or group and there is no reason why this principle should not be extended in the case of birds at any rate to language it is true that daines barringtons notion that young songbirds learn to sing only by imitating the adults still holds its ground and darwin gives it his approval in his descent of man it is perhaps one of those doctrines which are partially true or which do not contain the whole truth and it is possible to believe that while many singing birds do so learn their songs or acquire a greater proficiency in them from hearing the adults in other species the song comes instinctively and is like other instincts and habits purely an inherited memory  the case of a species in another order of birdscrypturistrikes me as being similar to this of the ovenbird and seems to lend some force to the suggestion i have made concerning the early development of voice in the young  birds peculiar to south america are said by anatomists to be less specialized lower more ancient than the birds of the northern continents and among those which are considered lowest and most ancient are the tinamous rail and partridge like in their habits birds that lead a solitary retiring life and in most cases have sweet melancholy voices rhynchotus rufescens a bird the size of a fowl inhabiting the pampas is perhaps the sweetestvoiced and sings with great frequency its song or call is heard oftenest towards the evening and is composed of five modulated notes flutelike in character very expressive and uttered by many individuals answering each other as they sit far apart concealed in the grass as we might have expected the faculties and instincts of the young of this species mature at a very early period when extremely small they abandon their parents to shift for themselves in solitude and when not more than onefourth the size they eventually attain they acquire the adult plumage and are able to fly as well as an old bird i observed a young bird of this species less than a quail in size at a house on the pampas and was told that it had been taken from the nest when just breaking the shell it had therefore never seen or heard the parent birds yet this small chick every day at the approach of evening would retire to the darkest corner of the dining room and concealed under a piece of furniture would continue uttering its evening song for an hour or longer at short intervals and rendering it so perfectly that i was greatly surprised to hear it for a thrush or other songster at the same period of life when attempting to sing only produces a chirping sound  the early singing of the ovenbird fledgling is important owing to the fact that the group it belongs to comprises the least specialized forms in the family they are stronglegged squaretailed terrestrial birds generally able to perch have probing beaks and build the most perfect mud or stick nests or burrow in the ground in the numerous treecreeping groups which seem as unrelated to the ovenbird as the woodpecker is to the hoopoe we find a score of wonderfully different forms of beak but many of them retain the probing character and are actually used to probe in rotten wood on trees and to explore the holes and deep crevices in the trunk we have also seen that some of these treecreepers revert to the ancestral habit if i may so call it of seeking their food by probing in the soil in others like dendrornis in which the beak has lost this character and is used to dig in the wood or to strip off the bark it has not been highly specialized and compared with the woodpeckers beak is a very imperfect organ considering the purpose for which it is used yet on the principle that similar functional requirements frequently lead to the development of similar structures in animals which are otherwise very distinctas we see in the tubular tongue in honeyeaters and humming birdswe might have expected to find in the dendrocolaptidae a better imitation of the woodpecker in so variable an organ as the beak if not in the tongue  probably the ovenbirds and their nearest relationsgeneralized hardy builders of strong nests and prolificrepresent the parental form and when birds of this type had spread over the entire continent they became in different districts frequenters of marshes forests thickets and savannas with altered lifehabits the numerous divergent forms originated some like xiphorynchus retaining a probing beak in a wonderfully modified form attenuated in an extreme degree and bent like a sickle others diverging more in the direction of nuthatches and woodpeckers  this sketch of the dendrocolaptidae necessarily slight and imperfect is based on a knowledge of the habits of about sixty species belonging to twentyeight genera from personal observation i am acquainted with less than thirty species it is astonishing to find how little has been written about these most interesting birds in south america one treecreeper only furnarius rufus the ovenbird par excellence has been mentioned on account of its wonderful architecture in almost every general work of natural history published during the present century yet the ovenbird does not surpass or even equal in interest many others in this family of nearly three hundred members     chapter xix  music and dancing in nature   in reading books of natural history we meet with numerous instances of birds possessing the habit of assembling together in many cases always at the same spot to indulge in antics and dancing performances with or without the accompaniment of music vocal or instrumental and by instrumental music is here meant all sounds other than vocal made habitually and during the more or less orderly performances as for instance drumming and tapping noises smiting of wings and humming whipcracking fanshutting grinding scraping and hornblowing sounds produced as a rule by the quills  there are human dances in which only one person performs at a time the rest of the company looking on and some birds in widely separated genera have dances of this kind a striking example is the rupicola or cock oftherock of tropical south america a mossy level spot of earth surrounded by bushes is selected for a dancingplace and kept well cleared of sticks and stones round this area the birds assemble when a cockbird with vivid orangescarlet crest and plumage steps into it and with spreading wings and tail begins a series of movements as if dancing a minuet finally carried away with excitement he leaps and gyrates in the most astonishing manner until becoming exhausted he retires and another bird takes his place  in other species all the birds in a company unite in the set performances and seem to obey an impulse which affects them simultaneously and in the same degree but sometimes one bird prompts the others and takes a principal part one of the most curious instances i have come across in reading is contained in mr biggwithers pioneering in south brazil he relates that one morning in the dense forest his attention was roused by the unwonted sound of a bird singingsongsters being rare in that district his men immediately they caught the sound invited him to follow them hinting that he would probably witness a very curious sight cautiously making their way through the dense undergrowth they finally came in sight of a small stony spot of ground at the end of a tiny glade and on this spot some on the stone and some on the shrubs were assembled a number of little birds about the size of tomtits with lovely blue plumage and red topknots one was perched quite still on a twig singing merrily while the others were keeping time with wings and feet in a kind of dance and all twittering an accompaniment he watched them for some time and was satisfied that they were having a ball and concert and thoroughly enjoying themselves they then became alarmed and the performance abruptly terminated the birds all going off in different directions the natives told him that these little creatures were known as the dancing birds  this species was probably solitary except when assembling for the purpose of display but in a majority of cases especially in the passerine order the solitary species performs its antics alone or with no witness but its mate azara describing a small finch which he aptly named oscilador says that early and late in the day it mounts up vertically to a moderate height then flies off to a distance of twenty yards describing a perfect curve in its passage turning it flies back over the imaginary line it has traced and so on repeatedly appearing like a pendulum swung in space by an invisible thread  those who seek to know the cause and origin of this kind of display and of song in animals are referred to darwins descent of man for an explanation the greater part of that work is occupied with a laborious argument intended to prove that the lovefeeling inspires the animals engaged in these exhibitions and that sexual selection or the voluntary selection of mates by the females is the final cause of all set musical and dancing performances as well as of bright and harmonious colouring and of ornaments  the theory with regard to birds is that in the loveseason when the males are excited and engage in courtship the females do not fall to the strongest and most active nor to those that are first in the field but that in a large number of species they are endowed with a faculty corresponding to the aesthetic feeling or taste in man and deliberately select males for their superiority in some aesthetic quality such as graceful or fantastic motions melody of voice brilliancy of colour or perfection of ornaments doubtless all birds were originally plaincoloured without ornaments and without melody and it is assumed that so it would always have been in many cases but for the action of this principle which like natural selection has gone on accumulating countless small variations tending to give a greater lustre to the species in each case and resulting in all that we most admire in the animal worldthe rupicolas flamecoloured mantle the peacocks crest and starry train the joyous melody of the lark and the pretty or fantastic dancing performances of birds  my experience is that mammals and birds with few exceptionsprobably there are really no exceptionspossess the habit of indulging frequently in more or less regular or set performances with or without sound or composed of sound exclusively and that these performances which in many animals are only discordant cries and choruses and uncouth irregular motions in the more aerial graceful and melodious kinds take immeasurably higher more complex and more beautiful forms among the mammalians the instinct appears almost universal but their displays are as a rule less admirable than those seen in birds there are some kinds it is true like the squirrels and monkeys of arboreal habits almost birdlike in their restless energy and in the swiftness and certitude of their motions in which the slightest impulse can be instantly expressed in graceful or fantastic action others like the chinchillidae family have greatly developed vocal organs and resemble birds in loquacity but mammals generally compared with birds are slow and heavy and not so readily moved to exhibitions of the kind i am discussing  the terrestrial dances often very elaborate of heavy birds like those of the gallinaceous kind are represented in the more volatile species by performances in the air and these are very much more beautiful while a very large number of birdshawks vultures swifts swallows nightjars storks ibises spoonbills and gullscircle about in the air singly or in flocks sometimes in serene weather they rise to a vast altitude and float about in one spot for an hour or longer at a stretch showing a faint birdcloud in the blue that does not change its form nor grow lighter and denser like a flock of starlings but in the seeming confusion there is perfect order and amidst many hundreds each swift or slowgliding figure keeps its proper distance with such exactitude that no two ever touch even with the extremity of the longwings flapping or motionlesssuch a multitude and such miraculous precision in the endless curving motions of all the members of it that the spectator can lie for an hour on his back without weariness watching this mystic clouddance in the empyrean  the blackfaced ibis of patagonia a bird nearly as large as a turkey indulges in a curious mad performance usually in the evening when feedingtime is over the birds of a flock while winging their way to the roostingplace all at once seem possessed with frenzy simultaneously dashing downwards with amazing violence doubling about in the most eccentric manner and when close to the surface rising again to repeat the action all the while making the air palpitate for miles around with their hard metallic cries other ibises also birds of other genera have similar aerial performances  the displays of most ducks known to me take the form of mock fights on the water one exception is the handsome and loquacious whistling widgeon of la plata which has a pretty aerial performance a dozen or twenty birds rise up until they appear like small specks in the sky and sometimes disappear from sight altogether and at that great altitude they continue hovering in one spot often for an hour or longer alternately closing and separating the fine bright whistling notes and flourishes of the male curiously harmonizing with the grave measured notes of the female and every time they close they slap each other on the wings so smartly that the sound can be distinctly heard like applauding handclaps even after the birds have ceased to be visible  the rails active sprightly birds with powerful and varied voices are great performers but owing to the nature of the ground they inhabit and to their shy suspicious character it is not easy to observe their antics the finest of the platan rails is the ypecaha a beautiful active bird about the size of the fowl a number of ypecahas have their assembling place on a small area of smooth level ground just above the water and hemmed in by dense rush beds first one bird among the rushes emits a powerful cry thrice repeated and this is a note of invitation quickly responded to by other birds from all sides as they hurriedly repair to the usual place in a few moments they appear to the number of a dozen or twenty bursting from the rushes and running into the open space and instantly beginning the performance this is a tremendous screaming concert the screams they utter have a certain resemblance to the human voice exerted to its utmost pitch and expressive of extreme terror frenzy and despair a long piercing shriek astonishing for its vehemence and power is succeeded by a lower note as if in the first the creature had well nigh exhausted itself this double scream is repeated several times and followed by other sounds resembling as they rise and fall half smothered cries of pains and moans of anguish suddenly the unearthly shrieks are renewed in all their power while screaming the birds rush from side to side as if possessed with madness the wings spread and vibrating the longbeak wide open and raised vertically this exhibition lasts three or four minntes after which the assembly peacefully breaks up  the singular wattled wingspurred and long toed jacana has a remarkable performance which seems specially designed to bring out the concealed beauty of the silky greenishgolden wingquillsthe birds go singly or in pairs and a dozen or fifteen individuals may be found in a marshy place feeding within sight of each other occasionally in response to a note of invitation they all in a moment leave off feeding and fly to one spot and forming a close cluster and emitting short excited rapidly repeated notes display their wings like beautiful flags grouped loosely together some hold the wings up vertically and motionless others half open and vibrating rapidly while still others wave them up and down with a slow measured motion  in the ypecaha and jacana displays both sexes take part a stranger performance is that of the spurwinged lapwing of the same regiona species resembling the lapwing of europe but a third larger brighter coloured and armed with spurs the lapwing display called by the natives its dance or serious danceby which they mean square dancerequires three birds for its performance and is so far as i know unique in this respect the birds are so fond of it that they indulge in it all the year round and at frequent intervals during the day also on moonlight nights if a person watches any two birds for some timefor they live in pairshe will see another lapwing one of a neighbouring couple rise up and fly to them leaving his own mate to guard their chosen ground and instead of resenting this visit as an unwarranted intrusion on their domain as they would certainly resent the approach of almost any other bird they welcome it with notes and signs of pleasure advancing to the visitor they place themselves behind it then all three keeping step begin a rapid march uttering resonant drumming notes in time with their movements the notes of the pair behind being emitted in a stream like a drumroll while the leader utters loud single notes at regular intervals the march ceases the leader elevates his wings and stands erect and motionless still uttering loud notes while the other two with puffedout plumage and standing exactly abreast stoop forward and downward until the tips of their beaks touch the ground and sinking their rhythmical voices to a murmur remain for some time in this posture the performance is then over and the visitor goes back to his own ground and mate to receive a visitor himself later on  in the passerine order not the least remarkable displays are witnessed in birds that are not accounted songsters as they do not possess the highly developed vocal organ confined to the suborder oscines the tyrantbirds which represent in south america the flycatchers of the old world all have displays of some kind in a vast majority of cases these are simply joyous excited duets between male and female composed of impetuous and more or less confused notes and screams accompanied with beating of wings and other gestures in some species choruses take the place of duets while in others entirely different forms of display have been developed in one groupcnipolegusthe male indulges in solitary antics while the silent modestcoloured female keeps in hiding thus the male of cnipolegus hudsoni an intensely blackplumaged species with a concealed white wingband takes his stand on a dead twig on the summit of a bush at intervals he leaves his perch displaying the intense white on the quills and producing as the wings are thrown open and shut alternately the effect of successive flashes of light then suddenly the bird begins revolving in the air about its perch like a moth wheeling round and close to the flame of a candle emitting a series of sharp clicks and making a loud humming with the wings while performing this aerial waltz the black and white on the quills mix the wings appearing like a grey mist encircling the body the fantastic dance over the bird drops suddenly on to its perch again and until moved to another display remains as stiff and motionless as a bird carved out of jet  the performance of the scissorstail another tyrantbird is also remarkable this species is grey and white with black head and tail and a crocusyellow crest on the wing it looks like a large swallow but with the two outer tailfeathers a foot long the scissorstails always live in pairs but at sunset several pairs assemble the birds calling excitedly to each other they then mount upwards like rockets to a great height in the anand after wheeling about for a few moments procipitate themselves downwards with amazing violence in a wild zigzag opening and shutting the long tailfeathers like a pair of shears and producing loud whirring sounds as of clocks being wound rapidly up with a slight pause after each turn of the key this aerial dance over they alight in separate couples on the tree tops each couple joining in a kind of duet of rapidly repeated castanetlike sounds  the displays of the woodhewers or dendrocolaptidae another extensive family resemble those of the tyrantbirds in being chiefly duets male and female singing excitedly in piercing or resonant voices and with much action the habit varies somewhat in the cachalote a patagonian species of the genus homorus about the size of the misselthrush old and young birds live in a family together and at intervals on any fine day they engage in a grand screaming contest which may be heard distinctly at a distance of a mile and a half one bird mounts on to a bush and calls and instantly all the others hurry to the spot and burst out into a chorus of piercing cries that sound like peals and shrieks of insane laughter after the chorus they all pursue each other wildly about among the bushes for some minutes  in some groups the usual duetlike performances have developed into a kind of harmonious singing which is very curious and pleasant to hear this is preeminently the case with the ovenbirds as dorbigney first remarked thus in the red ovenbird the first bird on the appearance of its mate flying to join it begins to emit loud measured notes and sometimes a continuous trill somewhat metallic in sound but immediately on the other bird striking in this introductory passage is changed to triplets strongly accented on the first note in a tempo vivace while the second bird utters loud single notes in the same time while thus singing they stand facing each other necks outstretched and tails expanded the wings of the first bird vibrating rapidly to the rapid utterance while those of the second bird beat measured time the finale consists of three or four notes uttered by the second bird alone strong and clear in an ascending scale the last very piercing  in the melodists proper the displays in a majority of cases are exclusively vocal the singer sitting still on his perch in the troupials a family of starlinglike birds numbering about one hundred and forty species there are many that accompany singing with pretty or grotesque antics the male screaming cowbird of la plata when perched emits a hollowsounding internal note that swells at the end into a sharp metallic ring almost belllike this is uttered with wings and tail spread and depressed the whole plumage being puffed out as in a strutting turkeycock while the bird hops briskly up and down on its perch as if dancing the belllike note of the male is followed by an impetuous scream from the female and the dance ends another species the common argentine cowbird of la plata when courting puffs out his glossy rich violet plumage and with wings vibrating emits a succession of deep internal notes followed by a set song in clear ringing tones and then suddenly taking wing he flies straight away close to the surface fluttering like a moth and at a distance of twenty to thirty yards turns and flies in a wide circle round the female singing loudly all the time hedging her in with melody as it were  many songsters in widely different families possess the habit of soaring and falling alternately while singing and in some cases all the aerial postures and movements the swift or slow descent vertical often with oscillations or in a spiral and sometimes with a succession of smooth oblique lapses seem to have an admirable correspondence with the changing and falling voicemelody and motion being united in a more intimate and beautiful way than in the most perfect and poetic forms of human dancing  one of the soaring singers is a small yellow fieldfinch of la platasycalis luteola and this species like some others changes the form of its display with the seasons it lives in immense flocks and during the cold season it has like most finches only aerial pastimes the birds wheeling about in a cloud pursuing each other with lively chirpings in august when the trees begin to blossom the flock betakes itself to a plantation and sitting on the branches the birds sing in a concert of innumerable voices producing a great volume of sound as of a high wind when heard at a distance heard near it is a great mass of melody not a confused tangle of musical sounds as when a host of troupials sing in concert but the notes although numberless seem to flow smoothly and separately producing an effect on the ear similar to that which rain does on the sight when the sun shines on and lightens up the myriads of falling drops all falling one way in this manner the birds sing for hours without intermission every day then the passion of love infects them the pleasant choir breaks up and its ten thousand members scatter wide over the surrounding fields and pasture lands during courtship the male has a feeble sketchy music but his singing is then accompanied with very charming love antics his circlings about the henbird his numberless advances and retreats and little soarings above her when his voice swells with importunate passion his fluttering lapses back to earth where he lies prone with outspread tremulous wings a suppliant at her feet his languishing voice meanwhile dying down to lispingsall these apt and graceful motions seem to express the very sickness of the heart but the melody during this emotional period is nothing after the business of pairing and nestbuilding is over his musical displays take a new and finer form he sits perched on a stalk above the grass and at intervals soars up forty or fifty yards high rising he utters a series of long melodious notes then he descends in a graceful spiral the set of the motionless wings giving him the appearance of a slowlyfalling parachute the voice then also falls the notes coming lower sweeter and more expressive until he reaches the surface after alighting the song continues the strains becoming longer thinner and clearer until they dwindle to the finest threads of sound and faintest tinklings as from a cithern touched by fairy fingers the great charm of the song is in this slow gradation from the somewhat throaty notes emitted by the bird when ascendinoto the excessively attenuated sounds at the close  in conclusion of this part i shall speak of one species morethe whitebanded mockingbird of patagonia which greatly excels all other songsters known to me in the copiousness variety and brilliant character of its music concealed in the foliage this bird will sing by the halfhour reproducing with miraculous fidelity the more or less melodious set songs of a score of speciesa strange and beautiful performance but wonderful as it seems while it lasts one almost ceases to admire this mimicking birdart when the mocker as if to show by contrast his unapproachable superiority bursts into his own divine song uttered with a power abandon and joyousness resembling but greatly exceeding that of the skylark singing at heavens gate the notes issuing in a continuous torrent the voice so brilliant and infinitely varied that if rivalry and emulation have as large a place in feathered breasts as some imagine all that hear this surpassing melody might well languish ever after in silent despair  in a vast majority of the finest musical performances the same notes are uttered in the same order and after an interval the song is repeated without any variation and it seems impossible that we could in any other way have such beautiful contrasts and harmonious lights and shadesthe whole song so to speak like a melody sweetly played in tune this seeming impossibility is accomplished in the mockingbirds song the notes never come in the same order again and again but as if inspired in a changed order with variations and new sounds and here again it has some resemblance to the skylarks song and might be described as the larks song with endless variations and brightened and spiritualized in a degree that cannot be imagined  this mockingbird is one of those species that accompany music with appropriate motions and just as its song is so to speak inspired and an improvization unlike any song the bird has ever uttered so its motions all have the same character of spontaneity and follow no order and yet have a grace and passion and a perfect harmony with the music unparalleled among birds possessing a similar habit while singing he passes from bush to bush sometimes delaying a few moments on and at others just touching the summits and at times sinking out of sight in the foliage then in an access of rapture soaring vertically to a height of a hundred feet with measured wingbeats like those of a heron or mounting suddenly in a wild hurried zigzag then slowly circling downwards to sit at last with tail outspread fanwise and vans glistening white in the sunshine expanded and vibrating or waved languidly up and down with a motion like that of some broadwinged butterfly at rest on a flower  i wish now to put this question what relation that we can see or imagine to the passion of love and the business of courtship have these dancing and vocal performances in nine cases out of ten in such cases for instance as that of the scissorstail tyrantbird and its pyrotechnic evening displays when a number of couples leave their nests containing eggs and young to join in a wild aerial dance the mad exhibitions of ypecahas and ibises and the jacanas beautiful exhibition of grouped wings the triplet dances of the spurwinged lapwing to perform which two birds already mated are compelled to call in a third bird to complete the set the harmonious duets of the ovenbirds and the duets and choruses of nearly all the woodhewers and the wingslapping aerial displays of the whistling widgeonswill it be seriously contended that the female of this species makes choice of the male able to administer the most vigorous and artistic slaps  the believer in the theory would put all these cases lightly aside to cite that of the male cowbird practising antics before the female and drawing a wide circle of melody round her or that of the jetblack automatonlike dancing tyrantbird and concerning this species he would probably say that the plainplumaged female went about unseen critically watching the dancing of different males to discover the most excellent performer according to the traditional standard and this was in substance what darwin did there are many species in which the male singly or with others practises antics or sings during the loveseason before the female and when all such cases or rather those that are most striking and bizarre are brought together and when it is gratuitously asserted that the females do choose the males that show off in the best manner or that sing best a case for sexual selection seems to be made out how unfair the argument is based on these carefully selected cases gathered from all regions of the globe and often not properly reported is seen when we turn from the book to nature and closely consider the habits and actions of all the species inhabiting any one district we see then that such cases as those described and made so much of in the descent of man and cases like those mentioned in this chapter are not essentially different in character but are manifestations of one instinct which appears to be almost universal among the animals the explanation i have to offer lies very much on the surface and is very simple indeed and like that of dr wallace with regard footnote it is curious to find that dr wallaces idea about colour has been independently hit upon by ruskin of stones he writes in frondes agrestisi have often had occasion to allude to the apparent connection of brilliancy of colour with vigour of life and purity of substance this is preeminently the case in the mineral kingdom the perfection with which the particles of any substance unite in crystallization corresponds in that kingdom to the vital power in organic nature to colour and ornaments covers the whole of the facts we see that the inferior animals when the conditions of life are favourable are subject to periodical fits of gladness affecting them powerfully and standing out in vivid contrast to their ordinary temper and we know what this feeling isthis periodic intense elation which even civilized man occasionally experiences when in perfect health more especially when young there are moments when he is mad with joy when he cannot keep still when his impulse is to sing and shout aloud and laugh at nothing to run and leap and exert himself in some extravagant way among the heavier mammalians the feeling is manifested in loud noises bellowings and screamings and in lumbering uncouth motionsthrowing up of heels pretended panics and ponderous mock battles  in smaller and livelier animals with greater celerity and certitude in their motions the feeling shows itself in more regular and often in more complex ways thus felidae when young and in very agile sprightly species like the puma throughout life simulate all the actions of an animal hunting its preysudden intense excitement of discovery concealment gradual advance masked by intervening objects with intervals of watching when they crouch motionless the eyes flashing and tail waved from side to side finally the rush and spring when the playfellow is captured rolled over on his back and worried to imaginary death other species of the most diverse kinds in which voice is greatly developed join in noisy concerts and choruses many of the cats may be mentioned also dogs and foxes capybaras and other loquacious rodents and in the howling monkeys this kind of performance rises to the sublime uproar of the tropical forest at eventide  birds are more subject to this universal joyous instinct than mammals and there are times when some species are constantly overflowing with it and as they are so much freer than mammals more buoyant and graceful in action more loquacious and have voices so much finer their gladness shows itself in a greater variety of ways with more regular and beautiful motions and with melody but every species or group of species has its own inherited form or style of performance and however rude and irregular this may be as in the case of the pretended stampedes and fights of wild cattle that is the form in which the feeling will always be expressed if all men at some exceedingly remote period in their history had agreed to express the common glad impulse which they now express in such an infinite variety of ways or do not express at all by dancing a minuet and minuetdancing had at last come to be instinctive and taken to spontaneously by children at an early period just as they take to walking on their hind legs mans case would be like that of the inferior animals  i was one day watching a flock of plovers quietly feeding on the ground when in a moment all the birds were seized by a joyous madness and each one after making a vigorous peck at his nearest neighbour began running wildly about each trying in passing to peck other birds while seeking by means of quick doublings to escape being pecked in turn this species always expresses its glad impulse in the same way but how different in form is this simple game of touchwhotouchcan from the triplet dances of the spurwinged lapwings with their drumming music pompous gestures and military precision of movement how different also from the aerial performance of another bird of the same familythe brazilian stiltin which one is pursued by the others mounting upwards in a wild eccentric flight until they are all but lost to view and back to earth again and then skywards once more the pursued bird when overtaken giving place to another individual and the pursuing pack making the air ring with their melodious barking cries how different again are all these from the aerial pastimes of the snipe in which the bird in its violent descent is able to produce such wonderful farreaching sounds with its tailfeathers the snipe as a rule is a solitary bird and like the oscillating finch mentioned early in this paper is content to practise its pastimes without a witness in the gregarious kinds all perform together for this feeling like fear is eminently contagious and the sight of one bird mad with joy will quickly make the whole flock mad there are also species that always live in pairs like the scissorstails already mentioned that periodically assemble in numbers for the purpose of display the crested screamer a very large bird may also be mentioned male and female sing somewhat harmoniously together with voices of almost unparalleled power but these birds also congregate in large numbers and a thousand couples or even several thousands may be assembled together and at intervals both by day and night all sing in concert their combined voices producing a thunderous melody which seems to shake the earth as a rule however birds that live always in pairs do not assemble for the purpose of display but the joyous instinct is expressed by duetlike performances between male and female thus in the three south american passerine families the tyrantbirds woodhewers and antthrushes numbering together between eight and nine hundred species a very large majority appear to have displays of this description  in my own experience in cases where the male and female together or assembled with others take equal parts in the set displays the sexes arc similar or differ little but where the female takes no part in the displays the superiority of the male in brightness of colour is very marked one or two instances bearing on this point may be given  a scarletbreasted troupial of la plata perches conspicuously on a tall plant in afield and at intervals soars up vertically singing and at the highest ascending point flight and song end in a kind of aerial somersault and vocal flourish at the same moment meanwhile the dullplumaged female is not seen and not heard for not even a skulking crake lives in closer seclusion under the herbageso widely have the sexes diverged in this species is the female then without an instinct so common rhas she no sudden fits of irrepressible gladness doubtless she has them and manifests them down in her place of concealment in lively chirpings and quick motionsthe simple primitive form in which gladness is expressed in the class of birds in the various species of the genus cnipolegus already mentioned the difference in the sexes is just as great as in the case of the troupial the solitary intensely black statuesque male has we have seen a set and highly fantastic performance but on more than one occasion i have seen four or five females of one species meet together and have a little simple performance all to themselvesin form a kind of lively mock fight  it might be objected that when a bird takes its stand and repeats a set finished song at intervals for an hour at a stretch remaining quietly perched such a performance appears to be different in character from the irregular and simple displays which are unmistakably caused by a sudden glad impulse but we are familiar with the truth that in organic nature great things result from small beginningsa common flower and our own bony skulls to say nothing of the matter contained within them are proofs of it only a limited number of species sing in a highly finished manner looking at many species we find every gradation every shade from the simple joyous chirp and cry to the most perfect melody even in a single branch of the true vocalists we may see itfrom the chirping bunting and noisy but tuneless sparrow to linnet and goldfinch and canary not only do a large majority of species show the singing instinct or form of display in a primitive undeveloped state but in that state it continues to show itself in the young of many birds in which melody is most highly developed in the adult and where the development has been solely in the male the female never rises above that early stage in her lively chirpings and little mock fights and chases and other simple forms which gladness takes in birds as well as in her plainer plumage and absence of ornament she represents the species at some remote period and as with song so with antics and all set performances aerial or terrestrial from those of the whale and the elephant to those of the smallest insect  another point remains to be noticed and that is the greater frequency and fulness in displays of all kinds including song during the love season and here dr wallaces colour and ornament theory helps us to an explanation at the season of courtship when the conditions of life are most favourable vitality is at its maximum and naturally it is then that the proficiency in all kinds of dancingantics aerial and terrestrial appears greatest and that melody attains its highest perfection this applies chiefly to birds but even among birds there are exceptions as we have seen in the case of the fieldfinch sycalis luteola the loveexcitement is doubtless pleasurable to them and it takes the form in which keenly pleasurable emotions are habitually expressed although not infrequently with variations due to the greater intensity of the feeling in some migrants the males arrive before the females and no sooner have they recovered from the effects of their journey than they burst out into rapturous singing these are not lovestrains since the females have not yet arrived and pairingtime is perhaps a mouth distant their singing merely expresses their overflowing gladness the forest at that season is vocal not only with the fine melody of the true songsters but with hoarse cawings piercing cries shrill duets noisy choruses drummings boomings trills woodtappingsevery sound with which different species express the glad impulse and birds like the parrot that only exert their powerful voices in screamingsbecause they can do no otherthen scream their loudest when courtship begins it has in many cases the effect of increasing the beauty of the performance giving added sweetness verve and brilliance to the song and freedom and grace to the gestures and motions but as i have said there are exceptions thus some birds that are good melodists at other times sing in a feeble disjointed manner during courtship in patagonia i found that several of the birds with good voicesone a mocking birdwere like the robin at home autumn and winter songsters  the argument has been stated very binefly but little would be gained by the mere multiplication of instances since however many they would bo selected instancesfrom a single district it is true while those in the descent of man were brought together from an immeasurably wider field but the principle is the same in both cases and to what i have written it may be objected that if instead of twentyfive i had given a hundred cases taking them as they came they might have shown a larger proportion of instances like that of the cowbird in which the male has a set performance practised only during the loveseason and in the presence of the female  it is no doubt true that all collections of facts relating to animal life present nature to us somewhat as a fantastic realmunavoidably so in a measure since the writing would be too bulky or too dry or too something inconvenient if we did not take only the most prominent facts that come before us remove them from their places where alone they can be seen in their proper relations to numerous other less prominent facts and rearrange them patch workwise to make up our literature but i am convinced that any student of the subject who will cast aside his bookssupposing that they have not already bred a habit in his mind of seeing only in accordance with verbal statementand go directly to nature to note the actions of animals for himselfactions which in many cases appear to lose all significance when set down in writingthe result of such independent investigation will be a conviction that conscious sexual selection on the part of the female is not the cause of music and dancing performances in birds nor of the brighter colours and ornaments that distinguish the male it is true that the females of some species both in the vertebrate and insect kingdoms do exercise a preference but in a vast majority of species the male takes the female he finds or that he is able to win from other competitors and if we go to the reptile class we find that in the ophidian order which excels in variety and richness of colour there is no such thing as preferential mating and if we go to the insect class we find that in butterflies which surpass all creatures in their glorious beauty the female gives herself up to the embrace of the first male that appears or else is captured by the strongest male just as she might be by a mantis or some other rapacious insect     chapter xx  biography of the vizcacha  lagostomus trichodactylus   the vizcacha is perhaps the most characteristic of the south american rodentia footnote according to mr waterhouse of all rodents the vizcacha is most nearly related to marsupials but in the points in which it approaches this order its relations are general that is not to any one marsupial species more than to another as these points of affinity are believed to be real and not merely adaptive they must be due in accordance with our view to inheritance from a common progenitor therefore wo must suppose either that all rodents including the vizcacha branched off from some ancient marsupial which will naturally have been more or less intermediate in character with respect to all existing marsupials or that both lodents and marsupials branched off from a common progenitor  on either view we must suppose that the vizcacha has retained by inheritance more of the characters of its ancient progenitor than have other rodentsdarwin origin of species while its habits in some respects are more interesting than those of any other rodent known it is moreover the most common mammal we have on the pampas and all these considerations have induced me to write a very full account of its customs it is necessary to add that since the following pages were written at my home on the pampas a great war of extermination has been waged against this animal by the landowners which has been more fortunate in its resultsor unfortunate if ones sympathies are with the vizcachathan the war of the australians against their imported rodentthe smaller and more prolific rabbit  the vizcachas on the pampas of buenos ayres live in societies usually numbering twenty or thirty members the village which is called vizcachera is composed of a dozen or fifteen burrows or mouths for one entrance often serves for two or more distinct holes often where the ground is soft there are twenty or thirty or more burrows in an old vizcachera but on stony or tosca soil even an old one may have no more than four or five burrows they are deep widemouthed holes placed very close together the entire village covering an area of from one hundred to two hundred square feet of ground  the burrows vary greatly in extent and usually in a vizcachera there are several that at a distance of from four to six feet from the entrance open into large circular chambers from these chambers other burrows diverge in all directions some running horizontally others obliquely downwards to a maximum depth of six feet from the surface some of these burrows or galleries communicate with those of other burrows a vast amount of loose earth is thus brought up and forms a very irregular mound fifteen to thirty inches above the surrounding level  it will afford some conception of the numbers of these vizcacheras on the settled pampas when i say that in some directions a person might ride five hundred miles and never advance half a mile without seeing one or more of them in districts where as far as the eye can see the plains are as level and smooth as a bowlinggreen especially in winter when the grass is closecropped and where the rough giantthistle has not sprung up these mounds appear like brown or dark spots on a green surface they are the only irregularities that occur to catch the eye and consequently form an important feature in the scenery in some places they are so near together that a person on horseback may count a hundred of them from one point of view  the sites of which the vizcacha invariably makes choice to work on as well as his manner of burrowing adapt him peculiarly to live and thrive on the open pampas other burrowing species seem always to fix upon some spot where there is a bank or a sudden depression in the soil or where there is rank herbage or a bush or tree about the roots of which to begin their kennel they are averse to commence digging on a clear level surface either because it is not easy for them where they have nothing to rest their foreheads against while scratching or because they possess a wary instinct that impels them to place the body in concealment whilst working on the surface thus securing the concealment of the burrow after it is made certain it is that where large hedges have been planted on the pampas multitudes of opossums weasels skunks armadillos c come and make their burrows beneath them and where there are no hedges or trees all these species make their kennels under bushes of the perennial thistle or where there is a shelter of some kind the vizcacha on the contrary chooses an open level spot the cleanest he can find to burrow on the first thing that strikes the observer when viewing the vizcachera closely is the enormous size of the entrance of the burrows or at least of several of the central ones in the mound for there are usually several smaller outside burrows the pitlike opening to some of these principal burrows is often four to six feet across the mouth and sometimes deep enough for a tall man to stand up waistdeep in how these large entrances can be made on a level surface may be seen when the first burrow or burrows of an incipient vizcachera are formed it is not possible to tell what induces a vizcacha to be the founder of a new community for they increase very slowly and furthermore are extremely fond of each others society and it is invariably one individual that leaves his native village to found a new and independent one if it were to have better pasture at hand then he would certainly remove to a considerable distance but he merely goes from forty to fifty or sixty yards off to begin his work thus it is that in desert places where these animals are rare a solitary vizcachera is never seen but there are always several close together though there may be no others on the surrounding plain for leagues when the vizcacha has made his habitation it is but a single burrow with only himself for an inhabitant perhaps for many months sooner or later however others join him and these will be the parents of innumerable generations for they construct no temporary lodgingplace as do the armadillos and other species but their posterity continues in the quiet possession of the habitations bequeathed to it how long it is impossible to say old men who have lived all their lives in one district remember that many of the vizcacheras around them existed when they were children it is invariably a male that begins a new village and makes his burrow in the following manner though he does not always observe the same method he works very straight into the earth digging a hole twelve or fourteen inches wide but not so deep at an angle of about 25 degrees with the surface but after he has progressed inwards a few feet the vizcacha is no longer satisfied with merely scattering away the loose earth he fetches up but cleans it away so far in a straight line from the entrance and scratches so much on this line apparently to make the slope gentler that he soon forms a trench a foot or more in depth and often three or four feet in length its use is as i have inferred to facilitate the conveying of the loose earth as far as possible from the entrance of the burrow but after a while the animal is unwilling that it should accumulate even at the end of this long passage he therefore proceeds to make two additional trenches that form an acute sometimes a right angle converging into the first so that when the whole is completed it takes the form of a capital y  these trenches are continually deepened and lengthened as the burrow progresses the angular segment of earth between them scratched away until by degrees it has been entirely conveyed off and in its place is the one deep great unsymmetrical mouth i have already described there are soils that will not admit of the animals working in this manner where there are large cakes of tosca near the surface as in many localities on the southern pampas the vizcacha makes its burrow as best he can and without the regular trenches in earths that crumble much sand or gravel he also works under great disadvantages  the burrows are made best in the black and red moulds of the pampas but even in such soils the entrances of many burrows are made differently in some the central trench is wanting or is so short that there appear but two passages converging directly into the burrow or these two trenches may be so curved inwards as to form the segment of a circle many other forms may also be noticed but usually they appear to be only modifications of the most common yshaped system  as i have remarked that its manner of burrowing has peculiarly adapted the vizcacha to the pampas it may be asked what particular advantage a species that makes a widemouthed burrow possesses over those that excavate in the usual way on a declivity or at the base of rocks or trees there would be none but on the perfectly level and shelterless pampas the durability of the burrow a circumstance favourable to the animals preservation is owing altogether to its being made in this way and to several barrows being made together the two outer trenches diverge so widely from the mouth that half the earth brought out is cast behind instead of before it thus creating a mound of equal height about the entrance by which it is secured from water during great rainfalls while the cattle avoid treading over the great pitlike entrances but the burrows of the dolichotis armadillo and other species when made on perfectly level ground are soon trod on and broken in by cattle in summer they are choked up with dust and rubbish and the loose earth having all been thrown up together in a heap on one side there is no barrier to the water which in eveiy great rainfall flows in and obliterates the kennel drowning or driving out the tenant  i have been minute in describing the habitations of the vizcacha as i esteem the subject of prime importance in considering the zoology of this portion of america the vizcacha does not benefit himself alone by his perhaps unique style of burrowing but this habit has proved advantageous to several other species and has been so favourable to two of our birds that they are among the most common species found here whereas without these burrows they would have been exceedingly rare since the natural banks in which they breed are scarcely found anywhere on the pampas i refer to the minera geositta cunicularia which makes its breedingholes in the banklike sides of the vizcachas burrow and to the little swallow atticora cyanoleuca which breeds in these excavations when forsaken by the minera few old vizcacheras are seen without some of these little parasitical burrows in them  birds are not the only beings in this way related to the vizcachas the fox and the weasel of the pampas live almost altogether in them several insects also frequent these burrows that are seldom found anywhere else of these the most interesting area large predacious nocturnal bug shining black with red wings a nocturnal cicindela a beautiful insect with dark green striated wingcases and pale red legs also several diminutive wingless wasps of the last i have counted six species most of them marked with strongly contrasted colours black red and white there are also other wasps that prey on the spiders found on the vizcachera all these and others are so numerous on the mounds that dozens of them might there be collected any summer day but if sought for in other situations they are exceedingly rare if the dry mound of soft earth which the vizcacha elevates amidst a waste of humid closegrowing grass is not absolutely necessary to the existence of all these species it supplies them with at least one favourable condition and without doubt thereby greatly increases their numbers they too whether predacious or preyed on have so many relations with other outside species and these again with still others that it would be no mere fancy to say that probably hundreds of species are either directly or indirectly affected in their struggle for existence by the vizcacheras so abundantly sprinkled over the pampas  in winter the vizcachas seldom leave their burrows till dark but in summer come out before sunset and the vizcachera is then a truly interesting spectacle usually one of the old males first appears and sits on some prominent place on the mound apparently in no haste to begin his evening meal when approached from the front he stirs not but eyes the intruder with a bold indifferent stare if the person passes to one side he deigns not to turn his head  other vizcachas soon begin to appear each one quietly taking up his station at his burrows mouth the females known by their greatly inferior size and lighter grey colour sitting upright on their haunches as if to command a better view and indicating by divers sounds and gestures that fear and curiosity struggles in them for mastery for they are always wilder and sprightlier in their motions than the males with eyes fixed on the intruder at intervals they dodge the head emitting at the same time an internal note with great vehemence and suddenly as the danger comes nearer they plunge simultaneously with a startled cry into their burrows but in some curiosity is the strongest emotion for in spite of their fellows contagious example and already half down the entrance again they start up to scrutinize the stranger and will then often permit him to walk within five or six paces of them  standing on the mound there is frequently a pair of burrowing owls pholeoptynx cunicularia these birds generally make their own burrows to breed in or sometimes take possession of one of the lesser outside burrows of the village but their favourite residence when not engaged in tending their eggs or young is on the vizcachera here a pair will sit all day and i have often remarked a couple close together on the edge of the burrow and when the vizcacha came out in the evening though but a hands breadth from them they did not stir nor did he notice them so accustomed are these creatures to each other usually a couple of the little burrowing geositta are also present they are lively creatures running with great rapidity about the mound and bare space that surrounds it suddenly stopping and jerking their tails in a slow deliberate manner and occasionally uttering their cry a trill or series of quick short clear notes resembling somewhat the shrill excessive laughter of a child among the grave stationary vizcachas of which they take no heed perhaps half a dozen or more little swallows atticora cyanoleuca are seen now clinging altogether to the banklike entrance of a burrow now hovering over it in a mothlike manner as if uncertain where to alight and anon sweeping about in circles but never ceasing their low and sorrowful notes  the vizcachera with all its incongruous inhabitants thus collected upon it is to a stranger one of the most novel sights the pampas afford  the vizcacha appears to be a rather common species over all the extensive argentine territory but they are so exceedingly abundant on the pampas inhabited by man and comparatively so rare in the desert places i have been in that i was at first much surprised at finding them so unequally distributed i have also mentioned that the vizcacha is a tame familiar creature this is in the pastoral districts where they are never disturbed but in wild regions where he is scarce he is exceedingly wary coming forth long after dark and plunging into his burrow on the slightest alarm so that it is a rare thing to get a sight of him the reason is evident enough in desert regions the vizcacha has several deadly enemies in the larger rapacious mammals of these the puma or lion felis concolor is the most numerous as it is also the swiftest most subtle and most voracious for as regards these traits the jaguar f onca is an inferior animal to the insatiable bloody appetite of this creature nothing comes amiss he takes the male ostrich by surprise and slays that wariest of wild things on his nest he captures little birds with the dexterity of a cat and hunts for diurnal armadillos he comes unawares upon the deer and huanaco and springing like lightning on them dislocates their necks before their bodies touch the earth often after he has thus slain them he leaves their bodies untouched for the polyborus and vulture to feast on so great a delight does he take in destroying life the vizcacha falls an easy victim to this subtle creature and it is not to be wondered at that it becomes wild to excess and rare in regions hunted over by such an enemy even when all other conditions are favourable to its increase but as soon as these wild regions are settled by man the pumas are exterminated and the sole remaining foe of the vizcacha is the fox comparatively an insignificant one  the fox takes up his residence in a vizcachera and succeeds after some quarrelling manifested in snarls growls and other subterranean warlike sounds in ejecting the rightful owners of one of the burrows which forthwith becomes his certainly the vizcachas are not much injured by being compelled to relinquish the use of one of their kennels for a season or permanently for if the locality suits him the fox remains with them always soon they grow accustomed to the unwelcome stranger he is quiet and unassuming in demeanour and often in the evening sits on the mound in their company until they regard him with the same indifference they do the burrowing owl but in spring when the young vizcachas are large enough to leave their cells then the fox makes them his prey and if it is a bitch fox with a family of eight or nine young to provide for she will grow so bold as to hunt her helpless quarry from hole to hole and do battle with the old ones and carry off the young in spite of them so that all the young animals in the village are eventually destroyed often when the young foxes are large enough to follow their mother the whole family takes leave of the vizcachera where such cruel havoc has been made to settle in another there to continue their depredations but the fox has ever a relentless foe in man and meets with no end of bitter persecutions it is consequently much more abundant in desert or thinly settled districts than in such as are populous so that in these the check the vizcachas receive from the foxes is not appreciable  the abundance of cattle on the pampas has made it unnecessary to use the vizcacha as an article of food his skin is of no value therefore man the destroyer of his enemies has hitherto been the greatest benefactor of his species thus they have been permitted to multiply and spread themselves to an amazing extent so that the halfdomestic cattle on the pampas are not nearly so familiar with man or so fearless of his presence as are the vizcachas it is not that they do him no injury but because they do it indirectly that they have so long enjoyed immunity from persecution it is amusing to see the sheepfarmer the greatest sufferer from the vizcachas regarding them with such indifference as to permit them to swarm on his run and burrow within a stones throw of his dwelling with impunity and yet going a distance from home to persecute with unreasonable animosity a fox skunk or opossum on account of the small annual loss it inflicts on the poultryyard that the vizcacha has comparatively no adverse conditions to war with wherever man is settled is evident when we consider its very slow rate of increase and yet see them in such incalculable numbers the female has but one litter in the year of two young sometimes of three she becomes pregnant late in april and brings forth in september the period of gestation is i think rather less than five months  the vizcacha is about two years growing a fullsized male measures to the root of the tail twentytwo inches and weighs from fourteen to fifteen pounds the female is nineteen inches in length and her greatest weight nine pounds probably it is a longlived and certainly it is a very hardy animal where it has any green substance to eat it never drinks water but after a long summer drought when for months it has subsisted on bits of dried thistlestalks and old withered grass if a shower falls it will come out of its burrows even at noonday and drink eagerly from the pools it has been erroneously stated that vizcachas subsist on roots their food is grass and seeds but they may also sometimes eat roots as the ground is occasionally seen scratched up about the burrows in march when the stalks of the perennial cardoon or castile thistle cynara cardunculus are dry the vizcachas fell them by gnawing about their roots and afterwards tear to pieces the great dry flowerheads to get the seeds imbedded deeply in them of which they seem very fond large patches of thistle are often found served thus the ground about them literally white with the silvery bristles they have scattered this cutting down tall plants to get the seeds at the top seems very like an act of pure intelligence but the fact is the vizcachas cut down every tall plant they can i have seen whole acres of maize destroyed by them yet the plants cut down were left untouched if posts be put into the ground within range of their nightly rambles they will gnaw till they have felled them unless of a wood hard enough to resist their chisellike incisors  the strongest instinct of this animal is to clear the ground thoroughly about its burrows and it is this destructive habit that makes it necessary for cultivators of the soil to destroy all the vizcachas in or near their fields on the uninhabited pampas where the long grasses grow i have often admired the vizcachera for it is there the centre of a clean space often of half an acre in extent on which there is an even closeshaven turf this clearing is surrounded by the usual rough growth of herbs and giant grasses in such situations this habit of clearing the ground is eminently advantageous to them as it affords them a comparatively safe spot to feed and disport themselves on and over which they can fly to their burrows without meeting any obstruction on the slightest alarm  of course the instinct continues to operate where it is no longer of any advantage in summer when the thistles are green even when growing near the burrows and the giant thistle carduus mariana springs up most luxuriantly right on the mound the vizcachas will not touch them either disliking the strong astringent sap or repelled by the thorns with which they are armed as soon as they dry and the thorns become brittle they are levelled afterwards when the animal begins to drag them about and cut them up as his custom is he accidentally discovers and feasts on the seed for vizcachas are fond of exercising their teeth on hard substances such as sticks and bones just as cats are of sharpening their claws on trees  another remarkable habit of the vizcacha that of dragging to and heaping about the mouth of his burrow every stalk he cuts down and every portable object that by dint of great strength he can carry has been mentioned by azara darwin and others on the level plains it is a useful habit for as the vizcachas are continually deepening and widening their burrows the earth thrown out soon covers up these materials and so assists in raising the mound on the buenosayrean pampas numbers of vizcacheras would annually be destroyed by water in the great sudden rainfalls were the mounds loss high but this is only an advantage when the animals inhabit a perfectly level country subject to flooding rains for where the surface is unequal they invariably prefer high to low ground to burrow on and are thus secured from destruction by water yet the instinct is as strong in such situations as on the level plains the most that can be said of a habit apparently so obscure in its origin and uses is that it appears to be part of the instinct of clearing the ground about the village every tall stalk the vizcacha cuts down every portable object he finds must be removed to make the surface clean and smooth but while encumbered with it he does not proceed further from his burrows but invariably retires towards them and so deposits it upon the mound so well known is this habit that whatever article is lost by nightwhip pistol or knifethe loser next morning visits the vizcacheras in the vicinity quite sure of finding it there people also visit the vizcacheras to pick up sticks for firewood  the vizcachas are cleanly in their habits and the fur though it has a strong earthy smell is kept exceedingly neat the hind leg and foot afford a very beautiful instance of adaptation propped by the hard curved tail they sit up erect and as firmly on the long horny disks on the undersides of the hind legs as a man stands on his feet most to be admired on the middle toe the skin thickens into a round cushion in which the curved teethlike bristles are set nicely graduated in length so that each particular hair may come into contact with the skin when the animal scratches or combs itself as to the uses of this appendage there can be no difference of opinion as there is about the serrated claw in birds it is quite obvious that the animal cannot scratch himself with his hind paw as all mammals do without making use of this natural comb then the entire foot is modified so that this comb shall be well protected and yet not be hindered from performing its office thus the inner toe is pressed close to the middle one and so depressed that it comes under the cushion of skin and cannot possibly get before the bristles or interfere their coming against the skin in scratching as certainly be the case if this toe were free as outer one  again the vizcachas appear to form the deep trenches before the burrows by scratching the earth violently backwards with the hind claws now these straight sharp daggershaped claws and especially the middle one are so long that the vizcacha is able to perform all this rough work without the bristles coming into contact with the ground and so getting worn by the friction the tehuelcho indians in patagonia comb their hair with a brushcomb very much like that on the vizcachas toe but in their case it does not properly fulfil its office or else the savages make little use of it vizcachas have a remarkable way of dusting themselves the animal suddenly throws himself on his back and bringing over his hind legs towards his head depresses them till his feet touch the ground in this strange posture he scratches up the earth with great rapidity raising a little cloud of dust then rights himself with a jerk and after an interval repeats the dusting usually they scratch a hole in the ground to deposit their excrements in whilst opening one of the outside burrows that had no communication with the others i once discovered a vast deposit of their dung so great that it must have been accumulating for years at the extremity to ascertain whether this be a constant or only a casual habit it would be necessary to open up entirely a vast number of vizcacheras when a vizcacha dies in his burrow the carcass is after some days dragged out and left upon the mound  the language of the vizcacha is wonderful for its variety when the male is feeding he frequently pauses to utter a succession of loud percussive and somewhat jarring cries these he utters in a leisurely manner and immediately after goes on feeding often he utters this cry in a low grunting tone one of his commonest expressions sounds like the violent hawking of a man clearing his throat at other times he bursts into piercing tones that may be heard a mile off beginning like the excited and quickrepeated squeals of a young pig and growing longer more attenuated and quavering towards the end after retiring alarmed into the burrows he repeats at intervals a deep internal moan all these and many other indescribable guttural sighing shrill and deep tones are varied a thousand ways in strength and intonation according to the age sex or emotions of the individual and i doubt if there is in the world any other fourfooted thing so loquacious or with a dialect so extensive i take great pleasure in going to some spot where they are abundant and sitting quietly to listen to them for they are holding a perpetual discussion all night long which the presence of a human being will not interrupt  at night when the vizcachas are all out feeding in places where they are very abundant and in some districts they literally swarm any very loud and sudden sound as the report of a gun or a clap of unexpected thunder will produce a most extraordinary effect no sooner has the report broken on the stillness of night than a perfect storm of cries bursts forth over the surrounding country after eight or nine seconds there is in the storm a momentary hill or pause and then it breaks forth again apparently louder than before there is so much difference in the tones of different animals that the cries of individuals close at hand may be distinguished amidst the roar of blended voices coming from a distance it sounds as if thousands and tens of thousands of them were striving to express every emotion at the highest pitch of their voices so that the effect is indescribable and fills a stranger with astonishment should a gun be fired off several times their cries become less each time and after the third or fourth time it produces no effect they have a peculiar sharp sudden fardarting alarmnote when a dog is spied that is repeated by all that hear it and produces an instantaneous panic sending every vizcacha flying to his burrow  but though they manifest such a terror of dogs when out feeding at night for the slowest dog can overtake them in the evening when sitting upon their mounds they treat them with tantalizing contempt if the dog is a novice the instant he spies the animal he rushes violently at it the vizcacha waits the charge with imperturbable calmness till his enemy is within one or two yards and then disappears into the burrow after having been foiled in this way many times the dog resorts to stratagem he crouches down as if transformed for the nonce into a felis and steals on with wonderfully slow and cautious steps his hair bristling tail hanging and eyes intent on his motionless intended victim when within seven or eight yards he makes a sudden rush but invariably with the same disappointing result the persistence with which the dogs go on hoping against hope in this unprofitable game in which they always act the stupid part is highly amusing and is very interesting to the naturalist for it shows that the native dogs on the pampas have developed a very remarkable instinct and one that might be perfected by artificial selection but dogs with the hunting habits of the cat would i think be of little use to man when it is required to train dogs to hunt the nocturnal armadillo dasypus villosus then this deeprooted and it might be added hereditary passion for vizcachas is excessively annoying and it is often necessary to administer hundreds of blows and rebukes before a dog is induced to track an armadillo without leaving the scent every few moments to make futile grabs at his old enemies  the following instance will show how little suspicion of man the vizcachas have a few years ago i went out shooting them on three consecutive evenings i worked in a circle constantly revisiting the same burrows never going a greater distance from home than could be walked in four or five minutes during the three evenings i shot sixty vizcachas dead and probably as many more escaped badly wounded into their burrows for they are hard to kill and however badly wounded if sitting near the burrow when struck are almost certain to escape into it but on the third evening i found them no wilder and killed about as many as on the first after this i gave up shooting them in disgust it was dull sport and to exterminate or frighten them away with a gun seemed an impossibility  it is a very unusual thing to eat the vizcacha most people and especially the gauchos having a silly unaccountable prejudice against their flesh i have found it very good and while engaged writing this chapter have dined on it served up in various ways the young animals are rather insipid the old males tough but the mature females are excellentthe flesh being tender exceedingly white fragrant to the nostrils and with a very delicate gameflavour  within the last ten years so much new land has been brought under cultivation that farmers have been compelled to destroy incredible numbers of vizcachas many large estancieros cattlebreeders have followed the example set by the graingrowers and have had them exterminated on their estates now all that azara on hearsay tells about the vizcachas perishing in their burrows when these are covered up but that they can support life thus buried for a period of ten or twelve days and that during that time animals will come from other villages and disinter them unless frightened off with dogs is strictly true country workmen are so well acquainted with these facts that they frequently undertake to destroy all the vizcacheras on an estate for so paltry a sum as tenpence in english money for each one and yet will make double the money at this work than they can at any other by day they partly open up then cover up the burrows with a great quantity of earth and by night go round with dogs to drive away the vizcachas from the still open burrows that come to dig out their buried friends after all the vizcacheras on an estate have been thus served the workmen are usually bound by previous agreement to keep guard over them for a space of eight or ten days before they receive their hire for the animals covered up are then supposed to be all dead some of these men i have talked with have assured me that living vizcachas have been found after fourteen daysa proof of their great endurance there is nothing strange i think in the mere fact of the vizcacha being unable to work his way out when thus buried alive for for all i know to the contrary other species may when their burrows are well covered up perish in the same manner but it certainly is remarkable that other vizcachas should come from a distance to dig out those that are buried alive in this good office they are exceedingly zealous and i have frequently surprised them after sunrise at a considerable distance from their own burrows diligently scratching at those that had been covered up the vizcachas are fond of each others society and live peaceably together but their goodwill is not restricted to the members of their own little community it extends to the whole species so that as soon as night comes many animals leave their own and go to visit the adjacent villages if one approaches a vizcachera at night usually some of the vizcachas on it scamper off to distant burrows these are neighbours merely come to pay a friendly visit this intercourse is so frequent that little straight paths are formed from one vizcachera to another the extreme attachment between members of different communities makes it appear less strange that they should assist each other either the desire to see as usual their buried neighbours becomes intense enough to impel them to work their way to them or cries of distress from the prisoners reach and incite them to attempt their deliverance many social species are thus powerfully affected by cries of distress from one of their fellows and some will attempt a rescue in the face of great dangerthe weasel and the peccary for example  mild and sociable as the vizcachas are towards each other each one is exceedingly jealous of any intrusion into his particular burrow and indeed always resents such a breach of discipline with the utmost fury several individuals may reside in the compartments of the same burrow but beyond themselves not even their nextdoor neighbour is permitted to enter their hospitality ends where it begins at the entrance it is difficult to compel a vizcacha to enter a burrow not his own even when hotly pursued by dogs they often refuse to do so when driven into one the instant their enemies retire a little space they rush out of it as if they thought the hidingplace but little less dangerous than the open plain i have frequently seen vizcachas chased into the wrong burrows summarily ejected by those inside and sometimes they make their escape only after being well bitten for their offence  i have now stated the most interesting facts i have collected concerning the vizcacha when others rewrite its history they doubtless will according to the opportunities of observation they enjoy be able to make some additions to it but probably none of great consequence i have observed this species in patagonia and buenos ayres only and as i have found that its habits are considerably modified by circumstances in the different localities where i have met with it i am sure that other variations will occur in the more distant regions where the conditions vary  the most remarkable thing to be said about the vizcacha is that although regarded by mr waterhouse and others who have studied its affinities as one of the lowest of the rodents exhibiting strong marsupial characters the living animal appears to be more intelligent than other rodents not of south america only but also of those of a higher type in other continents a parallel case is perhaps to be found in the hairy armadillo an extremely versatile and intelligent animal although only an edentate and among birds the ypecahaa large la plata railmight also be mentioned as an example of what ought not to be for it is a bold and intelligent bird more than a match for the fowl both in courage and in cunning and yet it is one of the family which professor parkerfrom the point of view of the anatomistcharacterizes as a feebleminded cowardly group     chapter xxi  the dying huanaco   lest any one should misread the title to this chapter i hasten to say that the huanaco or guanaco as it is often spelt is not a perishing species nor as things are is it likely to perish soon despite the fact that civilized men britons especially are now enthusiastically engaged in the extermination of all the nobler mammaliansa very glorious crusade the triumphant conclusion of which will doubtless be witnessed by the succeeding generation more favoured in this respect than ours the huanaco happily for it exists in a barren desolate region in its greatest part waterless and uninhabitable to human beings and the chapterheading refers to a singular instinct of the dying animals in very many cases allowed by the exceptional conditions in which they are placed to die naturally  and first a few words about its place in nature and general habits the huanaco is a small camelsmall that is compared with its existing relationwithout a hump and unlike the camel of the old world nonspecializad doubtless it is a very ancient animal on the earth and for all we know to the contrary may have existed contemporaneously with some of the earliest known representatives of the camel type whose remains occur in the lower and upper miocene depositspoebrotherium protolabis procamelus pliauchenia and macrauchenia it ranges from tierra del fuego and the adjacent islands northwards over the whole of patagonia and along the andes into peru and bolivia on the great mountain chain it is both a wild and a domestic animal since the llama the beast of burden of the ancient peruvians is no doubt only a variety but as mans slave it has changed so greatly from the original form that some naturalists have regarded the llama as a distinct species which like the camel of the east exists only in a domestic state it has had time enough to vary as it is more than probable that the tamed and useful animal was inherited by the children of the sun from races and nations that came before them and how far back andean civilization extends may be inferred from the belief expressed by the famous american archaeologist squiers that the ruined city of tiahuanaco in the vicinity of lake titicaca is as old as thebes and the pyramids  it is however with the wild animal the huanaco that i am concerned a fullgrown male measures seven to eight feet in length and four feet high to the shoulder it is well clothed in a coat of thick woolly hair of a pale reddish colour longest and palest on the under parts in appearance it is very unlike the camel in spite of the long legs and neck in its finelyshaped head and long ears and its proud and graceful carriage it resembles an antelope rather than its huge and from an aesthetic point of view deformed asiatic relation in habits it is gregarious and is usually seen in small herds but herds numbering several hundreds or even a thousand are occasionally met with on the stony desolate plateaus of southern patagonia but the huanaco is able to thrive and grow fat where almost any other herbivore would starve while the herd feeds one animal acts as sentinel stationed on the hillside and on the appearance of danger utters a shrill neigh of alarm and instantly all take to flight but although excessively shy and wary they are also very inquisitive and have enough intelligence to know that a single horseman can do them no harm for they will not only approach to look closely at him but will sometimes follow him for miles they are also excitable and at times indulge in strange freaks darwin writeson the mountains of tierra del fuego i have more than once seen a huanaco on being approached not only neigh and squeal but prance and leap about in a most ridiculous manner apparently in defiance as a challenge and captain king relates that while sailing into port desire he witnessed a chase of a huanaco after a fox both animals evidently going at their greatest speed so that they soon passed out of sight i have known some tame huanacos and in that state they make amusing intelligent pets fond of being caressed but often so frolicsome and mischievous as to be a nuisance to their master it is well known that at the southern extremity of patagonia the huanacos have a dying place a spot to which all individuals inhabiting the surrounding plains repair at the approach of death to deposit their bones darwin and fitzroy first recorded this strange instinct in their personal narratives and their observations have since been fully confirmed by others the best known of these dying or burialplaces are on the banks of the santa cruz and gallegos rivers where the river valleys are covered with dense primeval thickets of bushes and trees of stunted growth there the ground is covered with the bones of countless dead generations the animals says darwin in most cases must have crawled before dying beneath and among the bushes a strange instinct in a creature so preeminently social in its habits a dweller all its life long on the open barren plateaus and mountain sides what a subject for a painter the grey wilderness of dwarf thorn trees aged and grotesque and scantyleaved nourished for a thousand years on the bones that whiten the stony ground at their roots the interior lit faintly with the rays of the departing sun chill and grey and silent and motionlessthe huanacos golgotha in the long centuries stretching back into a dim immeasurable past so many of this race have journeyed hither from the mountain and the plain to suffer the sharp pang of death that to the imagination something of it all seems to have passed into that hushed and mournful nature and now one more the latest pilgrim has come all his little strength spent in his struggle to penetrate the close thicket looking old and gaunt and ghostly in the twilight with long ragged hair staring into the gloom out of deathdimmed sunken eyes england has one artist who might show it to us on canvas who would be able to catch the feeling of such a sceneof that mysterious passionless tragedy of naturei refer to j m swan the painter of the prodigal son and the lioness defending her cubs  to his account of the animals dying place and instinct darwin adds i do not at all understand the reason of this but i may observe that the wounded huanacos at the santa cruz invariably walked towards the river  it would no doubt be rash to affirm of any instinct that it is absolutely unique but putting aside some doubtful reports about a custom of the asiatic elephant which may have originated in the account of sindbad the sailors discovery of an elephants burial place we have no knowledge of an instinct similar to that of the huanaco in any other animal so far as we know it stands alone and apart with nothing in the actions of other species leading up or suggesting any family likeness to it but what chiefly attracts the mind to it is its strangeness it looks in fact less like an instinct of one of the inferior creatures than the superstitious observance of human beings who have knowledge of death and believe in a continued existence after dissolution of a triba that in past times had conceived the idea that the liberated spirit is only able to find its way to its future abode by starting at death from the ancient dyingplace of the tribe or family and thence moving westward or skyward or underground over the wellworn immemorial track invisible to material eyes  but although alone among animal instinctsin its strange and useless purposefor it is as absolutely useless to the species or race as to the dying individualit is not the only useless instinct we know of there are many others both simple and complex and of such instincts we believe with good reason that they once played an important part in the life of the species and were only rendered useless by changes in the condition of life or in the organism or in both in other words when the special conditions that gave them value no longer existed the correlated and perfect instinct was not in these cases eradicated but remained in abeyance and still capable of being called into activity by a new and false stimulus simulating the old and true viewed in this way the huanacos instinct might be regarded as something remaining to the animal from a remote past not altogether unaffected by time perhaps and like some ceremonial usage among men that has long ceased to have any significance or like a fragment of ancient history or a tradition which in the course of time has received some new and false interpretation the false interpretation to continue the metaphor is in this case that the purpose of the animal in going to a certain spot to which it has probably never previously resorted is to die there a false interpretation because in the first place it is incredible that an instinct of no advantage to the species in its struggle for existence and predominance should arise and become permanent and in the second place it is equally incredible that it could ever have been to the advantage of the species or race to have a dying place we must then suppose that there is in the sensations preceding death when death comes slowly some resemblance to the sensations experienced by the animal at a period when its curious instinct first took form and crystallized these would be painful sensations that threatened life and freedom from them and safety to the animal would only exist in a certain wellremembered spot further we might assume that it was at first only the memory of a few individuals that caused the animals to seek the place of safety that a habit was thus formed that in time this traditional habit became instinctive so that the animals old and young made their way unerringly to the place of refuge whenever the old danger returned and such an instinct slowly matured and made perfect to enable this animal to escape extinction during periods of great danger to mammalian life lasting hundreds or even thousands of years and destructive of numberless other species less hardy and adaptive than the generalized huanaco might well continue to exist to be occasionally called into life by a false stimulus for many centuries after it had ceased to be of any advantage  once we accept this explanation as probablenamely that the huanaco in withdrawing from the herd to drop down and die in the ancient dying ground is in reality only seeking an historically remembered place of refuge and not of deaththe action of the animal loses much of its mysterious character we come on to firm ground and find that we are no longer considering an instinct absolutely unique with no action or instinct in any other animal leading up or suggesting any family likeness to it as i said before we find in fact that there is at least one very important and very wellknown instinct in another class of creatures which has a strong resemblance to that of the huanaco as i have interpreted it and which may even serve to throw a side light on the origin of the huanacos instinct i refer to a habit of some ophidians in temperate and cold countries of returning annually to hybernate in the saine den  a typical instance is that of the rattlesnake in the colder parts of north america on the approach of winter these reptiles go into hiding and it has been observed that in some districts a very large number of individuals hundreds and even thousands will repair from the surrounding country to the ancestral den here the serpents gather in a mass to remain in a wholly or semitorpid condition until the return of spring brings them out again to scatter abroad to their usual summer haunts clearly in this case the knowledge of the hybernating den is not merely traditionalthat is handed down from generation to generation through the young each year following the adults and so forming the habit of repairing at certain seasons to a certain place for the young serpent soon abandons its parent to lead an independent life and on the approach of cold weather the hybernating den may be a long distance away ten or twenty or even thirty miles from the spot in which it was born the annual return to the hybernating den is then a fixed unalterable instinct like the autumnal migration of some birds to a warmer latitude it is doubtless favourable to the serpents to hybernate in large numbers massed together and the habit of resorting annually to the same spot once formed we can imagine that the individualsperhaps a single couple in the first placefrequenting some very deep dry and wellsheltered cavern safe from enemies would have a great advantage over others of their race that they would be stronger and increase more and spread during the summer months further and further from the cavern on all sides and that the further afield they went the more would the instinct be perfected since all the young serpents that did not have the instinct of returning unerringly to the ancestral refuge and that like the outsiders of their race to put it in that way merely crept into the first hole they found on the approach of the cold season would be more liable to destruction probably most snakes get killed long before a natural decline sets in to say that not one in a thousand dies of old age would probably be no exaggeration but if they were as safe from enemies and accidents as some less prolific and more highlyorganized animals so that many would reach the natural term of life and death came slowly we can imagine that in such a heatloving creature the failure of the vital powers would simulate the sensations caused by a falling temperature and cause the old or sick serpent even in midsummer to creep instinctively away to the ancient refuge where many a long lifekilling frost had been safely tided over in the past  the huanaco has never been a hybernating animal but we must assume that like the crotalus of the north he had formed a habit of congregating with his fellows at certain seasons at the same spot further that these were seasons of suffering to the animalthe suffering or discomfort and danger having in the first place given rise to the habit assuming again that the habit had existed so long as to become like that of the reptile a fixed immutable instinct a hereditary knowledge so that the young huanacos untaught by the adults would go alone and unerringly to the meetingplace from any distance it is but an easy step to the belief that after the conditions had changed and the refuges were no longer needed this instinctive knowledge would still exist in them and that they would take the old road when stimulated by the pain of a wound or the miserable sensations experienced in disease or during the decay of the lifeenergy when the senses grow dim and the breath fails and the blood is thin and cold  i presume that most persons who have observed animals a great deal have met with cases in which the animal has acted automatically or instinctively when the stimulus has been a false one i will relate one such case observed by myself and which strikes me as being apposite to the question i am considering it must be premised that this is an instance of an acquired habit but this does not affect my argument since i have all along assumed that the huanacoa highly sagacious species in the highest class of vertebratesfirst acquired a habit from experience of seeking a remembered refuge and that such habit was the parent as it were or the first clay model of the perfect and indestructible instinct that was to be  it is not an uncommon thing in the argentino pampasi have on two occasions witnessed it myselffor a ridinghorse to come home or to the gate of his owners house to die i am speaking of ridinghorses that are never doctored nor treated mercifully that look on their master as an enemy rather than a friend horses that live out in the open and have to be hunted to the corral or enclosure or roughly captured with a lasso as they run when their services are required i retain a very vivid recollection of the first occasion of witnessing an action of this kind in a horse although i was only a boy at the time on going out one summer evening i saw one of the horses of the establishment standing unsaddled and unbridled leaning his head over the gate going to the spot i stroked his nose and then turning to an old native who happened to be near asked him what could be the meaning of such a thing i think he is going to die he answered horses often come to the house to die and next morning the poor beast was found lying dead not twenty yards from the gate although he had not appeared ill when i stroked his nose on the previous evening but when i saw him lying there dead and remembered the old natives words it seemed to me as marvellous and inexplicable that a horse should act in that way as if some wild creaturea rhea a fawn or dolichoteshad come to exhale his last breath at the gates of his enemy and constant persecutor man  i now believe that the sensations of sickness and approaching death in the ridinghorse of the pampas resemble or similate the pains so often experienced of hunger thirst and fatigue combined together with the oppressive sensations caused by the ponderous native saddle or recado with its huge surcingle of raw hide drawn up so tightly as to hinder free respiration the suffering animal remembers how at the last relief invariably came when the twelve or fifteen hours torture were over the toil and the want and when the great iron bridle and ponderous gear were removed and he had freedom and food and drink and rest at the gate or at the door of his masters house the sudden relief had always come to him and there does he sometimes go in his sickness his fear overmastered by his suffering to find it again  discussing this question with a friend who has a subtle mind and great experience of the horse in semibarbarous countries and of many other animals wild and tame in many regions of the globe he put forward a different explanation of the action of the horse in coming home to die which he thinks simpler and more probable than mine it is that a dying or ailing animal instinctively withdraws itself from its fellowsan action of selfpreservation in the individual in opposition to the wellknown instincts of the healthy animals which impels the whole herd to turn upon and persecute the sickly member thus destroying its chances of recovery the desire of the suffering animal is not only to leave its fellows but to get to some solitary place where they cannot follow or would never find him to escape at once from a great and pressing danger but on the pastoral pampas where horses are so numerous that on that level treeless area they are always and everywhere visible no hidingplace is discoverable in such a case the animal goaded by its instinctive fear turns to the one spot that horses avoid and although that spot has hitherto been fearful to him the old fear is forgotten in the present and far more vivid one the vicinity of his masters house represents a solitary place to him and he seeks it just as the stricken deer seeks the interior of some close forest oblivious for the time in its anxiety to escape from the herd of the dangers lurking in it and which he formerly avoided  i have not set this explanation down merely because it does credit to my friends ingenuity but because it strikes me that it is the only alternative explanation that can be given of the animals action in coming home to die another fact concerning the illtamed and barbarously treated horses of the pampas which to my mind strengthens the view i have taken remains to be mentioned it is not an uncommon thing for one of these horses after escaping saddled and bridled and wandering about for anight or night and day on the plains to return of its own accord to the house it is clear that in a case of this kind the animal comes home to seek relief i have known one horse that always had to be hunted like a wild animal to be caught and that invariably after being saddled tried to break loose to return in this way to the gate after wandering about saddled and bridled for over twenty hours in uncomfortable freedom  the action of the ridinghorse returning to a master he is accustomed to fly from as from an enemy to be released of saddle and bridle is no doubt more intelligent than that of the dying horse coming home to be relieved from his sufferings but the motive is the same in both cases at the gate the only pain the animal has ever experienced has invariably begun and there it has ended and when the spur of some new pain afflicts himnew and yet like the oldit is to the wellremembered hated gate that it urges him  to return to the huanaco after tracing the dying instinct back to its hypothetical originnamely a habit acquired by the animal in some past period of seeking refuge from some kind of pain and danger at a certain spot it is only natural to speculate a little further as to the nature of that danger and of the conditions the animal existed in  if the huanaco is as old on the earth as its antique generalized form have led naturalists to suppose we can well believe that it has survived not only a great many lost mammalian types but many changes in the conditions of its life let us then imagine that at some remote period a change took place in the climate of patagonia and that it became colder and colder owing to some cause affecting only that portion of the antarctic region such a cause for instance as a great accumulation of icebergs on the northern shores of the antarctic continent extending century by century until a large portion of the now open sea became blocked up with solid ice if the change was gradual and the snow became deeper each winter and lasted longer an intelligent gregarious and exceedingly hardy and active animal like the huanaco able to exist on the driest woody fibres would stand the beat chance of maintaining its existence in such altered conditions and would form new habits to meet the new danger one would be that at the approach of a period of deep snow and deadly cold all the herds frequenting one place would gather together at the most favourable spots in the river valleys where the vegetation is dense and some food could be had while the surrounding country continued covered with deep snow they would in fact make choice of exactly such localities as are now used for dying places there they would be sheltered from the cuttingwinds the twigs and bark would supply them with food the warmth from a great many individuals massed together would serve to keep the snow partially melted under foot and would prevent their being smothered while the stiff and closely interlaced branches would keep a roof of snow above them and thus protected they would keep alive until the return of mild weather released them in the course of many generations all weakly animals and all in which the habit of seeking the refuge at the proper time was weak or uncertain in its action would perish but their loss would be an advantage to the survivors  it is worthy of remark that it is only at the southern extremity of patagonia that the huanacos have dying places in northern patagonia and on the chilian and peruvian andes no such instinct has been observed     chapter xxii  the strange instincts of cattle   my purpose in this paper is to discuss a group of curious and useless emotional instincts of social animals which have not yet been properly explained excepting two of the number placed first and last in the list they are not related in their origin consequently they are here grouped together arbitrarily only for the reason that we are very familiar with them on account of their survival in our domestic animals and because they are as i have said useless also because they resemble each other among the passions and actions of the lower animals in their effect on our minds this is in all cases unpleasant and sometimes exceedingly painful as when species that rank next to ourselves in their developed intelligence and organized societies such as elephants monkeys dogs and cattle are seen under the domination of impulses in some cases resembling insanity and in others simulating the darkest passions of man  these instincts are  1 the excitement caused by the smell of blood noticeable in horses and cattle among our domestic animals and varying greatly in degree from an emotion so slight as to be scarcely perceptible to the greatest extremes of rage or terror  2 the angry excitement roused in some animals when a scarlet or brightred cloth is shown to them so well known is this apparently insane instinct in our cattle that it has given rise to a proverb and metaphor familiar in a variety of forms to everyone  3 the persecution of a sick or weakly animal by its companions  4 the sudden deadly fury that seizes on the herd or family at the sight of a companion in extreme distress herbivorous mammals at such times will trample and gore the distressed one to death in the case of wolves and other savagetempered carnivorous species the distressed fellow is frequently torn to pieces and devoured on the spot  to take the first two together when we consider that blood is red that the smell of it is or may be or has been associated with that vivid hue in the animals mind that blood seen and smelt is or has been associated with the sight of wounds and with cries of pain and rage or terror from the wounded or captive animal there appears at first sight to be some reason for connecting these two instinctive passions as having the same originnamely terror and rage caused by the sight of a member of the herd struck down and bleeding or struggling for life in the grasp of an enemy i do not mean to say that such an image is actually present in the animals mind but that the inherited or instinctive passion is one in kind and in its working with the passion of the animal when experience and reason were its guides  but the more i consider the point the more am i inclined to regard these two instincts as separate in their origin although i retain the belief that cattle and horses and several wild animals are violently excited by the smell of blood for the reason just givennamely their inherited memory associates the smell of blood with the presence among them of some powerful enemy that threatens their life to this point i shall return when dealing with the last and most painful of the instincts i am considering  the following incident will show how violently this blood passion sometimes affects cattle when they are permitted to exist in a halfwild condition as on the pampas i was out with my gun one day a few miles from home when i came across a patch on the ground where the grass was pressed or trodden down and stained with blood i concluded that some thievish gauchos had slaughtered a fat cow there on the previous night and to avoid detection had somehow managed to carry the whole of it away on their horses as i walked on a herd of cattle numbering about three hundred appeared moving slowly on towards a small stream a mile away they were travelling in a thin long line and would pass the bloodstained spot at a distance of seven to eight hundred yards but the wind from it would blow across their track when the tainted wind struck the leaders of the herd they instantly stood still raising their heads then broke out into loud excited bellowings and finally turning they started off at a fast trot following up the scent in a straight line until they arrived at the place where one of their kind had met its death the contagion spread and before long all the cattle were congregated on the fatal spot and began moving round in a dense mass bellowing continually  it may be remarked here that the animal has a peculiar language on occasions like this it emits a succession of short bellowing cries like excited exclamations followed by a very loud cry alternately sinking into a hoarse murmur and rising to a kind of scream that grates harshly on the sense of the ordinary cowmusic i am a great admirer and take as much pleasure in it as in the cries and melody of birds and the sound of the wind in trees but this performance of cattle excited by the smell of blood is most distressing to hear  the animals that had forced their way into the centre of the mass to the spot where the blood was pawed the earth and dug it up with their horns and trampled each other down in their frantic excitement it was terrible to see and hear them the action of those on the border of the living mass in perpetually moving round in a circle with dolorous bellowings was like that of the women in an indian village when a warrior dies and all night they shriek and howl with simulated grief going round and round the dead mans hut in an endless procession  the bull and red rag instinct as it may be called comes next in order it is a familiar fact that brightness in itself powerfully attracts most if not all animals the higher mammalians are affected in the same way as birds and insects although not in the same degree this fact partly explains the rage of the bull a scarlet flag fluttering in the wind or lying on the grass attracts his attention powerfully as it does that of other animals but though curious about the nature of the bright object it does not anger him his anger is excitedand this is the whole secret of the matterwhen the colour is flaunted by a man when it forces him to fix his attention on a man ie an animal of another species that rules or drives him and that he fears but with only a slight fear which may at any moment be overcome by his naturally bold aggressive disposition not only does the vivid colour compel him to fix his attention on the being that habitually interferes with his liberty and is consequently regarded with unfriendly eyes but it also produces the illusion on his mind that the man is near him that he is approaching him in an aggressive manner it is an insult a challenge which being of so explosive a temper he is not slow to accept  on the pampas i was once standing with some gauchos at the gate of a corral into which a herd of halfwild cattle had just been driven one of the men to show his courage and agility got off his horse and boldly placed himself in the centre of the open gate his action attracted the attention of one of the nearest cows and lowering her horns she began watching him in a threatening manner he then suddenly displayed the scarlet lining of his poncho and instantly she charged him furiously with a quick movement to one side he escaped her horns and after we had driven her back resumed his former position and challenged her again in the same way the experiment was repeated not less than half a dozen times and always with the same result the cattle were all in a savage temper and would have instantly charged him on his placing himself before them on foot without the display of scarlet cloth but their fear of the mounted men standing with lassos in their hand on either side of him kept them in check but whenever the attention of any one individual among them was forcibly drawn to him by the display of vivid colour and fixed on him alone the presence of the horsemen was forgotten and fear was swallowed by rage it is a fact i think that most animals that exhibit angry excitement when a scarlet rag is flourished aggressively at them are easily excited to anger at all times domestic geese and turkeys may be mentioned among birds they do not fly at a grown person but they will often fly at a child that challenges them in this way and it is a fact that they do not at any time fear a child very much and will sometimes attack him without being challenged i think that the probability of the view i have taken is increased by another factnamely that the sudden display of scarlet colour sometimes affects timid animals with an extreme fear just as on the other hand it excites those that are bold and aggressive to anger domestic sheep forinstance that vary greatly in disposition in different races or breeds and even in different individuals may be affected in the two opposite ways some exhibiting extreme terror and others only anger at a sudden display of scarlet colour by the shepherd or herder  the persecution of a sick animal by its companions comes next under consideration  it will have been remarked with surprise by some readers no doubt that i have set down as two different instincts this persecution of a sick or weakly individual by its fellows and the sudden deadly rage that sometimes impels the herd to turn upon and destroy a wounded or distressed companion it is usual for writers on the instincts of animals to speak of them as one and i presume that they regard this sudden deadly rage of several individuals against a companion as merely an extreme form of the common persecuting instinct or impulse they are not really one but are as distinct in origin and character as it is possible for any two instincts to be the violent and fatal impulse starts simultaneously into life and action and is contagious affecting all the members of the herd like a sudden madness the other is neither violent nor contagious the persecution is intermittent it is often confined to one or to a very few members of the herd and seldom joined in by the chief member the leader or head to whom all the others give way  concerning this head of the herd or flock or pack it is necessary to say something more some gregarious animals particularly birds live together in the most perfect peace and amity and here no leader is required because in their long association together as a species in flocks they have attained to a oneness of mind so to speak which causes them to move or rest and to act at all times harmoniously together as if controlled and guided by an extraneous force i may mention that the kindly instinct in animals which is almost universal between male and female in the vertebrates is most apparent in these harmoniously acting birds thus in la plata i have remarked in more than one species that a lame or sick individual unable to keop pace with the flock and find its food has not only been waited for but in some cases some of the flock have constantly attended it keeping close to it both when flying and on the ground and i have no doubt feeding it just as they would have fed their young  naturally among such kinds no one member is of more consideration than another but among mammals such equality and harmony is rare the instinct of one and all is to lord it over the others with the result that one more powerful or domineering gets the mastery to keep it thereafter as long as he can the lower animals are in this respect very much like us and in all kinds that are at all fiercetempered the mastery of one over all and of a few under him over the others is most salutary indeed it is inconceivable that they should be able to exist together under any other system  on cattlebreeding establishments on the pampas where it is usual to keep a large number of fiercetempered dogs i have observed these animals a great deal and presume that they are very much like feral dogs and wolves in their habits their quarrels are incessant but when a fight begins the head of the pack as a rule rushes to the spot whereupon the fighters separate and march off in different directions or else cast themselves down and deprecate their tyrants wrath with abject gestures and whines if the combatants are both strong and have worked themselves into a mad rage before their head puts in an appearance it may go hard with him they know him no longer and all he can do is to join in the fray then if the fighters turn on him he may be so injured that his power is gone and the next best dog in the pack takes his place the hottest contests are always between dogs that are well matched neither will give place to the other and so they fight it out but from the foremost in strength and power down to the weakest there is a gradation of authority each one knows just how far he can go which companion he can bully when he is in a bad temper or wishes to assert himself and to which he must humbly yield in his turn in such a state the weakest one must always yield to all the others and cast himself down seeming to call himself a slave and worshipper of any other member of the pack that chooses to snarl at him or command him to give up his bone with a good grace  this masterful or domineering temper so common among social mammals is the cause of the persecution of the sick and weakly when an animal begins to ail he can no longer hold his own he ceases to resent the occasional illnatured attacks made on him his noncombative condition is quickly discovered and he at once drops down to a place below the lowest it is common knowledge in the herd that he may be buffeted with impunity by all even by those that have hitherto suffered buffets but have given none but judging from my own observation this persecution is not as a rule severe and is seldom fatal  it is often the case that a sick or injured animal withdraws and hides himself from the herd the instinct of the stricken deer this might be called but i do not think that we need assume that the ailing individual goes away to escape the danger of being illused by his companions he is sick and drooping and consequently unfit to be with the healthy and vigorous that is the simplest and probably the true explanation of his action although in some cases he might be driven from them by persistent rough usage however peaceably gregarious mammals may live together and however fond of each others company they may be they do not as a rule treat each other gently furthermore their games are exceedingly rough and require that they shall be in a vigorous state of health to escape injury horned animals have no buttons to the sharp weapons they prod and strike each other with in a sportive spirit i have often witnessed the games of wild and halfwild horses with astonishment for it seemed that broken bones must result from the sounding kicks they freely bestowed on one another this roughness itself would be a sufficient cause for the action of the individual sick and out of tune and untouched by the glad contagion of the others in escaping from them and to leave them would be to its advantage and to that of the race since if not fatally injured or sick unto death its chances of recovery to perfect health would be thereby greatly increased  it remains now to speak of that seemingly most cruel of instincts which stands last on my list it is very common among gregarious animals that are at all combative in disposition and still survives in our domestic cattle although very rarely witnessed in england my first experience of it was just before i had reached the age of five years i was not at that early period trying to find out any of natures secrets but the scene i witnessed printed itself very vividly on my mind so that i can recall it as well as if my years had been fiveandtwenty perhaps better it was on a summers evening and i was out by myself at some distance from the house playing about the high exposed roots of some old trees on the other side of the trees the cattle just returned from pasture were gathered on the bare level ground hearing a great commotion among them i climbed on to one of the high exposed roots and looking over saw a cow on the ground apparently unable to rise moaning and bellowing in a distressed way while a number of her companions were crowding round and goring her  what is the meaning of such an instinct darwin has but few words on the subject can we believe he says in his posthumous essay on instinct when a wounded herbivorous animal returns to its own herd and is then attacked and gored that this cruel and very common instinct is of any service to the species at the same time he hints that such an instinct might in some circumstances be useful and his hint has been developed into the current belief among naturalists on the subject here it is in dr romanes words we may readily imagine that the instinct displayed by many herbivorous animals of goring sick and wounded companions is really of use in countries where the presence of weak members in a herd is a source of danger to the herd from the prevalence of wild beasts here it is assumed that the sick are set upon and killed but this is not the fact sickness and decay from age or some other cause are slow things and increase imperceptibly so that the sight of a drooping member grows familiar to the herd as does that of a member with some malformation or unusual shade of colour or altogether white as in the case of an albino  sick and weak members as we have seen while subject to some illtreatment from their companions only because they can be illtreated with impunity do not rouse the herd to a deadly animosity the violent and fatal attack is often as not made on a member in perfect health and vigour and unwoundecl although owing to some accident in great distress and perhaps danger at the moment  the instinct is then not only useless but actually detrimental and this being so the action of the herd in destroying one of its members is not even to be regarded as an instinct proper but rather as an aberration of an instinct a blunder into which animals sometimes fall when excited to action in unusual circumstances  the first thing that strikes us is that in these wild abnormal moments of social animals they are acting in violent contradiction to the whole tenor of their lives that in turning against a distressed fellow they oppose themselves to the law of their being to the whole body of instincts primary and secondary and habits which have made it possible for them to exist together in communities it is i think by reflecting on the abnormal character of such an action that we are led to a true interpretation of this dark saying of nature  every one is familiar with bacons famous passage about the dog and the noble courage which that animal puts on when maintained by a man who is to him in place of a god or melior natura which courage is manifestly such as that creature without the confidence of a better nature than its own could never attain not so the dog is a social animal and acts instinctively in concert with his fellows and the courage he manifests is of the family not the individual in the domestic state the man he is accustomed to associate with and obey stands to him in the place of the controlling pack and to his mind which is canine and not human is the pack a similar noble courage greatly surpassing that exhibited on all other occasions is displayed by an infinite number of mammals and birds of gregarious habits when repelling the attacks of some powerful and dangerous enemy or when they rush to the rescue of one of their captive fellows concerning this rage and desperate courage of social animals in the face of an enemy we see 1 that it is excited by the distressed cries or by the sight of a member of the herd or family dying from or struggling in the clutches of an enemy 2 that it affects animals when a number af individuals are together and is eminently contagious like fear that communicates itself quick as lightning from one to another until all are in a panic and like the joyous emotion that impels the members of a herd or flock to rush simultaneously into play  now it is a pretty familiar fact that animals acting instinctively as well as men acting intelligently have at times their delusions and their illusions and see things falsely and are moved to action by a false stimulus to their own disadvantage when the individuals of a herd or family are excited to a sudden deadly rage by the distressed cries of one of their fellows or by the sight of its bleeding wounds and the smell of its blood or when they see it frantically struggling on the ground or in the cleft of a tree or rock as if in the clutches of a powerful enemy they do not turn on it to kill but to rescue it  in whatever way the rescuing instinct may have risen whether simply through natural selection or as is more probable through an intelligent habit becoming fixed and hereditary its effectiveness depends altogether on the emotion of overmastering rage excited in the animalrage against a tangible visible enemy or invisible and excited by the cries or struggles of a suffering companion clearly then it could not provide against the occasional rare accidents that animals meet with which causes them to act precisely in the way they do when seized or struck down by an enemy an illusion is the result of the emotion similar to the illusion produced by vivid expectation in ourselves which has caused many a man to see in a friend and companion the adversary he looked to see and to slay him in his falseseeing anger  an illusion just as great leading to action equally violent but ludicrous rather than painful to witness may be seen in dogs when encouraged by a man to the attack and made by his cries and gestures to expect that some animal they are accustomed to hunt is about to be unearthed or overtaken and if when they are in this disposition he cunningly exhibits and sets them on a dummy made perhaps of old rags and leather and stuffed with straw they will seize worry and tear it to pieces with the greatest fury and without the faintest suspicion of its true character  that wild elephants will attack a distressed fellow seemed astonishing to darwin when he remembered the case of an elephant after escaping from a pit helping its fellow to escape also but it is precisely the animals high or low in the organic scale that are social and possess the instinct of helping each other that will on occasions attack a fellow in misfortunesuch an attack being no more than a blunder of the helping instinct  felix de azara records a rather cruel experiment on the temper of some tame rats confined in a cage the person who kept them caught the tail of one of the animals and began sharply pinching it keeping his hand concealed under the cage its cries of pain and struggles to free itself greatly excited the other rats and after rushing wildly round for some moments they flew at their distressed companion and fixing their teeth in its throat quickly dispatched it in this case if the hand that held the tail had been visible and in the cage the bites would undoubtedly have been inflicted on it but no enemy was visible yet the fury and impulse to attack an enemy was present in the animals in such circumstances the excitement must be dischargedthe instinct obeyed and in the absence of any other object of attack the illusion is produced and it discharges itself on the struggling companion it is sometimes seen in dogs when three or four or five are near together that if one suddenly utters a howl or cry of pain when no man is near it and no cause apparent the others run to it and seeing nothing turn round and attack each other here the exciting causethe cry for helpis not strong enough to produce the illusion which is sometimes fatal to the suffering member but each dog mistakingly thinks that the others or one of the others inflicted the injury and his impulse is to take the part of the injured animal if the cry for helpcaused perhaps by a sudden cramp or the prick of a thornis not very sharp or intense the other dogs will not attack but merely look and growl at each other in a suspicious way  to go back to azaras anecdote why it may be askedand this question has been put to me in conversationif killing a distressed companion is of no advantage to the race and if something must be attackedwhy did not these rats in this instance attack the cage they were shut in and bite at the woodwork and wires or in the case related by mr andrew lang in longmans magazine some time ago in which the members of a herd of cattle in scotland turned with sudden amazing fury on one of the cows that had got wedged between two rocks and was struggling with distressed bellowings to free itselfwhy did they not attack the prisoning rocks instead of goring their unfortunate comrade to death for it is well known that animals will on occasions turn angrily upon and attack inanimate objects that cause them injury or hinder their freedom of action and we know that this mythic facultythe minds projection of itself into visible naturesurvives in ourselves that there are exceptional moments in our lives when it comes back to us no one for instance would be astonished to hear that any man even a philosopher had angrily kicked away or imprecated a stool or other inanimate object against which he had accidentally barked his shins the answer is that there is no connection between these two thingsthe universal mythic faculty of the mind and that bold and violent instinct of social animals of rushing to the rescue of a stricken or distressed companion which has a definite a narrow purposenamely to fall upon an enemy endowed not merely with the life and intelligence common to all things including rocks trees and waters but with animal form and motion  i had intended in this place to give other instances observed in several widelyseparated species including monkeys but it is not necessary as i consider that all the facts however varied are covered by the theory i have suggestedeven a fact i like the one mentioned in this chapter of cattle bellowing and madly digging up the ground where the blood of one of their kind had been spilt also such a fact as that of wild cattle and other animals caught in a trap or enclosure attacking and destroying each other in their frenzy and the fact that some fiercetempered carnivorous mammals will devour the companion they have killed it is an instinct of animals like wolves and peccaries to devour the enemy they have overcome and slain thus when the jaguar captures a peccary out of a drove and does not quickly escape with his prize into a tree he is instantly attacked and slain and then consumed even to the skin and bones this is the wolfs and the peccarys instinct and the devouring of one of their own companions is an inevitable consequence of the mistake made in the first place of attacking and killing it in no other circumstances not even when starving do they prey on their own species  if the explanation i have offered should seem a true or highly probable one it will i feel sure prove acceptable to many lovers of animals who regarding tins seemingly ruthless instinct not as an aberration but as in some vague way advantageous to animals in their struggle for existence are yet unable to think of it without pain and horror indeed i know those who refuse to think of it at all who would gladly disbelieve it if they could  it should be a relief to them to be able to look on it no longer as something ugly and hateful a blot on nature but as an illusion a mistake an unconscious crime so to speak that has for its motive the noblest passion that animals knowthat sublime courage and daring which they exhibit in defence of a distressed companion this fiery spirit in animals which makes them forget their own safety moves our hearts by its close resemblance to one of the most highlyprized human virtues just as we are moved to intellectual admiration by the wonderful migratory instinct in birds that simulates some of the highest achievements of the mind of man and we know that this beautiful instinct is also liable to mistakesthat many travellers leave us annually never to return such a mistake was undoubtedly the cause of the late visitation of pallas sandgrouse owing perhaps to some unusual atmospheric or dynamic condition or to some change in the nervous system of the birds they deviated widely from their usual route to scatter in countless thousands over the whole of europe and perish slowly in climates not suited to them while others overpassing the cold strange continent sped on over colder stranger seas to drop at last like aerolites quenching their lives in the waves  whether because it is true as professor freeman and some others will have it that humanity is a purely modern virtue or because the doctrine of darwin by showing that we are related to other forms of life that our best feelings have their roots low down in the temper and instincts of the social species has brought us nearer in spirit to the inferior animals it is certain that our regard for them has grown and is growing and that new facts and fresh inferences that make us think more highly of them are increasingly welcome     chapter xxiii  horse and man   there is no mode of progression so delightful as riding on horseback walking rowing bicycling are pleasant exercises in their way but the muscular exertion and constant exercise of judgment they call for occupy the mind partly to the exclusion of other things so that a long walk may sometimes be only a long walk and nothing more in riding we are not conscious of exertion and as for that close observation and accurate discernment necessary in traversing the ground with speed and safety it is left to the faithful servant that carries us pitfalls hillocks slippery places the thousand little inequalities of the surface that have to be measured with infallible eye these disturb us little to fly or go slowly at will to pass unshaken over rough and smooth alike fording rivers without being wet and mounting hills without climbing this is indeed unmixed delight it is the nearest approach to birdlife we seem capable of since all the monster bubbles and flying fabrics that have been the sport of winds from the days of montgolfier downwards have brought us no nearer to it the aeronaut gasping for breath above the clouds offers only a sad spectacle of the imbecility of science and mans shattered hopes to the free inhabitants of air we can only liken the mounted arab vanishing hawklike over the boundless desert  in riding there is always exhilarating motion yet if the scenery encountered be charming you are apparently sitting still while riverlike it flows toward and past you ever giving place to fresh visions of beauty above all the mind is free as when one lies idly on the grass gazing up into the sky and speaking of myself there is even more than this immunity from any tax on the understanding such as we require in walking the rhythmic motion the sensation as of night acting on the brain like a stimulus that anyone should be able to think better lying sitting or standing than when speeding along on horseback is to me incomprehensible this is doubtless due to early training and long use for on those great pampas where i first saw the light and was taught at a tender age to ride we come to look on man as a parasitical creature fitted by nature to occupy the back of a horse in which position only he has full and free use of all his faculties possibly the gauchothe horseman of the pampasis born with this idea in his brain if so it would only be reasonable to suppose that its correlative exists in a modification of structure certain it is that an intoxicated gaucho lifted on to the back of his horse is perfectly safe in his seat the horse may do his best to rid himself of his burden the riders legsor posterior arms as they might appropriately be calledretain their iron grip notwithstanding the fuddled brain  the gaucho is more or less bowlegged and of course the more crooked his legs are the better for him in his struggle for existence off his horse his motions are awkward like those of certain tardigrade mammals of arboreal habits when removed from their tree he waddles in his walk his hands feel for the reins his toes turn inwards like a ducks and here perhaps we can see why foreign travellers judging him from their own standpoint invariably bring against him the charge of laziness on horseback he is of all men most active his patient endurance under privations that would drive other men to despair his laborious days and feats of horsemanship the long journeys he performs without rest or food seem to simple dwellers on the surface of the earth almost like miracles deprive him of his horse and he can do nothing but sit on the ground crosslegged or en cuclillason his heels you have to use his own figurative language cut off his feet  darwin in his earlier years appears not to have possessed the power of reading men with that miraculous intelligence always distinguishing his researches concerning other and lower orders of beings in the voyage of a naturalist speaking of this supposed indolence of the gauchos he tells that in one place where workmen were in great request seeing a poor gaucho sitting in a listless attitude he asked him why he did not work the mans answer was that he was too poor to work the philosopher was astonished and amused at the reply but failed to understand it and yet to one acquainted with these lovers of brief phrases what more intelligible answer could have been returned the poor fellow simply meant to say that his horses had been stolena thing of frequent occurrence in that country or perhaps that some minion of the government of the moment had seized them for the use of the state  to return to the starting point the pleasures of riding do not flow exclusively from the agreeable sensations attendant on flightlike motion there is also the knowledge sweet in itself that not a mere cunningly fashioned machine like that fabled horse of brass on which the tartar king did ride sustains us but a something with life and thought like ourselves that feels what we feel understands us and keenly participates in our pleasures take for example the horse on which some quiet old country gentleman is accustomed to travel how soberly and evenly he jogs along picking his way over the ground but let him fall into the hands of a lively youngster and how soon he picks up a frisky spirit were horses less plastic more the creatures of custom than they are it would always be necessary before buying one to inquire into the disposition of its owner  when i was thirteen years old i was smitten with love for a horse i once sawan untamablelooking brute that rolled his eyes turbulently under a cloud of black mane tumbling over his forehead i could not take my sight off this proud beautiful creature and i longed to possess him with a great longing his ownera worthless vagabond as it happenedmarked my enthusiastic admiration and a day or two afterwards having lost all his money at cards he came to me offering to sell me the horse having obtained my fathers consent i rushed off to the man with all the money i possessedabout thirty or thirtyfive shillings i believe after some grumbling and finding he could get no more he accepted the money my new possession filled me with unbounded delight and i spent the time caressing him and leading him about the grounds in search of succulent grasses and choice leaves to feed him on i am sure this horse understood and loved me for in spite of that savage look which his eyes never quite lost he always displayed a singular gentleness towards me he never attempted to upset me though he promptly threwto my great delight i must confessanyone else who ventured to mount him probably the secret of his conduct was that he hated the whip of this individual if not of the species the celebrated description held truethe horse is a docile animal but if you flog him he will not do so after he had been mine a few days i rode on him one morning to witness a cattlemarking on a neighbouring estate i found thirty or forty gauchos on the ground engaged in catching and branding the cattle it was rough dangerous work but apparently not rough enough to satisfy the men so after branding an animal and releasing him from their lassos several of the mounted gauchos would purely for sport endeavour to knock it down as it rushed away by charging furiously on to it as i sat there enjoying the fun my horse stood very quietly under me also eagerly watching the sport at length a bull was released and smarting from the fiery torture lowered his horns and rushed away towards the open plain three horsemen in succession shot out from the crowd and charged the bull at full speed one by one by suddenly swerving his body round he avoided them and was escaping scotfree at this moment my horsepossibly interpreting a casual touch of my hand on his neck or some movement of my body as a wish to join in the sportsuddenly sprang forward and charged on the flying bull like a thunderbolt striking him full in the middle of his body and hurling him with a tremendous shock to earth the stricken beast rolled violently over while my horse stood still as a stone watching him strange to say i was not unseated but turninground galloped back greeted by a shout of applause from the spectatorsthe only sound of that description i have ever had the privilege of listening to they little knew that my horse had accomplished the perilous feat without his riders guidance no doubt he had been accustomed to do such things and perhaps for the moment had forgotten that he had passed into the hands of a new ownerone of tender years he never voluntarily attempted an adventure of that kind again he knew i suppose that he no longer carried on his back a reckless daredevil who valued not life poor picáso he was mine till he died i have had scores of horses since but never one i loved so well  with the gauchos the union between man and horse is not of so intimate a nature as with the indians of the pampas horses are too cheap where a man without shoes to his feet may possess a herd of them for the closest kind of friendship to ripen the indian has also less individuality of character the immutable nature of the conditions he is placed in and his savage life which is a perpetual chase bring him nearer to the level of the beast he rides and probably the acquired sagacity of the horse in the long copartnership of centuries has become hereditary and of the nature of an instinct the indian horse is more docile he understands his master better the slightest touch of the hand on his neck which seems to have developed a marvellous sensitiveness is sufficient to guide him the gaucho labours to give his horse a silken mouth as he aptly calls it the indians horse has it from birth occasionally the gaucho sleeps in the saddle the indian can die on his horse during frontier warfare one hears at times of a dead warrior being found and removed with difficulty from the horse that carried him out of the fight and about whose neck his rigid fingers were clasped in death even in the gaucho country however where i grieve to confess the horse is not deservedly esteemed there are very remarkable instances of equine attachment and fidelity to man and of a fellowship between horse and rider of the closest kind one only i will relate  when rosas that man of blood and iron was dictator of the argentine countrya position which he held for a quarter of a centuiydesertors from the army were inexorably shot when caught as they generally were but where my boyhood was spent there was a deserter a man named santa anna who for seven years without ever leaving the neighbourhood of his home succeeded in eluding his pursuers by means of the marvellous sagacity and watchful care exercised by his horse when taking his rest on the plainfor he seldom slept under a roofhis faithful horse kept guard at the first sight of mounted men on the horizon he would fly to his master and seizing his cloak between his teeth rouse him with a vigorous shake the hunted man would start up and in a moment man and horse would vanish into one of the dense reedbeds abounding in the place and where no man could follow i have not space to tell more about this horse but at last in the fulness of time when the figs were ripeliterally as well as figuratively for it happened in the autumn of the yearthe long tyrannous rule ended and santa anna came out of the reedbeds where he had lived his wildanimal life to mix with his fellows i knew him some years later he was a rather heavylooking man with little to say and his reputation for honesty was not good in the place but i dare say there was something good in him  students of nature are familiar with the modifying effects of new conditions on man and brute take for example the gaucho he must every day traverse vast distances see quickly judge rapidly be ready at all times to encounter hunger and fatigue violent changes of temperature great and sudden perils these conditions have made him differ widely from the peasant of the peninsula he has the endurance and keen sight of a wolf is fertile in expedients quick in action values human life not at all and is in pain or defeat a stoic unquestionably the horse he rides has also suffered a great change he differs as much from the english hunter for instance as one animal can well differ from another of the same species he never pounds the earth and wastes his energies in vain parade he has not the dauntless courage that performs such brilliant feats in the field and that often as not attempts the impossible in the chase he husbands all his strength carrying his head low and almost grazing the ground with his hoofs so that he is not a showy animal constant use or the slow cumulative process of natural selection has served to develop a keenness of sense almost preternatural the vultures eye with all the advantage derived from the vultures vast elevation above the scene surveyed is not so farreaching as the sense of smell in the pampa horse a common phenomenon on the pampas is a sudden migration of the horses of a district to some distant place this occurs in seasons of drought when grass or water fails the horses migrate to some district where from showers having fallen or other circumstances there is a better supply of food and drink a slight breeze blowing from the more favoured region which may be forty or fifty miles away or even much further is enough to start them off yet during the scorching days of midsummer very little moisture or smell of grass can possibly reach them from such a distance  another phenomenon even more striking is familiar to every frontiersman for some reason the gaucho horse manifests the greatest terror at an indian invasion no doubt his fear is in part at any rate an associate feeling the coming of the indians being always a time of excitement and commotion sweeping like a great wave over the country houses are in flames families flying cattle being driven at frantic speed to places of greater safety be this as it may long before the marauders reach the settlement often when they are still a whole days journey from it the horses take the alarm and come wildly flying in the contagion quickly spreads to the horned cattle and a general stampede ensues the gauchos maintain that the horses smell the indians i believe they are right for when passing a distant indian camp from which the wind blew the horses driven before me have suddenly taken fright and run away leading me a chase of many miles the explanation that ostriches deer and other fleet animals driven in before the invaders might be the cause of the stampede cannot be accepted since the horses are familiar with the sight of these animals flying from their gaucho hunters  there is a pretty fable of a cat and dog lying in a dark room aptly illustrating the fine senses of these two species listen i heard a feather drop said the dog oh no said the cat it was a needle i saw it the horse is not commonly believed to have senses keen as that and a dog tracing his masters steps over the city pavement is supposed to be a feat no other animal can equal no doubt the artificial life a horse lives in england giving so little play to many of his most important faculties has served to blunt them he is a splendid creature but the noble bearing the dash and reckless courage that distinguish him from the modest horse of the desert have not been acquired without a corresponding loss in other things when ridden by night the indian horseand sometimes the same habit is found in the gauchos animaldrops his head lower and lower as the darkness increases with the danger arising from the presence of innumerable kennels concealed in the grass until his nose sweeps the surface like a foxhounds that this action is dictated by a powerful instinct of selfpreservation is plain for when i have attempted to forcibly drag the animals head up he has answered such an experiment by taking the bit in his teeth and violently pulling the reins out of my hand his miraculous sense of smell measures the exact position of every hidden kennel every treacherous spot and enables him to pass swiftly and securely over it  on the desert pampa the gaucho for a reason that he knows calls the puma the friend of man the arab gives this designation to his horse but in europe where we do not associate closely with the horse the dog naturally takes the foremost place in our affections the very highest praise yet given to this animal is probably to be found in bacons essay on atheism for take an example of a dog he says and mark what a generosity and courage he will put on when he finds himself maintained by a man who is to him in place of a god or melior natura which courage is manifestly such as that creature without the confidence of a better nature than its own could never attain can we not say as much of the horse the very horses that fly terrorstricken from the smell of an indian will when maintained by a man readily charge into a whole host of yelling savages  i once had a horse at home born and bred on the place so docile that whenever i required him i could go to him where the horses were at pasture and though they all galloped off at my approach he would calmly wait to be caught springing on to his back i would go after the other horses or gallop home with only my hand on his neck to guide him i did not often ride him as he was slow and lazy but with timid women and children he was a favourite he was also frequently used for farm work in or out of harness and i could shoot from his back in the peach season he would roam about the plantation getting the fruit of which he was very fond by tugging at the lower branches of the trees and shaking it down in showers one intensely dark night i was riding home on this horse i came through a road with a wire fence on each side two miles in length and when i had got nearly to the end of this road my horse suddenly stopped short uttering a succession of loud terrified snorts i could see nothing but the intense blackness of the night before me and tried to encourage him to go on touching him on the neck i found his hair wet with the sudden profuse sweat of extreme fear the whip made no impression on him he continued to back away his eyes apparently fixed on some object of horror just before him while he trembled to such a degree that i was shaken in the saddle he attempted several times to wheel round and run away but i was determined not to yield to him and continued the contest suddenly when i was beginning to despair of getting home by that road he sprang forward and regularly charged the to me invisible object before him and in another moment when he had apparently passed it taking the bit between his teeth he almost flew over the ground never pausing till he brought me to my own door when i dismounted his terror seemed gone but he hung his head in a dejected manner like a horse that has been under the saddle all day i have never witnessed another such instance of almost maddening fear his terror and apprehension were like what we can imagine a man experiencing at sight of a ghost in some dark solitary place  yet he did not forcibly carry me away from it as he might so easily have done but finding himself maintained by a nature superior to his own he preferred to face it i have never met in the dog a more striking example of this noblest kind of brute courage the incident did not impress me very much at the moment but when i came to reflect that my sight was mere blindness compared with that of my horse and that it was not likely his imagination clothed any familiar natural object with fantastic terrors it certainly did impress me very deeply  i am loth to finish with my subject in which to express myself in the manner of the gauchos i have passed over many matters like good grass and fragrant herbs the galloping horse sniffs at but cannot stay to taste and especially loth to conclude with this last incident which has in it an element of gloom i would rather first go back for a few moments to my original themethe pleasures of riding for the sake of mentioning a species of pleasure my english reader has probably never tasted or even heard of when riding by night on the pampas i used to enjoy lying back on my horse till my head and shoulders rested well on his back my feet also being raised till they pressed against his neck and in this position which practice can make both safe and comfortable gaze up into the starry sky to enjoy this method of riding thoroughly a surefooted unshod horse with perfect confidence in his rider is necessary and he must be made to go at a swift and smooth pace over level grassy ground with these conditions the sensation is positively delightful nothing of earth is visible only the vast circle of the heavens glittering with innumerable stars the muffled sound of the hoofs on the soft sward becomes in fancy only the rushing of the wings of our pegasus while the enchanting illusion that we are soaring through space possesses the mind unfortunately however this method of riding is impracticable in england and even if people with enthusiasm enough could be found to put it in practice by importing swift lightfooted arabian or pampa horses and careering about level parks on dark starry nights probably a shout of derision would be raised against so undignified a pastime  apropos of dignity i will relate in conclusion an incident in my london life which may possibly interest psychologists some time ago in oxford street i got on top of an omnibus travelling west my mind was preoccupied i was anxious to get home and in an absent kind of way i became irritated at the painfully slow rate of progress it was all an old familiar experience the deep thought lessening pace and consequent irritation the indolent brute i imagined myself riding was as usual taking advantage of his riders abstraction but i would soon feelingly persuade him that i was not so far gone as to lose sight of the difference between a swinging gallop and a walk so elevating my umbrella i dealt the side of the omnibus a sounding blow very much to the astonishment of my fellowpassengers so overgrown are we with usages habits tricks of thought and action springing from the soil we inhabit and when we have broken away and removed ourselves far from it so long do the dead tendrils still cling to us     chapter xxiv  seen and lost   we can imagine what the feelings of a lapidary would bean enthusiast whose life is given to the study of precious stones and whose sole delight is in the contemplation of their manifold beautyif a stranger should come in to him and opening his hand exhibit a new unknown gem splendid as ruby or as sapphire yet manifestly no mere variety of any familiar stone but differing as widely from all others as diamond from opal or catseye and then just when he is beginning to rejoice in that strange exquisite loveliness the hand should close and the stranger with a mocking smile on his lips go forth and disappear from sight in the crowd a feeling such as that would be is not unfrequently experienced by the field naturalist whose favoured lot it is to live in a country not yet thoroughly worked out with its every wild inhabitant scientifically named accurately described and skilfully figured in some colossal monograph one swift glance of the practised eye ever eagerly searching for some newthing and he knows that here at length is a form never previously seen by him but his joy is perhaps only for a few moments and the prize is snatched from sight for ever the lapidary might have some doubts he might think that the stranger had after all only mocked him with the sight of a wonderful artificial gem and that a close examination would have proved its worthlessness but the naturalist can have no doubts if he is an enthusiast well acquainted with the fauna of his district and has good eyesight he knows that there is no mistake for there it is the new strange form photographed by instantaneous process on his mind and there it will remain a tantalizing image its sharp lines and fresh colouring unblurred by time  walking in some open forest glade he may look up just in time to see a great strange butterflya blue morpho let us say wandering in some far country where this angel insect is unknownpassing athwart his vision with careless buoyant flight the most sylphlike thing in nature and all blue and pure like its aerial home but with a more delicate and wonderful brilliance in its cerulean colour giving such unimaginable glory to its broad airy wings and then almost before his soul has had time to feel its joy it may soar away unloitering over the tall trees to be seen no more  but the admiration the delight and the desire are equally great and the loss just as keenly felt whether the strange species seen happens to be one surpassingly beautiful or not its newness is to the naturalist its greatest attraction how beautiful beyond all others seems a certain small unnamed brown bird to my mind so many years have passed and its image has not yet grown dim yet i saw it only for a few moments when it hopped out from the thick foliage and perched within two or three yards of me not afraid but only curious and after peering at me first with one eye and then the other and wiping its small dagger on a twig it flew away and was seen no more for many days i sought for it and for years waited its reappearance and it was more to me than ninety and nine birds which i had always known yet it was very modest dressed in a brown suit very pale on the breast and white on the throat and for distinction a strawcoloured stripe over the eyethat ribbon which queen nature bestows on so many of her feathered subjects in recognition i suppose of some small and common kind of merit if i should meet with it in a collection i should know it again only in that case it would look plain and homely to methis little bird that for a time made all others seem unbeautiful  even a richer prize may come in sight for a brief periodone of the nobler mammalians which are fewer in number and bound to earth like ourselves and therefore so much better known than the wandering children of air in some secluded spot resting amidst luxuriant herbage or forest undergrowth a slight rustling makes us start and lo looking at us from the clustering leaves a strange face the leaflike ears erect the dark eyes round with astonishment and the sharp black nose twitching and sniffing audibly to take in the unfamiliar flavour of a human presence from the air like the pursedup and smacking lips of a winedrinker tasting a new vintage no sooner seen than gone like a dream a phantom the quaint furry face to be thereafter only an image in memory  sometimes the prize may be a very rich one and actually within reach of the handchallenging the hand as it were to grasp it and yet presently slip away to be seen no more although it maybe sought for day after day with a hungry longing comparable to that of some poor tramp who finds a gold doubloon in the forest and just when he is beginning to realize all that it means to him drops it in the grass and cannot find it again there is not the faintest motion in the foliage no rustle of any dry leaf and yet we know that something has movedsomething has come or has gone and gazing fixedly at one spot we suddenly see that it is still there close to us the pointed ophidian head and long neck not drawn back and threatening but sloping forward dark and polished as the green and purple weedstems springing from marshy soil and with an irregular chain of spots extending down the side motionless too as the stems it is but presently the tongue crimson and glistening darts out and flickers like a small jet of smoke and flame and is withdrawn then the smooth serpent head drops down and the thing is gone  how i saw and lost the noble wrestling frog has been recounted in chapter iv other tantalizing experiences of the same kind remain to be told in the present chapter which is not intended for the severe naturalist but rather for such readers as may like to hear something about the pains and pleasures of the seeker as well as the result of the seeking  one of my earliest experiences of seeing and losing relates to a hummingbirda veritable jewel of ornithology i was only a boy at the time but already pretty well acquainted with the birds of the district i lived in near la plata river and among them were three species of the hummingbird one spring day i saw a fourtha wonderful little thing only half as big as the smallest of the other threethe wellknown phaithornis splendensand scarcely larger than a bumblebee i was within three feet of it as it sucked at the flowers suspended motionless in the air the wings appearing formless and mistlike from their rapid vibratory motion but the rest of the upper plumage was seen distinctly as anything can be seen the head and neck and upper part of the back were emerald green with the metallic glitter usually seen in the burnished scalelike feathers of these small birds the lower half of the back was velvetblack the tail and tailcoverts white as snow on two other occasions at intervals of a few days i saw this brilliant little stranger always very near and tried without success to capture it after which it disappeared from the plantation four years later i saw it once again not far from the same place it was late in summer and i was out walking on the level plain where the ground was carpeted with short grass and nothing else grew there except a solitary stunted cardoou thistlebush with one flower on its central stem above the greygreen artichokelike leaves the disc of the great thorny blossom was as broad as that of a sunflower purple in colour delicately frosted with white on this flat disc several insects were feedingflies fireflies and small waspsand i paused for a few minutes in my walk to watch them suddenly a small misty object flew swiftly downwards past my face and paused motionless in the air an inch or two above the rim of the flower once more my lost hummingbird which i remembered so well the exquisitely graceful form half circled by the misty mothlike wings the glittering green and velvetblack mantle and snowwhite tail spread open like a fanthere it hung like a beautiful birdshaped gem suspended by an invisible gossamer thread onetwothree moments passed while i gazed trembling with rapturous excitement and then before i had time to collect my faculties and make a forlorn attempt to capture it with my hat away it flew gliding so swiftly on the air that form and colour were instantly lost and in appearance it was only an obscure grey line traced rapidly along the low sky and fading quickly out ol sight and that was the last i ever saw of it  the case of this small winged gem still wandering nameless in the wilds reminds me of yet another bird seen and lost also remarkable for its diminutive size for years i looked for it and when the wishedfor opportunity came and it was in my power to secure it i refrained and fate punished me by never permitting me to see it again on several occasions while riding on the pampas i had caught glimpses of this minute bird flitting up mothlike with uncertain tremulous flight and again dipping into the weeds tall grass or thistles its plumage was yellowish in hue like sere dead herbage and its extremely slender body looked longer and slimmer than it was owing to the great length of its tail or of the two middle tailfeathers i knew that it was a synallaxisa genus of small birds of the woodhewer family now as i have said in a former chapter these are wise little birds more interestingi had almost said more beautifulin their wisdom or wisdomsimulating instincts than the quatzel in its resplendent green or the cockoftherock in its vivid scarlet and orange mantle wrens and mockingbirds have melody for their chief attraction and the name of each kind is to our minds also the name of a certain kind of sweet music we think of swifts and swallows in connection with the mysterious migratory instinct and hummingbirds have a glittering mantle and the miraculous motions necessary to display its everchanging iridescent beauty in like manner the homely dendrocolaptidae possess the genius for building and an account of one of these small birds without its nest would be like a biography of sir christopher wren that made no mention of his works it was not strange then that when i saw this small bird the question rose to my mind what kind of nest does it build  one morning in the month of october the great breedingtime for birds in the southern hemisphere while cautiously picking my way through a bed of eardoon bushes the mysterious little creature flitted up and perched among the clustering leaves quite near to me it uttered a feeble grasshopperlike chirp and then a second individual smaller palercoloured and if possible shyer than the first showed itself for two or three seconds after which both birds dived once more into concealment how glad i was to see them for here they were male and female in a suitable spot in my own fields where they evidently meant to breed every day after that i paid them one cautious visit and by waiting from five to fifteen minutes standing motionless among the thistles i always succeeded in getting them to show themselves for a few moments i could easily have secured them then but my wish was to discover their nesting habits and after watching for some days i was rewarded by finding their nest then for three days more i watched it slowly progressing towards completion and each time i approached it one of the small birds would flit out to vanish into the herbage the structure was about six inches long and not more than two inches in diameter and was placed horizontally on a broad stiff eardoon leaf sheltered by other leaves above it was made of the finest dry grass loosely woven and formed a simple perfectly straight tube open at both ends the aperture was so small that i could only insert my little finger and the bird could not of course have turned round in so narrow a passage and so always went in at one end and left by the other on visiting the spot on the fourth day i found to my intense chagrin that the delicate fabric had been broken and thrown down by some animal also that the birds had utterly vanishedfor i sought them in vain both there and in every weedy and thistly spot in the neighbourhood the bird without the nest had seemed a useless thing to possess now for all my pains i had only a wisp of fine dry grass in my hand and no bird the shy modest little creature dwelling violetlike amidst clustering leaves and even when showing itself still halfhidden from the eye was thereafter to be only a tantalizing image in memory still my case was not so hopeless as that of the imagined lapidary for however rare a species may be and near to its final extinction there must always be many individuals existing and i was cheered by the thought that i might yet meet with one at some future time and even if this particular species was not to gladden my sight again there were others scores and hundreds more and at any moment i might expect to see one shining a living gem on natures open extended palm  sometimes it has happened that an animal would have been overlooked or passed by with scant notice to be forgotten perhaps but for some singular action or habit which has instantly given it a strange importance and made its possession desirable  i was once engaged in the arduous and monotonous task of driving a large number of sheep a distance of two hundred and fifty miles in excessively hot weather when sheep prefer standing still to travelling five or six gauchos were with me and we were on the southern pampas of buenos ayres near to a long precipitous stony sierra which rose to a height of five or six hundred feet above the plain who that has travelled for eighteen days on a dead level in a broiling sun can resist a hill that sierra was more sublime to us than conondagua than illimani  leaving the sheep i rode to it with three of the men aad after securing our horses on the lower slope we began our laborious ascent now the gaucho when taken from his horse on which he lives like a kind of parasite is a very slowmoving creature and i soon left my friends far behind coming to a place where ferns and flowering herbage grew thick i began to hear all about me sounds of a character utterly unlike any natural sound i was acquainted withinnumerable low clear voices tinkling or pealing like minute sweettoned resonant bellsfor the sounds were purely metallic and perfectly belllike i was completely ringed round with the mysterious music and as i walked it rose and sank rhythmically keeping time to my steps i stood still and immediately the sounds ceased i took a step forwards and again the fairybells were set ringing as if at each step my foot touched a central meeting point of a thousand radiating threads each thread attached to a peal of little bells hanging concealed among the herbage i waited for my companions and called their attention to the phenomenon and to them also it was a thing strange and perplexing it is the bellsnake cried one excitedly this is the rattlesnake but although at that time i had no experience of this reptile i knew that he was wrong yet how natural the mistake the spanish name of bellsnake had made him imagine that the whirring sound of the vibrating rattles resembling muffled cicada music is really belllike in character eventually we discovered that the sound was made by grasshoppers but they were seen only to be lost for i could not capture one so excessively shy and cunning had the perpetual ringing of their own little tocsins made them and presently i had to return to my muttons and afterwards there was no opportunity of revisiting the spot to observe so singular a habit again and collect specimens it was a very slender grasshopper about an inch and a half long of a uniform tawny protective colourthe colour of an old dead leaf it also possessed a protective habit common to most grasshoppers of embracing a slender vertical stem with its four fine front legs and moving cunningly round so as to keep the stem always in front of it to screen itself from sight only other grasshoppers are silent when alarmed and the silence and masking action are related and together prevent the insect from being detected but this particular species or race or colony living on the sides of the isolated sierra had acquired a contrary habit resembling a habit of gregarious birds and mammals for this informing sound unless it mimicked some warningsound as of a rattlesnake which it didnt could not possibly be beneficial to individuals living alone as grasshoppers generally do but on the contrary only detrimental and such a habit was therefore purely for the public good and could only have arisen in a species that always lived in communities  on another occasion in the middle of the hot season i was travelling alone acrosscountry in a locality which was new to me a few leagues east of la plata river in its widest part about eleven oclock in the morning i came to a lowlying level plain where the closecropped grass was vivid green although elsewhere all over the country the vegetation was scorched and dead and dry as ashes the ground being so favourable i crossed this low plain at a swinging gallop and in about thirty minutes time in that halfhour i saw a vast number of snakes all of one kind and a species new to me but my anxiety to reach my destination before the oppressive heat of the afternoon made me hurry on so numerous were the snakes in that green place that frequently i had as many as a dozen in sight at one time it looked to me like a coroneliaharmless colubrine snakesbut was more than twice as large as either of the two species of that genus i was already familiar with in size they varied greatly ranging from two to fully five feet in length and the colour was dull yellow or tan slightly lined and mottled with shades of brown among dead or partially withered grass and herbage they would have been undistinguishable at even a very short distance but on the vivid green turf they were strangely conspicuous some being plainly visible forty or fifty yards away and not one was seen coiled up they were all lying motionless stretched out full length and looking like dark yellow or tancoloured ribbons thrown on to the grass it was most unusual to see so many snakes together although not surprising in the circumstances the december heats had dried up all the watercourses and killed the vegetation and made the earth hard and harsh as burnt bricks and at such times snakes especially the more active nonvenomous kinds will travel long distances in their slow way in search of water those i saw during my ride had probably been attracted by the moisture from a large area of country and although there was no water the soft fresh grass must have been grateful to them snakes are seen coiled up when they are at home when travelling and far afield they lie as a rule extended full length even when restingand they are generally resting pausing at length before quitting this green plain to give my horse a minutes rest i got off and approached a large snake but when i was quite twelve yards from it it lifted its head and turning deliberately round came rather swiftly at me i retreated and it followed until springing on to my horse i left it greatly surprised at its action and beginning to think that it must be venomous as i rode on the feeling of surprise increased conquering haste and in the end seeing more snakes i dismounted and approached the largest when exactly the same thing occurred again the snake rousing itself and coming angrily at me when i was still considering the dull lethargic character of the deadliest kinds at an absurd distance from it again and again i repeated the experiment with the same result and at length i stunned one with a blow of my whip to examine its mouth but found no poisonfangs in it  i then resumed my journey expecting to meet with more snakes of the same kind at my destination but there were none and very soon business called me to a distant place and i never met with this species afterwards but when i rode away from that green spot and was once more on the higher desolate windswept plain surrounding ita rustling sea of giant thistles still erect although dead and red as rust and filling the hot blue sky with silvery downit was with a very strange feeling the change from the green and living to the dead and dry and dusty was so great there seemed to be something mysterious extranatural in that low level plain so green and fresh and snaky where my horses hoofs had made no sounda place where no man dwelt and no cattle pastured and no wild bird folded its wing and the serpents there were not like othersthe mechanical coiledup thing we know a mere boneandmuscle mantrap set by the elements to spring and strike when trodden on but these had a high intelligence a lofty spirit and were filled with a noble rage and astonishment that any other kind of creature even a man should venture there to disturb their sacred peace it was a fancy born of that sense of mystery which the unknown and the unusual in nature wakes in usan obsolescent feeling that still links us to the savage but the simple fact was wonderful enough and that has been set down simply and apart from all fancies if the reader happens not to be a naturalist it is right to tell him that a naturalist cannot exaggerate consciously and if he be capable of unconscious exaggeration then ho is no naturalist he should hasten to join the innumerable caravan that moves to the fantastic realms of romance looking at the simple fact scientifically it was a case of mimicrythe harmless snake mimicking the fierce threatening gestures and actions proper to some deadly kind only with this difference the venomous snake of all deadly things in nature is the slowest to resentment the most reluctant to enter into a quarrel whereas in this species angry demonstrations were made when the intruder was yet far off and before he had shown any hostile intentions  my last casethe last that is of the few i have selectedrelates to a singular variation in the human species on this occasion i was again travelling alone in a strange district on the southern frontier of buenos ayres on a bitterly cold midwinter day shortly before noon i arrived stiff and tired at one of those pilgrims rests on the pampas a wayside pulperia or public house where the traveller can procure anything he may require or desire from a tumbler of brazilian rum to make glad his heart to a poncho or cloak of blue cloth with fluffy scarlet lining to keep him warm o nights and to speed him on his way a pair of castiron spurs weighing six pounds avoirdupois with rowels eight inches in diameter manufactured in this island for the use of barbarous men beyond the sea the wretched mudandgrass building was surrounded by a foss crossed by a plank drawbridge outside of the enclosure twelve or fourteen saddled horses were standing and from the loud noise of talk and laughter in the bar i conjectured that a goodly company of rough frontiersmen were already making merry at that early hour it was necessary for me to go in among them to see the proprietor of the place and ask permission to visit his kitchen in order to make myself a tin of coffee that being the refreshment i felt inclined for when i went in and made my salutation one man wheeled round square before me stared straight into my oyes and in an exceedingly highpitched reedy or screechy voice and a singsong tone returned my good morning and bade me call for the liquid i loved best at his expense i declined with thanks and in accordance with gaucho etiquette added that i was prepared to pay for his liquor it was then for him to say that he had already been served and so let the matter drop but he did not do so he screamed out in his wild animal voice that he would take gin i paid for his drink and would i think have felt greatly surprised at his strange insolent behaviour so unlike that of the usually courteous gaucho but this thing affected me not at all so profoundly had his singular appearance and voice impressed me and for the rest of the time i remained in the place i continued to watch him narrowly professor huxley has somewhere said a variation frequently occurs but those who notice it take no care about noting down the particulars that is not a failing of mine and this is what i noted down while the mans appearance was still fresh in memory he was about five feet eleven inches in heightvery tall for a gauchostraight and athletic with exceedingly broad shoulders which made his round head look small long arms and huge hands the round flat face coarse black hair swarthy reddish colour and smooth hairless cheeks seemed to show that he had more indian than spanish blood in him while his round black eyes were even more like those of a rapacious animal in expression than in the pureblooded indian he also had the indian or halfbreeds moustache when that natural ornament is permitted to grow and which is composed of thick bristles standing out like a cats whiskers the mouth was the marvellous feature for it was twice the size of an average mouth and the two lips were alike in thickness this mouth did not smile but snarled both when he spoke and when he should have smiled and when he snarled the wliolo of his teeth and a part of the gums were displayed the teeth were not as in other human beingsincisors canines and molars they were all exactly alike above and below each tooth a gleaming white triangle broad at the gum where it touched its companion teeth and with a point sharp as the sharpestpointed dagger they were like the teeth of a shark or crocodile i noticed that when he showed them which was very often they were not set together as in dogs weasels and other savage snarling animals but apart showing the whole terrible serration in the huge red mouth  after getting his gin he joined in the boisterous conversation with the others and this gave me an opportunity of studying his face for several minutes all the time with a curious feeling that i had put myself into a cage with a savage animal of horrible aspect whose instincts were utterly unknown to me and were probably not very pleasant it was interesting to note that whenever one of the others addressed him directly or turned to him when speaking it was with a curious expression not of fear but partly amusement and partly something else which i could not fathom now one might think that this was natural enough purely on account of the mans extraordinary appearance i do not think that a sufficient explanation for however strange a mans appearance may be his intimate friends and associates soon lose all sense of wonder at his strangeness and even forget that he is unlike others my belief is that this curiosity or whatever it was they showed in their faces was due to something in his charactera mental strangeness showing itself at unexpected times and which might flash out at any moment to amuse or astonish them there was certainly a correspondence between the snarling action of the mouth and the dangerous form of the teeth perfect as that in any snarling animal and such animals it should be remembered snarl not only when angry and threatening but in their playful moods as well other and more important correspondences or correlations might have existed and the voice was certainly unlike any human voice i have ever heard whether in white red or black man but the time i had for observation was short the conversation revealed nothing further and byandby i went away in search of the odorous kitchen where there would be hot water for coffee or at all events cold water and a kettle and materials for making a fireto wit bones of dead cattle buffalo chips and rancid fat  i have never been worried with the wish or ambition to be a headhunter in the dyak sense but on this one occasion i did wish that it had been possible without violating any law or doing anything to a fellowcreature which i should not like done to myself to have obtained possession of this mans head with its set of unique and terrible teeth for how in the name of evolution did he come by them and by other physical peculiaritiesthe snarling habit and that highpitched animal voice for instancewhich made him a being different from othersone separate and far apart was he so admirably formed so complete and wellbalanced merely a freak of nature to use an oldfashioned phrasea sport or spontaneous individual variationan experiment for a new human type imagined by nature in some past period inconceivably long ago but which she had only now too late found time to carry out or rather was he like that little hairy maiden exhibited not long ago in london a reproduction of the past the mystery called reversiona something in the life of a species like memory in the life of an individual the memory which suddenly brings back to the old mans mind the image of his childhood for no dreammonster in human form ever appeared to me with so strange and terrible a face and this was no dream but sober fact for i saw and spoke with this man and unless cold steel has given him his quietus or his own horse has crushed him or a mad bull sored himall natural forms of death in that wild landhe is probably still living and in the prime of life and perhaps at this very moment drinking gin at some astonished travellers expense at that very bar where i met him the old palaeolithic man judging from the few remains we have of him must have had an unspeakably savage and to our way of thinking repulsive and horrible aspect with his villainous low receding forehead broad nose great projecting upper jaw and retreating chin to meet such a man face to face in piccadilly would frighten a nervous person of the present time but his teeth were not unlike our own only very much larger and more powerful and well adapted to their work of masticating the flesh underdone and possibly raw of mammoth and rhinoceros if then this living man recalls a type of the past it is of a remoter past a more primitive man the volume of whose history is missing from the geological record to speculate on such a subject seems idle and useless and when i coveted possession of that head it was not because i thought that it might lead to any fresh discovery a lower motive inspired the feeling i wished for it only that i might bring it over the sea to drop it like a new apple of discord suited to the spirit of the times among the anthropologists and evolutionists generally of this old and learned world inscribed of course to the most learned but giving no locality and no particulars i wished to do that for the pleasurenot a very noble kind of pleasure i allowof witnessing from some safe hidingplace the stupendous strife that would have ensueda battle more furious lasting and fatal to many a brave knight of biology than was ever yet fought over any bone or bony fragment or fabric ever picked up including the celebrated cranium of the neanderthal     appendix  the puma or lion of america   the following passage occurs in an article on the naturalist in la plata by the late professor piomanes which appeared in the nineteenth century may 1893 after quoting the account of the pumas habits and character given in the book the writer saysi have received corroboration touching all these points from a gentleman who when walking alone and unarmed on the skirts of a forest was greatly alarmed by a large puma coming out to meet him deeming it best not to stand he advanced to meet the animal which thereupon began to gambol around his feet and rub against his legs after the manner of an affectionate cat at first he thought these movements must have been preliminary to some peculiar mode of attack and therefore he did not respond but walked quietly on until the puma suddenly desisted and reentered the forest this gentleman says that until the publication of mr hudsons book he had always remained under the impression that that particular puma must have been insane  music and dancing in nature  i have found among my papers the following mislaid note on the subject of sportive displays of mammalians which should have been used on page 281 where the subject is briefly treatedmost mammalians are comparatively silent and live on the ground and not having the power to escape easily which birds have and being more persecuted by man they do not often disport themselves unrestrainedly in his presence it is difficult to watch any wild animal without the watchers presence being known or suspected nevertheless their displays are not so rare as we might imagine i have more than once detected species with which i was or imagined myself to be well acquainted disporting themselves in a manner that took me completely by surprise while out tinamou shooting one day in autumn near my own home in la plata i spied a troop of about a dozen weasels racing madly about over a vizcacha villagethe mound and group of pitlike burrows inhabited by a community of vizcachas these weasels were of the large common species galictis barbara about the size of a cat and were engaged in a pastime resembling a complicated dance and so absorbed were they on that occasion that they took no notice of me when i walked up to within nine or ten yards of them and stood still to watch the performance they were all swiftly racing about and leaping over the pits always doubling quickly back when the limit of the mound was reached and although apparently carried away with excitement and crossing each others tracks at all angles and this so rapidly and with so many changes of direction that i became confused when trying to keep any one animal in view they never collided nor even came near enough to touch one another the whole performance resembled on a greatly magnified scale and without its beautiful smoothness and lightning swiftness the fantastic dance of small black waterbeetles frequently seen on the surface of a pool or stream during which the insects glide about in a limited area with such celerity as to appear like black curving lines traced by flying invisible pens and as the lines everywhere cross and intersect they form an intricate pattern on the surface after watching the weasel dance for some minutes i stepped up to the mound whereupon the animals became alarmed and rushed pellmell into the burrows but only to reappear in a few seconds thrusting up their long ebonyblack necks and flat greycapped heads snarling chattering at me glaring with fierce beady eyes     the strange instincts of cattle   in november and december 1893 a short correspondence appeared in the field on the curious subject of dogs burying their dead it arose through a letter from a mr gould of albany western australia relating the following incident  a settler shot a bitch from a neighbouring estate that had formed the habit of coming on to his land to visit and play with his dog the dog finding his companion dead was observed to dig a large hole in the ground into which he dragged the carcase but he did not cover it with earth the writer wished to know if any reader of the field had met with a similar case some notes which i contributed in reply to this letter bear on one of the subjects treated in the chapter on strange instincts namely the instinct of social animals to protect and shield their fellows and for this reason i have thought it best to reproduce them in this place  i remember on one occasion watching at intervals for an entire day a large and very savage dog keeping watch over the body of a dead bitch that had been shot he made no attempt to bury the dead animal but he never left it he was observed more than once trying to drag the body away doubtless with the intention of hiding it not succeeding in these attempts he settled down by its side again although it was evident that he was suffering greatly from thirst and heat it was at last only with the greatest trouble that the people of the house succeeded in getting the body away and burying it out of his sight  another instance more to the point occurred at my own house on the pampas and i was one of several persons who witnessed it a small red longhaired bitcha variety of the common native curgave birth to four or five pups a peon was told to destroy them and waiting until the bitch was out of sight he carried them off to the end of the orchard some 400 or 500 yards from the house and threw them into a pool of water which was only two to three feet deep the bitch passed the rest of the day in rushing frantically about searching for her young and in the evening a little after dark actually succeeded in finding them although they were lying at the bottom of the pool she got them all out and carried them one by one to another part of the grounds where she passed the night with them uttering at intervals the most piercing cries in the morning she carried them to still another spot where there was a soft mould and then dug a hole large and deep enough to bury them all covering them over with the loose earth her task done she returned to the house to sleep all day but when night came again the whole piteous performance was repeated the pups were dug up and she passed the long piercingly cold nightfor it was in the depth of wintertrying to keep them warm and uttering as before distressing cries yet a third time the whole thing was repeated but after the third night when the dog came home to sleep the dead pups were taken out of the ground and buried at a distance  such an action as this strikes one with astonishment only because we have the custom of burying our dead and are too ready at all times to regard the dog as humanlike but the explanation of the action in this case is to be found in the familiar fact that very many animals including the dog have the habit or instinct of burying or concealing the thing they wish to leave in safety thus the dog buries the bone it does not want to eat and when hungry digs it up again when a dog buries or hides the dead body of the she dog it was attached to or the she dog buries her dead young it is with the same motivenamely to conceal the animal that cannot be roused and that it would not be safe to leave exposed  it is plain to all who observe their actions that the lower animals have no comprehension of death in the case of two animals that are accustomed to play or to be much together if one dies or is killed and its body left the other will come to sniff at touch and at last try to rouse it but finding all attempts vain it will at length go away to seek companionship elsewhere in cases where the attachment is much stronger the dead body may he watched over for an indefinite period a brother of mine once related to me a very pathetic incident which occurred at an estancia on the pampas where he was staying a large portion of the land was a low level marshy plain partly overgrown with reeds and rushes and one day in this wilderness a little boy of eight or nine from the estancia lost himself a small dog his invariable attendant had gone out with him but did not return seven days later the poor boy was found at a great distance from the house lying on the grass where he had died of exhaustion the dog was lying coiled up at his side and appeared to be sleeping but when spoken to he did not stir and was presently found to be dead too the dog could have gone back at any moment to the estancia but his instinct of attachment overcame all others he kept guard over his little master who slept so soundly and so long until he too slept in the same way  a still more remarkable case of this kind was given in one of my books of a gaucho accompanied by his dog who was chased and overtaken by a troop of soldiers during one of the civil wars in uruguay suspecting him of being a spy or at all events an enemy his captors cut his throat then rode away calling to the dog to follow them but the animal refused to leave his dead masters side returning to the spot a few days later they saw the body of the man they had killed surrounded by a large number of vultures which the dog in a frenzy of excitement was occupied in keeping at a respectable distance it was observed that the dog after making one of his sallies driving the birds away with furious barkings would set out at a run to a small stream not far from the spot but when half way to it he would look back and seeing the vultures advancing once more to the corpse would rush back to protect it the soldiers watched him for some time with great interest and once more they tried in vain to get him to follow them two days afterwards they revisited the spot to find the dog lying dead by the side of his dead master i had this story from the lips of one of the witnesses  in all such cases whether the dog watches over conceals or buries a dead body he is doubtless moved by the same instinct which leads him to safeguard the animal he is attached toanother dog or his human master but as the dead animal is past help it is of course a blunder of the instinct and the blunder must be of very much less frequent occurrence among wild than among domestic animals in a state of nature when a gregarious animal dies he dies as a rule alone his body is not seen by his former companions and he is not missed when he dies by violencewhich is the common fatethe body is carried off or devoured by the killer this being the usual order there is no instinct except in a very few species relating to the disposal of the dead among mammals and other vertebrates such as is found in ants and other social insects there are a few mammalians that live together in small communities in a habitation made to last for many generations in which such an instinct would appear necessary and it accordingly exists but is very imperfect this is the case with the vizcacha the large rodent of the pampas which lives with its fellows to the number of twenty or thirty in a cluster of huge burrows when a vizcacha dies in a burrow the body is dragged out and thrown on to the mound among the mass of rubbish collected on itbut not until he has been dead a long time and there is nothing left of him but the dry bones held together by the skin in that condition the other members of the community probably cease to look on him as one of their companions who has fallen into a long sleep he is no more than so much rubbish which must be cleared out of an old disused burrow probably the beaver possesses some rude instinct similar to that of the vizcacha  apropos of animals burying their treasures or connections for safety it is worth mentioning that the skunk of the pampas occasionally buries her young in the kennel when hunger compels her to go out foraging i had often heard of this habit of the female skunk from the gauchos and one day had the rare good fortune to witness an animal engaged in obliterating her own kennel the senses of the skunk are so defective that one is able at times to approach very near to without alarming them in this instance i sat on my horse at a distance of twenty yards and watched the animal at work drawing in the loose earth with her fore feet until the entrance to the kennel was filled up to within three inches of the surface then dropping into the shallow cavity she pressed the loose mould down with her nose her task finished she trotted away and the hollow in the soil when i examined it closely looked only like the mouth of an ancient chokedup burrow the young inhabit a circular chamber lined with fine dry grass at the end of a narrow passage from 3 ft to 5 ft long and no doubt have air enough to serve them until their parent returns but i believe the skunk only buries her young when they are very small
