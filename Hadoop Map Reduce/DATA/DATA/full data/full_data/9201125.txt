carpetknight and the lady   the girl paused and steadied herself for a moment against a field gate her breath came fast in little sobbing pants her dainty shoes were soiled with dust and there was a great tear in her skirt very slowly very fearfully she turned her head her cheeks were the colour of chalk her eyes were filled with terror if a cart were coming or those labourers in the field had heard escape was impossible  the terror faded from her eyes a faint gleam of returning colour gave her at once a more natural appearance so far as the eye could reach the white level road with its fringe of elmtrees was empty away off in the fields the bluesmocked peasants bent still at their toil they had heard nothing seen nothing a few more minutes and she was safe  yet before she turned once more to resume her flight she schooled herself with an effort to look where it had happened a dark mass of wreckage over which hung a slight mist of vapour lay half in the ditch half across the hedge close under a tree from the trunk of which the bark had been torn and stripped a few yards further off something grey inert was lying a huddledup heap of humanity twisted into a strange unnatural shape again the chalky pallor spread even to her lips her eyes became lit with the old terror she withdrew her head with a little moan and resumed her flight away up on the hillside was the little country railway station she fixed her eyes upon it and ran keeping always as far as possible in the shadow of the hedge gazing fearfully every now and then down along the valley for the white smoke of the train  she reached the station and mingling with a crowd of excursionists who had come from the river on the other side took her place in the train unnoticed she leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes until the last moment she was afraid  arrived in paris she remembered that she had not the money for a fiacre she was in ill trim for walking but somehow or other she made her way as far as the champs elysées and sank down upon an empty seat  she had not at first the power for concealment her nerves were shattered her senses dazed by this unexpected shock she sat there a mark for boulevarders the unconscious object of numberless wondering glances paris was full and it was by no means a retired spot which she had found yet she never once thought of changing it a person of somewhat artificial graces and mannerisms she was for once in her life perfectly natural terror had laid a paralyzing hand upon her fear kept her almost unconscious of the curious glances which she was continually attracting  then there came briskly along the path towards her an englishman he was perhaps fortyfive years of age he was dressed with the utmost care and he set his feet upon the broad walk as though the action were in some way a condescension he was alert wellgroomed and yetperhaps in contrast with the more volatile french typethere was a suggestion of weight about him not to say heaviness he too looked at the girl slackened his pace and looked at her again through his eyeglasses looked over his shoulder after he had passed and finally came to a dead stop he scratched his upper lip reflectively  it was a habit of his to talk to himself in the present case it did not matter as there was no one else within earshot  dear me he said dear me i wonder what i ought to do she is english i am sure of that she is english and apparently in some distress i wonder  he turned slowly round he was inclined to be a goodnatured person and he had no nervous fears of receiving a snub the girl was pretty and apparently a lady  she cannot be aware he continued that she is making herself conspicuous it would surely be only common politeness to drop her a hinta fellow countrywoman too i trust that she will not misunderstand me i believei believe that i must risk it  he stood before her his hat in his hand his head bent his voice lowered to a convenient pitch  i beg your pardon he said but you appear to be a fellow countrywoman of mine and in some distress can i be of any assistance i can assure you that it would give me very much pleasure  her first upward glance was one of terrified apprehension when she saw however that this man was a stranger and obviously harmless her expression changed as though by magic a delicate flush of colour streamed into her cheeks her eyes fell and then sought his again with timid interest her natural instincts reasserted themselves she began to act  you are very kind she said hesitatingly but i dont rememberi dont think that i know you do i  i am afraid that you do not he admitted with a smile which he meant to be encouraging you remind me of the story which they tell against us over here you knowof the englishman who refused to be saved from drowning because he was unacquainted with his rescuer permit me to introduce myself my name is ferringhallsir john ferringhall  there was genuine interest in her eyes now sir john saw it and was flattered  you are sir john ferringhall she repeated yes i remember you now you were pointed out to me ata few nights ago  he was not in the least surprised a millionaire and a knight even though his money has been made in carpets is used to being a person of interest  very likely he answered i am fairly well known here i must apologize i suppose for speaking to you but your appearance certainly indicated that you were in some sort of trouble and you were becomingpardon mean object of comment to the passersby  the girl sat up and looked at him with a curious twist at the corners of her mouthhumorous or pathetic he could not tell which as though accidentally she swept her skirts from a chair close drawn to her own sir john hesitated she was marvellously pretty but he was not quite sureyetthat it was advisable for him to sit with her in so public a place his inclinations prompted him most decidedly to take the vacant chair prudence reminded him that he was a county magistrate and parliamentary candidate for a somewhat difficult borough where his principal supporters were dissenters of strict principles who took a zealous interest in his moral character he temporized and the girl raised her eyes once more to his  you are the sir john ferringhall who has bought the lyndmore estate are you not she remarked my fathers sisters used once to live in the old manor house i believe you have had it pulled down have you not  the misses pellissier he exclaimed then your name  my name is pellissier my father was colonel pellissier he had an appointment in jersey you know after he left the army  sir john did not hesitate any longer he sat down  upon my word he exclaimed this is most extraordinary i  then he stopped short for he began to remember things he was not quite sure whether after all he had been wise he would have risen again but for the significance of the action  dear me he said then some of your family history is known to me one of your aunts died i believe and the other removed to london  the girl nodded  she is living there now she remarked  your father is dead too i believe he continued and your mother  two years ago she answered they died within a few months of one another  very sadvery sad indeed he remarked uneasily i remember hearing something about it i believe that the common report was that you and your sister had come to paris to study painting  she assented gently  we have a small studio she murmured in the rue de st pierre  sir john looked at her sideways her eyes were fixed upon the ground the pink colour coming and going in her cheeks was very delicate and girlish after all this could never be the black sheep he had been quite right to sit down it was astonishing how seldom it was that his instincts betrayed him he breathed a little sigh of satisfaction  come he continued the world after all is a very small place we are not altogether strangers are we i feel that under the circumstances i have the right to offer you my advice and if necessary my help i beg that you will consider me your friend  she looked at him with fluttering eyelidssweetly grateful it was such an unexpected stroke of fortune sir john was not used to such glances and he liked them  it is so difficult she murmured so impossible to explain even to my own brotherif i had onei could not tell everything and you although you are so kind you are almost a stranger arent you  no no he protested you must not think of me as one try and consider me your elder brother or an old family friend whichever you like best  she thanked him with one of her shy little glances more than ever sir john was glad that he had sat down  it is very very difficult she continued looking steadfastly at the ground onlyi have come face to facewith something terrible and wholly unexpected trouble i want to leave paris todaythis very day i want to leave it for ever  he looked at her very gravely  but your sister he asked what of her have you quarrelled with her  the girl shook her head  no she answered i have not quarrelled with her it is simply our point of view which is altogether different i want to get awayto go to london i cannot explain beyond that  then i am sure sir john declared that i shall not ask you i know nothing about the matter but i feel convinced that you are right you ought to have had better advice two years ago paris is not the place for two young girls i presume that you have been living alone  she sighed gently  my sister she murmured is so independent she is bohemian to the fingertips she makes me feel terribly oldfashioned  sir john smiled and congratulated himself upon his insight he was so seldom wrong  the next question miss anna he said is how am i to help you i am wholly at your disposal  she looked up at him quickly her expression was a little changed less innocent more discerning  anna she repeated how do you knowwhy do you think that my name is anna he smiled in a quietly superior way  i think he said that i am right i am very good at guessing names  i am really curious she persisted you must have heardhave youoh tell me wont you she begged have you heard things  the tears stood in her eyes she leaned a little towards him nothing but the publicity of the place and the recollection of that terrible constituency kept him from attempting some perfectly respectful but unmistakable evidence of his sympathy  i am afraid he said gravely that your sister has been a little indiscreet it is nothing at all for you to worry about  she looked away from him  i knew she said in a low despairing tone that people would talk  he coughed gently  it was inevitable he declared it is not of course a pleasant subject of conversation for you or for me yet i think i may venture to suggest to you that your sisterserindiscretionshave reached a point which makes a separation between you almost a necessity  she covered her face with her hands  ititmust come she faltered  i do not lay claim he continued to any remarkable amount of insight but it is possible is it not that i have stumbled upon your present cause of distress  you are wonderful she murmured  he smiled complacently  not at all this is simply a chapter of coincidences now what i want you to feel is this i want you to feel that you have found a friend who has a strong desire to be of service to you treat me as an elder brother if you like he is here by your side how can he help you  she threw such a look upon him that even he sir john ferringhall carpetmerchant hidebound englishman slowwitted pompous deliberate felt his heart beat to music perhaps the parisian atmosphere had affected him he leaned towards her laid his hand tenderly upon hers  i hope you realize he went on in a lower and less assured tone that i am in earnestvery much in earnest you must let me do whatever i can for you i shall count it a privilege  i believe you she murmured i trust you altogether i am going to take you entirely at your word i want to leave paris today will you lend me the money for my ticket to london  with all the pleasure in the world he answered heartily let me add too that i am thankful for your decision you have somewhere to go to in london i hope  she nodded  there is my aunt she said the one who used to live at lyndmore she will take me in until i can make some plans it will be horribly dull and she is a very trying person but anything is better than this  he took out his watch  let me see he said your best route will be via boulogne and folkestone at nine oclock from the gare du nord what about your luggage  i could get a few of my things at any rate she said my sister is sure to be out  very well he said it is just six oclock now supposing you fetch what you can and if you will allow me i will see you off it would give me great pleasure if you would dine with me somewhere first  she looked at him wistfully but with some unwilling doubt in her wrinkled forehead it was excellently done especially as she loved good dinners  you are very kind to think of it she said butdont you think perhapsthat i had better not  he smiled indulgently  my dear child he said with me you need have no apprehension i am almost old enough to be your father  she looked at him with uplifted eyebrowsa look of whimsical incredulity sir john felt that after all fortyfive was not so very old  that sounds quite absurd she answered yet it is my last evening and i thinkif you are sure that you would like to have methat i will risk it  we will go to a very quiet place he assured her a place where i have often taken my own sisters you will be wearing your travelling dress and no doubt you would prefer it shall we say at halfpast seven  she rose from her chair  i will take a carriage she said and fetch my things  let us say that café maston in the boulevard des italiennes at halfpast seven then he decided i shall be waiting for you there and in the meantime if you will help yourselfpray dont look like that it is a very small affair after all and you can pay me back if you will  she took the pocketbook and looked up at him with a little impulsive movement her voice shook her eyes were very soft and melting  i cannot thank you sir john she said i shall never be able to thank you  wont you postpone the attempt then he said gallantly until i have done something to deserve your gratitude you will not forgetseventhirty café maston boulevard des italiennes  she drove off in a little fiacre nodding and smiling at sir john who remained upon the avenue he too when she had disappeared called a carriage  hotel ritz he said mechanically to the coachman if only her sister is half as pretty no wonder that she has set the parisians talking     chapter ii  the adventure of annabel   the man spoke mercilessly incisively as a surgeon only he hated the words he uttered hated the blunt honesty which forced them from his lips opposite his pupil stood with bowed head and clasped hands  you have the temperament he said you have the ideas your first treatment of a subject is always correct always suggestive but of what avail is this you have no execution no finish you lack only that mechanical knack of expression which is the least important part of an artists equipment but which remains a tedious and absolute necessity we have both tried hard to develop ityou and iand we have failed it is better to face the truth  much better she agreed oh much better  personally he went on i must confess to a great disappointment i looked upon you from the first as the most promising of my pupils i overlooked the mechanical imperfections of your work the utter lack of finish the crudeness of your drawing i said to myself this will come it seems that i was mistaken you cannot draw your fingers are even now as stiff as a schoolgirls you will never be able to draw you have the ideas you are an artist by the divine right of birth but whatever form of expression may come to you at some time it will not be painting take my advice burn your palette and your easel give up your lonely hours of work here look somewhere else in life depend upon it there is a place for youwaiting here you only waste your time  she was silent and in the gloom of the dimly lit apartment he could not see her face he drew a little breath of relief the worst was over now he continued tenderly almost affectionately  after all there are great things left in the world for you painting is only one slender branch of the great tree tonight all this may seem hard and cruel tomorrow you will feel like a freed woman tomorrow i shall come and talk to you againof other things  a man of infinite tact and kindness he spoke his message and went the girl with a little moan crossed the room and threw open the window  she looked steadfastly out paris always beautiful even in the darkness glittered away to the horizon the lights of the champs elysées and the place de la concorde suggestive brilliant seductive shone like an army of fireflies against the deep cool background of the night she stood there with white set face and nervously clenched fingers the echo of those kindly words seemed still to ring in her ears she was crushed with a sense of her own terrible impotency a failure she must write herself down a failure at her age with her ambitions with her artistic temperament and creative instincts she was yet to be denied all coherent means of expression she was to fall back amongst the ruck a young woman of talent content perhaps to earn a scanty living by painting christmas cards or teaching at a kindergarten her fingernails dug into her flesh it was the bitterest moment of her life she flung herself back into the bare little room cold empty comfortless in a momentary fury she seized and tore in pieces the study which remained upon the easel the pieces fell to the ground in a little white shower it was the end she told herself fiercely and then as she stood there with the fragments of the torn canvas at her feet some even caught upon her skirt the door was thrown open and a girl entered humming a light tune  the newcomer stopped short upon the threshold  anna what tragedy has happened little sister no lights no supper no coffeeand above all no mr courtlaw how dreary it all looks never mind come and help me pack im off to england  annabel are you mad to england you are joking of course but come in dear i will light the stove and there shall be some coffee presently  coffee bah  the newcomer picked her way across the floor with daintily uplifted skirts and subsided into a deck chair of stretched canvas  i will not rob you of your coffee most dutiful of sisters she exclaimed i have had adventuresoh more than one i can assure you it has been a marvellous dayand i am going to england  anna looked at her sister gravely even in her painting smock and with her disarranged hair the likeness between the two girls was marvellous  the adventures i do not doubt annabel she said they seem to come to you as naturally as disappointmentto other people but to england what has happened then  already the terror of a few hours ago seemed to have passed away from the girl who leaned back so lazily in her chair watching the tip of her patent shoe swing backwards and forwards she could even think of what had happened very soon she would be able to forget it  happened oh many things she declared indolently the most important is that i have a new admirer  the wonderful likeness between the two girls was never less noticeable than at that moment anna stood looking down upon her sister with grave perturbed face annabel lounged in her chair with a sort of insolent abandon in her pose and wideopen eyes which never flinched or drooped one realized indeed then where the differences lay the tender curves about annas mouth transformed into hard sharp lines in annabels the eyes of one truthful and frank the others more beautiful but with less expressionwindows lit with dazzling light but through which one sawnothing  a new admirer annabel but what has that to do with your going to england  everything he is sir john ferringhallvery stupid very respectable very egotistical but after all what does that matter he is very much taken with me he tries hard to conceal it but he cannot  then why anna asked quietly do you run away it is not like you  annabel laughed softly  how unkind she exclaimed still since it is better to tell you sir john is very much in earnest but his respectability is something altogether too overpowering of course i knew all about him years ago and he is exactly like everybodys description of him i am afraid anna just a little afraid that in paris i and my friends here might seem a trifle advanced besides he might hear things that is why i called myself anna  youyou did what anna exclaimed  called myself anna the girl repeated coolly it cant make any difference to you and there are not half a dozen people in paris who could tell us apart  anna tried to look angry but her mouth betrayed her instead she laughed laughed with lips and eyes laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks  you little wretch she exclaimed weakly why should i bear the burden of your wickedness who knows what might come of it i shall permit nothing of the sort  annabel shrugged her shoulders  too late my dear girl she exclaimed i gave your name i called myself anna after all what can it matter it was just to make sure three little letters cant make a bit of difference  but it may matter very much indeed anna declared perhaps for myself i do not mind but this man is sure to find out some day and he will not like having been deceived tell him the truth annabel  the truth  there was a brief but intense silence anna felt that her words had become charged with a fuller and more subtle meaning than any which she had intended to impart the truth it was a moment of awkwardness between the two sistersa moment too charged with its own psychological interest for there were secrets between them which for many months had made their intercourse a constrained and difficult thing it was annabel who spoke  how crude you are anna she exclaimed with a little sigh sir john is not at all that sort he is the kind of man who would much prefer a little dust in his eyes but heavens i must pack  she sprang to her feet and disappeared in the room beyond from which she emerged a few minutes later with flushed cheeks and dishevelled hair  it is positively no use anna she declared appealingly you must pack for me i am sorry but you have spoilt me i cant do it even decently myself and i dare not run the risk of ruining all my clothes  anna laughed gave in and with deft fingers created order out of chaos soon the trunk portmanteau and hat box were ready then she took her sisters hand  annabel she said i have never asked you for your confidence we have lived under the same roof but our ways seem to have lain wide apart there are many things which i do not understand have you anything to tell me before you go  annabel laughed lightly  my dear anna as though i should think of depressing you with my long list of misdeeds  you have nothing to tell me  nothing  so annabel departed with the slightest of farewells wearing a thick travelling veil and sitting far back in the corner of a closed carriage anna watched her from the windows watched the carriage jolt away along the cobbled street and disappear then she stepped back into the empty room and stood for a moment looking down upon the scattered fragments of her last canvas  it is a night of endings she murmured to herself perhaps for me she added with a sudden wistful look out of the bare high window a night of beginnings     chapter iii  anna or annabel   sir john was wholly unable to understand the laugh and semiironical cheer which greeted his entrance to the smokingroom of the english club on the following evening he stood upon the threshold dangling his eyeglasses in his fingers stolid imperturbable mildly interrogative he wanted to know what the joke against him wasif any  may i enquire he asked smoothly in what way my appearance contributes to your amusement if there is a joke i should like to share it  a fairhaired young englishman looked up from the depths of his easy chair  you hear him he remarked looking impressively around a joke sir john if you had presented yourself here an hour ago we should have greeted you in pained silence we had not then recovered from thef shock our ideal had fallen a sense of loss was amongst us drummond he continued looking across at his visàvis we look to you to give expression to our sentiments your career at the bar had given you a command of language also a selfcontrol not vouchsafed to us ordinary mortals explain to sir john our feelings  drummond a few years older dark cleanshaven with bright eyes and humorous mouth laid down his paper and turned towards sir john he removed his cigarette from his lips and waved it gently in the air  holcroft he remarked in bald language and with the usual limitations of his clouded intellect has still given some slight expression to the consternation which i believe i may say is general amongst us we looked upon you my dear sir john with reverence almost with awe you represented to us the immaculate briton the one englishman who typified the saxonism if i may coin a word of our race we have seen great and soberminded men come to this unholy city and become degenerates we have known men who have come here for no other purpose than to prove their unassailable virtue who have strode into the arena of temptation waving thethe what is itthe white flower of a blameless life only to exchange it with marvellous facility for the violets of the parisienne but you ferringhall our pattern an erstwhile sheriff of london a county magistrate a prospective politician a sober and an upright man one who had he aspired to it might even have filled the glorious position of lord mayorjames a whisky and apollinaris at once i cannot go on my feelings overpower me  you all seem to be trying to pull my leg sir john remarked quietly i suppose youll come to the point soonif there is one  drummond shook his head in melancholy fashion  he dissembles he said after all how easy the descent is even for the greatest of us i hope that james will not be long with that whisky and apollinaris my nerves are shaken i require stimulant  sir john seated himself deliberately  i should imagine he said shaking out a copy of the times that it is your brain which is addled  drummond looked up with mock eagerness  this he exclaimed must be either the indifference of an utterly callous nature or it may beye gods it may beinnocence holcroft we may have been mistaken  think not that young man remarked laconically  i will put the question drummond said gravely ferringhall were you or were you not dining last night at a certain restaurant in the boulevard des italiennes withla petite pellissier  now indeed sir john was moved he sat up in his chair as though the question had stung him the times slipped from his fingers his eyes were bright and his voice had in it an unaccustomed timbre  it is true he said that i was dining last night at a restaurant in the boulevard des italiennes and it is true that my companion was a young lady whose name is pellissier what of it  there was a shout of laughter sir john looked about him and somehow the laugh died away if such a thing in connexion with him had been possible they would have declared that he was in a towering rage an uncomfortable silence followed sir john once more looked around him  i repeat gentlemen he said in an ominously low tone what of it  drummond shrugged his shoulders  you seem to be taking our little joke more seriously than it deserves ferringhall he remarked  i fail to see the joke sir john said kindly explain it to me  certainly the thing which appeals to our sense of humour is the fact that you and la petite pellissier were dining together  will you tell me sir john said ponderously by what right you call that young ladyla petite pellissier i should be glad to know how you dare to allude to her in a public place in such a disrespectful manner  drummond looked at him and smiled  dont be an ass ferringhall he said tersely annabel pellissier is known to most of us i myself have had the pleasure of dining with her she is very charming and we all admire her immensely she sings twice a week at the ambassadors and the casino mavise  sir john held up his hand  stop he said you do not even know what you are talking about the young lady with whom i was dining last night was miss anna pellissier miss annabel is her sister i know nothing of that young lady  there was a moments silence drummond took up a cigarette and lit it  the young lady i presume told you that her name was anna he remarked  it was not necessary sir john answered stiffly i was already aware of the fact i may add that the family is well known to me the two aunts of these young ladies lived for many years in the dower house upon my estate in hampshire under the circumstances you must permit me to be the best judge of the identity of the young lady who did me the honour as an old family friend of dining with me  like most men who lie but seldom he lied well drummond smoked his cigarette meditatively he remembered that he had heard stories about the wonderful likeness between these two sisters one of whom was an artist and a recluse whilst the other had attached herself to a very gay and a very brilliant little coterie of pleasureseekers there was a bare chance that he had been mistaken he thought it best to let the matter drop a few minutes later sir john left the room  he walked out into the champs elysées and sat down his cigar burnt out between his fingers and he threw it impatiently away he had seldom been more perturbed he sat with folded arms and knitted brows thinking intently the girl had told him distinctly that her name was anna her whole conduct and tone had been modest and ladylike he went over his interview with her again their conversation at dinnertime she had behaved in every way perfectly his spirits began to rise drummond had made an abominable mistake it was not possible for him to have been deceived he drew a little sigh of relief  sir john by instinct and training was an unimaginative person he was a business man pure and simple his eyes were fastened always upon the practical side of life such ambitions as he had were stereotyped and material yet in some hidden corner was a vein of sentiment of which for the first time in his later life he was now unexpectedly aware he was conscious of a peculiar pleasure in sitting there and thinking of those few hours which already were becoming to assume a definite importance in his minda place curiously apart from those dryasdust images which had become the gods of his prosaic life somehow or other his reputation as a hardened and unassailable bachelor had won for him during the last few years a comparative immunity from attentions on the part of those women with whom he had been brought into contact it was a reputation by no means deserved a wife formed part of his scheme of life for several years he had been secretly but assiduously looking for her in his way he was critical the young ladies in the somewhat mixed society amongst which he moved neither satisfied his taste nor appealed in any way to his affections this girl whom he had met by chance and befriended had done both she possessed what he affected to despise but secretly worshippedthe innate charm of breeding the pellissiers had been an old family in hampshire while his grandfather had driven a van  as in all things so his thoughts came to him deliberately he pictured himself visiting the girl in this shabby little home of her auntsshe had told him that it was shabbyand he recalled that delicious little smile with which she would surely greet him a smile which seemed to be a matter of the eyes as well as the lips she was poor he was heartily thankful for it he thought of his wealth for once from a different point of view how much he would be able to do for her flowers theatre boxes carriages the open sesame to the whole world of pleasure he himself middleaged steeped in traditions of the city and moneymaking very illskilled in all the lighter graces of life as he himself well knew could yet come to her invested with something of the halo of romance by the almost magical powers of an unlimited banking account she should be lifted out of her narrow little life and it should be all owing to him and afterwards sir john drew his cigar from his lips and looked upwards where the whitelights flashed strangely amongst the deep cool green of the limetrees his lips parted in a rare smile afterwards was the most delightful part of all  if only there had not been this single torturing thoughta mere pinprick but still curiously persistent suddenly he stopped short he was in front of one of the more imposing of the cafés chantantsopposite illuminated with a whole row of lights was the wonderful poster which had helped to make alcide famous he had looked at it before without comprehension tonight the subtle suggestiveness of those few daring lines fascinating in their very simplicity the head thrown back the halfclosed eyesthe inner meaning of the great artist seemed to come to him with a rush he stood still almost breathless a slow anger burned in the man it was debauching thisa devilish art which drew such strange allurements from a face and figure almost madonnalike in their simplicity unwillingly he drew a little nearer and became one of the group of loiterers about the entrance a woman touched him lightly on the arm and smiled into his face  monsieur admires the poster  as a rule sir john treated such advances with cold silence this woman contrary to his custom he answered  it is hatefuldiabolical he exclaimed  the woman shrugged her shoulders  it is a great art she said in broken english the little english girl is very fortunate for what indeed does she do a simple song no gesture no acting nothing and they pay her monsieur is going inside perhaps  but sir johns eyes were still riveted upon the poster and his heart was beating with unaccustomed force for just as though a vague likeness is sometimes borne swiftly in upon one so a vague dissimilarity between the face on the poster and the heroine of his thoughts had slowly crept into his consciousness he drew a little breath and stepped back after all he had the means of setting this tormenting doubt at rest she had mentioned the address where she and her sister had lived he would go there he would see this sister he would know the truth then once and for all he walked hastily to the side of the broad pavement and summoned a fiacre     chapter iv  the temperament of an artist   you may sit there and smoke and look out upon your wonderful paris anna said lightly you may talkif you can talk cheerfully not unless  and you asked david courtlaw  well if i find your conversation interesting i shall listen if not i have plenty to think about she answered leaning back in her chair and watching the smoke from her own cigarette curl upwards  for instance  she smiled  how i am to earn enough sous for my dinner tomorrowor failing that what i can sell  his face darkened  and yet he said you bid me talk cheerfully or not at all  why not your spirits at least should be good it is not you who runs the risk of going dinnerless tomorrow  he turned upon her almost fiercely  you know he muttered you know quite well that your troubles are far more likely to weigh upon me than my own do you think that i am utterly selfish  she raised her eyebrows  troubles my friend she exclaimed lightly but i have no troubles  he stared at her incredulously and she laughed very softly  what a gloomy person you are she murmured you call yourself an artistbut you have no temperament the material cares of life hang about your neck like a millstone a doubt as to your dinner tomorrow would make you miserable tonight you know i call that positively wicked it is not at all what i expected either on the whole i think that i have been disappointed with the life here there is so little abandon so little real joyousness  and yet he murmured one of the greatest of our writers has declared that the true spirit of bohemianism is denied to your sex  he was probably right she declared bohemianism is the least understood word ever coined i do not think that i have the bohemian spirit at all  he looked at her thoughtfully she wore a plain black dress reaching almost to her throather small oval face with the large brown eyes was colourless delicately expressive yet with something mysterious in its sphinxlike immobility a woman hard to read who seemed to delight in keeping locked up behind that fascinating rigidity of feature the intense sensibility which had been revealed to him her master only in occasional and rare moments of enthusiasm she reminded him sometimes of the one holy and ineffable madonna at others of berode the great courtezan of her day who had sent kings away from her doors and had just announced her intention of ending her life in a convent  i believe that you are right he said softly it is the worst of including in our vocabulary words which have no definite meaning perhaps i should say of which the meaning varies according to ones personal point of view you for instance you live you are not afraid to live yet you make our bohemianism seem like a vulgar thing  she stirred gently in her chair  my friend she said i have been your pupil for two years you have watched all the uncouth creations of my brain come sprawling out upon the canvas and besides we have been companions yet the fact remains that you do not understand me at all no not one little bit it is extraordinary  it is he replied the one humiliation of my life my opportunities have been immense and my failure utter if i had been your companion only and not your master i might very well have been content to accept you for what you seem but there have been times anna when your work has startled me illdrawn without method or sense of proportion you have put wonderful things on to canvas have drawn them out of yourself notwithstanding your mechanical inefficiency god knows how you did it you are utterly baffling  she laughed at him easily and mirthfully  dear friend she said do not magnify me into a physiological problem i should only disappoint you terribly some day i think i know where i am puzzling you now  then for heavens sake be merciful he exclaimed lift up one corner of the curtain for me  very well you shall tell me if i am wrong you see me here an admitted failure in the object to which i have devoted two years of my life you know that i am practically destitute without means or any certain knowledge of where my next meal is coming from i speak frankly because you also know that no possible extremity would induce me to accept help from any living person you notice that i have recently spent ten francs on a box of the best russian cigarettes and that there are roses upon my table you observe that i am as usual fairly cheerful and moderately amiable it surprises you you do not understand and you would like to very well i will try to help you  her hand hung over the side of her chair nearest to him he looked at it eagerly but made no movement to take it during all their long comradeship he had never so much as ventured to hold her fingers this was david courtlaw whose ways too had never been very different from the ways of other men as regards her sex  you see it comes after all she continued from certain original convictions which have become my religion rather a magniloquent term perhaps but what else am i to say one of these is that the most absolutely selfish thing in the world is to give way to depression to think of ones troubles at all except of how to overcome them i spend many delightful hours thinking of the pleasant and beautiful things of life i decline to waste a single second even in considering the ugly ones do you know that this becomes a habit  if you would only teach us all he murmured how to acquire it  i suppose people would say that it is a matter of temperament she continued with me i believe that it is more it has become a part of the order of my life whatever may happen tomorrow i shall be none the better for anticipating its miseries today  i wonder he said a trifle irrelevantly what the future has in store for you  she shrugged her shoulders  is that not rather a profitless speculation my friend  he seemed deaf to her interruption his grey eyes burned under his shaggy eyebrows he leaned towards her as though anxious to see more of her face than that faint delicate profile gleaming like marble in the uncertain light  you were born for great things he said huskily for great passions for great accomplishments will you find your destiny i wonder or will you go through life like so many othersa wanderer knocking ever at empty doors homeless to the last oh if one could but find the way to your heart  she laughed gaily  dear friend she said remember that you are speaking to one who has failed in the only serious object which she has ever sought to accomplish my destiny i am afraid is going to lead me into the ruts  he shook his head  you were never born he declared to follow the well worn roads i wonder he added after a moments pause whether you ever realize how young you are  young i am twentyfour  yet you are very young anna why will you persist in this singlehanded combat with life  dont she cried  but i must i will he answered fiercely oh i know you would stop me if you could this time you cannot you are the woman i love anna let me make your future for you dont be afraid that i shall stunt it i will give you a broad free life you shall have room to develop you shall live as you will where you will only give me the right to protect you to free you from all these petty material cares  she laid her hand softly upon his  dear friend she said do you not think that you are breaking an unspoken compact i am very sorry in your heart you know quite well that all that you have said is useless  ay he repeated looking away from her uselessworse than useless  you are foolish she declared with a note of irritability in her tone you would appear to be trying to destroy a comradeship which has been very very pleasant for you know that i have made up my mind to dig a little way into life singlehanded i too want to understandto walk with my head in the light love is a great thing and happiness a joy let me go my own way towards them we may meetwho can tell but i will not be fettered even though you would make the chains of roses listen  she stopped short there was a sharp knocking at the outside door courtlaw rose to his feet  it is too late for visitors she remarked i wonder would you mind seeing who it is  courtlaw crossed the room and threw open the door he had come to annas rooms from a dinner party and he was in evening dress sir john who was standing outside looked past him at the girl still sitting in the shadow  i believe he said stiffly that these are the apartments of miss pellissier i must apologize for disturbing you at such an unseemly hour but i should be very much obliged if miss pellissier would allow me a few minutes conversation my name is ferringhallsir john ferringhall     chapter v  alcide   courtlaw took up his hat and coat at once but anna motioned him to remain  please stay she said briefly will you come in sir john i believe that i have heard my sister speak of you this is my friend mr david courtlawsir john ferringhall  sir john acknowledged the introduction without cordiality he entered the room with his usual deliberation and looked covertly about him he noticed the two chairs close together anna was still holding her cigarette between her fingers her likeness to her sister gave him at first almost a shock a moment afterwards he was conscious of a wonderful sense of relief for if the likeness between the sisters was remarkable the likeness between this girl and the poster which he had come from studying was more remarkable still  i must repeat sir john said that i much regret disturbing you at such an unseemly hour my only excuse is that i missed my way here and i am leaving paris early tomorrow morning  if your business with me is of any importance anna said calmly it does not matter in the least about the hour have you brought me a message from my sister i understood i believe that she was seeing you last night  your sister he answered did me the honour of dining with me last night  yes  after all it was not so easy the girls eyes never left his face she was civil but she was obviously impatient to know his errand afraid no doubt he thought grimly that her other visitor would leave  i believe he said slowly that i shall do best to throw myself upon your consideration and tell you the truth i have recently made your sisters acquaintance and in the course of conversation i understood from her that her christian name was anna some friends who saw us dining together persist in alluding to her as miss annabel pellissier i am guilty practically of the impertinence of coming to ask you whether i misunderstood your sister  is my sisters christian name then of so much importance to you she asked with a faint smile  the things involved in it are he answered gravely  she accepted his rejoinder with a brief nod courtlaw opened his lips but remained silent in the face of her imperative gesture let me hasten she said to reassure you my sister was scarcely likely to make a mistake she told youthe truth  courtlaws walking stick which he had been handling fell with a crash to the ground he stooped to recover it and his face was hidden sir john felt and looked several years younger  i am much obliged to you he said really i do not know why i should have doubted it  nor i she remarked tersely  he looked at her with a certain curiosity she was a very elegant young woman slightly taller perhaps than her sister and with an air of reserved strength underneath her quiet face and manner which annabel may have lacked it was hard to associate her with the stories which he and all paris had heard of alcide  you then he said are alcide that wonderful posteris of you  she lifted her eyebrows  i am sorry she said if you find the likeness unsatisfactory my friends consider it wonderfully faithful have you any more questions to ask me  sir john on his way down had determined to hint to this young woman that providing certain contingencies which he had in his mind should come to pass he would be prepared to make her a handsome offer to change her name he found however that now the time had come he utterly lacked the courage to attempt any such speech  none i thank you he answered i will not intrude upon you further  wait she said  he turned back at once  i have answered all your questions she said perhaps you will not object to answering one for me you have thought it worth while to take some considerable pains to resolve for yourself my sisters identity may i ask the nature of your interest in her  he hesitated  it is not an easy matter he said for me to offer you an altogether adequate explanation i have only seen your sister for a very brief time and i am a little past the age when a man does headstrong things at the same time i must say that i am most anxious to improve my acquaintance with her i am a single man and  thank you she interrupted i will not ask you to explain further good night  he left at once immensely relieved yet scarcely satisfied with himself as regarded his share of the interview with this young woman they heard his footsteps descending the stone staircase growing fainter and fainter then courtlaw looked across at her with a white puzzled face  why did you lie to that man he asked fiercely how dared you do yourself this injustice  i did it for her sake she answered it may be her salvation i believe that he will marry her  you would let himknowingall that you know  why not she is my flesh and blood she is more dear to me than anything else perhaps if i had watched over her more closely things would have been different  you why you have been an angel to her he exclaimed impatiently you know very well that she is selfish and pleasureloving to the backbone you have made enough sacrifices for her surely without this besides you cannot tell where it will end you have taken upon your shoulders the burden of her misdeeds you may have to carry them further and longer than you think oh it is unbearable  the mans face was dark with passion it was as though he were personally aggrieved his tone was rough almost threatening the girl only smiled at him serenely but she laid her hand for a moment quietly upon his  dear friend she said this is a matter which you must leave to me to do as i think best annabel is my only sister you know almost my only relative if i do not look after her she has no one and she is very young younger than her years  it was significant of her influence over him that he answered her calmly although a storm of angry thoughts were struggling for expression within him  look after her why not but you have done it all your life you have been her guardian angel but even you cannot alter her character annabel was born soulless a human butterfly if ever there was one the pursuit of pleasure selfgratification is an original instinct with her blood and bone body and spirit she is selfish through and through even you have not been able to hold her back i speak no harm of her she is your sister and god knows i wish her none but  a look checked him  i know she said quietly that paris where she has been so much admired is not a good place for her that is why i am glad that she has gone to london  he rose from his chair and walked restlessly up and down the room the passion of pentup speech compelled action of some sort there was a black fear in his heart he stopped before her suddenly  you too he said abruptly you mean to follow her you will go to london  it is necessary she answered you yourself have decided thatapart from the question of annabel  he was suddenly calm  it is part of the irony of life he said one is always playing the surgeon one kills always the thing one loves best i meant to lie to you would to god i had  she shook her head  the surgeons knife is surely a kindly weapon she declared it was best for me to know later on i could scarcely have forgiven you  and nowi am to lose you  for a little time she answered i meant to say goodbye to you tonight or after all is it worth while the channel is a little broader than the boulevardsbut one crosses it sometimes  he looked at her with white set face  yes he said i shall come that is very certain but after all it will be different i think that i have become a drug drinker i need you every day in the mornings i find labour easy because i am going to see you in the afternoon my brain and fingers leap to their work because you have been with me anna you shall not go i cannot let you go  she threw away the end of her cigarette without turning or looking in his direction she leaned forwards her head supported upon her fingers her elbows upon her knees she gazed steadily out of the window at that arc of glittering lights he made a quick movement towards her but she did not flinch his arm fell to his side the effort of selfrepression cost him a sob  david she said you are not a coward are you  i do not know he muttered the bravest of us have joints in our armour  you are not a coward she repeated or you would not be my friend a woman may choose any one for her lover but for her friend she makes no mistake you are not a coward david and you must not talk like one put out your hand and bid me godspeed it is the only way  i cannot do it he cried hoarsely i cannot part with you you have grown into my life anna  again she stopped him but this time it was not so easy the mans passion became almost unbearable at the thought of losing her and yet as she rose slowly to her feet and stood looking at him with outstretched hands a strange mixture of expressions shining in her wonderful eyes he realized in some measure the strength of her determination felt the utter impotence of anything which he could say to her he forgot for the moment his own selfpity the egotism of his own passionate love he took her hands firmly in his and raised them to his lips  you shall go he declared i will make of the days and weeks one long morning but remember the afternoon must come always remember that  her hands fell to her side she remained for a few moments standing as though listening to his retreating footsteps then she turned and entering the inner room commenced to dress hastily for the street     chapter vi  a question of identification   the little man with the closelycropped beard and hair looked at her keenly through his gold eyeglasses he sat before a desk littered all over with papers and official looking documents the walls of the room were lined with shelves on which were glass jars retorts countless bottles and many appliances of surgical science a skeleton was propped against the mantelpiece the atmosphere seemed heavy with the odour of drugs  you are mademoiselle pellissier he asked without rising to his feet  anna admitted the fact  we sent for you several hours ago he remarked  i came directly i was disengaged anna answered in any case there is probably some mistake i have very few friends in paris  he referred to a sheet of paper by his side  your name and address were upon an envelope found in the pocket of an englishman who was brought here late last night suffering from serious injuries he said in a dry official tone as it is doubtful whether the man will live we should be glad if you would identify him  it is most unlikely that i shall be able to do so anna answered to the best of my belief i have not a single english acquaintance in the city  my dear young lady the official said irritably this man would not have your name and address in his pocket without an object you cannot tell whether you know him or not until you have seen him be so good as to come this way  with a little shrug of the shoulders anna followed him they ascended by a lift to one of the upper floors passed through a long ward and finally came to a bed in the extreme corner round which a screen had been arranged a nurse came hurrying up  he is quiet only this minute she said to the official all the time he is shouting and muttering if this is the young lady she can perhaps calm him  anna stepped to the foot of the bed an electric light flashed out from the wall the face of the man who lay there was clearly visible anna merely glanced at the coarse flushed features and at once shook her head  i have never seen him in my life she said to the official i have not the least idea who he is  just then the mans eyes opened he saw the girl and sprang up in bed  annabel at last he shouted where have you been all these hours i have been calling for you annabel i was lying who says that i am not meysey hill i was trying to scare you see it is on my cardsm hill meysey hill dont touch the handle annabel curse the thing youve jammed it now do you want to kill us both stop the thing stop it  anna stepped back bewildered but the man held out his arms to her  i tell you it was a lie he shouted wildly cant you believe me i am meysey hill i am the richest man in england i am the richest man in the world you love money you know you do annabel never mind ive got plenty well go to the shops diamonds you shall have all that you can carry away sacks full if you like pearls too i mean it i tell you im meysey hill the railway man dont leave me dont leave me in this beastly thing annabel annabel  his voice became a shriek in response to an almost imperative gesture from the nurse anna laid her hand upon his he fell back upon the pillows with a little moan clutching the slim white fingers fiercely in a moment his grasp grew weaker the perspiration stood out upon his forehead his eyes closed  anna stepped back at once with a little gasp of relief the hand which the man had been holding hung limp and nerveless at her side she held it away from her with an instinctive repulsion born of her unconquerable antipathy to the touch of strangers she began rubbing it with her pockethandkerchief the man himself was not a pleasant object part of his head was swathed in linen bandages such of his features as were visible were of coarse mould his eyes were set too close together anna turned deliberately away from the bedside she followed the official back into his room  well he asked her tersely  i can only repeat what i said before she declared to the best of my belief i have never seen the man in my life  but he recognized you the official objected  he fancied that he did she corrected him coolly i suppose delusions are not uncommon to patients in his condition  the official frowned  your name and address in his pocket was no delusion he said sharply i do not wish to make impertinent inquiries into your private life nothing is of any concern of ours except the discovery of the mans identity he was picked up from amongst the wreckage of a broken motor on the road to versailles last night and we have information that a lady was with him only a few minutes before the accident occurred  you are very unbelieving anna said coldly i hope you will not compel me to say again that i do not know the mans name nor to the best of my belief have i ever seen him before in my life  the official shrugged his shoulders  you decline to help us in any way then he said remember that the man will probably die he had little money about him and unless friends come to his aid he must be treated as a pauper  i do not wish to seem unfeeling anna said slowly but i can only repeat that i am absolutely without concern in the matter the man is a stranger to me  the official had no more to say only it was with a further and most unbelieving shrug of the shoulders that he resumed his seat  you will be so good as to leave us your correct name and address mademoiselle he said curtly  you have them both anna answered  he opened the door for her with a faint disagreeable smile  it is possible mademoiselle he said that this affair is not yet ended it may bring us together again  she passed out without reply yet she took with her an uneasy consciousness that in this affair might lie the germs of future trouble  as she crossed the square almost within a stones throw of her lodgings she came face to face with courtlaw he stopped short with a little exclamation of surprise  my dear friend she laughed not so tragic if you please  he recovered himself  i was surprised i admit he said you did not tell me that you were going out or i would have offered my escort do you know how late it is  she nodded  i heard the clock strike as i crossed the square she answered i was sent for to go to the hospital st denis but what are you doing here  old père runeval met me on your doorstep and he would not let me go i have been sitting with him ever since the hospital st denis did you say i hope that no one of our friends has met with an accident  she shook her head  they wanted me to identify some one whom i had certainly never seen before in my life and to tell you the truth they were positively rude to me because i could not have you ever heard the name of meysey hill  meysey hill he repeated it after her and she knew at once from his tone and his quick glance into her face that the name possessed some significance for him  yes i have heard of him and i know him by sight he admitted he was a friend of your sisters was he not  i never heard her mention his name she answered still of course it is possible this man was apparently not sure whether he was meysey hill or not  how long had he been in the hospital courtlaw asked  since last night  then whoever he may be he is not meysey hill courtlaw said that young man was giving a luncheon party to a dozen friends at the café de paris today i sat within a few feet of him i feel almost inclined to regret the fact  why she asked  if one half of the stories about meysey hill are true he answered i would not stretch out my little finger to save his life  isnt that a little extreme  i am an extreme person at times this man has an evil reputation i know of scandalous deeds which he has done  anna had reached the house where she lodged but she hesitated on the doorstep  have you ever seen annabel with him she asked  never  it is odd that this man at the hospital should call himself meysey hill she remarked  if you wish he said i will go there in the morning and see what can be done for him  it would be very kind of you she declared i am only sorry that i did not ask you to go with me  she rang the bell and he waited by her side until she was admitted to the tall gloomy lodginghouse and ever after it struck him that her backward smile as she disappeared was charged with some special significance the door closed upon her and he moved reluctantly away when next he asked for her some twelve hours later he was told that mademoiselle had left his most eager inquiries and most lavish bribes could gain no further information than that she had left for england and that her address waslondon     chapter vii  miss pellissiers suspicions   anna  anna kissed her sister and nodded to her aunt then she sat downuninvitedand looked from one to the other curiously there was something about their greeting and the tone of annabels exclamation which puzzled her  i wish she said that you would leave off looking at me as though i were something grisly i am your very dutiful niece aunt and your most devoted sister annabel i havent murdered any one or broken the law in any way that i know of perhaps you will explain the state of panic into which i seem to have thrown you  annabel who was looking very well and who was most becomingly dressed moved to a seat from which she could command a view of the road outside she was the first to recover herself her aunt a faded anæmiclooking lady of somewhat too obtrusive gentility was still sitting with her hand pressed to her heart  annabel looked up and down the empty street and then turned to her sister  for one thing anna she remarked we had not the slightest idea that you had left or were leaving paris you did not say a word about it last week nor have you written it is quite a descent from the clouds isnt it  i will accept that anna said as accounting for the surprise perhaps you will now explain the alarm  miss pellissier was beginning to recover herself she too at once developed an anxious interest in the street outside  i am sure anna she said i do not see why we should conceal the truth from you we are expecting a visit from sir john ferringhall at any moment he is coming here to tea  well anna remarked calmly  sir john her aunt repeated with thin emphasis is coming to see your sister  anna drummed impatiently with her fingers against the arm of her chair  well she declared goodhumouredly i shant eat him  miss pellissier stiffened visibly  this is not a matter altogether for levity anna she said your sisters future is at stake i imagine that even you must realize that this is of some importance  anna glanced towards her sister but the latter avoided her eyes  i have always she admitted calmly taken a certain amount of interest in annabels future i should like to know how it is concerned with sir john ferringhall and how my presence intervenes  sir john miss pellissier said impressively has asked your sister to be his wife it is a most wonderful piece of good fortune as i suppose you will be prepared to admit the ferringhalls are of course without any pretence at family but sir john is a very rich man and will be able to give annabel a very enviable position in the world the settlements which he has spoken of too are most munificent no wonder we are anxious that nothing should happen to make him change his mind  i still  anna stopped short suddenly she understood she grew perhaps a shade paler and she glanced out into the street where her fourwheeler cab laden with luggage was still waiting  sir john of course disapproves of me she remarked slowly  sir john is a man of the world her aunt answered coldly he naturally does not wish for connexions which arei do not wish to hurt you feelings anna but i must say itnot altogether desirable  the irrepressible smile curved annas lips she glanced towards her sister and curiously enough found in her face some faint reflection of her own rather sombre mirth she leaned back in her chair it was no use the smile had become a laugh she laughed till the tears stood in her eyes  i had a visit from sir john in my rooms she said did he tell you annabel  yes  he mentioned the matter to me also miss pellissier remarked stiffly the visit seems to have made a most painful impression upon him to tell you the truth he spoke to me very seriously upon the subject  anna sprang up  i will be off she declared my cab with all that luggage would give the whole show away goodbye aunt  miss pellissier tried ineffectually to conceal her relief  i do not like to seem inhospitable anna she said hesitatingly and of course you are my niece just as annabel is although i am sorry to learn that your conduct has been much less discreet than hers but at the same time i must say plainly that i think your presence here just now would be a great misfortune i wish very much that you had written before leaving paris  anna nodded  quite right she said i ought to have done goodbye aunt ill come and see you again later on annabel come to the door with me she added a little abruptly there is something which i must say to you  annabel rose and followed her sister from the room a maidservant held the front door open anna sent her away  annabel she said brusquely listen to me  well  sir john came to methat you knowand you can guess what i told him no never mind about thanking me i want to ask you a plain question and you must answer me faithfully is all that folly done withfor ever  annabel shivered ever so slightly  of course it is anna you ought to know that i am going to make a fresh start  be very sure that you do anna said slowly if i thought for a moment that there was any chance of a relapse i should stop here and tell him the truth even now  annabel looked at her with terrified eyes  anna she cried you must believe me i am really in earnest i would not have him knownowfor the world  very well anna said i will believe you remember that hes not at all a bad sort and to speak frankly hes your salvation try and let him never regret it theres plenty to be got out of life in a decent sort of way be a good wife to him you can if you will  i promise annabel declared he is very kind anna really and not half such a prig as he seems  anna moved towards the door but her sister detained her  wont you tell me why you have come to england she said it was such a surprise to see you i thought that you loved paris and your work so much  a momentary bitterness crept into annas tone  i have made no progress with my work she said slowly and the money was gone i had to ask mr courtlaw for his true verdict and he gave it me i have given up painting  anna  it is true dear after all there are other things all that i regret are the wasted years and i am not sure that i regret them only of course i must begin something else at once that is why i came to london  but what are you going to dowhere are you going to live annabel asked have you any money  lots anna answered laconically never mind me i always fall on my feet you know  you will let us hear from youlet us know where you are very soon annabel called out from the step  anna nodded as she briskly crossed the pavement  some day she answered run in now theres a hansom coming round the corner                                       anna sat back in her cab but found it remain stationary  gracious she exclaimed to herself i dont know where to go to  the cabman knocking with the butt end of his whip upon the window reminded her that he was in a similar predicament  drive towards st pancras she directed promptly i will tell you when to stop  the cab rumbled off anna leaned forward watching the people in the streets it was then for the first time she remembered that she had said nothing to her sister of the man in the hospital     chapter viii  whites   northwards away from the inhospitality of west kensington rumbled the ancient fourwheel cab laden with luggage and drawn by a wheezy old horse rapidly approaching its last days inside was anna leaning a little forward to watch the passersby brighteyed full to the brim of the insatiable curiosity of youththe desire to understand and appreciate this new world in which she found herself she was practically an outcast she had not even the ghost of a plan as to her future and she had something less than five pounds in her pocket she watched the people and hummed softly to herself  suddenly she thrust her head out of the window  please stop cabman she ordered  the man pulled up it was not a difficult affair  is this montague street wc she asked  the man looked as though he would have liked to deny it but could not  stay where you are for a moment she directed i want to find an address  the man contented himself with a nod anna rummaged about in her dressingcase and finally drew out a letter on the envelope was written                 sydney courtlaw esq                   13 montague st  she put her head out of the window  number 13 please cabman  weve come past it miss the man answered with a note of finality in his gruff voice  then turn round and go back there she directed  the man muttered something inaudible and gathered up the reins his horse which had apparently gone to sleep preferred to remain where he was after a certain amount of manoeuvring however he was induced to crawl around and in a few minutes came to stop again before a tall brightlypainted house which seemed like an oasis of colour and assertive prosperity in a long dingy row this was number 13 montague street familiarly spoken of in the neighbourhood as whites  anna promptly alighted with the letter in her hand the door was opened for her by a wearylooking youth in a striped jacket several sizes too large for him the rest of his attire was nondescript  does mr courtlaw mr sydney courtlaw live here please anna asked him  not home yet miss the young man replied generally gets here about seven  anna hesitated and then held out the letter  i think that i will leave this letter for him she said it is from his brother in paris say that i will call again or let him know my address in london  the young man accepted the letter and the message and seemed about to close the door when a lady issued from one of the front rooms and intervened she wore a black satin dress a little shiny at the seams a purposeless bow of white tulle at the back of her neck and a huge chatelaine she addressed anna with a beaming smile and a very creditable mixture of condescension and officiousness under the somewhat trying incandescent light her cheeks pleaded guilty to a recent use of the powder puff  i think that you were inquiring for mr courtlaw she remarked he is one of our guestsperhaps i should say boarders here but he seldom returns before dinnertime we dine at seventhirty can i give him any message for you  thank you anna answered i have a letter for him from his brother which i was just leaving  i will see that he gets it immediately on his return the lady promised you did not wish to see him particularly this evening then  anna hesitated  well no she answered to tell you the truth though i am quite a stranger in london and it occurred to me that mr courtlaw might have been able to give me an idea where to stop  the lady in black satin looked at the pile of luggage outside and hesitated  were you thinking of private apartments a boardinghouse or an hotel she asked  i really had not thought about it at all anna answered smiling i expected to stay with a relation but i found that their arrangements did not allow of it i have been used to living in apartments in paris but i suppose the system is different here  the lady in black satin appeared undecided she looked from anna who was far too nicelooking to be travelling about alone to that reassuring pile of luggage and wrinkled her brows thoughtfully  of course she said diffidently this is a boardinghouse although we never take in promiscuous travellers the class of guests we have are all permanent and i am obliged to be very careful indeed butif you are a friend of mr courtlawsi should like to oblige mr courtlaw  it is very nice of you to think of it anna said briskly i should really like to find somewhere to stay if it was only for a few nights  the lady stood away from the door  will you come this way she said into the drawingroom there is no one there just now most of my people are upstairs dressing for dinner the gentlemen are so particular now and a good thing too i say i was always used to it and i think it gives quite a tone to an establishment please sit down missdear me i havent asked you your name yet  my name is pellissier anna said anna pellissier  i am mrs white the lady in black satin remarked it makes one feel quite awkward to mention such a thing but after all i think that it is best for both parties could you give me any references  there is mr courtlaw anna said and my solicitors messrs le mercier and stowe of st heliers they are rather a long way off but you could write to them i am sorry that i do not know any one in london but after all mrs white i am not sure that i could afford to come to you i am shockingly poor please tell me what your terms are  well mrs white said slowly it depends a good deal upon what rooms you have just now my best ones are all taken  so much the better anna declared cheerfully the smallest will do for me quite well  mrs white looked mysteriously about the room as though to be sure that no one was listening  i should like you to come here she said its a great deal for a young lady whos alone in the world as i suppose you are at present to have a respectable home and i do not think in such a case that private apartments are at all desirable we have a very nice set of young people here too just at present and you would soon make some friends i will take you for thirtyfive shillings a week please dont let any one know that  i have no idea what it costs to live in london anna said but i should like very much to come for a short time if i might  certainly mrs white said two days notice shall be sufficient on either side  and i may bring my luggage in and send that cabman away anna asked dear me what a relief if i had had any nerves that man would have trampled upon them long ago  cabmen are so trying mrs white assented you need have no further trouble the manservant shall bring your trunks in and pay the fare too if you like  anna drew out her purse at once  you are really a good samaritan she declared i am perfectly certain that that man meant to be rude to me he has been bottling it up all the way from west kensington  mrs white rang the bell  come upstairs she said and i will show you your room and would you mind hurrying a little you wont want to be late the first evening and its ten minutes past seven now gracious theres the gong this way my dearandyoull excuse my mentioning it but a quiet blouse and a little chiffon you know will be quite sufficient its your first evening and early impressions do count for so much you understand me im sure  anna was a little puzzled but she only laughed  perhaps as ive only just arrived she remarked i might be forgiven if i do not change my skirt i packed so hurriedly that it will take me a long time to find my things  certainly mrs white assured her certainly ill mention it youre tired of course this is your room the gong will go at seventhirty dont be late if you can help it                                       anna was not late but her heart sank within her when she entered the drawingroom it was not a hopeful looking group two or three podgylooking old men with wives to match halfadozen overdressed girls and a couple of underdressed american ones who still wore the clothes in which they had been tramping half over london since breakfast time a sprinkling of callow youths and a couple of pronounced young jews who were talking loudly together in some unintelligible jargon of the city what had she to do with such as these she had hard work to keep a smiling face as mrs white who had risen to greet her proceeded with a formal and from annas point of view a wholly unnecessary round of introductions and then suddenlya relief a young manalmost a boy slight dark and with his brothers deep grey eyescame across the room to her  you must be the miss pellissier of whom david has told me so much he said shyly i am very glad that you have come here i heard from david about you only this morning  you are marvellously like your brother anna said beaming upon him i have a letter for you and no end of messages where can we sit down and talk  he led her across the room towards a window recess in which a tall fair young man was seated with an evening paper in his hand  let me introduce my friend to you courtlaw said arthur this is miss pellissiermr brendon brendon and i are great chums he went on nervously we are clerks in the same bank i dont think that the rest of the people here like us very well do they arthur so were obliged to be friends  anna shook hands with brendona young man also but older and more selfpossessed than sydney courtlaw  sydney is quite right miss pellissier he said he and i dont seem to get on at all with our fellowguests as mrs white calls them you really ought not to stay here and talk to us it is a most inauspicious start for you  dear me anna laughed how unfortunate what ought i to do should i be forgiven do you think if i were to go and hold that skein of wool for the old lady in the yellow cap  dont speak of her irreverently brendon said in an awed whisper her husband was a county councillor and she has a niece who comes to see her in a carriage i wish she wouldnt look like that at us over her glasses  horace the manservant transformed now into the semblance of a correctly garbed waiter threw open the door  dinner is served maam he announced to mrs white  there was no rush everything was done in a genteel and ordinary way but on the other hand there was no lingering anna found herself next sydney courtlaw with his friend close at hand opposite to her was a sallowvisaged young man whose small tie seemed like a smudge of obtusively shiny black across the front of a high closedrawn collar as a rule courtlaw told her softly he talked right and left and to everybody throughout the whole of the mealtonight he was almost silent and seemed to devote his whole attention to staring at anna after the first courses however she scarcely noticed him her two new friends did their best to entertain her  i cant imagine miss pellissier brendon said leaning towards her whatever made you think of coming to stay if only for a week at a montague street boardinghouse are you going to write a novel  not i she answered gaily i came to london unexpectedly and my friends could not take me in i had a vague sort of idea that this was the region where one finds apartments so i told my cabman to drive in this direction while i sat inside his vehicle and endeavoured to form a plan of campaign he brought me past this house and i thought i would call and leave your brothers letter then i saw mrs white  no more sydney courtlaw begged laughingly you were booked of course an unexpected vacancy wasnt it every one comes in on unexpected vacancy  and they go  when they get the chance it really isnt so easy to go as it seems we have come to the conclusion brendon and i that mrs white is psychologically gifted she throws a sort of spell over us all we struggle against it at first but in the end we have to submit she calls us her guests but in reality we are her prisoners we simply cant get away theres that old gentleman at the end of the tablebullding his name is he will tell you confidentially that he simply hates the place yet hes been here for six years and hes as much a fixture as that sham mahogany sideboard everyone will grumble to you confidentiallymiss ellicot shes our swagger young lady you knowup there next to miss white she will tell you that it is so out of the world here so far away from everyone one knows old kesterton cholericlooking individual nearly opposite will curse the cooking till hes black in the face but he never misses a dinner the semitic looking young man opposite who seems to have been committing you to memory piecemeal will tell you that he was never so bored in all his life as he has been here yet he stays they all stay  and you yourself  brendon laughed  oh we are also under the spell he declared but i think that we are here mainly because it is cheap it is really cheap you know to appreciate it you should try rooms  is this a fair sample of the dinner anna asked who had the healthy appetite of a strong young woman  it is if anything a little above the average brendon admitted  anna said nothing the young man opposite was straining his ears to listen to their conversation mrs white caught her eye and smiled benignly down the table  i hope that mr courtlaw is looking after you miss pellissier she said  admirably thank you anna answered  the young lady with frizzled hair whom brendon had pointed out to her as miss ellicot leaned forward from her hostesss side she had very frizzy hair indeed very black eyebrows a profusion of metallic adornments about her neck and waist and an engaging smile  we are so interested to hear miss pellissier she said that you have been living in paris we shall expect you to tell us all what to wear  anna smiled very faintly and shook her head  i have come from a very unfashionable quarter she said and i do not think that i have been inside a milliners shop for a year besides it is all reversed now you know paris copies london  brendon leaned over confidentially  you are in luck miss pellissier he declared your success here is absolutely meteoric miss ellicot has spoken to you the great mr bullding is going to for five minutes he has been trying to think of something to say i am not sure but i believe that he has just thought of something  may i be prepared anna asked which is mr bullding  stout old gentleman four places down on the left look out its coming  anna raised her eyes and caught the earnest gaze of an elderly gentleman with a double chin a protuberant under lip and a snuffstained coat  i was in paris four years ago mr building announced solemnly it rained the whole of the time but we saw all the sights and the place never seemed dull  it takes a great deal of bad weather to depress the true parisian anna admitted  a volatile temperamentyes a volatile temperament mr bullding repeated rather struck with the phrase it is a pity that as nations we are not more friendly  anna nodded and turned again to courtlaw  i will not be drawn into a conversation with mr bullding she declared i believe that he would bore me tell me what are these bananas and nuts for  dessert  anna laid down her serviette  let us escape she said couldnt we three go out and have some coffee somewhere the thought of that drawingroom paralyses me  brendon laughed softly  we can he said and we will but it is only fair to warn you that it isnt expected mrs white is proud of her drawingroom evenings there is a musical programme and we have the windows open and blinds up and a pink lamp shade over the piano lampa sort of advertisement of the place you know strangers look in and long and neighbours are moved to envy  anna hesitated no longer she almost sprang to her feet conscious of mrs whites surprise as she swung easily down the room followed by the two young men she smiled a careless explanation at her  i am dying to renew my acquaintance with london mrs white she remarked  you are not going outthis evening i trust that lady asked a trifle dismayed  anna did not pause but she looked over her shoulder with slightly lifted eyebrows  why not they tell me that london is impossible till after ten and i want my first impressions to be favourable  there will be some coffee and music in the drawingroom in a few minutes mrs white said  thanks im not very fond of coffee anna answered and i hate music good night  mrs white gasped and then stiffened miss ellicot who sang ballads and liked brendon to turn over the pages for her tossed her head anna passed serenely out     chapter ix  brendons luck   anna sat in a chair in her room and sighed she was alone and the mask of her unchanging high spirits was for the moment laid aside she was a little paler than when she had come to london a little paler and a little thinner there were dark rims under her eyes soft now with unshed tears for this three weeks had been the hardest of her life there had been disappointments and humiliations and although she hated to admit it even to herself she was in desperate straits nevertheless she was still fighting  there is one thing i must concentrate on at the moment she told herself and that is how to pay my next weeks bill to mrs white it ought not to be much i have gone without dinner for three nights andcome in  sydney courtlaw followed his timid knock anna raised her eyebrows at the sight of him he was in evening dress swallowtailed coat and white tie  is this a concession to mrs white she asked laughing how gratified she must have been if only i had known i would have made an effort to get home in time for dinner  not exactly he answered nervously please forgive me coming up miss pellissier but you have not been down to dinner for three nights andbrendon and iwe were afraid that you might be unwell  never better in my life anna declared briskly i had lunch very late today and i did not get home in time for dinner  she smiled grimly at the recollection of that lunchtea and roll at a cheap café sydney was watching her eagerly  im glad youre all right he said because we want you to do us a favour brendons had an awful stroke of luck  im delighted she exclaimed do tell me all about it  he only heard this afternoon sydney continued an uncle in new york is dead and has left him loads of money a lawyer has come all the way from america about it we want to celebrate and we want you to help us brendon suggests supper at the carlton we meant to make it dinner and a theatre but you were not home we thought of starting in half an hours time and trying for a theatre somewhere on the way  how delightful exclaimed anna i should love to come it is very sweet of you to have waited for me run away now please i must see if i have a gown fit to wear                                       this anna declared as she sipped her wine and looked around her reminds me more of paris than any place i have yet seen i suppose it is the mirrors and decorations  and the people brendon asked what do you think of them  anna extended her critical survey and shrugged her shoulders  what can one say she exclaimed did you ever see women so wearylooking and so dowdy they do not talk they seem to spend their time yawning and inspecting their neighbours dresses through those hateful glasses it never seems to enter their heads to try and amuse their menkind  two young men on their way down the room came suddenly to a standstill before anna the foremost tall cleanshaven perfectly groomed half extended his hand with a smile of recognition  miss pellissier isnt it he said glad to see you in london no idea that you were here though  anna looked up with a doubtful smile of nonrecognition  my name is certainly pellissier she said but i am very sorryi do not recognize you in the least  the tall young man dropped his eyeglass and smiled  had the pleasure of dining with you at the ambassadors one night before the show you knowlast september i think it was charley pevenill was our host my name is armytagelord ernest armytage  anna had suddenly stiffened she regarded the young man coldly her tone was icy  i am afraid that you are making a mistake she said i was never at any such dinner and i am quite sure that i do not know you  perhaps you remember me miss pellissier the second young man interposed i had the pleasure ofermeeting you more than once i believe  a spot of colour flared in annas cheek as she glanced towards the speaker something in his smile in the cynical suggestiveness of his deferential tone maddened her  to the best of my belief she said with quiet dignity i have never seen either of you before in my life  for a fraction of a second the two young men hesitated then the foremost bowed and passed on  i am exceedingly sorry he said pray accept my apologies  and mine murmured his companion with the smile still lingering upon his lips  they took their places at a distant table anna sat quite still for a moment and then the colour suddenly returned to her cheeks she laughed softly and leaned across the table  do not look so uncomfortable both of you she begged those young men startled me at first because they knew my name i am quite sure though that they did not mean to be rude  impudent beggars sydney growled i never wanted to kick any one so much in my life as that second fellow  i think anna said that it was only his manner do look at this tragedy in mauve who has just come in what can she be the wife of a country tradesman or a duchess and such a meek little husband too what can she have done to deserve such a fate oh  they both turned round at annas exclamation a familiar figure was making his way towards them sydney sprang up  why its david he exclaimed hullo  courtlaw haggard his deepset eyes more brilliant than ever took annas hand into his and breathed a little close drawn sigh of content he was introduced to brendon and a chair was brought by an attentive waiter he declined supper but took wine  have you dropped from the skies sydney asked wonderingly it was only yesterday i had your letter and you never mentioned coming over  i had some unexpected business courtlaw answered shortly  and how did you find us here  i called at montague street a few minutes after you had left mrs white told me where to find you  he leaned back in his chair as though wearied yet either the rest or the wine seemed already to have done him good the lines about his mouth gradually softened he talked very little and rather absently in no way could he be said to contribute to the gaiety of the little party but when they were on their way out he whispered in annas ear  please let me drive you home i want to talk to you and i must return tomorrow  anna hesitated  we are mr brendons guests she said and i scarcely think it would be nice of me to leave him alone with sydney  courtlaw turned abruptly to brendon  mr brendon he said may i rob you of your guest just for the drive home i have only a few hours in england and miss pellissier is an old friend  by all means brendon answered we will follow you in another cab  they passed out on to the pavement and the commissionaire called a hansom the man looked closely at anna as she crossed the footway and as he held her skirt from the wheel he pressed something into her hand her fingers closed upon it instinctively it was a letter she slipped it calmly into her pocket the commissionaire smiled it was a sovereign easily earned  the hansom drove off suddenly anna felt her hand seized and imprisoned in courtlaws burning fingers she glanced into his face it was enough  i have stood it for a month anna he exclaimed you will not even answer my letters i could not keep away any longer  do you think that it was wise of you or kind to come she asked quietly  wise kind what mockery words are i came because i had to i cannot live without you anna come backyou must come back we can be married tomorrow in paris there you are trying to take your hand away  you disappoint me she said wearily you are talking like a boy what is the use of it i do not wish to marry you i do not wish to return to paris you are doing your best to break our friendship  it is you he cried you who are talking folly when you speak of friendship between you and me it is not the woman who speaks there it is the vapouring school girl i tell you that i love you anna and i believe that you love me you are necessary to me i shall give you my life every moment and thought of my life you must come back see what you have made of me i cannot work i cannot teach you have grown into my life and i cannot tear you out  anna was silent she was trembling a little the mans passion was infectious she had to school herself to speak the words which she knew would cut him like a knife  you are mistaken david i have counted you and always hoped to count you the best of my friends but i do not love you i do not love any one  i dont believe it he answered hoarsely we have come too close together for me to believe it you care for me a little i know i will teach you how to make that little sufficient  you came to tell me this  i came for you he declared fiercely  the hansom sped through the crowded streets anna suddenly leaned forward and looked around her  we are not going the right way she exclaimed  you are coming my way courtlaw answered anna he pleaded be merciful you care for me just a little i know you are alone in the world you have no one save yourself to consider come back with me tonight your old rooms are there if you choose i kept them on myself till the sight of your empty chair and the chill loneliness of it all nearly sent me mad  anna lifted her hand and pushed open the trap door  drive to 13 montague street cabman she ordered  the man pulled up his horse grumbling and turned round courtlaw sat with folded arms he said nothing  my friend she said no let me tell you this nothing would induce me to marry you or any man at present i am a pauper and as yet i have not discovered how to earn money i am determined to fight my own little battle with the worldthere must be a place for me somewhere and i mean to find it afterwards it may be different if i were to marry you now i should feel a dependent being all my lifea sort of parasitical creature without blood or muscle i should lose every scrap of independenceeven my selfrespect however good you were to me and however happy i was in other ways i should find this intolerable  all these things he muttered bitterly this desperate resolve to take your life into your own hands your unnatural craving for independence would never trouble you for a momentif you really cared  then perhaps she answered with a new coldness in her tone perhaps i really do not care no dont interrupt me i think that i am a little disappointed in you you appear to be amongst those strong enough in all ordinary matters but who seem to think it quite natural and proper to give in at once and play the weakling directlyone cares do you think that it makes for happiness to force oneself into the extravagant belief that love is the only thing in the world worth having and to sacrifice for it independence selfrespect ones whole scheme of life i cannot do it david perhaps as you say i do not really carebut i cannot do it  he was strangely silent he did not even reply to her for several minutes  i cannot reason with you he said at last wearily i speak from my heart and you answer from your brain  believe me that i have answered you wisely she said in a gentler tone wisely for you too as well as myself and now you must go back take up your work and think all this over presently you will see that i am right and then you shall take your vacation over here and we will be good comrades again  he smiled bitterly as he handed her from the cab he declined to come in  will you tell sydney that i will see him in the morning he said i am staying at the savoy he can come round there  you will shake hands with me please she begged  he took her fingers and lifted his eyes to hers something he saw there made him feel for a moment ashamed he pressed the long shapely hand warmly in his  goodbye he said earnestly please forgive me you are right quite right  she was able to go straight to her room without delay and she at once locked the door with a little sigh of relief she found herself struggling with a storm of tears  a sob was strangled in her throat she struggled fiercely not to give way  oh i am lonely she moaned i am lonely if i could but                                       to escape from her thoughts she began to undress humming a light tune to herself though her eyes were hot with unshed tears and the sobs kept rising in her throat as she drew off her skirt she felt something in the pocket and remembered the letter which the commissionaire at the carlton had given her she tore open the envelope and read it       my dear girl       i am so sorry if we made asses of ourselves tonight the fact      is i was so glad to see you again that it never occurred to me      that a little discretion might be advisable im afraid im a      terribly clumsy fellow       i hope that you are going to allow me to see something of you      during your stay in london for the sake of old times could you      come to tea at my rooms one afternoon or would you dine with me      somewhere and do a theatre we could have a private room of      course if you do not wish to be seen about london and a box at      the theatre i often think of those delightful evenings in paris      may we not repeat them once at any rate in london                 ever yours                   nigel ennison       ps my address is 94 pall mall  anna read and her cheeks grew slowly scarlet she crushed the letter in her hand  i wonder she murmured to herself if this is the beginning     chapter x  the tragedy of an appetite   anna notwithstanding her quiet clothes a figure marvellously out of accord with her surroundings sat before a small marbletopped table at a crowded abc and munched a roll and butter with hearty appetite  if only i could afford another she thought regretfully i wonder why i am always hungry nowadays it is so ridiculous  she lingered over her tea and glancing around a sudden reflection on the change in her surroundings from the scene of her last nights supper brought a faint humorous smile to her lips  in two days she reflected mrs white will present her bill i have one shilling and sevenpence halfpenny left i have two days in which to earn nearly thirty shillingsthat is with no dinners and get a situation i fancy that this is a little more than playing at bohemianism  so far she continued eyeing hungrily the last morsel of roll which lay upon her plate my only chance of occupation has lain with a photographer who engaged me on the spot and insulted me in half an hour what beasts men are i cannot typewrite my three stories are still wandering round two milliners have refused me as a lay figure because business was so bad i am no use for a clerk because i do not understand shorthand after all i fancy that i shall have to apply for a situation as a nursery governess who understands french faugh  she took up the last morsel of roll and held it delicately between her long slim fingers then her white teeth gleamed and her excuse for remaining any longer before that little marble table was gone she rose paid her bill and turned westwards  she walked with long swinging steps scorning the thought of buses or the tube if ever she felt fatigue in these long tramps which had already taken her half over london she never admitted it asking her way once or twice she passed along fleet street into the strand and crossed trafalgar square into piccadilly here she walked more slowly looking constantly at the notices in the shop windows one she entered and met with a sharp rebuff which she appeared to receive unmoved but when she reached the pavement outside her teeth were clenched and she carried herself unconsciously an inch or so higher it was just then that she came face to face with nigel ennison  he was walking listlessly along welldressed debonnair goodlooking directly he saw anna he accosted her his manner was deferential even eager anna who was disposed to be sharply critical could find no fault with it  how fortunate i am miss pellissier all day i have been hoping that i might run across you you got my note  i certainly received a note anna admitted  you were going to answer it  certainly not she said deliberately  he looked at her with an expression of comical despair  what have i done miss pellissier he pleaded we were good friends in paris werent we you made me all sorts of promises we planned no end of nice things and thenwithout a word to any one you disappeared now we meet again and you will scarcely look at me you seem altogether altered too upon my wordyou are miss pellissier arent you  i certainly am she admitted  he looked at her for a moment in a puzzled sort of way  of course he said you have changed somehowand you certainly are less friendly  she laughed after all his was a pleasant face and a pleasant voice and very likely annabel had behaved badly  perhaps she said it is the london climate it depresses one you know  he nodded  you look more like your old self when you smile he remarked but forgive me you are tired wont you come and have some tea with me there is a new place in bond street he hastened to say where everything is very well done and they give us music if that is any attraction to you  she hesitated and looked for a moment straight into his eyes he certainly bore inspection he was tall and straight and his expression was good  i will comewith pleasure she said if you will promise to treat me as a new acquaintancenot to refer toparisat all  i promise he answered heartily allow me  he took his place by her side and they talked lightly of london the shops and people they found a cosy little table in the tearooms and everything was delicious anna with her marvellous capacity for enjoyment ate cakes and laughed and forgot that she had had tea an hour or so ago at an abc or that she had a care in the world  bythebye he said presently your sister was married to old ferringhall the other day wasnt she i saw the notice in the papers  anna never flinched but after the first shock came a warm glow of relief after all it was what she had been praying forand annabel could not have known her address  my sister and i she said slowly have seen very little of each other lately i fancy that sir john does not approve of me  ennison shrugged his shoulders  sort of man who can see no further than his nose he remarked contemptuously fearful old fogey i cant imagine any sister of yours putting up with him for a moment i thought perhaps you were staying with them as you did not seem particularly anxious to recognize your old friends  anna shook her head  no i am alone she answered  then we must try and make london endurable for you he remarked cheerfully what night will you dine and go to the theatre with meand how about hurlingham on saturday  anna shook her head  thank you she said coolly those things are not for me just at present  he was obviously puzzled anna sighed as she reflected that her sister had simply revelled in her indiscretions  come he said you cant be meaning to bury yourself there must be something we can do what do you say to brighton  anna looked at him quietlyand he never finished his sentence  may i ask whether you are staying with friends in town he inquired deferentially perhaps your engagements are made for you  i am staying she answered coolly at a small boardinghouse near russell square  he dropped his eyeglass with a clatter  at a boardinghouse he gasped  she nodded  yes i am an independent sort of person she continued and i am engaged in an attempt to earn my own living you dont happen to know of any one i suppose who wants a nursery governess or a clerkwithout shorthandor a tryeron or a copyist or  for heavens sake stop miss pellissier he interrupted what a hideous repertoire if you are in earnest about wanting to earn money why on earth dont you accept an engagement here  an engagement she queried  on the stage yes you would not have the slightest difficulty  she laughed softly to herself  do you know she confessed i never thought of that  he looked at her as though doubting even now whether she could possibly be in earnest  i cannot conceive he said how any other occupation could ever have occurred to you you do not need me to remind you of your success at paris the papers are continually wondering what has become of alcide your name alone would fill any music hall in london  again that curious smile which puzzled him so much parted her lips for a moment  dear me she said i fancy you exaggerate my fame i cant imagine londonersparticularly interested in me  he shrugged his shoulders even now he was not at all sure that she was not playing with him there were so many things about her which he could not understand she began to draw on her gloves thoughtfully  i am very much obliged for the tea she said this is a charming place and i have enjoyed the rest  it was a delightful piece of good fortune that i should have met you he answered i hope that whatever your plans may be you will give me the opportunity of seeing something of you now and then  i am afraid she said preceding him down the narrow stairs that i am going to be too busy to have much time for gadding about however i daresay that we shall come across one another before long  that is provokingly indefinite he answered a little ruefully wont you give me your address  she shook her head  it is such a very respectable boardinghouse she said i feel quite sure that mrs white would not approve of callers  i have a clue at any rate he remarked smiling i must try the directory  i wish you good luck she answered there are a good many whites in london  may i put you in a hansom he asked lifting his stick  for heavens sake no she answered quickly do you want to ruin me i shall walk back  i may come a little way then he begged  if you think it worth while she answered doubtfully  apparently he thought it very much worth while restraining with an effort his intense curiosity he talked of general subjects only trying his best to entertain her he succeeded so well that they were almost in montague street before anna stopped short  heavens she exclaimed i have brought you very nearly to my door go back at once please  he held out his hand obediently  ill go he said but i warn you that i shall find you out  for a moment she was grave  well she said i may be leaving where i am in a few days so very likely you will be no better off  he looked at her intently  miss pellissier he said i dont understand this change in you every word you utter puzzles me i have an idea that you are in some sort of trouble wont you let mecant i be of any assistance  he was obviously in earnest his tone was kind and sympathetic  you are very good she said indeed i shall not forget your offer but just now there is nothing which you or anybody can do goodbye  he was dismissed and he understood it anna crossed the street and letting herself in at no 13 with a latchkey went humming lightly up to her room she was in excellent spirits and it was not until she had taken off her hat and was considering the question of dinner or no dinner that she remembered that another day had passed and she was not a whit nearer being able to pay her tomorrows bill     chapter xi  the puzzlement of nigel ennison   nigel ennison walked towards his club the most puzzled man in london there could not he decided possibly be two girls so much alike besides she had admitted her identity and yethe thought of the supper party where he had met annabel pellissier the stories about her his own few minutes whispered lovemaking he was a selfcontained young man but his cheeks grew hot at the thought of the things which it had seemed quite natural to say to her then but which he knew very well would have been instantly resented by the girl whom he had just left he went over her features one by one in his mind they were the same he could not doubt it there was the same airy grace of movement the same deep brown hair and alabaster skin he found himself thinking up all the psychology which he had ever read was this the result of some strange experiment it was the person of annabel pellissierthe soul of a very different order of being  he spent the remainder of the afternoon looking for a friend whom he found at last in the billiard room of one of the smaller clubs to which he belonged after the usual laconic greetings he drew him on one side  fred he said do you remember taking me to dinner at the ambassadors one evening last september to meet a girl who was singing there hamilton and drummond and his lot were with us  of course his friend answered la belle alcide wasnt it annabel pellissier was her real name jolly nice girl too  ennison nodded  i thought i saw her in town today he said do you happen to know whether she is supposed to be here  very likely indeed captain fred meddoes answered lighting a cigarette i heard that she had chucked her show at the french places and gone in for a reform all round sisters got married to that bounder ferringhall  ennison took an easy chair  what a little brick he murmured she must have character its no half reform either what do you know about her fred i am interested  meddoes turned round from the table on which he was practising shots and shrugged his shoulders  not much he answered and yet about all there is to be known i fancy there were two sisters you know old jersey and hampshire family the pellissiers and a capital stock too i believe  any one could see that the girls were ladies ennison murmured  no doubt about that meddoes continued the father was in the army and got a halfpay job at st heliers died short i suppose and the girls had to shift for themselves one went in for painting kept straight and married old ferringhall a week or so agothe lord help her the other kicked over the traces a bit made rather a hit with her singing at some of those french places and went the pace in a mild ladylike sort of way cheveney was looking after her i think then if shes over he probably knows all about it  ennison looked steadily at the cigarette which he was tapping on his forefinger  so cheveney was her friend you think eh he remarked  no doubt about that i fancy meddoes answered lightly he ran some austrian fellow off she was quite the rage in a small way you know strange demurelooking young woman with wonderful complexion and eyes and a style about her too care for a hundred up  ennison shook his head  cant stop thanks he answered see you tonight i suppose  he sauntered off  im damned if ill believe it he muttered to himself savagely  but for the next few days he avoided cheveney like the plague                                       the same night he met meddoes and drummond together the latter over from paris on a weeks leave from the embassy  odd thing meddoes remarked we were just talking about the pellissier girl drummond was telling me about the way old ferringhall rounded upon them all at the club  sounds interesting ennison remarked may i hear  it really isnt much to tell drummond answered you know what a fearful old prig ferringhall is always goes about as though the whole world were watching him we tried to show him around paris but he wouldnt have any of it talked about his years his position and his constituents and always sneaked off back to his hotel just when the fun was going to begin well one night some of us saw him or thought we saw him at a café dining with alcideas a matter of fact it seems that it was her sister he came into the club next day and of course we went for him thick jove he didnt take to it kindly i can tell you stood on his dignity and shut us up in great style it seems that he was a sort of family friend of the pellissiers and it was the artist sister whom he was with the joke of it is that hes married to her now and cuts me dead  i suppose ennison said the likeness between the sisters must be rather exceptional  i never saw the goodygoody one close to so i cant say drummond answered certainly i was a little way off at the café and she had a hat and veil on but i could have sworn that it was alcide  is alcide still in paris ennison asked  dont think so drummond answered i heard the other day that shed been taken in by some cad of a fellow who was cutting a great dash in paris personating meysey hill the great railway man anyhow shes disappeared for some reason or other perhaps ferringhall has pensioned her off hes the sort of johnny who wouldnt care about having a sisterinlaw on the loose  ennison here thought he saw her in london meddoes remarked  drummond nodded  very likely the two sisters were very fond of one another i believe perhaps sir john is going to take the other one under his wing whos for a rubber of whist  ennison made so many mistakes that he was glad to cut out early in the evening he walked across the park and called upon his sister  is lady lescelles in he asked the butler  her ladyship dined at home the man answered i have just ordered a carriage for her i believe that her ladyship is going to carey house and on to the marquis of waterfords ball he added hastily consulting a diary on the hall table  a tall elegantly dressed woman followed by a maid came down the broad staircase  is that you nigel she asked i hope you are going to carey house  he shook his head and threw open the door of a great dimlylit apartment on the ground floor  come in here a moment will you blanche he said i want to speak to you  she assented smiling he was her only brother and she his favourite sister he closed the door  i want to ask you a question he said a serious question  she stopped buttoning her glove and looked at him  well  you and all the rest of them are always lamenting that i do not marry supposing i made up my mind to marry some one of good enough family but who was in a somewhat doubtful position concerning whose antecedents in fact there was a certain amount of scandal would you stand by meand her  my dear nigel she exclaimed are you serious  you know very well that i should never joke on such a subject mind i am anticipating events nothing is settled upon it may be it probably will all come to nothing but i want to know whether in such an event you would stand by me  she held out her hand  you can count upon me nigel she said but for you dad would never have let me marry lescelles he was only a younger son and you know what trouble we had i am with you through thick and thin nigel  he kissed her and handed her into the carriage then he went back to his rooms and lit a cigar  there are two things to be done he said softly to himself the first is to discover what she is here for and where she is staying the second is to somehow meet lady ferringhall these fellows must be right he added thoughtfully and yettheres a mystery somewhere     chapter xii  the poster of alcide   on saturday mornings there was deposited on the plate of each guest at breakfast time a long folded paper with mrs whites compliments anna thrust hers into her pocket unopened and for the first time left the house without a smile upon her face she was practically destitute of jewellery the few pence left in her purse would only provide a very scanty lunch another day of nonsuccess would mean many disagreeable things  and even she was forced to admit to herself that this last resource of hers was a slender reed on which to lean she mounted the stairs of the theatrical agents office with very much less than her usual buoyancy nor did she find much encouragement in the general appearance of the room into which she was shown there was already a score or more of people there some standing up and talking together others seated in chairs ranged along the wall beyond was another door on which was painted in black letters                 mr earles                strictly private  every one stared at anna anna stared back at every one with undaunted composure a young man with shiny frock coat and very high collar advanced towards her languidly  want to see mr earles he inquired  i do anna answered here is my card will you take it in to him  the young man smiled in a superior manner  have to take your turn he remarked laconically theres twenty before you and mr earles is going out at twelve sharpimportant engagement better come another morning  thank you anna answered i will take my chance  she removed some posters from a chair and seated herself coolly the young man looked at her  unless you have an appointment which you havent he said youll only waste your time here  i can spare it anna answered suavely  the young man entered into a lively little war of words with a yellowhaired young person near the door anna picked up an ancient magazine and began to turn over the pages in a leisurely way the conversation which her entrance had interrupted began to buzz again all around her a quarter of an hour passed then the inner door opened abruptly a tall cleanshaven man came out and walked rapidly through the room exchanging greetings right and left but evidently anxious to avoid being detained mr earles himself stood upon the threshold of his sanctum the prototype of the smart natty jew with black hair waxed moustache and a wired flower in his buttonhole a floridlooking young woman rose up and accosted him eagerly  im next mr earles she exclaimed been sitting on the doorstep almost for two hours  in a minute in a minute he answered his eyes fixed upon anna reuben come here  the young man obeyed the summons his employer retreated into the further apartment leaving the door ajar  whats that young ladys namegirl in dark brown stranger here mr earles asked sharply  the youth produced a crumpledup card from his waistcoat pocket a sense of impending disaster was upon him mr earles glanced at it and his eyes flashed with anger  you blithering idiot he exclaimed  mr earles strode into the waitingroom his face was wreathed in smiles his beringed hand was cordially outstretched  my dear miss pellissier he said impressively this is an unexpected pleasure come in come in do i must apologize for my young puppy of a clerk if i had known that you were here you should not have been kept waiting for a second  it took a good deal to surprise anna but it was all she could do to follow mr earles with composure into the inner room there was a little murmur of consternation from the waiting crowd and the florid young woman showed signs of temper to which mr earles was absolutely indifferent he installed anna in a comfortable easy chair and placed his own between her and the door  come he said this is capital capital it was only a few months ago that i told you you must come to london and you only laughed at me yet here you are and at precisely the right moment too bythebye he added in a suddenly altered tone i hope i trustthat you have not entered into any arrangements with any one here  ioh no anna said a little faintly i have made no arrangements as yetnone at all  mr earles recovered his spirits  excellent he exclaimed your arrival is really most opportune the halls are on the lookout for something new bythebye do you recognize that  anna looked and gasped an enormous poster almost covered one side of the wallthe poster the figure of the girl upon it in plain black dress standing with her hands behind her was an undeniable and astonishing likeness of herself it was her figure her style of dress her manner of arranging the hair mr earles regarded it approvingly  a wonderful piece of work he declared a most wonderful likeness too i hope in a few days miss pellissier that these posters will be livening up our london hoardings  anna leaned back in the chair and laughed softly even this man had accepted her for alcide without a moments question then all the embarrassments of the matter flashed in upon her she was suddenly grave  i suppose mr earles she said that if i were to tell you that although that poster was designed from a rough study of me and although my name is pellissier that nevertheless i am not alcide would you believe me  you can try it on if you like mr earles remarked genially my only answer would be to ask you to look at that mirror and then at the poster the poster is of alcide its a duplicate of the french one  anna got up and looked at the mirror and then at the poster the likeness was ridiculous  well she said sitting down again i want an engagement  capital mr earles declared any choice as to which of the halls you can pick and choose you know i recommend the unusual  i have no choice anna declared  i can get you mr earles said slowly keeping his eyes fixed upon her forty at the unusual two turns encores voluntary six for matinées we should not bar any engagements at private houses but in other respects the arrangement must be exclusive  forty what anna asked bewildered  guineas of course mr earles answered glibly forty guineas a week i mentioned sixty i believe when i was in paris but there are expenses and just now business is bad  anna was speechless but she had presence of mind enough to sit still until she had recovered herself mr earles watched her anxiously she appeared to be considering  of course he ventured i could try for more at the alhambra very likely they would give  i should be satisfied with the sum you mention anna said quietly but there are difficulties  dont use such a word my dear young lady mr earles said persuasively difficulties indeed well make short work of them  i hope that you may anna answered enigmatically in the first place i have no objection to the posters as they have no name on them but i do not wish to appear at all upon the stage as alcide if you engage me it must be upon my own merits you are taking it for granted that i am alcide as a matter of fact i am not  excuse me mr earles said but this is rubbish  call it what you like anna answered i can sing the songs alcide sang and in the same style but i will not be engaged as alcide or advertised under that name  mr earles scratched his chin for a moment thoughtfully then a light seemed to break in upon him he slapped his knee  by jove he exclaimed of course i remember now it was your sister who married sir john ferringhall the other day wasnt it  anna nodded  it was she admitted  you neednt say a word more mr earles declared i see the difficulty the old fools been working on you through your sister to keep off the stage hes a prig to the fingertips is sir johndoesnt know what an artist is its awkward but well get round it somehow now ill tell you what i propose let me run you for six months ill give you say thirtyfive guineas a week clear of expenses and half of anything you earn above the two turns a night what do you say  i agree anna said coldly if you will make it three months  better say six mr earles protested seating himself before the desk and dipping his pen in the ink  four anna decided firmly i shall not agree to six  it scarcely gives me a chance mr earles said with a resigned sigh but i shall rely upon you to stick to me so long as i do the right thing by you you cant do without an agent and theres no one can run you better than i can  you must also put in the agreement anna said that i do not represent myself to be alcide and that i am not advertised to the public by that name  mr earles threw down his pen with a little exclamation  come this way he said  he opened the door of still another room in one corner of which was a grand piano he seated himself before it  go to the far corner he said and sing the last verse of les petites  he struck a note and anna responded playing with one hand he turned on his stool to glance at her instinctively she had fallen into the posture of the poster her hands behind her her head bent slightly forward her chin uplifted her eyes bright with the drollery of the song mr earles closed the piano with a little bang  you are a funny a very funny young lady he said but we waste time here you do not need my compliments we will get on with the agreement and you shall have in it whatever rubbish you like  anna laughed and went back to her easy chair she knew that her voice was superior to annabels and she had no further qualms whilst she was wondering how to frame her request for an advance mr earles drew out his cheque book  you will not object he said glancing towards her to accepting a deposit it is customary even where an agreement is drawn  i shall have no objection at all anna assured him  he handed her a cheque for thirtyone pounds ten shillings and read the agreement through to her anna took up the pen and signed after a moments hesitation                 a pellissier  i will send you a copy mr earles said rubbing his hands together by post now will you do me the honour of lunching with me miss pellissier  anna hesitated  perhaps he queried you wish to avoid being seen about with any oneerconnected with the profession under present circumstances if so do not hesitate to tell me be frank i beg you miss pellissier i am already too much flattered that you should have given me your confidence  you are very good mr earles anna said i think perhaps if you will excuse me that we will defer the luncheon  just as you wish mr earles declared goodhumouredly but i shall not let you go without drinking a glass of wine to our success  he plunged into one of his drawers and brought up a small goldfoiled bottle the cork came out with a loud pop and anna could not help wondering how it must sound to the patient little crowd outside she drank her glass of wine however and clanked glasses goodnaturedly with mr earles  you must leave me your address if you please he said as she rose to go  she wrote it down he looked at it with uplifted eyebrows but made no remark  i shall probably want you to come down to the unusual tomorrow morning he said bring any new songs you may have  anna nodded and mr earles attended her obsequiously to the door she descended the stairs and found herself at last in the streetalone it was a brief solitude however a young man who had been spending the last hour walking up and down on the opposite side of the way came quickly over to her she looked up and recognized mr brendon     chapter xiii  he will not forget   the external changes in brendon following on his alteration of fortune were sufficiently noticeable from head to foot he was attired in the fashionable garb of the young man of the moment not only that but he carried himself erectthe slight slouch which had bent his shoulders had altogether disappeared he came to her at once and turning walked by her side  now i should like to know she said looking at him with a quiet smile what you are doing here it is not a particularly inspiring neighbourhood for walking about by yourself  i plead guilty miss pellissier he answered at once i saw you go into that place and i have been waiting for you ever since  i am not sure whether i feel inclined to scold or thank you she declared i think as i feel in a good humour it must be the latter  he faced her doggedly  miss pellissier he said i am going to take a liberty  you alarm me she murmured smiling  dont think that i have been playing the spy upon you he continued neither sydney nor i would think of such a thing but we cant help noticing you have been going out every morning and coming home latetired outtoo tired to come down to dinner forgive me but you have been looking have you not for some employment  quite true she answered i have found out at last what a useless person i amfrom a utilitarian point of view it has been very humiliating  and that i suppose he said waving his stick towards mr earles office was your last resource  it certainly was she admitted i changed my last shilling yesterday  he was silent for a moment or two his lips were tight drawn his eyes flashed as he turned towards her  do you think that it is kind of you miss pellissier he said almost roughly to ignore your friends so in your heart you know quite well that you could pay sydney or me no greater compliment than to give us just a little of your confidence we know london and you are a stranger here surely our advice would have been worth having at any rate you might have spared yourself many useless journeys and disappointments and us a good deal of anxiety instead you are willing to go to a place like that where you ought not to be allowed to think of showing yourself  why not she asked quietly  the very question shows your ignorance he declared you know nothing about the stage you havent an idea what the sort of employment you could get there would be like the sort of people you would be mixed up with it is positively hateful to think of it  she laid her fingers for a moment upon his arm  mr brendon she said if i could ask for advice or borrow money from any one i would from youthere but i cannot i never could i suppose i ought to have been a man you see i have had to look after myself so long that i have developed a terrible bump of independence  such independence he answered quickly is a vice you see to what it has brought you you are going to accept a post as chorus girl or super or something of that sort  you do not flatter me she laughed  i am too much in earnest he answered to be able to take this matter lightly  i am rebuked she declared i suppose my levity is incorrigible but seriously things are not so bad as you think  he groaned  they never seem so at first he said  you do not quite understand she said gently i will tell you the truth it is true that i have accepted an engagement from mr earles but it is a good one i am not going to be a chorus girl or even a super i have never told you so or sydney but i can singrather well when my father died and we were left alone in jersey i was quite a long time deciding whether i would go in for singing professionally or try painting i made a wrong choice it seemsbut my voice remains  you are really going on the stage then he said slowly  in a senseyes  brendon went very pale  miss pellissier he said dont  why not she asked smiling i must live you know  i havent told any one the amount he went on it sounds too ridiculous but i have two hundred thousand pounds will you marry me  anna looked at him in blank amazement then she burst into a peal of laughter  my dear boy she exclaimed how ridiculous fancy you with all that money for heavens sake though do not go about playing the don quixote like this it doesnt matter with me but there are at least a dozen young women in mr earles waitingroom who would march you straight off to a registrars office  you have not answered my question he reminded her  nor am i going to she answered smiling i am going to ignore it it was really very nice of you but tomorrow you will laugh at it as i do now  is it necessary he said for me to tell you  stop please she said firmly  brendon was silent  do not force me to take you seriously she continued i like to think of your offer it was impulsive and natural now let us forget it  i understand he said doggedly  and you must please not look at me as though i were an executioner she declared lightly i will tell you something if you like one of the reasons why i left paris and came to london was because there was a man there who wanted me to marry him i really cared for him a little but i am absolutely determined not to marry for some time at any rate i do not want to get only a secondhand flavour of life one can learn and understand only by personal experience by actual contact with the realities of life i did not want anything made smooth and easy for me that is why i would not marry this man whom i did and whom i do care for a little later onwell then the time may come then perhaps i shall send for him if he has not forgotten  i do not know who he is brendon said quietly but he will not forget  anna shrugged her shoulders lightly  who can tell she said your sex is a terrible fraud it is generally deficient in the qualities it prides itself upon most men do not understand constancy as women do  brendon was not inclined to be led away from the point  we will take it then he said that you have refused or ignored one request i have made you this morning i have yet another let me lend you some money between comrades it is the most usual thing in the world and i do not see how your sex intervenes let me keep you from that mans clutches then we can look out together for such employmentas would be more suitable for you i know london better than you and i have had to earn my own living you cannot refuse me this  he looked at her anxiously and she met his glance with a dazzling smile of gratitude  indeed she said i would not but it is no longer necessary i cannot tell you much about it but my bad times are over for the present i will tell you what you shall give me if you like  well  lunch i am hungrytragically hungry  he called for a hansom  after all he said i am not sure that you are not a very material person  i am convinced of it she answered let us go to that little place at the back of the palace im not half smart enough for the west end  wherever you like he answered a little absently  they alighted at the restaurant and stood for a moment in the passage looking into the crowded room suddenly a half stifled exclamation broke from annas lips brendon felt his arm seized in a moment they were in the street outside anna jumped into a waiting hansom  tell him to driveanywhere she exclaimed  brendon told him the name of a distant restaurant and sprang in by her side she was looking anxiously at the entrance to the restaurant the commissionaire stood there tall and imperturbable there was no one else in the doorway she leaned back in the corner of the cab with a little sigh of relief a smile flickered upon her lips as she glanced towards brendon who was very serious indeed her sense of humour could not wholly resist his abnormal gravity  i am so sorry to have startled you she said but i was startled myself i saw someone in there whom i have always hoped that i should never meet again i hopei am sure that he did not see me  he certainly did not follow you out brendon answered  his back was towards me anna said i saw his face in a mirror i wonder  london is a huge place brendon said even if he lives here you may go all your life and never come face to face with him again     chapter xiv  this is my wife   anna notwithstanding her momentary fright in the middle of the day was in high spirits she felt that for a time at any rate her depressing struggle against continual failure was at an end she had paid her bill and she had enough left in her purse to pay many such beyond that everything was nebulous she knew that in her new rôle she was as likely as not to be a rank failure but the relief from the strain of her immediate necessities was immense she had been in the drawingroom for a few minutes before the gong had sounded and had chattered gaily to every one now in her old place she was doing her best thoroughly to enjoy a most indifferent dinner  your brother has gone she asked sydney between the courses  he nodded  yes david left this afternoon i do not think that he has quite got over his surprise at finding you established here  she laughed  after all why should he be surprised she remarked of course one lives differently in paris but thenparis is paris i think that a boardinghouse is the very best place for a woman who wants to develop her sense of humour only i wish that it did not remind one so much of a secondhand clothes shop  sydney looked at her doubtfully  now i suppose brendon understands exactly what you mean he remarked he looks as though he did at any rate i dont please enlighten me  she laughed gailyand she had a way when she laughed of throwing back her head and showing her beautiful white teeth so that mirth from her was a thing very much to be desired  look round the table she said arent we all just odds and ends of humanitythe leftovers you know there is something inconglomerate about us we are amiable to one another but we dont mix we cant  you and i and brendon get on all right dont we sydney objected  but thats quite different replied anna you are neither of you in the least like the ordinary boardinghouse young man you dont wear a dinner coat with a flower in your buttonhole or last nights shirt or very glossy boots nor do you haunt the drawingroom in the evening or play at being musical besides  she stopped short she herself and one other there recognized the interposition of something akin to tragedy a thicklyset sandy young man with an unwholesome complexion and greasesmooth hair had entered the room he wore a black tail coat buttoned tightly over his chest and a large diamond pin sparkled in a white satin tie which had seen better days he bowed awkwardly to mrs white who held out her hand and beamed a welcome upon him  now isnt this nice that lady exclaimed im sure were all delighted to see you again mr hill i do like to see old friends back here if theres any one here whom you have not met i will make you acquainted with them after dinner will you take your old place by miss ellicot  miss ellicot swept aside her skirts from the vacant chair and welcomed the newcomer with one of her most engaging smiles  we were afraid that you had deserted us for good mr hill she said graciously i suppose paris is very very distracting you must come and tell me all about it although i am not sure whether we shall forgive you for not having written to any of us  mr hill was exchanging greetings with his hostess and salutations around the table  thank you maam glad to get back im sure he said briskly looks like old times here i see sorry im a bit late the first evening got detained in the city and  then he met the fixed breathless gaze of those wonderful eyes from the other side of the table and he too broke off in the middle of his sentence he breathed heavily as though he had been running his large coarse lips drew wider apart slowly a mirthless and very unpleasant smile dawned upon his face  great scott he exclaimed huskily whyitsits you  amazement seemed to dry up the torrents of his speech the girl regarded him with the face of a sphinx only in her eyes there seemed to be some apprehension of the fact that the young mans clothes and manners were alike undesirable things  are you speaking to me she asked calmly i am afraid that you are making a mistake i am quite sure that i do not know you  a dull flush burned upon his cheeks he took his seat at the table but leaned forward to address her a note of belligerency had crept into his tone  dont know me eh i like that you areor rather you were he corrected himself with an unpleasant little laugh miss pellissier eh  a little sensation followed upon his words miss ellicot pursed her lips and sat a little more upright the lady whose husband had been mayor of hartlepool looked at anna and sniffed mrs white became conscious of a distinct sense of uneasiness and showed it in her face she was obliged as she explained continually to every one who cared to listen to be so very particular on the other hand the two young men who sat on either side of anna were already throwing murderous glances at the newcomer  my name anna replied calmly is certainly pellissier but i repeat that i do not know you i never have known you  he unfolded his serviette with fingers which shook all the time his eyes never left her face an ugly flush stained his cheeks  ive plenty of pals he said who when theyve been doing paris on the qt like to forget all about iteven their names but you  something seemed to catch his breath he never finished his sentence there was a moments breathless and disappointed silence if only he had known it sympathy was almost entirely with him anna was no favourite at no 13 montague street  she shrugged her shoulders  you appear she said without any sign of anger in her tone and with unruffled composure to be a very impertinent person do you mind talking to some one else  mrs white leaned forward in her chair with an anxious smile designed to throw oil upon the troubled waters  come she said we mustnt have any unpleasantness and mr hills first night back amongst us too no doubt theres some little mistake we all get deceived sometimes mr hill i hope you wont find everything cold youre a little late you must remember and we are punctual people here  i shall do very well thank you maam he answered shortly  sydney and brendon vied with one another in their efforts to engage anna in conversation and miss ellicot during the momentary lull deemed it a favourable opportunity to recommence siege operations the young man was mollified by her sympathy and flattered by the obvious attempts of several of the other guests to draw him into conversation yet every now and then during the progress of the meal his attention apparently wandered and leaning forward he glanced covertly at anna with a curious mixture of expressions on his face  anna rose a few minutes before the general company at the same time sydney and brendon also vacated their places to reach the door they had to pass the end of the table and behind the chair where mr hill was seated he rose deliberately to his feet and confronted them  i should like to speak to you for a few minutes he said to anna dropping his voice a little it is no good playing a game we had better have it over  she eyed him scornfully in any place her beauty would have been an uncommon thing here where every element of her surroundings was tawdry and commonplace and before this young man of vulgar origin and appearance it was striking  i do not know you she said coldly i have nothing to say to you  he stood before the door brendon made a quick movement forward she laid her hand upon his arm  please dont she said it really is not necessary be so good as to let me pass sir she added looking her obstructor steadily in the face  he hesitated  this is all rot he declared angrily you cant think that im fool enough to be put off like this  she glanced at brendon who stood by her side tall and threatening her eyebrows were lifted in expostulation a faint delightfully humorous smile parted her lips  after all she said if this person will not be reasonable i am afraid  it was enough a hand of iron fell upon the scowling young mans shoulder  be so good as to stand away from that door at once sir brendon ordered  hill lost a little of his truculency he knew very well that his muscles were flabby and his nerve by no means what it should be he was no match for brendon he yielded his place and struck instead with his tongue he turned to mrs white  im sorry maam to seem the cause of any disturbance but this he pointed to anna is my wife  the sensation produced was gratifying enough the mans statement was explicit and spoken with confidence every one looked at anna for a moment she too had started and faltered in her exit from the room her fingers clutched the side of the door as though to steady herself she caught her breath and her eyes were lit with a sudden terror she recovered herself however with amazing facility scarcely any one noticed the full measure of her consternation from the threshold she looked her accuser steadily and coldly in the face  what you have said is a ridiculous falsehood she declared scornfully i do not even know who you are  she swept out of the room hill would have followed her but mrs white and miss ellicot laid each a hand upon his arm one on either side the echoes of his hard unpleasant laugh reached anna on her way upstairs                                       it was a queer little bedsittingroom almost in the roof with a partition right across it as usual brendon lit the candles and sydney dragged out the spiritlamp and set it going anna opened a cupboard and produced cups and saucers and a tin of coffee  only four spoonsful left she declared briskly and your turn to buy the next pound sydney  right he answered ill bring it tomorrow fresh ground no chicory and all the rest of it butmiss pellissier  well  are you quite sure that you want us this evening wouldnt you rather be alone just say the word and well clear out like a shot  she laughed softly  you are afraid she said that the young man who thinks that he is my husband has upset me  madman  blithering ass  the girl looked into the two indignant faces and held out both her hands  youre very nice both of you she said gently but im afraid you are going to be in a hopeless minority here as regards me  they eyed her incredulously  you cant imagine sydney exclaimed that the people downstairs will be such drivelling asses as to believe piffle like that  anna measured out the coffee her eyes were lit with a gleam of humour after all it was really rather funny  well i dont know she said thoughtfully i always notice that people find it very easy to believe what they want to believe and you see im not in the least popular miss ellicot for instance considers me a most improper person  miss ellicot that old cat sydney exclaimed indignantly  miss ellicot brendon echoed as if it could possibly matter what such a person thinks of you  anna laughed outright  you are positively eloquent tonightboth of you she declared but you see appearances are very much against me he knew my name and also that i had been living in paris and a man doesnt risk claiming a girl for his wife as a rule for nothing he was painfully in earnest too i think you will find that his story will be believed whatever i say and in any case if he is going to stay on here i shall have to go away  dont say that sydney begged we will see that he never annoys you  anna shook her head  he is evidently a friend of mrs whites she said and if he is going to persist in this delusion we cannot both remain here id rather not go she added this is much the cheapest place i know of where things are moderately clean and i should hate rooms all by myself dear me what a nuisance it is to have a pseudo husband shot down upon one from the skies  and such a beast of a one sydney remarked vigorously  brendon looked across the room at her thoughtfully  i wonder he said is there anything we could do to help you to get rid of him  can you think of anything anna answered i cant he appears to be a most immovable person  brendon hesitated for a moment he was a little embarrassed  there ought to be some means of getting at him he said the fellow seems to know your name miss pellissier and that you have lived in paris might we ask you if you have ever seen him if you knew him at all before this evening  she stood up suddenly and turning her back to them looked steadily out of the window below was an uninspiring street a thoroughfare of boardinghouses and apartments the steps even the pavements were invaded by little knots of loungers driven outside by the unusual heat of the evening most of them in evening dress or what passed for evening dress in montague street the sound of their strident voices floated upwards the high nasal note of the predominant americans the shrill laughter of girls quick to appreciate the wit of such of their male companions as thought it worth while to be amusing a young man was playing the banjo in the distance a barrelorgan was grinding out a pot pourri of popular airs anna raised her eyes above the housetops it was different she drew a long breath after all why need one look down always the other things remained  i think she said that i would rather not have anything to say about that man  it isnt necessary they both declared breathlessly  brendon dismissed the subject with a wave of the hand he glanced at his watch  let us walk round to covent garden he suggested i daresay the gallery will be full but there is always the chance and i know you two are keen on melba  the girl shook her head  not tonight she said i have to go out  they hesitated as a rule their comings and goings were discussed with perfect confidence but on this occasion they both felt that there was intent in her silence as to her destination nevertheless sydney clumsily but earnestly had something to say about it  i am afraidi really think that one of us ought to go with you he said that beast of a fellow is certain to be hanging about  she shook her head  it is a secret mission she declared there are policemenand buses  you shall not need either brendon said grimly we will see that he doesnt follow you  she thanked him with a look and rose to her feet  go down and rescue the rags of my reputation she said smiling i expect it is pretty well in shreds by now tomorrow morning i shall have made up my mind what to do     chapter xv  a marriage certificate   anna looked about her admiringly it was just such a bedroom as she would have chosen for herself the colouring was green and white with softly shaded electric lights an alcove bedstead which was a miracle of daintiness white furniture and a long low dressingtable littered all over with a multitude of daintily fashioned toilet appliances through an open door was a glimpse of the bathrooma vision of luxury out of which annabel herself in a wonderful dressinggown and followed by a maid presently appeared  too bad to keep you waiting annabel exclaimed im really very sorry collins you can go now i will ring if i want you  the maid discreetly withdrew and anna stood transfixed gazing with puzzled frown at her sister  annabel why what on earth have you been doing to yourself child she exclaimed  annabel laughed a little uneasily  the very question my dear sister she said tells me that i have succeeded dear me what a difference it has made no one would ever think that we were sisters dont you think that the shade of my hair is lovely  there is nothing particular the matter with the shade anna answered but it is not nearly so becoming as before you touched it and what on earth do you want to darken your eyebrows and use so much makeup for at your age youre exactly twentythree and youre got up as much as a woman of fortyfive  annabel shrugged her shoulders  i only use the weeniest little dab of rouge she declared and it is really necessary because i want to get rid of the pallor effect  anna made no remark her disapproval was obvious enough annabel saw it and suddenly changed her tone  you are very stupid anna she said can you not understand it is of no use your taking my identity and all the burden of my iniquities upon your dear shoulders if i am to be recognized the moment i show my face in london that is why i have dyed my hair that is why i have abandoned my rôle of ingenuèe and altered my whole style of dress upon my word anna she declared with a strange little laugh you are a thousand times more like me as i was two months ago than i am myself  a sudden sense of the gravity of this thing came home to anna her sisters words were true they had changed identities absolutely it was not for a week or a month it was for ever a cold shiver came over her that last year in paris when annabel and she had lived in different worlds had often been a nightmare to her annabel had taken her life into her hands with gay insouciance had made her own friends gone her own way anna never knew whither it had led hersometimes she had fears it was her past now not annabels  it is very good of you to come and see me my dear sister annabel remarked throwing herself into a low chair and clasping her hands over her head to tell you the truth i am a little dull  where is your husband anna asked  he is addressing a meeting of his constituents somewhere annabel answered i do not suppose he will be home till late tell me how are you amusing yourself  anna laughed  i have been amusing myself up to now by trying to earn my living she replied  i hope annabel answered lazily that you have succeeded bythebye do you want any money sir johns ideas of pin money are not exactly princely but i can manage what you want i dare say  thank you anna answered coldly i am not in need of any i might add that in any case i should not touch sir johns  thats rather a pity annabel said he wants to settle something on you i believe it is really amusing he lives in constant dread of a reappearance of la belle alcide and hearing it said that she is his wifes sister bit priggish isnt it and if he only knew itso absurd tell me how you are earning your living here annatypewriting or painting or ladys companion  i think anna said that the less you know about me the better is all your house on the same scale of magnificence as this annabel she asked looking round  annabel shook her head  most of it is ugly and frowsy she declared but it isnt worth talking about i have made up my mind to insist upon moving from here into park lane or one of the squares it is absolutely a frightful neighbourhood this if only you could see the people who have been to call on me sir john has the most absurd ideas too he wont have menservants inside the house and his collection of carriages is only fit for a museumwhere most of his friends ought to be bythebye i can assure you anna it will take me years to get decently established the mans as obstinate as a mule  anna looked at her steadily  he will find it difficult no doubt to alter his style of living she said i do not blame him i hope you will always remember  annabel held out her hands with a little cry of protest  no lecturing anna she exclaimed i hope you have not come for that  i came anna answered looking her sister steadily in the face to hear all that you can tell me about a man named hill  annabel had been lying curled up on the lounge the personification of graceful animal ease at annas words she seemed suddenly to stiffen her softly intertwined fingers became rigid the little spot of rouge was vivid enough now by reason of this new pallor which seemed to draw the colour even from her lips but she did not speak she made no attempt to answer her sisters question anna looked at her curiously and with sinking heart  you must answer me annabel she continued you must tell me the truth please it is necessary  annabel rose slowly to her feet walked to the door as though to see that it was shut and came back with slow lagging footsteps  there was a man called montague hill she said hoarsely but he is dead  then there is also anna remarked a montague hill who is very much alive not only that but he is here in london i have just come from him  annabel no longer attempted to conceal her emotion she battled with a deadly faintness and she tottered rather than walked back to her seat anna quitting her chair dropped on her knees by her sisters side and took her hand  do not be frightened dear she said you must tell me the truth and i will see that no harm comes to you  the only montague hill i ever knew annabel said slowly is dead i know he is dead i saw him lying on the footway i felt his heart it had ceased to beat it was a motor accidenta fatal motor accident the evening papers called it they could not have called it a fatal motor accident if he had not been dead  anna nodded  yes i remember she said it was the night you left paris they thought that he was dead at first and they took him to the hospital i believe that his recovery was considered almost miraculous  alive annabel moaned her eyes large with terror you say that he is alive  he is certainly alive anna declared more than that he arrived today at the boardinghouse where i am staying greeted me with a theatrical start and claimed meas his wife that is why i am here you must tell me what it all means  and you annabel exclaimed what did you say  well i considered myself justified in denying it anna answered drily he produced what he called a marriage certificate and i believe that nearly every one in the boardinghouse including mrs white my landlady believes his story i am fairly well hardened in iniquityyour iniquity annabelbut i decline to have a husband thrust upon me i really cannot have anything to do with mr montague hill  amarriage certificate annabel gasped  anna glanced into her sisters face and rose to her feet  let me get you some water annabel dont be frightened dear remember  annabel clutched her sisters arm she would not let her move she seemed smitten with a paroxysm of fear  a thickset coarselooking young man anna she exclaimed in a hoarse excited whisper he has a stubbly yellow moustache weak eyes and great horrid hands  anna nodded  it is the same man annabel she said there is no doubt whatever about that there was the motor accident too it is the same man for he raved in the hospital and they fetched me it was you of course whom he wanted  alive in london annabel moaned  yes pull yourself together annabel i must have the truth  the girl on the lounge drew a long sobbing breath  you shall she said listen there was a meysey hill in paris an american railway millionaire this man and he were alike and about the same age montague hill was taken for the millionaire once or twice and i suppose it flattered his vanity at any rate he began to deliberately personate him he sent me flowers celeste introduced him to meoh how celeste hated me she must have known hewanted to marry me just theni was nervous i had gone further than i meant towith some englishmen i was afraid of being talked about you dont know anna but when one is in danger one realizes that thethe other side of the line is hell the man was mad to marry me i heard everywhere of his enormous riches and his generosity i consented we went to the embassy there wasa service then he took me out to monteaux on a motor we were to have breakfast there and return in the evening on the way he confessed he was a london man of business spending a small legacy in paris he had heard me singthe fool thought himself in love with me celeste he knew she was chaffing him about being taken for meysey hill and suggested that he should be presented to me as the millionaire he told me with a coarse nervous laugh i was his wife we were to live in some wretched london suburb his salary was a few paltry hundreds a year anna i listened to all that he had to say and i called to him to let me get out he laughed i tried to jump but he increased the speed we were going at a mad pace i struck him across the mouth and across the eyes he lost control of the machine i jumped theni was not even shaken i saw the motor dashed to pieces against the wall and i saw him pitched on his head into the road i leaned over and looked at himhe was quite still i could not hear his heart beat i thought that he was dead i stole away and walked to the railway station that night in paris i saw on the bills fatal motor accidents le petit journal said that the man was dead i was afraid that i might be called upon as a witness that is why i was so anxious to leave paris the man who came to our rooms you know that night was his friend  the good god anna murmured herself shaken with fear you were married to him  it could not be legal annabel moaned it couldnt be i thought that i was marrying meysey hill not that creature we stepped from the embassy into the motorand oh i thought that he was dead why didnt he die  anna sprang to her feet and walked restlessly up and down the room annabel watched her with wideopen terrified eyes  you wont give me away anna he would never recognize me now you are much more like what i was then  anna stopped in front of her  you dont propose do you she said quietly that i should take this man for my husband  you can drive him away annabel cried tell him that he is mad go and live somewhere else  in his present mood anna remarked he would follow me  oh you are strong and brave annabel murmured you can keep him at arms length besides it was under false pretences he told me that he was a millionaire it could not be a legal marriage  i am very much afraid anna answered that it was it might be upset i am wondering whether it would not be better to tell your husband everything you will never be happy with this hanging over you  annabel moistened her dry lips with a handkerchief steeped in eau de cologne  you dont know him anna she said with a little shudder or you would not talk like that he is steeped in the conventions every slight action is influenced by what he imagines would be the opinion of other people anything in the least irregular is like poison to him he has no imagination no real generosity you might tell the truth to some men but never to him  anna was thoughtful a conviction that her sisters words were true had from the first possessed her  annabel she said slowly if i fight this thing out myself can i trust you that it will not be a vain sacrifice after what you have said it is useless for us to play with words you do not love your husband you have married him for a positionto escape fromthings which you feared will you be a faithful and honest wife will you do your duty by him and forget all your past follies unless annabel you can  oh i will pledge you my word annabel cried passionately my solemn word believe me anna oh you must believe me i have been very foolish but it is over  remember that you are young still and fond of admiration anna said you will not give sir john any cause for jealousy you will have no secrets from him exceptconcerning those things which are past  anna i swear it her sister sobbed  then i will do what i can anna promised i believe that you are quite safe he has had brain fever since and as you say i am more like what you were then than you yourself are now i dont think for a moment that he would recognize you  annabel clutched her sisters hands the tears were streaming down her face her voice was thick with sobs  anna you are the dearest bravest sister in the world she cried oh i cant thank you you dear dear girl ilisten  they heard a mans voice outside  sir john annabel gasped  anna sprang to her feet and made for the dressingroom door  one moment if you please  she stopped short and looked round sir john stood upon the threshold     chapter xvi  the discomfiture of sir john   sir john looked from one to the other of the two sisters his face darkened  my arrival appears to be opportune he said stiffly i was hoping to be able to secure a few minutes conversation with you miss pellissier perhaps my wife has already prepared you for what i wish to say  not in the least anna answered calmly we have scarcely mentioned your name  sir john coughed he looked at annabel whose face was buried in her handshe looked back at anna who was regarding him with an easy composure which secretly irritated him  it is concerningour future relations sir john pronounced ponderously  indeed anna answered indifferently that sounds interesting  sir john frowned anna was unimpressed elegant a little scornful she leaned slightly against the back of a chair and looked him steadily in the eyes  i have no wish he said to altogether ignore the fact that you are my wifes sister and have therefore a certain claim upon me  annas eyes opened a little wider but she said nothing  a claim he continued which i am quite prepared to recognize it will give me great pleasure to settle an annuity for a moderate amount upon you on certain conditions  awhat anna asked  an annuitya sum of money paid to you yearly or quarterly through my solicitors and which you can consider as a gift from your sister the conditions are such as i think you will recognize the justice of i wish to prevent a repetition of any such errand as i presume you have come here upon this evening i cannot have my wife distressed or worried  may i ask anna said softly what you presume to have been the nature of my errand here this evening  sir john pointed to annabel who was as yet utterly limp  i cannot but conclude he said that your errand involved the recital to my wife of some trouble in which you find yourself i should like to add that if a certain amount is needed to set you free from any debts you may have contracted in addition to this annuity you will not find me unreasonable  anna glanced momentarily towards her sister but annabel neither spoke nor moved  with regard to the conditions i mentioned sir john continued gaining a little confidence from annas silence i think you will admit that they are not wholly unreasonable i should require you to accept no employment whatever upon the stage and to remain out of england  annas demeanour was still imperturbable her marble pallor untinged by the slightest flush of colour she regarded him coldly as though wondering whether he had anything further to say sir john hesitated and then continued  i trust he said that you will recognize the justice of these conditions under happier circumstances nothing would have given me more pleasure than to have offered you a home with your sister you yourself i am sure recognize how impossible you have made it for me now to do anything of the sort i may say that the amount of the annuity i propose to allow you is two hundred a year  anna looked for a moment steadily at her sister whose face was still averted then she moved towards the door before she passed out she turned and faced sir john the impassivity of her features changed at last her eyes were lit with mirth the corners of her mouth quivered  really sir john she said i dont know how to thank you i can understand now these newspapers when they talk of your magnificent philanthropy it is magnificent indeed and yetyou millionaires should really i think cultivate the art of discrimination i am so much obliged to you for your projected benevolence frankly it is the funniest thing which has ever happened to me in my life i shall like to think of itwhenever i feel dull goodbye anna  annabel sprang up sir john waved her back  do i understand you then to refuse my offer he asked anna  she shot a sudden glance at him sir john felt hot and furious it was maddening to be made to feel that he was in any way the inferior of this cool selfpossessed young woman whose eyes seemed for a moment to scintillate with scorn there were one or two bitter moments in his life when he had been made to feel that gentility laid on with a brush may sometimes crack and show weak placesthat deportment and breeding are after all things apart anna went out                                       her cheeks burned for a moment or two when she reached the street although she held her head upright and walked blithely even humming to herself fragments of an old french song and then at the street corner she came face to face with nigel ennison  i wont pretend he said that this is an accident the fates are never so kind to me as a matter of fact i have been waiting for you  she raised her eyebrows  really she said and by what right do you do anything of the sort  no right at all he admitted only it is much too late for you to be out alone you have been to see your sister of course how is she  my sister is quite well thank you she answered would you mind calling that hansom for me  he looked at it critically and shook his head  you really couldnt ride in it he said deprecatingly the horses knees are broken and i am not sure that the man is sober i would sooner see you in a bus again  she laughed  do you mean to say that you have been here ever since i came  i am afraid that i must confess it he answered idiotic isnt it  absolutely she agreed coldly i wish you would not do it  would not do what  well follow buses from russell square to hampstead  i can assure you he answered that it isnt a habit of mine but seriously  well seriously  isnt it your own fault a little why do you not tell me your address and allow me to call upon you  why should i i have told you that i do not wish for acquaintances in london  perhaps not in a general way he answered calmly you are quite right i think only i am not an acquaintance at all i am an old friend and i declined to be shelved  would you mind telling me anna asked how long i knew you in paris  he looked at her sideways there was nothing to be learned from her face  well he said slowly i had met you three timesbefore drummonds dinner  oh drummonds dinner she repeated you were there were you  he laughed a little impatiently  isnt that rather a strange questionunder the circumstances he asked quietly  her cheeks flushed a dull red she felt that there was a hidden meaning under his words yet her embarrassment was only a passing thing she dismissed the whole subject with a little shrug of the shoulders  we are both of us trenching upon forbidden ground she said it was perhaps my fault you have not forgotten  i have forgotten nothing he answered enigmatically  anna hailed a bus he looked at her reproachfully the bus however was full they fell into step again more than ever a sense of confusion was upon ennison  last time i saw you he reminded her you spoke did you not of obtaining some employment in london  quite true she answered briskly and thanks to you i have succeeded  thanks to me he repeated puzzled i dont understand  no but it is very simple it was you who were so much amazed that i did not trythe music hall stage here  you must admit he declared that to uswho had seen youthe thought of your trying anything else was amazing  at any rate she declared your remarks decided me i have an engagement with a theatrical agenti believe for the unusual  you are going to sing in london he said quietly  yes  for a moment or two he did not speak glancing towards him she saw that a shadow had fallen upon his face  tell me she insisted why you look like that you are afraidthat here in londoni shall not be a success it is that is it not  no he answered readily it is not that the idea of your being a failure would never have occurred to me  then why are you sorry that i am going to the unusual i do not understand  their eyes met for a moment his face was very serious  i am sorry he said slowly why i do not know  i positively insist upon knowing she declared cheerfully the sooner you tell me the better  it is very hard to explain he answered i think that it is only an idea only you seem to me since the time when i knew you in paris to have changedto have changed in some subtle manner which i find at times utterly bewildering i find you an impenetrable enigma i find it impossible to associate you withmy little friend of the ambassadors the things she said and did from youseem impossible i had a sort of idea he went on that you were starting life all over again and it seemed awfully plucky  there was a long silence then anna spoke more seriously than usual  i think she said that i rather like what you have said dont be afraid to go on thinking it even though i am going to sing at the unusual you may find that the alcide whom you knew in paris does not exist any more at the same time she added in a suddenly altered tone it isnt anything whatever to do with you is it  why not he answered you permitted me then to call you my friend i do not intend to allow you to forget  they passed a man who stared at them curiously ennison started and looked anxiously at anna she was quite unconcerned  did you see who that was he asked in a low tone  i did not recognize him anna answered i supposed that he took off his hat to you  it was cheveney he said slowly  cheveney she repeated i do not know any one of that name  he caught her wrist and turned her face towards him her eyes were wide open with amazement  mr ennison  he released her  good god he exclaimed who are youannabel pellissier or her ghost  anna laughed  if it is a choice between the two she answered i must be annabel pellissier i am certainly no ghost  you have her face and figure he muttered you have even her name yet you can look cheveney in the face and declare that you do not know him you have changed from the veriest butterfly to a womanyou wear different clothes you have the air of another world if you do not help me to read the riddle of yourself annabel i think that very soon i shall be a candidate for the asylum  she laughed heartily and became as suddenly grave  so mr cheveney was another paris friend was he she asked  dont befool me any more he answered almost roughly if any one should knowyou should he was your friend we were onlyles autres  that is quite untrue she declared cheerfully i certainly knew him no better than you  then heand parislied ennison answered  that she answered is far easier to believe you are too credulous  ennison had things to say but he looked at her and held his tongue they turned the last corner and almost immediately a man who had been standing there turned and struck ennison a violent blow on the cheek ennison reeled and almost fell recovering himself quickly his instinct of selfdefence was quicker than his recollection of annas presence he struck out from the shoulder and the man measured his length upon the pavement  anna sprang lightly away across the street brendon and courtlaw who had been watching for her met her at the door she pointed across the road  please go and see thatnothing happens she pleaded  it is the first moment we have let him out of our sight brendon exclaimed as he hastened across the street  hill sat up on the pavement and mopped the blood from his cheek ennisons signetring had cut nearly to the bone  what the devil do you mean by coming for me like that ennison exclaimed glowering down upon him serves you right if id cracked your skull  hill looked up at him an unkempt roughlooking object with broken collar tumbled hair and the blood slowly dripping from his face  what do you mean hanging round with my wife he answered fiercely  ennison looked down on him in disgust  you silly fool he said i know nothing about your wife the young lady i was with is not married at all why dont you make sure before you rush out like that upon a stranger  you were with my wife hill repeated sullenly i suppose youre like the rest of them call her miss pellissier eh i tell you shes my wife and ive got the certificate in my pocket  i dont know who you are ennison said quietly but you are a thundering liar  hill staggered to his feet and drew a folded paper from his pocket  marriage certificates dont tell lies at any rate he said just look that through will you  ennison took the document tore it half in two without looking at it and flung it back in hills face then he turned on his heel and walked off     chapter xvii  the change in alcide   bythebye his neighbour asked him languidly who is our hostess  usually known i believe as lady ferringhall ennison answered unless i have mixed up my engagement list and come to the wrong house  how dull you are the lady remarked of course i mean who was she  i believe that her name was pellissier ennison answered  pellissier she repeated thoughtfully there were some hampshire pellissiers  she is one of them ennison said  dear me i wonder where sir john picked her up  in paris i think ennison answered only married a few months ago and lived out at hampstead  heavens the lady exclaimed i heard they came from somewhere outrageous  hampstead didnt suit lady ferringhall ennison remarked they have just taken this house from lady cellender  and what are you doing here the lady asked  politics ennison answered grimly and you  same thing besides my husband has shares in sir johns company do you know i am beginning to believe that we only exist nowadays by the tolerance of these millionaire tradesmen our land brings us in nothing we have to get them to let us in for the profits of their business and in return we ask them todinner bythebye have you seen this new woman at the empire what is it they call heralcide  yes i have seen her ennison answered  every one raves about her lady angela continued for my part i can see no difference in any of these french girls who come over here with their demure manner and atrocious songs  alcides songs are not atrocious ennison remarked  lady angela shrugged her shoulders  it is unimportant she said nobody understands them of course but we all look as though we did something about this woman rather reminds me of our hostess  ennison thought so too half an hour later when having cut out from one of the bridge tables he settled down for a chat with annabel every now and then something familiar in her tone the poise of her head the play of her eyes startled him then he remembered that she was annas sister  he lowered his voice a little and leaned over towards her  bythebye lady ferringhall he said do you know that i am a very great admirer of your sisters i wonder if she has ever spoken to you of me  the change in lady ferringhalls manner was subtle but unmistakable she answered him almost coldly  i see nothing of my sister she said in paris our lives were far apart and we had seldom the same friends i have heard of you from my husband you are somebodys secretary are you not  it was plain that the subject was distasteful to her but ennison although famous in a small way for his social tact did not at once discard it  you have not seen your sister lately he remarked i believe that you would find her in some respects curiously altered i have never in my life been so much puzzled by any one as by your sister something has changed her tremendously  annabel looked at him curiously  do you mean in looks she asked  not only that he answered in paris your sister appeared to me to be a charming student of frivolity here she seems to have developed into a brilliant woman with more character and steadfastness than i should ever have given her credit for her features are the same yet the change has written its mark into her face do you know lady ferringhall i am proud that your sister permits me to call myself her friend  and in paris  in paris he interrupted she was a very delightful companion but beyond thatone did not take her seriously i am not boring you am i  she raised her eyes to his and smiled into his face  you are not boring me she said but i would rather talk of something else i suppose you will think me very unsisterly and coldhearted but there are circumstances in connexion with my sisters latest exploit which are intensely irritating both to my husband and to myself  he recognized the force almost the passion which trembled in her tone and he at once abandoned the subject he remained talking with her however it was easy for him to see that she desired to be agreeable to him they talked lightly but confidentially until sir john approached them with a slight frown upon his face  mr ennison he said it is for you to cut in at lady angelas table anna do you not see that the countess is sitting alone  she rose and flashed a quick smile upon ennison behind her husbands back  you must come and see me some afternoon she said to him  he murmured his delight and joined the bridge party where he played with less than his accustomed skill on the way home he was still thoughtful he turned in at the club they were talking of alcide as they often did in those days  she has improved her style someone declared certainly her voice is far more musical  another differed  she has lost something he declared something which brought the men in crowds around the stage at the ambassadors i dont know what youd call ita sort of witchery almost suggestiveness she sings better perhaps but i dont think she lays hold of one so  i will tell you what there is about her which is so fetching drummond who was lounging by declared she contrives somehow to strike the personal note in an amazing manner you are wedged in amongst a crowd perhaps in the promenade you lean over the back you are almost out of sight yet you catch her eyeyou cant seem to escape from it you feel that that smile is for you the words are for you the whole song is for you naturally you shout yourself hoarse when she has finished and feel jolly pleased with yourself  and if you are a millionaire like drummond someone remarked you send round a note and ask her to come out to supper  in the present case drummond remarked glancing across the room cheveney wouldnt permit it  ennison dropped the evening paper which he had been pretending to read cheveney strolled up a pipe in his mouth  cheveney wouldnt have anything to say about it as it happens he remarked a little grimly ungracious little beast i call her i dont mind telling you chaps that except on the stage i havent set eyes on her this side of the water ive called half a dozen times at her flat and she wont see me rank ingratitude i call it  there was a shout of laughter drummond patted him on the shoulder  never mind old chap he declared lets hope your successor is worthy of you  you fellows ennison said quietly are getting a little wild i have known miss pellissier as long as any of you perhaps and i have seen something of her since her arrival in london i consider her a very charming young womanand i wont hear a word about paris for there are things i dont understand about that but i will stake my word upon it that today miss pellissier is entitled not only to our admiration but to our respect i firmly believe that she is as straight as a die  ennisons voice shook a little they were his friends and they recognized his unusual earnestness drummond who had been about to speak refrained cheveney walked away with a shrug of the shoulders  i believe you are quite right so far as regards the present at any rate someone remarked from the depths of an easy chair you see her sister is married to ferringhall isnt she and she herself must be drawing no end of a good screw here i always say that its poverty before everything that makes a girl skip the line  ennison escaped he was afraid if he stayed that he would make a fool of himself he walked through the misty september night to his rooms on his way he made a slight divergence from the direct route and paused for a moment outside the flat where anna was now living it was nearly one oclock but there were lights still in all her windows suddenly the door of the flat opened and closed a man came out and walking recklessly almost cannoned into ennison he mumbled an apology and then stopped short  its ennison isnt it he exclaimed what the devil are you doing stargazing here  ennison looked at him in surprise  i might return the compliment courtlaw he answered by asking why the devil you come lurching on to the pavement like a drunken man  courtlaw was pale and dishevelled he was carelessly dressed and there were marks of unrest upon his features he pointed to where the lights still burned in annas windows  what do you think of that farce he exclaimed bitterly you are one of those who must know all about it was there ever such madness  i am afraid that i dont understand ennison answered you seem to have come from miss pellissiers rooms i had no idea even that she was a friend of yours  courtlaw laughed hardly his eyes were red he was in a curious state of desperation  nor am i now he answered i have spoken too many truths tonight why do women take to lies and deceit and trickery as naturally as a duck to water  you are not alluding i hope to miss pellissier ennison said stiffly  why not isnt the whole thing a lie isnt her reputation this husband of hers the alcide business isnt it all a cursed juggle she hasnt the right to do it i  he stopped short he had the air of a man who has said too much ennison was deeply interested  i should like to understand you he said i knew miss pellissier in paris at the ambassadors and i know her now but i am convinced that there is some mystery in connexion with her change of life she is curiously altered in many ways is there any truth do you suppose in this rumoured marriage  i know nothing courtlaw answered hurriedly ask me nothing i will not talk to you about miss pellissier or her affairs  you are not yourself tonight courtlaw ennison said come to my rooms and have a drink  courtlaw refused brusquely almost rudely  i am off tonight he said i am going to america i have work there i ought to have gone long ago will you answer me a question first  if i can ennison said  what were you doing outside miss pellissiers flat tonight you were looking at her windows why what is she to you  i was there by accident ennison answered miss pellissier is nothing to me except a young lady for whom i have the most profound and respectful admiration  courtlaw laid his hand upon ennisons shoulder they were at the corner of pall mall now and had come to a standstill  take my advice he said hoarsely call it warning if you like admire her as much as you chooseat a distance no more look at me you knew me in paris david courtlaw wellbalanced sane wasnt i you never heard anyone call me a madman im pretty near being one now and its her fault ive loved her for two years i love her now and im off to america and if my steamer goes to the bottom of the atlantic ill thank the lord for it  he strode away and vanished in the gathering fog ennison stood still for a moment swinging his latchkey upon his finger then he turned round and gazed thoughtfully at the particular spot in the fog where courtlaw had disappeared  im dd if i understand this he said thoughtfully i never saw courtlaw with hernever heard her speak of him he was going to tell me somethingand he shut up i wonder what it was     chapter xviii  annabel and alcide   lady ferringhall lifted her eyes to the newcomer and the greeting in them was obviously meant for him alone she continued to fan herself  you are late she murmured  my chief he said took it into his head to have an impromptu dinner party he brought home a few waverers to talk to them where they had no chance of getting away  she nodded  i am bored she said abruptly this is a very foolish sort of entertainment and as usual she continued a little bitterly i seem to have been sent along with the dullest and least edifying of mrs montressors guests  ennison glanced at the other people in the box and smiled  i got your note just in time he remarked i knew of course that you were at the montressors but i had no idea that it was a music hall party afterwards are you all here  five boxes full she answered some of them seem to be having an awfully good time too did you see lord delafield and miss anderson they packed me in with colonel anson and mrs hitchings who seem to be absolutely engrossed in one another and a boy of about seventeen who no sooner got here than he discovered that he wanted to see a man in the promenade and disappeared  ennison at once seated himself  i feel justified then he said in annexing his chair i expect you had been snubbing him terribly  well he was presumptuous annabel remarked and he wasnt nice about it i wonder how it is she added that boys always make love so impertinently  ennison laughed softly  i wonder he said how you would like to be made love toboldly or timorously or sentimentally  are you master of all three methods she asked stopping her fanning for a moment to look at him  indeed no he answered mine is a primitive and unstudied manner it needs cultivating i think  his fingers touched hers for a moment under the ledge of the box  that sounds so uncouth she murmured i detest amateurs  i will buy books and a lay figure he declared to practise upon or shall i ask colonel anson for a few hints  for heavens sake no she declared i would rather put up with your own efforts however clumsy lovemaking at first hand is dull enough at second hand it would be unendurable  he leaned towards her  is that a challenge  she shrugged her shoulders all ablaze with jewels  why not it might amuse me  somewhat irrelevantly he glanced at the next few boxes where the rest of mrs montressors guests were  is your husband here tonight he asked  my husband she laughed a little derisively no he wouldnt come here of all placesjust now he dined and then pleaded a political engagement i was supposed to do the same but i didnt  you know he said with some hesitation that your sister is singing  she nodded  of course i want to hear how she does it  she does it magnificently he declared i thinkwe all think that she is wonderful  she looked at him with curious eyes  i remember she said that the first night i saw you you spoke of my sister as your friend have you seen much of her lately  nothing at all he answered  the small grey feathers of her exquisitely shaped fan waved gently backwards and forwards she was watching him intently  do you know she said that every one is remarking how ill you look i too can see it what has been the matter  toothache he answered laconically  she looked away  you might at least she murmured have invented a more romantic reason  oh i might he answered have gone further still i might have told you the truth  has my sister been unkind to you  the family he declared has not treated me with consideration  she looked at him doubtfully  you promised faithfully to be there he said slowly i loathe afternoon concerts and  she was really like her sister he thought impressed for a moment by the soft brilliancy of her smile her fingers rested upon his  you were really at moulton house she exclaimed penitently i am so sorry i had a perfect shoal of callers people who would not go i only arrived when everybody was coming away  a little murmur of expectation an audible silence announced the coming of alcide then a burst of applause she was standing there smiling at the audience as at her friends from the first there had always been between her and her listeners that electrical sympathy which only a certain order of genius seems able to create then she sang  ennison listened and his eyes glowed lady ferringhall listened and her cheeks grew pale her whole face stiffened with suppressed anger she forgot annas sacrifices forgot her own callousness forgot the burden which she had fastened upon her sisters shoulders she was fiercely and bitterly jealous anna was singing as she used to sing she was chic distinguished unusual what right had she to call herself alcide it was abominable an imposture ennison listened and he forgot where he was he forgot annabels idle attempts at lovemaking all the culdesac gallantry of the moment the cultivated indifference which was part of the armour of his little world fell away from him he leaned forward and looked into the eyes of the woman he loved and it seemed to him that she sang back to him with a sudden note of something like passion breaking here and there through the gay mocking words which flowed with such effortless and seductive music from her lips  neither of them joined in the applause which followed upon her exit they were both conscious however that something had intervened between them their conversation became stilted a spot of colour brighter than any rouge burned on her cheeks  she is marvellously clever he said  she appears to be very popular here she remarked  you too sing he asked  i have given it up she answered one genius in the family is enough after a pause she added do you mind fetching back my recalcitrant cavalier  anything except that he murmured i was half hoping that i might be allowed to see you home  if you can tear yourself away from this delightful place in five minutes she answered i think i can get rid of the others  we will do it he declared if only sir john were not sir john i would ask you to come and have some supper  dont imperil my reputation before i am established she answered smiling afterwards it seems to me that there are no limits to what one may not do amongst ones own set  i am frightened of sir john he said but i suggest that we risk it  dont tempt me she said laughing and drawing her operacloak together you shall drive home with me in a hansom if you will that is quite as far as i mean to tempt providence tonight                                       again on his way homeward from cavendish square he abandoned the direct route to pass by the door of annas flat impassive by nature and training he was conscious tonight of a strange sense of excitement of exhilaration tempered by a dull background of disappointment her sister had told him that it was true anna was married after all she was a consummate actress her recent attitude towards him was undoubtedly a pose his long struggle with himself his avoidance of her were quite unnecessary there was no longer any risk in association with her his pulses beat fast as he walked his feet fell lightly upon the pavement he slackened his pace as he reached the flat the windows were still darkenedperhaps she was not home yet he lit a cigarette and loitered about he laughed once or twice at himself as he paced backwards and forwards he felt like a boy again the taste for adventures was keen upon his palate the whole undiscovered world of rhythmical things of love and poetry and passion seemed again to him a real and actual place and he himself an adventurer upon the threshold  then a hansom drove up and his heart gave a great leap she stepped on to the pavement almost before him and his blood turned almost to ice as he saw that she was not alone a young man turned to pay the cabman then she saw him  mr ennison she exclaimed is that really you  there was no sign of embarrassment in her manner she held out her hand frankly she seemed honestly glad to see him  how odd that i should almost spring into your arms just on my doorstep she remarked gaily are you in a hurry will you come in and have some coffee  he hesitated and glanced towards her companion he saw now that it was merely a boy  this is mr sydney courtlawmr ennison she said you are coming in arent you sydney  if i may he answered your coffees too good to refuse  she led the way talking all the time to ennison  do you know i have been wondering what had become of you she said i had those beautiful roses from you on my first night and a tiny little note but no address i did not even know where to write and thank you  i have been abroad he said the life of a private secretary is positively one of slavery i had to go at a moments notice  i am glad that you have a reasonable excuse for not having been to see me she said goodhumouredly please make yourselves comfortable while i see to the coffee  it was a tiny little room daintily furnished individual in its quaint colouring and the masses of perfumed flowers set in strange and unexpected places a great bowl of scarlet carnations gleamed from a dark corner set against the background of a deep brown wall a jar of pink roses upon a tiny table seemed to gain an extra delicacy of colour from the sombre curtains behind anna who had thrown aside her sealskin coat wore a tightfitting walking dress of some dark shade he leaned back in a low chair and watched her graceful movements the play of her white hands as she bent over some wonderful machine a woman indeed this to love and be loved beautiful graceful gay a dreamy sense of content crept over him the ambitions of his life and they were many seemed to lie far away broken up dreams in some outside world where the way was rough and the sky always grey a little table covered with a damask cloth was dragged out there were cakes and sandwichesfor ennison a sort of elysian feast long to be remembered they talked lightly and smoked cigarettes till anna with a little laugh threw open the window and let in the cool night air  ennison stood by her side they looked out over the city grim and silent now for it was long past midnight for a moment her thoughts led her back to the evening when she and courtlaw had stood together before the window of her studio in paris before the coming of sir john had made so many changes in her life she was silent the ghost of a fading smile passed from her lips she had made her way since then a little further into the heart of life yet even now there were so many things untouched so much to be learned tonight she had a curious feeling that she stood upon the threshold of some change the great untrodden world was before her still into which no one can pass alone she felt a new warmth in her blood a strange sense of elation crept over her sorrows and danger and disappointment she had known perhaps the day of her recompense was at hand she glanced into her companions face and she saw there strange things for a moment her heart seemed to stop beating then she dropped the curtain and stepped back into the room sydney was strumming over a new song which stood upon the piano  i am sure she said that you mean to stay until you are turned out do you see the time  i may come and see you ennison asked as his hand touched hers  yes she answered looking away some afternoon     chapter xix  this is not the end   i said some afternoon she remarked throwing open her warm coat and taking off her gloves but i certainly did not mean today  i met you accidentally he reminded her our ways happened to lie together  and our destinations also it seems she added smiling  you asked me in to tea he protested  in selfdefence i had to she answered it is a delightful day for walking but a great deal too cold to be standing on the pavement  of course he said reaching out his hand tentatively for his hat i could go away even now your reputation for hospitality would remain under a cloud though for tea was distinctly mentioned  then you had better ring the bell she declared laughing the walk has given me an appetite and i do not feel like waiting till five oclock i wonder why on earth the curtains are drawn it is quite light yet and i want to have one more look at that angry red sun would you mind drawing them back  ennison sprang up but he never reached the curtains they were suddenly thrown aside and a man stepped out from his hidingplace a little exclamation of surprise escaped ennison anna sprang to her feet with a startled cry  you she exclaimed what are you doing here how dare you come to my rooms  the man stepped into the middle of the room the last few months had not dealt kindly with mr montague hill he was still flashily dressed with much obvious jewellery and the shiniest of patent boots but his general bearing and appearance had altered for the worse his cheeks were puffy and his eyes bloodshot he had the appearance of a man who has known no rest for many nights his voice when he spoke was almost fiercely assertive but there was an undernote of nervousness  why not he exclaimed i have the right to be here i hid because there was no other way of seeing you i did not reckon uponhim  he pointed to ennison who in his turn looked across at anna  you wish me to stay he asked in a low tone  i would not have you go for anything she answered  nevertheless hill said doggedly i am here to speak to you alone  if you do not leave the room at once anna answered calmly i shall ring the bell for a policeman  he raised his hand and they saw that he was holding a small revolver  you need not be alarmed he said i do not wish to use this i came here peaceably and i only ask for a few words with you but i mean to have them no you dont  ennison had moved stealthily a little nearer to him and looked suddenly into the dark muzzle of the revolver  if you interfere between us the man said it will go hardly with you this lady is my wife and i have a right to be here i have the right also to throw you out  ennison obeyed annas gesture and was silent  you can say what you have to say before mr ennison if at all anna declared calmly in any case i decline to see you alone  very well the man answered i have come to tell you this you are my wife and i am determined to claim you we were properly married and the certificate is at my lawyers i am not a madman or a pauper or even an unreasonable person i know that you were disappointed because i did not turn out to be the millionaire perhaps i deceived you about it however thats over and done with ill make any reasonable arrangement you like i dont want to stop your singing you can live just about how you like but you belong to meand i want you  he paused for a moment and then suddenly continued his voice had broken he spoke in quick nervous sentences  you did your best to kill me he said you might have given me a chance anyway im not such a bad sort you knowi worship you i have done from the first moment i saw you i cant rest or work or settle down to anything while things are like this between you and me i want you ive got to have you and by god i will  he took a quick step forward anna held out her hand and he paused there was something which chilled even him in the cold impassivity of her features  listen she said i have heard these things from you before and you have had my answer understand once and for all that that answer is final i do not admit the truth of a word which you have said i will not be persecuted in this way by you  you do not deny that you are my wife he asked hoarsely you cannot oh you cannot  i have denied it she answered why will you not be sensible go back to your old life and your old friends and forget all about paris and this absurd delusion of yours  delusion he muttered glaring at her delusion  you can call it what you like she said in any case you will never receive any different sort of answer from me stay where you are mr ennison  with a swift movement she gained the bell and rang it the mans hand flashed out but immediately afterwards an oath and a cry of pain broke from his lips the pistol fell to the floor ennison kicked it away with his foot  i shall send for a policeman anna said directly my maid answers the bellunless you choose to go before  the man made no attempt to recover the revolver he walked unsteadily towards the door  very well he said i will go but and he faced them both with a still expressionless glance this is not the end                                       anna recovered her spirits with marvellous facility it was ennison who for the rest of his visit was quiet and subdued  you are absurd she declared it was unpleasant while it lasted but it is overand my toasted scones are delicious do have another  it is over for now he answered but i cannot bear to think that you are subject to this sort of thing  she shrugged her shoulders slightly some of the delicate colour which the afternoon walk had brought into her cheeks had already returned  it is an annoyance my friend she said not a tragedy  it might become one he answered the man is dangerous  she looked thoughtfully into the fire  i am afraid she said that he must have a skeleton key to these rooms if so i shall have to leave  you cannot play at hideandseek with this creature all your life he answered let your friends act for you there must be ways of getting rid of him  i am afraid she murmured that it would be difficult he really deserves a better fate does he not he is so beautifully persistent  he drew a little nearer to her the lamp was not yet lit and in the dim light he bent forward as though trying to look into her averted face he touched her hand soft and cool to his fingersshe turned at once to look at him her eyes were perhaps a little brighter than usual the firelight played about her hair there seemed to him to be a sudden softening of the straight firm mouth nevertheless she withdrew her hand  let me help you he begged indeed you could have no more faithful friend you could find no one more anxious to serve you  her hand fell back into her lap he touched it again and this time it was not withdrawn  that is very nice of you she said but it is so difficult  not at all he answered eagerly i wish you would come and see my lawyers of course i know nothing of what really did happen in parisif even you ever saw him there you need not tell me but a lawyer is different his clients story is safe with him he would advise you how to get rid of the fellow  i will think of it she promised  you must do more than think of it he urged it is intolerable that you should be followed about by such a creature i am sure that he can be got rid of  she turned and looked at him her face scarcely reflected his enthusiasm  it may be more difficult than you think she said you see you do not know how much of truth there is in his story  if it were all true he said doggedly it may still be possible  i will think of it she repeated i cannot say more  they talked for a while in somewhat dreamy fashion anna especially being more silent than usual at last she glanced at a little clock in the corner of the room and sprang to her feet  heavens look at the time she exclaimed it is incredible i shall barely be in time for the theatre i must go and dress at once  he too rose  i will wait for you on the pavement if you like he said but i am going to the unusual with you your maid would not be of the least protection  but your dinner she protested you will be so late  he laughed  you cannot seriously believe he said that at the present moment i care a snap of the fingers whether i have any dinner or not  she laughed  well you certainly did very well at tea she remarked if you really are going to wait make yourself as comfortable as you can there are cigarettes and magazines in the corner there  anna disappeared but ennison did not trouble either the cigarettes or the magazines he sat back in an easy chair with a hand upon each of the elbows and looked steadfastly into the fire  people spoke of him everywhere as a young man of great promise a politician by instinct a keen and careful judge of character yet he was in a state of hopeless bewilderment he was absolutely unable to focus his ideas the girl who had just left the room was as great a mystery to him now as on the afternoon when he had met her in piccadilly and taken her to tea and behindthere was paris memories of amazing things memories which made his cheeks burn and his heart beat quickly as he sat there waiting for her for the first time a definite doubt possessed him a woman cannot change her soul then it was the woman herself who was changed anna was not alcide of the ambassadors whose subtly demure smile and piquant glances had called him to her side from the moment of their first meeting it was impossible  she came in while he was still in the throes conviction battling with commonsense his own apprehension he rose at once to his feet and turned a white face upon her  i am going to break a covenant he cried i cannot keep silence any longer  you are going to speak to me of things which happened before we met in london she asked quietly  yes i must the thing is becoming a torture to me i must  she threw open the door and pointed to it  my word holds she said if you speakfarewell  he stood quite silent for a moment his eyes fixed upon her face something he saw there had a curious effect upon him he was suddenly calm  i shall not speak he said now or at any other time come  they went out together and he called a hansom from the opposite corner under the trees a man with his hat slouched over his eyes stood and glowered at them     chapter xx  annas surrender   this is indeed a gala night said ennison raising his glass and watching for a moment the golden bubbles was it really only this afternoon that i met you in st james park  anna nodded and made a careful selection from a dish of quails  it was just an hour before teatime she remarked i have had nothing since and it seems a very long time  an appetite like yours he said resignedly is fatal to all sentiment  not in the least she assured him i find the two inseparable  he sighed  i have noticed he said that you seem to delight in taking a topsyturvy view of life it arises i think from an over developed sense of humour you would find things to laugh at even in artemus ward  you do not understand me at all she declared i think that you are very dense besides your remark is not in the least complimentary i have always understood that men avoid like the plague a woman with a sense of humour  so they talked on whilst supper was served falling easily into the spirit of the place and yet both of them conscious of some new thing underlying the gaiety of their tongues and manner anna in her strange striking way was radiantly beautiful without a single ornament about her neck or hair wearing the plainest of black gowns out of which her shoulders shone gleaming white she was easily the most noticeable and the most distinguishedlooking woman in the room tonight there seemed to be a new brilliancy in her eyes a deeper quality in her tone she was herself conscious of a recklessness of spirits almost hysterical perhaps after all the others were right perhaps she had found this new thing in life the thing wonderful the terrors and anxieties of the last few months seemed to have fallen from her to have passed away like an ugly dream dismissed with a shudder even from the memory an acute sense of living was in her veins even the taste of her wine seemed magical ennison too always handsome and debonnair seemed transported out of his calm self his tongue was more ready his wit more keen than usual he said daring things with a grace which made them irresistible his eyes flashed back upon her some eloquent but silent appreciation of the change in her manner towards him  and then there came for both of them at least a temporary awakening it was he who saw them first coming down the roomannabel in a wonderful white satin gown in front and sir john stiff unbending disapproving bringing up the rear he bent over to anna at once  it is your sister and her husband he said they are coming past our table  annabel saw ennison first and noticing his single companion calmly ignored him then making a pretence of stooping to rearrange her flowing train she glanced at anna and half stopped in her progress down the room sir john followed her gaze and also saw them his face clouded with anger  it was after all a momentary affair annabel passed on with a strained nod to her sister and sir johns bow was a miracle of icy displeasure they vanished through the doorway anna and her escort exchanged glances almost simultaneously they burst out laughing  how do you feel she asked  limp he answered as a matter of fact i deserve to i was engaged to dine with your sister and her husband and i sent a wire  it was exceedingly wrong of you anna declared before i came to england i was told that there were two things which an englishman who was commeilfaut never did the first was to break a dinner engagement  and the second  make love to a single woman  your knowledge of our ways he murmured is profound yet i suppose that at the present moment i am the most envied man in the room  her eyes were lit with humour to have spoken lightly on such a subject a few hours ago would have seemed incredible  but you do not know she whispered whether i am a married woman or not there is mr montague hill  the lights were lowered and an attentive waiter hovered round annas cloak they left the room amongst the last and ennison had almost to elbow his way through a group of acquaintances who had all some pretext for detaining him to which he absolutely refused to listen they entered a hansom and turned on to the embankment the two great hotels on their right were still ablaze with lights on their left the river with its gloomy pile of buildings on the opposite side and a huge revolving advertisement throwing its strange reflection upon the black water a fresh cool breeze blew in their faces anna leaned back with half closed eyes  delicious she murmured  his fingers closed upon her hand she yielded it without protest as though unconsciously not a word passed between them it seemed to him that speech would be an anticlimax  he paid the cab and turned to follow her she passed inside and upstairs without a word in her little sittingroom she turned on the electric light and looked around half fearfully  please search everywhere she said i am going through the other rooms i shall not let you go till i am quite sure  if he has a key ennison said how are you to be safe  i had bolts fitted on the doors yesterday she answered if he is not here now i can make myself safe  it was certain that he was not there anna came back into the sittingroom with a little sigh of relief  indeed she said it was very fortunate that i should have met you this afternoon either sydney or mr brendon always comes home with me and tonight both are away mary is very good but she is too nervous to be the slightest protection  i am very glad he answered in a low tone it has been a delightful evening for me  and for me anna echoed  a curious silence ensued anna was sitting before the fire a little distance from himennison himself remained standing some shadow of reserve seemed to have crept up between them she laughed nervously but kept her eyes averted  it is strange that we should have met annabel she said i am afraid your broken dinner engagement will not be so easy to explain  he was very indifferent in fact he was thinking of other things  i am going he said to be impertinent i do not understand why you and your sister should not see more of one another you must be lonely here with only a few men friends  she shook her head  loneliness she said is a luxury which i never permit myself besidesthere is sir john  sir john is an ass he declared  he is annabels husband she reminded him  annabel he looked at her thoughtfully it is rather odd he said but i always thought that your name was annabel and hers anna  many other people she remarked have made the same mistake  again he said i am going to be impertinent i never met your sister in paris but i heard about her more than once she is not in the least like the descriptions of her  she has changed a good deal anna admitted  there is some mystery about you both he exclaimed with sudden earnestness no dont interrupt me why may i not be your friend somehow or other i feel that you have been driven into a false position you represent to me an enigma the solution of which has become the one desire of my life i want to give you warning that i have set myself to solve it tomorrow i am going to paris  she seemed unmoved but she did not look at him  to paris but why what do you hope to discover there  i do not know he answered but i am going to see david courtlaw  then she looked up at him with frightened eyes  david courtlaw she repeated what has he to do with it  he was your sisters masterher friend a few days ago i saw him leave your house he was like a man beside himself he began to tell me somethingand stopped i am going to ask him to finish it  she rose up  i forbid it she said firmly  they were standing face to face now upon the hearthrug she was very pale and there was a look of fear in her eyes  i will tell you as much as this she continued there is a secret i admit it set yourself to find it out if you willbut if you do never dare to call yourself my friend again  it is for your goodyour good only i am thinking he declared  then let me be the judge of what is best she answered  he was silent he felt his heart beat faster and fasterhis selfrestraint slipping away after all what did it matterit or anything else in the world she was within reach of his arms beautiful compelling herself as it seemed suddenly conscious of the light which was burning in his eyes a quick flush stained her cheeks she put out her hands to avoid his embrace  no she exclaimed you must not it is impossible  his arms were around her he only laughed his defiance  i will make it possible he cried i will make all things possible  anna was bewildered she did not know herself only she was conscious of an unfamiliar and wonderful emotion she gave her lips to his without resistance all her protests seemed stifled before she could find words to utter them with a little sigh of happiness she accepted this new thing     chapter xxi  her sisters secret   i think lady ferringhall said that you are talking very foolishly i was quite as much annoyed as you were to see mr ennison with my sister last night but apart from that you have no particular objection to him i suppose  the occurrence of last night is quite sufficient in itself sir john answered to make me wish to discontinue mr ennisons acquaintance i should think anna that your own senseerof propriety would enable you to see this it is not possible for us to be on friendly terms with a young man who has been seen in a public place having supper alone with your sister after midnight the fact itself is regrettable enoughregrettable i fear is quite an inadequate word to receive him here afterwards would be most repugnant to me  he probably does not know of the relationship annabel remarked  i imagine sir john said that your sister would acquaint him with it in any case he is liable to discover it at any time my own impression is that he already knows  why do you think so she asked  i noticed him call her attention to us as we passed down the room he answered of course he may merely have been telling her who we were but i think it improbable  apart from the fact of his acquaintance with annaannabel lady ferringhall said quickly may i ask if you have any other objection to mr ennison  sir john hesitated  to the young man himself he answered no i simply object to his calling here two or three times a week during my absence  how absurd annabel declared how could he call except in your absence as you are never at home in the afternoon and if i cared to have him come every day why shouldnt he i find him very amusing and very useful as well he brought his mother to call and as you know the countess goes scarcely anywhere hers is quite the most exclusive set in london  my feeling in the matter sir john said is as i have stated further i do not care for you to accept social obligations from mr ennison or any other young man  you are jealous she declared contemptuously  if i am he answered reddening you can scarcely assert that it is without a cause you will forgive my remarking anna that i consider there is a great change in your manner towards me and your general deportment since our marriage  annabel laughed gaily  my dear man she exclaimed wasnt that a foregone conclusion  you treat the matter lightly he continued to me it seems serious enough i have fulfilled my part of our marriage contract can you wonder that i expect you to fulfil yours  i am not aware she answered that i have ever failed in doing so  you are at least aware he said that you have on several recent occasions acted in direct opposition to my wishes  for example  your dyed hair i was perfectly satisfied with your appearance i consider even now that the present colour is far less becoming then you have altered not only that but your manner of dressing it you have darkened your eyebrows you have even changed your style of dress you have shown an almost feverish anxiety to eliminate from your personal appearance all that reminded me of youwhen we first met  well she said has there not been some reason for this the likeness to annabel could scarcely have escaped remark you forget that every one is going to the unusual to see her  he frowned heavily  i wish that i could forget it he said fortunately i believe that the relationship is not generally known i trust that no unpleasant rumours will be circulated before the election at any rate  annabel yawned  they might do you good she remarked alcide is very popular  sir john turned towards the door  it does not appear to me he said stiffly to be an affair for jests  annabel laughed derisively and took up her book she heard her husbands heavy tread descending the stairs and the wheels of his carriage as he drove off then she threw the volume away with a little impatient exclamation she rose from her chair and began walking up and down the room restlessly every now and then she fingered an ornament moved a piece of furniture or rearranged some draperies once she stopped in front of a mirror and looked at herself thoughtfully  i am getting plain she said with a little shudder this life is killing me oh it is dull dull dull  suddenly an idea seemed to strike her she went to her room and changed the loose morning gown in which she had lunched for a dark walking dress a few minutes later she left the house on foot and taking a hansom at the corner of the square drove to annas flat  anna was having tea by herself when she entered she rose at once with a little exclamation half of surprise half of pleasure  my dear annabel she said this is delightful but i thought that it was forbidden  it is annabel answered shortly but i wanted to see you  anna wheeled an easy chair to the fire  you will have some tea she asked  annabel ignored both the chair and the invitation she was looking about her and her face was dark with anger the little room was fragrant with flowers anna herself bright and with all the evidences of well being annabel was conscious then of the slow anger which had been burning within her since the night of her visit to the unusual her voice trembled with suppressed passion  i have come for an explanation she said you are an impostor how dare you use my name and sing my songs  anna looked at her sister in blank amazement  annabel she exclaimed why what is the matter with you what do you mean  annabel laughed scornfully  oh you know she said dont be a hypocrite you are not alcide you have no right to call yourself alcide you used to declare that you hated the name you used to beg me for hours at a time to give it all up never to go near the ambassadors again and yet the moment i am safely out of the way you are content to dress yourself in my rags to go and get yourself popular and admired and successful all on my reputation  annabel annabel  annabel stamped her foot her tone was hoarse with passion  oh you can act she cried you can look as innocent and shocked as you please i want to know who sent you those  she pointed with shaking fingers to a great bunch of dark red carnations thrust carelessly into a deep china bowl to which the card was still attached anna followed her finger and looked back into her sisters face  they were sent to me by mr nigel ennison annabel how on earth does it concern you  annabel laughed hardly  concern me she repeated fiercely you are not content then with stealing from me my name you would steal from me then the only man i ever cared a snap of the fingers about they are not your flowers they are mine they were sent to alcide not to you  anna rose to her feet at last she was roused her cheeks were flushed and her eyes bright  annabel she said you are my sister or i would bid you take the flowers if you care for them and leave the room but behind these things which you have said to me there must be others of which i know nothing you speak as one injuredas though i had been the one to take your nameas though you had been the one to make sacrifices in your heart you know very well that this is absurd it is you who took my name not i yours it is i who took the burden of your misdeeds upon my shoulders that you might become lady ferringhall it is i who am persecuted by the man who calls himself your husband  annabel shivered a little and looked around her  he does not come here she exclaimed quickly  he spends hours of every day on the pavement below anna answered calmly i have been bearing thisfor your sake shall i send him to sir john  annabel was white to the lips but her anger was not yet spent  it was your own fault she exclaimed he would never have found you out if you had not personated me  on the contrary anna whispered quietly we met in a small boardinghouse where i was stopping  you have not told me yet annabel said how it is that you have dared to personate me to call yourself alcide your hair your gestures your voice all mine oh how dared you do it  you must not forget anna said calmly that it is necessary for me alsoto live i arrived here with something less than five pounds in my pocket my reception at west kensington you know of i was the black sheep i was hurried out of the way you did not complain then that i personated youno nor when sir john came to me in paris and for your sake i lied  you did not  wait annabel when i arrived in london i went to live in the cheapest place i could find i set myself to find employment i offered myself as a clerk as a milliner as a shop girl i would even have taken a place as waitress in a tea shop i walked london till the soles of my shoes were worn through and my toes were blistered i ate only enough to keep body and soul together  there was no need for such heroism annabel said coldly you had only to ask  do you think anna interrupted with a note of passion trembling also in her tone that i would have taken alms from sir john the man to whom i had lied for your sake it was not possible i went at last when i had barely a shilling in my purse to a dramatic agent by chance i went to one who had known you in paris  well  he greeted me effusively he offered me at once an engagement i told him that i was not alcide he only laughed he had seen the announcement of your marriage in the papers and he imagined that i simply wanted to remain unknown because of your husbands puritanism i sang to him and he was satisfied i did not appear i have never announced myself as alcide it was the press who forced the identity upon me  they were my posters annabel said the ones cariolus did for me  the posters at least anna answered quietly i have some claim to you know very well that you took from my easel david courtlaws study of me and sent it to cariolus you denied it at the timebut unfortunately i have proof mr courtlaw found the study in cariolus studio  annabel laughed hardly  what did it matter she cried we are or rather we were so much alike then that the portrait of either of us would have done for the other it saved me the bother of being studied  it convinced mr earles that i was alcide anna remarked quietly  we will convince him now to the contrary annabel answered  anna looked at her startled  what do you mean she asked  annabel set her teeth hard and turned fiercely towards anna  it means that i have had enough of this slavery she declared my husband and all his friends are fools and the life they lead is impossible for me it takes too many years to climb even a step in the social ladder ive had enough of it i want my freedom  you mean to say anna said slowly that you are going to leave your husband  yes  you are willing to give up your position your beautiful houses your carriages and milliners accounts to come back to bohemianism  why not annabel declared i am sick of it it is dulldeadly dull  and what about this manmr montague hill  annabel put her hand suddenly to her throat and steadied herself with the back of a chair she looked stealthily at anna  you have succeeded a little too well in your personation she said bitterly to get rid very easily of mr montague hill you are a great deal more like what i was a few months ago than i am now  anna laughed softly  you propose then she remarked that i shall still be saddled with a pseudo husband i think not annabel you are welcome to proclaim yourself alcide if you will i would even make over my engagement to you if mr earles would permit but i should certainly want to be rid of mr montague hill and i do not think that under those circumstances i should be long about it  annabel sank suddenly into a chair her knees were trembling her whole frame was shaken with sobs  anna she moaned i am a jealous ungrateful woman but oh how weary i am i know if onlyanna tell me she broke off suddenly how did you get to know mr ennison  he spoke to me thinking that i was you anna answered i liked him and i never undeceived him  and he sat at my table annabel said bitterly and yet he did not know me  anna glanced up  you must remember she said that you yourself are responsible for your altered looks  for the others annabel said tearfully that is well enough but for him  something in her sisters tone startled anna she looked at her for a moment fixedly when she tried to speak she found it difficult her voice seemed to come from a long way off  what do you mean annabel you only knew mr ennison slightly  there was a dead silence in the little room anna sat with the face of a sphinxwaiting annabel thought and thought again  i knew mr ennison better than i have ever told you she said slowly  go on  you knowin paris they coupled my name with some onesan englishmans nigel ennison was he  anna stood up her cheeks were aflame her eyes were lit with smouldering passion  go on she commanded let me know the truth  annabel looked down it was hard to meet that gaze  does he never speak to you ofof old times she faltered  dont fence with me anna cried fiercely the truth  annabel bent over her and whispered in her sisters ear     chapter xxii  an old fool   lady ferringhall made room for him on the sofa by her side she was wearing a becoming teagown and it was quite certain that sir john would not be home for several hours at least  i am delighted to see you mr ennison she said letting her fingers rest in his do come and cheer me up i am bored to distraction  he took a seat by her side he was looking pale and ill there were shadows under his eyes he returned her impressive greeting almost mechanically  but you yourself she exclaimed glancing into his face you too look tired you poor man what have you been doing to yourself  nothing except travelling all night he answered i am just back from paris i am bothered i have come to you for sympathy perhaps for help  you may be sure of the one she murmured the other too if it is within my power  it is within yoursif anybodys he answered it is about your sister lady ferringhall  annabel gave a little gasp the colour slowly left her cheeks the lines of her mouth hardened the change in her face was not a pleasant one  about my sister she repeated slowly  her tone should have warned him but he was too much in earnest to regard it  yes you remember that you saw us at the savoy a few evenings ago  yes  and you knew of course that we were old friends  indeed  lady ferringhall i love your sister  you what she repeated incredulously  i love your sister  lady ferringhall sat with half closed eyes and clenched teeth brute fool to have come to her on such an errand she felt a hysterical desire to strike him to burst out crying to blurt out the whole miserable truth the effort to maintain her selfcontrol was almost superhuman  butyour people she gasped surely lady ennison would object even if it were possible and the duke tooi heard him say that a married secretary would be worse than useless to him  the difficulties on my own side i can deal with he answered i am not dependent upon any one i have plenty of money and the duke will not be in the next cabinet my trouble is with your sister  lady ferringhall was conscious of some relief  she has refused to listen to you  she has behaved in a most extraordinary manner he answered we partedthat night the best of friends she knew that i cared for her she had admitted that she cared for me i suppose i was a little idiotici dont think we either of us mentioned the future but it was arranged that i should go the next afternoon and have tea with her when i went i was refused admittance i have since received a most extraordinary letter from her she offers me no explanation permits me absolutely no hope she simply refuses to see or hear from me again i went to the theatre that night i waited for her at the back she saw me and lady ferringhall i shall never forget her look as long as i live it was horrible she looked at me as though i were some unclean thing as though my soul were weighted with every sin in the calendar i could not have spoken to her it took my breath away by the time i had recovered myself she had gone my letters are returned unopened her maid will not even allow me across the doorstep  the explanation seems to me to be reasonably simple annabel said coldly you seem to forget that my sister ismarried  if she is he answered i am convinced that there are circumstances in connexion with that marriage which would make a divorce easy  you would marry a divorcée she asked  i would marry your sister anyhow under any circumstances he answered  she looked at him curiously  i want to ask you a question she said abruptly this wonderful affection of yours for my sister does it date from your first meeting with her in paris  he hesitated  i admired your sister in paris he answered but i do not believe that i regard her now as altogether the same person something has happened to change her marvellously either that or she wilfully deceived me and every one else in those days as to her real self she was a much lighter and more frivolous person very charming and companionablebut with a differencea great difference i wonder whether you would mind lady ferringhall he went on with a sudden glance at her if i tell you that you yourself remind me a great deal more of what she was like then except of course that your complexion and colouring are altogether different  i am highly flattered she remarked with subtle irony  will you help me he asked  what can i do  go and see her find out what i have done or failed to do get me an interview with her  really she said with a hard little laugh you must regard me as a very goodnatured person  you are he answered unconsciously i am sure that you are i want her to tell me the whole truth about this extraordinary marriage we will find some way out of it  you think that you can do that  i am sure of it he answered confidently those things are arranged more easily in any other country than england at any rate she must see me i demand it as a right i must know what new thing has come between us that she should treat me as a lover one day and a monster the next  she leaned back amongst the cushions of her chair she was very pale but she reminded him more at that minute than at any time of alcide as he had first known her  i wonder she said how much you care  i care as a man cares only once in his life he answered promptly when it comes there is no mistaking it  did it comein paris  i do not know he answered i do not think so what does it matter it is here and it is here to stay do help me lady ferringhall you need not be afraid no trouble will ever come to your sister through me if this idiotic marriage is binding then i will be her friend but i have powerful friends i only want to know the truth and i will move heaven and earth to have it set aside  the truth she murmured with her eyes fixed upon him well  she stopped short he looked at her in some embarrassment  forgive me he said but i want to hear it from your sister it is her duty to tell me and i would not have her think that i had been trying to work upon your sympathies to learn her secrets  she was silent  you will go and see her he begged  yes i will go she promised with a queer little smile it is against my husbands orders and i am not sure that my sister will be particularly glad to see me but i will go  i shall always be grateful to you he declared  dont be too sure of that she answered enigmatically     chapter xxiii  montague hill sees light at last   at exactly ten minutes past ten annabel rang the bell of her sisters flat there was no response she rang again with the same result then as she was in the act of turning reluctantly away she noticed a thin crack between the door and the frame she pushed the former and it opened the latch had not fully caught  the flat was apparently empty annabel turned on the electric light and made her way into the sittingroom there was a coffee equipage on the table and some sandwiches and the fire had been recently made up annabel seated herself in an easy chair and determined to wait for her sisters return  the clock struck halfpast ten the loneliness of the place somewhat depressed her she took up a book and threw it down again then she examined with curiosity some knickknacks upon a small round table by her side amongst them was a revolver she handled it half fearfully and set it carefully down again then for the first time she was conscious of an unaccountable and terrifying sensation she felt that she was not alone  she was only a few yards from the door but lacked the courage to rise and fly her knees shook her breath came fast she almost felt the lurid effect of those tiny patches of rouge upon her pallorstricken cheeks her eyes were dilatedfixed in a horrified stare at the parting in the curtains which hung before the window  there was some one there she had seen a mans head steal out for a moment and draw the curtains a little closer even now she could trace the outline of his shape behind the lefthand curtain she was wholly unable to conceal her knowledge of his presence a little smothered cry broke from her lipsthe curtains were thrown aside and a man stepped out she was powerless to move from her chair all through that brief but measureless space of time during which wonder kept him silent as fear did her she cowered there a limp helpless object her courage and her presence of mind had alike deserted her she could neither speak nor move nor cry out  annabel god in heaven it is annabel  she did not speak her lips parted but no words came  what have you done to yourself he muttered you have dyed your hair and darkened your eyebrows but you are annabel i should know youin heaven or hell who is the other  what other  her voice seemed to come from a long way off her lips were dry and cracked  the annabel who lives here who sings every night at the unusual they call her by your old name her hair and voice and figure are as yours used to be who is she i say  my sister annabel faltered  he trembled violently he seemed to be labouring under some great excitement  i am a fool he said all these days i have taken her for you i have pleaded with herno wonder that i have pleaded with her in vain and all this time perhaps you have been waiting expecting to hear from me is it so annabel  i did not know she faltered anything about you why should i  at last he murmured at last i have found you i must not let you go again do you know annabel that you are my wife  no she moaned not that i thoughtthe papers said  you thought that i was dead he interrupted you pushed the wheel from my hand you jumped and i think that you left me yet you knew that i was not dead you came to see me in the hospital you must have repented a little or you would not have done that  i did not come she faltered it was my sister anna i had left paris  he passed his hand wearily over his forehead  that is where i got confused he said i opened my eyes and she was bending over my bedside then i thought she has repented all will be well so i made haste and recovered i came to london to look for you and somehow the figure i saw in my dreams had got mixed up with you your sister great god how like she is to what you were  annabel looked around her nervously  these are her rooms she said soon she will return  the sooner the better he answered i must explain to her annabel i cannot believe it i have found you  his eyes were burning he advanced a step towards her she held out both her hands  no no she cried you frighten me  he smiled at her indulgently  but i am your husband he said you have forgotten i am your husband though as yet your hand has scarcely lain in mine  it was a mistake she faltered you told me that your name was meysey hill i thought that you were he  his face darkened  i did it for love of you he said i lied as i would have committed a murder or done any evil deed sooner than lose you what does it matter i am not a pauper annabel i can keep you you shall have a house out at balham or sydenham and two servants you shall have the spending of every penny of my money annabel tell me that you did not wish me dead tell me that you are not sorry to see me again  her passion conquered for a moment her fear  but i am sorry she exclaimed our marriage must be annulled it was no marriage at all  never he exclaimed vehemently you are mine annabel and nothing shall ever make me give you up  but it is too late she declared you have no right to hold me to a bargain which on your side was a lie i consented to become mrs meysey hillnever your wife  what do you meanby too late he demanded  there is some one else whom i care for  he laughed hardly  tell me his name he said and i promise that he shall never trouble you but you he continued moving imperceptibility a little nearer to her you are mine the angels in heaven shall not tear you from me we leave this room together i shall not part with you again  no she cried i will not i will have nothing to do with you you are not my husband  he came towards her with that in his face which filled her with blind terror  you belong to me he said fiercely the marriage certificate is in my pocket you belong to me and i have waited long enough  he stepped past her to the door and closed it then he turned with a fierce movement to take her into his arms there was a flash and a loud report he threw up his hand reeled for a moment on his feet and collapsed upon the floor  annabel he moaned you have killed me my wifekilled me  with a little crash the pistol fell from her shaking fingers she stood looking down upon him with dilated eyes her faculties seemed for a moment numbed she could not realize what she saw surely it was a dream a moment before he had been a strong man she had been in his power a poor helpless thing now he lay there a doubledup mass with ugly distorted features and a dark wet stain dripping slowly on to the carpet it could not be she who had done this she had never let off a pistol in her life yet the smoke was curling upwards in a faint innocentlooking cloud to the ceiling the smell of gunpowder was strong in the room  it was true she had killed him it was as much accident as anything but she had killed him once beforebut that had been different this time they would call it murder  she listened listened intently for several minutes people were passing in the street below she could hear their footsteps upon the pavement a hansom stopped a little way off she could hear the bell tinkle as the horse shook its head there was no one stirring in the flats he himself had deadened the sound by closing the door she moved a little nearer to him  it was horrible but she must do it she sank upon her knees and unbuttoned his coat it was there in the breast pocket stiff and legal looking she drew it out with shaking fingers there was a great splash of blood upon it her hand was all wet and sticky a deadly sickness came over her the room seemed spinning round she staggered to the fireplace and thrust it into the heart of the dying flames she held it down with the poker looking nervously over her shoulder then she put more coal on piled it over the ashes and stood once more upright  still silence everywhere she pulled down her veil and made her way to the door she turned out the electric light and gained the hall still no sound her knees almost sank beneath her as she raised the latch of the front door and looked out there was no one to be seen she passed down the stairs and into the street  she walked for a mile or more recklessly close veiled with swift level footsteps though her brain was in a whirl and a horrible faintness all the time hovered about her then she called a hansom and drove home                                       miss pellissier brendon said gently i am afraid that some fresh trouble has come to you  she smiled at him cheerfully  am i dull she said i am sorry  you could never be that he answered but you are at least more serious than usual  perhaps she said i am superstitious this is my last week at the unusual you know we begin rehearsing on monday at the garrick  surely he protested the change is all in favour of your own inclinations it is your own choice isnt it  she nodded  yes but i believe that mr earles thinks i am a little mad and between ourselves i am not sure about it myself it is easy enough to sing these little chansons in an original wayit requires a very different sort of ability to succeed on the stage  you have it he declared confidently  she laughed altogether in her old manner  i wonder how it is she exclaimed that my friends have so much more confidence in me than i have in myself  they know you better he declared  i am afraid she answered that ones friends can judge only of the externals and the things which matter the things inside are realized only by oneselfstop  she laid her fingers upon his arm and they both stood still they had turned into the street on the opposite side of which were the flats where anna lived glancing idly up at her own window as they had swung round the corner she had seen a strange thing the curtains which she had left drawn were open and the electric lights were turned on then even as they stood there the room was plunged into darkness  there is someone in my rooms anna said  is it your maid he asked  i have given her two days holiday anna answered she has gone down into the country  and no one elsehas a key  i believe she said that that man must have one i am safe while i am there for i have had bolts fitted everywhere and a pane of glass in the front door but i am always afraid that he may get in while i am away look is that some one coming out  the front door of the flats stood open and through it a woman slim and veiled passed on to the pavement and turned with swift footsteps in the opposite direction anna watched her with curious eyes  is it any one you know brendon asked  i am not sure anna answered but of course she may have come from one of the other flats  perhaps he said you had better let me have your key and i will go up and explore  we will go together she answered  they crossed the street and entering the front door passed up the outside stone steps of the flat anna herself opened the hall door they stood for a moment in the passage and listened silence then anna clutched her companions arm  what was that she asked sharply  he had heard nothing they both listened intently again silence  i thought that i heard a groan anna whispered  he laughed reassuringly  i heard nothing he declared and my ears are good come  he threw open the door of the sittingroom and switched on the electric light  there is nogood god he exclaimed  he turned round to keep anna out by force if possible but he was too late she was by his side she too had seen the thin stream of blood on which her eyes were fastened with a nameless horror reached almost to her feet     chapter xxiv  a case for the police   after that first horrible moment it was perhaps anna who was the more selfpossessed she dropped on her knees by his side and gently unbuttoned his waistcoat then she looked up at brendon  you must fetch a doctor she said i do not think that he is quite dead  and leave you here alone he asked in a hoarse whisper come with me  i am not afraid she answered please hurry  he reeled out of the room anna was afterwards astonished at her own selfpossession she bound a scarf tightly round the place where the blood seemed to be coming from then she stood up and looked around the room  there were no evidences of any struggle no overturned chairs or disarranged furniture the grate was full of fluttering ashes of burnt paper and the easy chair near the fire had evidently been used on the floor was a handkerchief a little morsel of lace anna saw it and for the first time found herself trembling  she moved towards it slowly and picked it up holding it out in front of her whilst the familiar perfume seemed to assert itself with damning insistence it was annabels the lace was family lace easily recognizable the perfume was the only one she ever used annabel had been here then it was she who had come out from the flat only a few minutes before it was she  annas nerves were not easily shaken but she found herself suddenly clutching at the table for support the room was reeling or was it that she was going to faint she recovered herself with a supreme effort there were the burnt papers still in the grate she took up the poker and stirred the fire vigorously almost at the same moment the door opened and brendon entered followed by the doctor  anna turned round with a start which was almost of guilt the poker still in her hand she met the keen grey eyes of a cleanshaven man between forty and fifty quietly dressed in professional attire before he even glanced at the man on the floor he stepped over to her side and took the poker from her  forgive me madam he said stiffly but in such a case as this it is better that nothing in the room should be disturbed until the arrival of the police you have been burning paper i see  are you a detective or a doctor she asked calmly do you need me to remind you that your patient is bleeding to death  he dropped on his knees by the mans side and made a hurried examination  who tied this scarf here he asked looking up  i did anna answered i hope that it has not done any harm  he would have been dead before now without it the doctor answered shortly get me some brandy and my bag  it was nearly half an hour before they dared ask him the question  will he live  the doctor shook his head  it is very doubtful he said you must send for the police at once you know you sir he added turning to brendon had better take my card round to the police station in werner street and ask that detective dorling be sent round here at once on urgent business  is it necessary to send for the police anna asked  absolutely the doctor answered and the sooner the better this is a case either of suicide or murder the police are concerned in it in either event  please go then mr brendon anna said you will come back wont you  he nodded cheerfully  of course i will he answered  the doctor and anna were left alone every moment or two he bent over his patient he seemed to avoid meeting annas eyes as much as possible  does he live here he asked her presently  no  far away  i have no idea anna answered  who is the tenant of these rooms he inquired  i am  you will have no objection to his remaining here he asked a move of any sort would certainly be fatal  of course not anna said had he better have a nurse i will be responsible for anything of that sort  if he lives through the next hour the doctor answered i will send some one do you know anything of his friends is there any one for whom we ought to send  i know very little of him beyond his name anna answered i know nothing whatever of his friends or his home he used to live in a boardinghouse in russell square that is where i first knew him  the doctor looked at her thoughtfully perhaps for the first time he realized that anna was by no means an ordinary person his patient was distinctly of a different order of life it was possible that his first impressions had not been correct  your name i believe is  pellissier anna answered  allow me the doctor said to give you a word of advice miss pellissier a detective will be here in a few moments to make inquiries into this affair you may have something to conceal you may not tell the whole truth it always comes out sooner or later dont try to shield anybody or hide anything it is bad policy  anna smiled very faintly  i thank you for your advice she said i can assure you that it was quite unnecessary i know less about this affair perhaps than you suppose what i do know i shall have no hesitation in telling anyone who has the right to ask  just so the doctor remarked drily and if i were you i would keep away from the fire  brendon reappeared followed by a tall thin man with a stubbly brown moustache and restless grey eyes the doctor nodded to him curtly  good evening dorling he said before you do anything else i should advise you to secure those charred fragments of paper from the grate i know nothing about this affair but some one has been burning documents  the detective went down on his hands and knees with delicate touch he rescued all that was possible of them and made a careful little parcel then he stepped briskly to his feet and bent over the wounded man  shot through the lungs he remarked  the doctor nodded  bad hemorrhage he said i am going to fetch some things that will be wanted if he pulls through the next hour i found him lying like this the bleeding partly stopped by this scarf else he had been dead by now  the doctor glanced towards anna considering his convictions he felt that his remark was a generous one annas face however was wholly impassive  he took up his hat and went the detective rapidly sketched the appearance of the room in his notebook and picked up the pistol from under the table then he turned to anna  can you give me any information as to this affair he asked  i will tell you all that i know anna said my name is anna pellissier sometimes called annabel i am engaged to sing every evening at the unusual music hall this mans name is montague hill i saw him first a few months ago at mrs whites boardinghouse in russell square he subjected me there to great annoyance by claiming me as his wife as a matter of fact i had never spoken to him before in my life since then he has persistently annoyed me i have suspected him of possessing a skeleton key to my apartments tonight i locked up my flat at six oclock it was then i am sure empty i dined with a friend and went to the unusual at a quarter past eleven i returned here with this gentleman mr brendon as we turned the corner of the street i noticed that the electric light was burning in this room we stopped for a moment to watch it and almost immediately it was turned out we came on here at once i found the door locked as usual but when we entered this room everything was as you see nothing has been touched since  the detective nodded  a very clear statement madam he said from what you saw from the opposite pavement then it is certain that some person who was able to move about was in this room only a minute or so before you entered it  that is so anna answered  you met no one upon the stairs or saw no one leave the flats  no one anna answered firmly  then either this man shot himself or some one else shot him immediately before your arrivalor rather if it was not himself the person who did it was in the room say two minutes before you arrived  that is so anna admitted  i will not trouble you with any questions about the other occupants of the flats mr dorling said i shall have to go through the building you say that this gentleman was with you  i was brendon answered most providentially  you did not notice anything which may have escaped this lady you saw no one leave the flats  no one brendon answered  you heard no pistolshot  none  the detective turned again to anna  you know of no one likely to have had a grudge against this man he asked  no  there is no one else who has a key to your rooms  no one except my maid who is away in wiltshire  the inference is then the detective said smoothly that this man obtained admission to your rooms by means of a false key that he burnt some papers here and shot himself within a few moments of your return either that or some other person also obtained admission here and shot him and that person is either still upon the premises or escaped without your notice  i suppose anna said that those are reasonable deductions  the detective thrust his notebook into his pocket  i brought a man with me who is posted outside he remarked with your permission i should like to search the remainder of your rooms  anna showed him the way  have either of you been out of this room since you discovered what had happened he asked  mr brendon went for the doctor anna answered i have not left this apartment myself  nothing unusual was discovered in any other part of the flat while they were still engaged in looking round the doctor returned with a nurse and assistant  with your permission he said to anna i shall arrange a bed for him where he is there is scarcely one chance in a dozen of saving his life there would be none at all if he were moved  you can make any arrangements you like anna declared i shall leave the flat to you and go to a hotel  you would perhaps be so good as to allow one of my men to accompany you and see you settled mr dorling said deferentially in the event of his death we should require you at once to attend at the inquest  i am going to pack my bag anna answered in five minutes i shall be ready     chapter xxv  the steel edge of the truth   the manservant with his plain black clothes and black tie had entered the room with a deferential little gesture  you will pardon me sir he said in a subdued tone but i think that you have forgotten to look at your engagement book there is lady arlingfords reception tonight ten till twelve and the hatton house ball marked with a cross sir important i put your clothes out an hour ago  nigel ennison looked up with a little start  all right dunster he said i may go to hatton house later but you neednt wait i can get into my clothes  the man hesitated  can i bring you anything sira whisky and soda or a liqueur youll excuse me sir but you havent touched your coffee  bring me a whisky and soda and a box of cigarettes ennison answered and then leave me alone theres a good fellow im a little tired  the man obeyed his orders noiselessly and then left the room  ennison roused himself with an effort took a long drink from his whisky and soda and lit a cigarette  what a fool i am he muttered standing up on the hearthrug and leaning his elbows upon the broad mantelpiece and yet i wonder whether the world ever held such another enigma in her sex paris looms behinda tragedy of strange recollectionshere she emerges phoenixlike subtly developed a flawless woman beautiful selfreliant witty a woman with the strange gift of making all others beside her seem plain or vulgar and thenthis sudden thrust god only knows what i have done or left undone something unpardonable is laid to my charge only last night she saw me and there was horror in her eyes i have written calledof what avail is anythingagainst that look what the devil is the matter dunster  i beg your pardon sir the man answered there is a lady here to see you  ennison turned round sharply  a lady dunster who is it  the man came a little further into the room  lady ferringhall sir  lady ferringhallalone ennison exclaimed  quite alone sir  ennison was dismayed  for heavens sake dunster dont let her out of the carriage or hansom or whatever she came in say im out away anything  i am sorry sir the man answered but she had sent away her hansom before i answered the bell she is in the hall now i  the door was thrown open annabel entered  forgive my coming in she said to ennison i heard your voices and the hall is draughty what is the matter with you  dunster had withdrawn discreetly ennisons manner was certainly not one of a willing host  i cannot pretend that i am glad to see you lady ferringhall he said quietly for your own sake let me beg of you not to stay for a moment dunster shall fetch you a cab i  she threw herself into an easy chair she was unusually pale and her eyes were brilliant never had she seemed to him so much like anna  you neednt be worried she said quietly the conventions do not matter one little bit you will agree with me when you have heard what i have to say for me that is all over and done with  lady ferringhall anna he exclaimed  she fixed her brilliant eyes upon him  suppose you call me by my proper name she said quietly call me annabel  he started back as though he had been shot  annabel he exclaimed that is your sisters name  no mine  it came upon him like a flash innumerable little puzzles were instantly solved he could only wonder that this amazing thing had remained so long a secret to him he remembered little whispered speeches of hers so like the annabel of paris so unlike the woman he loved a hundred little things should have told him long ago nevertheless it was overwhelming  but your hair he gasped  dyed  and your figure  ones corsetière arranges that my friend i am only grieved that you of all others should have been so deceived i have seen you with anna and i have not known whether to be glad or sorry i have been in torment all the while to know whether it was to anna or to annabel that you were making love so charmingly nigel do you know that i have been very jealous  he avoided the invitation of her eyes he was indeed still in the throes of his bewilderment  but sir john he exclaimed what made you marry him what made you leave paris without a word to any one what made you and your sister exchange identities  there is one answer to all those questions nigel she said with a nervous little shudder it is a hateful story come close to me and let me hold your hand dear i am a little afraid  there was a strange look in her face the look of a frightened child ennison seemed to feel already the shadow of tragedy approaching he stood by her side and he suffered her hands to rest in his  you remember the man in paris who used to follow me aboutmeysey hill they called him  he nodded  miserable bounder he murmured turned out to be an impostor too  he imposed on me annabel continued i believed that he was the great multimillionaire he worried me to marry him i let him take me to the english embassy and we went through some sort of a ceremony i thought it would be magnificent to have a great house in paris and more money than any other woman afterwards we started for déjeuner in a motor on the way he confessed he was not meysey hill but an englishman of business and he had only a small income every one took him for the millionaire and he had lost his head about me iwell i lost my temper i struck him across the face twisted the steering wheel of the motor sprang out myself and left him for dead on the road with the motor on top of him this is the first act  served the beast right ennison declared i think i can tell you something which may be very good news for you presently but go on  act two she continued enter sir john very honest very much in love with me i thought that hill was dead but i was frightened and i wanted to get away from paris sir john heard gossip about usabout anna the recluse a paragon of virtue and annabel alias alcide a dancer at the cafés chantants and concerning whom there were many stories which were false and a fewwhich were true iwell i borrowed annas name i made her my unwilling confederate sir john followed me to london and married me to this day he and every one else thinks that he married anna  act three anna comes to london she is poor and she will take nothing from my husband the man she had deceived for my sake and he on his part gravely disapproves of her as alcide she tries every way of earning a living and fails then she goes to a dramatic agent curiously enough nothing will persuade him that she is not alcide he believes that she denies it simply because owing to my marriage with sir john whom they call the puritan knight she wants to keep her identity secret he forces an engagement upon her she never calls herself alcide it is the press who find her out she is the image of what i was like and she has a better voice then enter mr hill againalive he meets anna and claims her as his wife it is anna again who stands between me and ruin  i cannot let you go on ennison interrupted i believe that i can give you great news tell me where the fellow hill took you for this marriage ceremony  it was behind the place de vendome on the other side from the ritz  i knew it ennison exclaimed cheer up annabel you were never married at all that place was closed by the police last month it was a bogus affair altogether kept by some blackguard or other of an englishman everything was done in the most legal and imposing way but the whole thing was a fraud  then i was never married to him at all annabel said  neverbut by jove you had a narrow escape ennison exclaimed annabel i begin to see why you are here think had you not better hurry back before sir john discovers you are his wife right enough you can tell me the rest another time  she smiled faintly  the rest she said holding tightly to his hands is the most important of all you came to me you wished me to speak to anna i went to her rooms tonight there was no one at home and i was coming away when i saw that the door was open i decided to go in and wait in her sittingroom i found montague hill he had gained admission somehow and he too was waiting for anna buthe was cleverer than any of you he knew me nigel at last he cried i have found you he would listen to nothing he swore that i was his wife andi shot him nigel as his arms were closing around me shot him do you hear  good god he exclaimed looking at her curiously is this true annabel is he dead  she nodded  i shot him i saw the blood come as he rolled over i tore the marriage certificate from his pocket and burnt it and then i came here  you camehere he repeated vaguely  nigel nigel she cried dont you understand it is i whom you cared for in paris not anna she is a stranger to you you cannot care for her think of those days in paris do you remember when we went right away nigel and forgot everything we went down the river past veraz and the larks were singing all over those deep brown fields and the river further on wound its way like a coil of silver across the rich meadowland and along the hillside vineyards oh the scent of the flowers that day the delicious quiet the swallows that dived before us in the river nigel you have not forgotten it was the first day you kissed me under the willows coming into veraz nigel you have not forgotten  no he said with a little bitter smile i have never forgotten  she suddenly caught hold of his shoulders and drew him down towards her  nigel dont you understand i must leave england tonight i must go somewhere into hiding a long long way off i killed him nigel they will say that it was murder but if only you will come i do not care  he shook her hands off almost roughly he stood away from her she listened with dumb fear in her eyes  listen annabel he said hoarsely we played at lovemaking in paris it was very pretty and very dainty while it lasted but we played it with our eyes open and we perfectly understood the gameboth of us other things came we went our ways there was no broken faithnot even any question of anything of the sort i met you here as lady ferringhall we have played at a little mild lovemaking again it has been only the sort of nonsense which passes lightly enough between half the men and women in london you shall know the truth i do not love you i have never loved you i call myself a man of the world a man of many experiences but i never knew what love meantuntil i met your sister  you loveanna she exclaimed  i do he answered i always shall now if you are ready to go with me i too am ready we will go to ostend by the early morning boat and choose a hiding place from there i will marry you when sir john gets his divorce and i will do all i can to keep you out of harm but you had better know the truth to start with i will do all this not because i love you butbecause you are annas sister  annabel rose to her feet  you are magnificent she said but the steel of your truth is a little oversharpened it cuts will you let your servant call me a hansom she continued opening the door before he could reach her side i had no idea that it was so abominably late  he scarcely saw her face again she pulled her veil down and he knew that silence was best  where to he asked as the hansom drove up  home of course she answered eight cavendish square     chapter xxvi  annabel is warned   you  david courtlaw crossed the floor of the dingy little sittingroom with outstretched hands  you cannot say that you did not expect me he answered i got sydneys telegram at ten oclock and caught the tenthirty from the gare du nord  it is very nice of you anna said softly  rubbish he answered i could not have stayed in paris and waited for news tell me exactly what has happened even now i do not understand is this man hill dead  she shook her head  he was alive at four oclock this afternoon she answered but the doctors give little hope of his recovery  what is there to be feared he asked her quietly  she hesitated  you are my friend she said if any one is i think that i will tell you the man hill has persecuted me for monthsever since i have been in england he claimed me for his wife and showed to every one a marriage certificate he shot at me at the unusual and the magistrates bound him over to keep the peace i found him once in my rooms and i believe that he had a key to my front door last night mr brendon and i returned from the unusual and found him lying in my room shot through the lungs in the grate were some charred fragments of a marriage certificate we fetched the doctor and the police from the first i could see that neither believed my story i am suspected of having shot the man  but that is ridiculous he exclaimed  she laughed a little bitterly  i am under police surveillance she said so is mr brendon  but there is not a shadow of evidence against you he objected the man alone could supply any and if he recovers sufficiently to say anything what he would say would exonerate you  yes  there was a moments silence annas face was half turned from him but her expression and the tone of her monosyllable puzzled him he stepped quickly towards her her eyes seemed to be looking backwards she distinctly shivered as he forced her to look at him he was bewildered  anna he exclaimed hoarsely look at me what is it good god  an unhappy little smile parted her lips she clenched her hands together and leaned forward in her chair gazing steadily into the fire  i think she said that i will tell you everything i must tell somebodyand you would understand  i am your friend he said slowly whatever you may have to tell me you can trust me anna you know that i will be as silent as the grave  not long ago she said you left me in anger partly because of this exchange of identities between annabel and myself you said that it would bring trouble it has  yes  annabels real reason for wishing to leave paris the real reason she married sir john ferringhall was because of a very foolish thing which she did it wasin connection with this man hill he personated over there a millionaire named meysey hill and it seems that he induced annabel to go through some sort of marriage with him at the embassy  where courtlaw asked quickly  in paris  courtlaw seemed about to say something he changed his mind however and simply motioned to her to proceed  then there was a motor accident only an hour or so after this ceremony and hill was reported to be killed annabel believed it came to england and married sir john now you can understand why i have been obliged to  yes yes i understand that courtlaw interrupted but about last night  annabel knew where i lived anna continued slowly she has been to my flat before i saw her come out from the flat buildings two minutes before we entered it last night i picked up her handkerchief on the floor  you meanyou think  hush i think that he was concealed in my room and annabel and he met there what passed between them i cannot thinki dare not the pistol was his own it is true but it was one which was taken from him when he forced his way in upon me before now you can understand why every minute is a torture to me it is not for myself i fear but if he speaksi fear what he may tell  you have been to her he asked  i dare not she answered  i will go he said she must be warned she had better escape if she can  anna shook her head  she will take her risk she answered i am sure of it if he recovers he may not accuse her if he dies she is safe  he paced the room for a minute or two restlessly  there are some people he said at last who seem fated to carry on their shoulders the burdens of other people you anna are one of them i know in paris you pinched and scraped that your sister might have the dresses and entertainments she desired you fell in at once with her quixotic and damnable scheme of foisting her reputation and her follies upon your shoulders whilst she marries a rich man and commences all over again a life of selfish pleasure you on the other hand have to come to london a worker with the responsibility of life upon your own shouldersand in addition all the burden of her follies  you forget she said looking up at him with a faint smile that under the cloak of her name i am earning more money a week than i could ever have earned in a year by my own labours  it is an accident he answered besides it is not so you sing better than annabel ever did you have even a better style alcide or no alcide there is not a music hall manager in london or paris who would not give you an engagement on your own merits  perhaps not she answered and yet in a very few weeks i shall have done with it all do you think that i shall ever make an actress my friend  i doubt it he answered bluntly you have not feeling enough  she smiled at him  it is like old times she said to hear these home truths all the same i dont admit it  he shook his head  to be an actress he said you require a special and peculiar temperament i do not believe that there has ever lived a really great actress whose moral character from the ordinary point of view would bear inspection  then i she said have too much character  too much character and too little sentiment he answered too much sensibility and too cold a heart too easily roused emotions and too little passion how could you draw the curtain aside which hides the great and holy places of lifeyou who have never loved  you have become french to the core she murmured you would believe that life is kindled by the passions alone  there was silence between them then a servant girl brought in a telegram anna tore it open and passed it to courtlaw it was from brendon      hill gradually recovering consciousness doctor says depositions     tonight recovery impossiblebrendon  he looked at her gravely  i think he said that some one ought to warn her  it is number 8 cavendish square she answered simply                                       courtlaw found himself ushered without questions into annabels long low drawingroom fragrant with flowers and somewhat to his surprise crowded with guests from the further end of the apartment came the low music of a violin servants were passing backwards and forwards with tea and chocolate for a moment he did not recognize annabel then she came a few steps to meet him  mr courtlaw is it not she remarked with lifted eyebrows really it is very kind of you to have found me out  he was bereft of words for a moment and in that moment she escaped having passed him on deftly to one of the later arrivals  lady mackinnor she said i am sure that you must have heard of mr david courtlaw permit me to make him known to youmr courtlawlady mackinnor  with a murmured word of excuse she glided away and courtlaw who had come with a mission which seemed to him to be one of life or death was left to listen to the latest art jargon from chelsea he bore it as long as he could watching all the time with fascinated eyes annabel moving gracefully about amongst her guests always gay with a smile and a whisper for nearly everybody grudgingly he admired her to him she had always appeared as a mere pleasureloving parasitesomething quite insignificant he had pictured her if indeed she had ever had the courage to do this thing as sitting alone convulsed with guilty fear starting at her own shadow a slave to constant terror and instead he found her playing the great lady and playing it well she knew or guessed his mission too for more than once their eyes met and she laughed mockingly at him at last he could bear it no longer he left his companion in the midst of a glowing eulogy of bastien leparge and boldly intercepted his hostess as she moved from one group to join another  can you spare me a moment he asked i have a message from your sister  are you in a hurry she asked carelessly a lot of these people will be going presently  my message is urgent he said firmly if you cannot listen to me now it must remain undelivered  she shrugged her shoulders and led him towards a small recess so you come from anna do you she remarked well what is it  montague hill is recovering consciousness he said he will probably make a statement tonight  that sounds very interesting she answered coolly perhaps i should better be able to understand its significance if you would explain to me who mr montague hill is  your husband he answered bluntly  she did not wince she laughed a little contemptuously  you and anna she said seem to have stumbled upon a mares nest if that is my sisters message pray return to her and say that the doings and sayings of mr montague hill do not interest me in the least  dont be foolish he said sharply you were seen to leave the flat and your handkerchief was found there very likely by this time the whole truth is known  she smiled at him an understanding smile but her words defied him  what a beautiful mares nest she exclaimed i can see you and anna groaning and nodding your grave heads together bah she does not know me very well and younot at all do have some tea wont you if you must go then  courtlaw was dismissed as he passed out he saw in the hall a quietly dressed man with keen grey eyes talking to one of the footmen he shivered and looked behind as he stepped into his hansom had it come already     chapter xxvii  john ferringham gentleman   confess my dear husband annabel said lightly that you are bewildered  sir john smiled  my dear anna he answered to tell you the truth it has seemed just lately as though we were becoming in some measure estranged you certainly have not shown much desire for my society have you  you have been wrapped up in your politics she murmured  he shook his head  there have been other times he said a little sadly  her little white hand stole across the table there was a look in her eyes which puzzled him  i have been very selfish she declared but you must forgive me john  i would forgive you a great deal more he answered readily for the sake of an evening like this you have actually given up a dinnerparty to dine alone with me  and made you give up a political meeting she reminded him  quite an unimportant one he assured her i would have given up anything to see you your old self againas you are this evening  i am afraid i have not been very nice she said sadly never mind you must think of this evening john sometimesas a sort of atonement  i hope he answered looking at her in some surprise that we shall have many more such to think about  they were lingering over their dessert the servants had left the room annabel half filled her glass with wine and taking a little folded packet from her plate shook the contents into it  i am developing ailments she said meeting his questioning eyes it is nothing of any importance john i have something to say to you  if you want to ask a favour he remarked smiling you have made it almost impossible for me to refuse you anything  i am going to ask more than a favour she said slowly i am going to ask for your forgiveness  he was a little uneasy  i do not know what you mean he said but if you are referring to any little coolness since our marriage let us never speak of it again i am something of an old fogey anna im afraid but if you treat me like this you will teach me to forget it  annabel looked intently into her glass  john she said i am afraid that i am going to make you unhappy i am very very sorry but you must listen to me  he relapsed into a stony silence a few feet away across the low vases of pink and white roses sat annabel more beautiful tonight perhaps than ever before in her life she wore a wonderful dress of turquoise blue made by a great dressmaker for a function which she knew very well now that she would never attend her hair once more was arranged with its old simplicity there was a new softness in her eyes a hesitation a timidity about her manner which was almost pathetic  you remember our first meeting  yes he answered hoarsely i remember it very well indeed you have the look in your eyes tonight which you had that day the look of a frightened child  she looked into her glass  i was frightened then she declared i am frightened now but it is all very different there was hope for me then now there is none no none at all  you talk strangely anna he said go on  people talked to you in paris about us she continued about anna the virtuous and annabel the rake you were accused of having been seen with the latter you denied it remembering that i had called myself anna you went even to our rooms and saw my sister anna lied to you i lied to you i was annabel the rake alcide of the music halls my name is annabel not anna do you understand  i do not he answered how could i when your sister sings now at the unusual every night and the name alcide flaunts from every placard in london  the likeness between us she said before i began to disfigure myself with rouge and illdressed hair was remarkable anna failed in her painting our money was gone and she was forced to earn her own living she came to london and tried several things without any success  but why  sir john stopped short with a moment of inward shame he remembered his deportment towards anna it was scarcely likely that she would have accepted his aid some one had once in his hearing called him a prig he remembered it suddenly he thought of his severe attitude towards the girl who was rightly and with contempt refusing his measured help he looked across at annabel and he groaned this was his humiliation as well as hers  anna of course would not accept any money from us she continued she tried everything and last of all she tried the stage she went to a dramatic agent and he turned out to be the one who had heard me sing in paris he refused to believe that anna was not alcide he thought she wished to conceal her identity because of the connexion with you and he offered her an engagement at once she was never announced as alcide but directly she walked on she simply became alcide to every one she had a better voice than i and the rest i suppose is only a trick the real alcide she wound up with a faint smile across the table at him is here  he sat like a man turned to stone some part of the stiff vigour of the man seemed to have subsided he seemed to have shrunken in his seat his eyes were fixed upon her face but he opened his lips twice before he spoke  when you married me  her little hand flashed out across the table  john she said i can spare you that question i had been about as foolish and selfish as a girl could be i had done the most compromising things and behaved in the most ridiculous way but from the restyou saved me  sir john breathed a long deep sigh he sat up in his chair again the colour came back to his cheeks  john dont she cried you think that this is all you are going to be generous and forgive it isnt all there is worse to come there is a tragedy to come  out with it then he cried almost roughly dont you know child that this is torture for me what in gods name more can you have to tell me  her face had become almost like a marble image she spoke with a certain odd deliberation carefully chosen words which fell like drops of ice upon the man who sat listening  before i met you i was deluded into receiving upon friendly terms a man named hill who passed himself off as meysey hill the railway man but who was in reality an englishman in poor circumstances he was going to settle i forget how many millions upon me and i think that i was dazzled i went with him to what i supposed to be the british embassy and went through a ceremony which i understood to be the usual form of the marriage one used there afterwards we started for a motor ride to a place outside paris for déjeuner and i suppose the mans nerve failed him i questioned him too closely about his possessions and remarked upon the fact that he was a most inexpert driver although meysey hill had a great reputation as a motorist anyhow he confessed that he was a fraud i struck him across the face jumped out and went back by train to paris he lost control of the machine was upset and nearly killed  did you say sir john asked that the mans name was hill  yes she answered  the man who was found dead in your sisters room was named hill  it is the man she answered i killed him  sir john clutched at the table with both hands a slow horror was dawning in his fixed eyes this was not the sort of confession which he had been expecting annabel had spoken calmly enough and steadily but his brain refused at first to accept the full meaning of her words it seemed to him that a sort of mist had risen up between them everything was blurred only her face was clear frail and delicate almost flowerlike with the sad haunting eyes ever watching his annabel a murderess it was not possible  child he cried you do not know what you say this is part of a dreamsome evil fancy think you could not have done it  she shook her head deliberately hopelessly  i think that i know very well what i am saying she answered i went to annas rooms because i felt that i must see her he was there concealed waiting her return he recognized me at once and he behaved like a madman he swore that i was his wife that chance had given me to him at last john he was between me and the door a strong coarse man and there were things in his eyes which made my blood run cold with terror he came over to me i was helpless beside me on annas table was a pistol i was not even sure whether it was loaded i snatched it up pointed it blindly at him and fired  ah sir john exclaimed  he fell over at my feet she continued i saw him stagger and sink down and the pistol was smoking still in my hand i bent over him anna had told me that he carried always with him this bogus marriage certificate i undid his coat and i took it from his pocket i burned it  but the marriage itself sir john asked i do not understand  there was no marriage she answered i was very foolish to have been deceived even for a moment there was no marriage and i hated oh how i hated the man  did any one see you leave the flat he asked  i do not know but david courtlaw has been here tonight they say he will be conscious he will say who it was so there is no escape and listen john  well  i went from annas flat to nigel ennisons rooms i told him the truth i asked him to take me away and hide me he refused he sent me home  sir johns head bent lower and lower there was nothing left now of the selfassured prosperous man of affairs his shoulders were bent his face was furrowed with wrinkles he looked no longer at his wife his eyes were fixed upon the tablecloth  there was a gentle rustling of skirts softly she rose to her feet he felt her warm breath upon his cheek the perfume of her hair as she leaned over him he did not look up so he did not know that in her other hand she held a glass of wine  dear husband she murmured i am so very very sorry i have brought disgrace upon you and i havent been the right sort of wife at all but it is all over now and presently there will be some one else i should like to have had you forgive me  he did not move he seemed to be thinking hard she paused for a moment then she raised the glass nearer to her lips  goodbye john she said simply  something in her tone made him look up in a second the glass lay shattered upon the carpet there was a stain of wine upon her dress  god in heaven annabel he cried what were you doing  her voice was a little hysterical her unnatural calm was giving way  it was poisonwhy not she answered who is there to care andjohn  his arms were around her he kissed her once on the lips with a passion of which during all their days of married life he had given no sign  you poor little girl he cried forgive you indeed there isnt a husband breathing annabel who wouldnt have blessed that pistol in your hands and prayed god that the bullet might go straight it is no crime none at all it is one of gods laws that a woman may defend her honour even with the shedding of blood while you talked i was only making our plans it was necessary to think and think quickly  she was altogether hysterical now  but ii went to nigel ennison for help i asked himto take me away  she saw him flinch but he gave no sign of it in his tone  perhaps he said i have been to blame it must be my fault that you have not learnt that your husband is the man to come toat such a time as this oh i think i understand annabel you were afraid of me afraid that i should have been shocked afraid of the scandal bah little woman you have been brave enough before pull yourself together now drink this  he poured out a glass of wine with a firm hand and held it to her lips she drank it obediently  good he said as he watched the colour come back to her cheeks now listen you go to your room and ring for your maid i received a telegram as you know during dinner it contains news of the serious illness of a near relation at paris your maid has twenty minutes to pack your dressing case for one night and you have the same time to change into a travelling dress in twenty minutes we meet in the hall remember i will tell you our plans on the way to the station  but you she exclaimed you are not coming there is the election  he laughed derisively  election be hanged he exclaimed dont be childish annabel we are off for a second honeymoon just one thing more we may be stopped dont look so frightened you called yourself a murderess you are nothing of the sort what you did is called manslaughter and at the worst there is only a very slight penalty nothing to be frightened about in the least remember that  she kissed him passionately and ran lightly upstairs in the hall below she could hear his firm voice giving quick commands to the servants     chapter xxviii  the hissing of alcide   there was a strange and ominous murmur of voices a shuffling of feet in the gallery a silence which was like the silence before a storm anna who had sung the first verse of her song looked around the house a little surprised at the absence of the applause which had never yet failed her she realized in a moment what had happened even though the individual faces of her audience were not to be singled out she had been conscious from the first moment of her appearance that something was wrong she hesitated and for a moment thought of omitting her second verse altogether the manager however who stood in the wings nodded to her to proceed and the orchestra commenced the first few bars of the music then the storm broke a long shrill catcall in the gallery seemed to be the signal then a roar of hisses they came from every part from the pit the circle and the gallery even from the stalls and there arose too a background of shouts  who killed her husband  go and nurse him missus  murderess  anna looked from left to right she was as pale as death but she seemed to have lost the power of movement they shouted to her from the wings to come off she could not stir hand or foot a paralyzing horror was upon her her eardrums were burning with the echoes of those hideous shouts a crumpledup newspaper thrown from the gallery hit her upon the cheek the stage manager came out from the wings and taking her hand led her off there was more shouting  the stage manager reappeared presently and made a speech he regrettedmore deeply than he could saythe occurrence of this evening he fancied that when they had had time to reflect they would regret it still more no no they had shown themselves grossly ignorant of facts they had chosen to deliberately and wickedly insult a lady who had done her best to entertain them for many weeks he could not promise that she would ever appear again in that house good job well they might say that but he knew very well that before long they would regret it of his own certain knowledge he could tell them that for his own part he could not sufficiently admire the pluck of this lady who notwithstanding all that she had been through had chosen to appear this evening rather than break her engagement he should never sufficiently be able to regret the return which they had made to her he begged their attention for the next turn  he had spoken impressively and most likely anna had she reappeared would have met with a fair reception she however had no idea of doing anything of the sort she dressed rapidly and left the theatre without a word to any one the whole incident was so unexpected that neither courtlaw nor brendon were awaiting the man who sat behind a pigeonhole and regulated the comings and goings was for a moment absent anna stood on the step and looked up and down the street for a hansom suddenly she felt her wrist grasped by a strong hand it was ennison who loomed up through the shadows  anna thank god i have found you at last but you have not finished surely your second turn is not over is it  she laughed a little hardly even now she was dazed the horror of those few minutes was still with her  have you not heard she said for me there is no second turn i have said goodbye to it all they hissed me  beasts he muttered but was it wise to sing tonight  why not the man was nothing to me  you have not seen the evening paper  no what about them  he called a hansom  they are full of the usual foolish stories tomorrow they will all be contradicted tonight all london believes that he was your husband  that is why they hissed me then  of course tomorrow they will know the truth  she shivered  is this hansom for me she said thank youand goodbye  i am coming with you he said firmly  she shook her head  dont she begged  you are in trouble he said no one has a better right than i to be with you  you have no right at all she answered coldly  i have the right of the man who loves you he declared some day you will be my wife and it would not be well for either of us to remember that in these unhappy days you and i were separated  anna gave her address to the driver she leaned back in the cab with halfclosed eyes  this is all madness she declared wearily do you think it is fair of you to persecute me just now  it is not persecution anna he answered gently only you are the woman i love and you are in trouble and you are something of a heroine too you see my riddle is solved i know all  you know all  your sister has told me  you have seen hersince last night  yes  anna shivered a little she asked no further questions for the moment ennison himself with the recollection of annabels visit still fresh in his mind was for a moment constrained and ill at ease when they reached her rooms she stepped lightly out upon the pavement  now you must go she said firmly i have had a trying evening and i need rest  you need help and sympathy more anna he pleaded and i have the right yes i have the right to offer you both i will not be sent away  it is my wish to be alone she said wearily i can say no more  she turned and fitted the latchkey into the door he hesitated for a moment and then he followed her she turned the gas up in her little sittingroom and sank wearily into an easy chair on the mantelpiece in front of her was a note addressed to her in annabels handwriting she looked at it with a little shudder but she made no motion to take it  will you say what you have to say please and go i am tired and i want to be alone  he came and stood on the hearthrug close to her  anna he said you make it all indescribably hard for me will you not remember what has passed between us i have the right to take my place by your side  you have no right at all she answered further than that i am amazed that you should dare to allude to those few moments to that single moment of folly if ever i could bring myself to ask you any favour i would ask you to forget even as i have forgotten  why in heavens name should i forget he cried i love you anna and i want you for my wife there is nothing but your pride which stands between us  there is great deal more she answered coldly for one thing i am going to marry david courtlaw  he stepped back as though he had received a blow  it is not possible he exclaimed  why not  because you are mine you have told me that you cared oh you cannot escape from it anna my love you cannot have forgotten so soon  he fancied that she was yielding but her eyes fell once more upon that fatal envelope and her tone when she spoke was colder than ever  that was a moment of madness she said i was lonely i did not know what i was saying  i will have your reason for this he said i will have your true reason  she looked at him for a moment with fire in her eyes  you need a reason ask your own conscience what sort of a standard of life yours may be i do not know yet in your heart you know very well that every word you have spoken to me has been a veiled insult every time you have come into my presence has been an outrage that is what stands between us if you would knowthat  she pointed to the envelope still resting upon the mantelpiece he recognized the handwriting and turned a shade paler her eyes noted it mercilessly  but your sister he said what has she told you  everything  he was a little bewildered  but he said you do not blame me altogether  she rose to her feet  i am tired she said and i want to rest but if you do not leave this room i must  he took up his hat  very well he said you are unjust and quixotic anna you have no right to treat any one as you are treating me and yeti love you when you send for me i shall come back i do not believe that you will marry david courtlaw i do not think that you will dare to marry anybody else  he left the room and she stood motionless with flaming cheeks listening to his retreating footsteps when she was quite sure that he was gone she took her sisters note from the mantelpiece and slowly broke the seal       dearest a       i lied to you nigel ennison was my very good friend but there      is not the slightest reason for your not marrying him if you      wish to do so       my husband knows all we leave england tonight                 ever yours                   annabel  anna moved softly to the window and threw up the sash ennison had disappeared     chapter xxix  montague hill plays the game   the man opened his eyes and looked curiously about him  where am i he muttered  courtlaw who was sitting by the bedside bent over him  you are in a private room of st felix hospital he said  hospital what for whats the matter with me  courtlaws voice sank to a whisper a nurse was at the other end of the room  there was an accident with a pistol in miss pellissiers room he said  the light of memory flashed in the mans face his brows drew a little nearer together  accident she shot me he muttered i had found her at last and she shot me listen you am i going to die  i am afraid that you are in a dangerous state courtlaw answered gravely the nurse will fetch the doctor directly i wanted to speak to you first  who are you  i am a friend of miss pellissiers courtlaw answered  which one  the miss pellissier in whose rooms you were and who sings at the unusual courtlaw answered the miss pellissier who was at whites with us  the man nodded  i remember you now he said so it seems that i was wrong annabel was in hiding all the time  annabel pellissier is married courtlaw said quietly  shes my wife the man muttered  it is possible courtlaw said that you too were deceived where were you married  at the english embassy in paris you will find the certificate in my pocket  and who made the arrangements for you and sent you there courtlaw asked  hainault celestes friend he did everything  i thought so courtlaw said you too were deceived the place to which you went was not the english embassy and the whole performance was a fraud i heard rumours of it in paris and the place since then has been closed  but hainaultassuredmethat the marriage was binding  so it would have been at the english embassy courtlaw answered but the place to which you went was not the english embassy it was rigged up for the occasion as it has been many a time before  but hainaultwasa pal ii dont understand the man faltered wearily  hainault was celestes friend and celeste was annabels enemy courtlaw said it was a plot amongst them all to humiliate her  then she has never been my wife  never for a second she is the wife now of another man  hill closed his eyes for fully five minutes he lay quite motionless then he opened them again suddenly to find courtlaw still by his side  it was a bad day for me he said speaking slowly and painfully a bad thing for me when that legacy came i thought id see paris do the thinglike a toff and i heard alcide sing and that little dance she did i was in the front row and i fancied she smiled at me lord what a state i was in night after night i sat there i watched her come in i watched her go she dropped a flowerits in my pocketbook now i couldnt rest or eat or sleep i made hainaults acquaintance stood him drinks lent him money he shook his head all the time annabel pellissier was not like the others he said she had a few acquaintances english gentlemen but she lived with her sisterwas a lady but one day he came to me it was celestes idea i could be presented as meysey hill we were alike he wasa millionaire and i passed myself off as meysey hill and sincetheni havent had a minutes peace god help me  courtlaw was alarmed at the mans pallor  you mustnt talk any more he said but i want you to listen to me just for a moment the doctor will be here to see you in five minutes the nurse sent for him as soon as she saw that you were conscious it is very possible that he will ask you to tell him before witnesses how you received your wound  the man smiled at him  you are their friend then  i am courtlaw answered  which one  the one whose life you have been making a burden who has been all the time shielding her sister i would have married her long ago but she will not have me  bring herhere hill muttered i  the door opened and the doctor entered softly hill closed his eyes courtlaw stood up  he has asked to see some one he whispered to the doctor is there any urgency  the doctor bent over his patient who seemed to have fallen asleep presently he turned to courtlaw  i think he said that i would fetch any one whom he has asked to see his condition is not unfavourable but there may be a relapse at any moment  so only a few minutes after ennisons departure while anna stood indeed with her sisters open letter still in her hand courtlaw drove up in hot haste she opened the door to him herself  will you come round to the hospital he asked hill has asked for you and they will take his depositions tonight  she slipped on her cloak and stepped into the hansom with him they drove rapidly through the emptying streets  will he die she asked  impossible to say he answered we have a private room at st felix everything is being done that can be  you are sure that he asked for menot for annabel  certain courtlaw answered  has he accused any one yet  not yet he answered i have scarcely left his side  he was still conscious when they reached the hospital and his state was much more favourable the doctor and another man were by his bedside when they entered the room and there were writing materials which had evidently been used close at hand he recognised anna and at once addressed her  thank youfor coming he said the doctor has asked me to give them my reasonsfor shooting myself ive told them all that was necessary but iwanted to ask your pardonfor having made myself a nuisance to you and for breaking into your roomsand to thank youthe doctor says you bound up my woundor i should have bled to death  i forgive you willingly anna said bending over him it has all been a mistake hasnt it  no more talking the doctor interposed  i want two wordswith miss pellissier alone hill pleaded  the doctor frowned  remember he said you are not by any means a dying man now but youll never pull through if you dont husband your strength  two words only hill repeated  they all left the room anna leaned over so that he needed only to whisper  tell your sister she was right to shoot quite right i meant mischief but tell her this too i believed that our marriage was genuine i believed that she was my wife or she would have been safe from me  i will tell her anna promised  she has nothing to be afraid of he continued i have signed a statement that i shot myself bad trade and drink both trueboth true  his eyes were closed anna left the room on tiptoe she and courtlaw drove homewards together     chapter xxx  sir johns necktie   sir john in a quiet dark travelling suit was sitting in a pokey little room writing letters the room was worse than pokey it was shabby and the view from the window of chimney pots and slate roofs wholly uninspiring nevertheless sir john had the look of a man who was enjoying himself he seemed years younger and the arrangement of his tie and hair were almost rakish he stamped his last letter as annabel entered  she was dressed for the street very much as her own maid was accustomed to dress and there was a thick veil attached to her hat  john she declared i must eat or die do get your hat and we will go to that corner café  right he answered i know the place you meanvery good cooking for such an outoftheway show ill be ready in a moment  sir john stamped his letters brushed his hat and carefully gave his moustache an upward curl before the lookingglass  i really do not believe he announced with satisfaction that any one would recognize me what do you think annabel  i dont think they would she admitted you seem to have cultivated quite a jaunty appearance and you certainly look years younger one would think that you enjoyed crawling away out of your world into hiding with a very foolish wicked wife  upon my word he declared you are right i really am enjoying it it is like a second honeymoon if it wasnt for the fear that after allbut we wont think of that i dont believe any one could have traced us here you see we travelled second class and we are in the least known quarter of paris tonight we leave for marseilles on thursday we embark for south america  you are a marvellous courier she declared as they passed into the street you see i will take your arm it looks so french to be affectionate  there are some french customs he declared which are admirable i presume that i may not kiss you in the street  certainly not sir she replied laughing if you attempted such a thing it would be in order that i should smack you hard with the palm of my hand upon the cheek  that is another french custom he remarked which is not so agreeable here we are shall we sit outside and drink a petit verre of something to give us an appetite while dinner is being prepared  certainly not she answered i am already so hungry that i shall begin on the petit pains i have an appetite which i dare not increase  they entered the place a pleasant little café of the sort to be met with in the outlying parts of paris most of the tables were for those who smoked only and drank wine but there were a few spread with tablecloths and laid for dinner sir john and annabel seated themselves at one of them and the proprietor himself a small darkvisaged man radiant with smiles came hurrying up followed by a waiter  monsieur would dine it was very good and madame of course with a low bow the carte de jour was before monsieur he had but to give his orders monsieur could rely upon his special attention and for the cookingwell he had his customers who came from their homes to him year after year and always they were well satisfied he waited the pleasure of monsieur  sir john gave his order deliberately stumbling now and then over a word and anglicizing others when he had finished he took up the wine list and ordered a bottle of dry champagne  i am afraid he said to anna afterwards that it was a mistake to order the champagne sec they will guess that i am english  annabel leaned back in her chair and laughed till the tears stood in her eyes  did youdid you really think that they would take you for a frenchman she exclaimed  i dont see why not he answered these clothes are french and im sure this floppy bow would make a frenchman of me anyhow perhaps i ought to have let you order the dinner but i think i got through it pretty well  you did anna exclaimed thank heaven they are bringing the hors doeuvres john i shall eat that whole tin of sardines do take them away from me after i have had four  after all sir john remarked complacently it is astonishing how easy it is for people with brains and a little knowledge of the world to completely hide themselves i am absolutely certain that up to the present we have escaped all notice and i do not believe that any casual observer would take us for english people  a man who had been sitting with his hat tilted over his eyes at an adjacent table had risen to his feet and stood suddenly before them  permit me to offer you the english paper which has just arrived sir john he said holding out a daily telegraph you may find in it a paragraph of some interest to you  sir john was speechless it was annabel who caught at the paper  youappear to know my name sir sir john said  oh yes the stranger remarked goodhumouredly i know you very well by sight sir john it is my business to know most people we were fellow passengers from charing cross and we have been fellow lodgers in the rue dentrepot i trust you will not accuse me of discourtesy if i express my pleasure that henceforth our ways will lie apart  a little sobbing cry from annabel arrested sir johns attention the stranger with a bow returned to his table  read this john                 the bucknall mansions mystery       montague hill the man who was found lying wounded in bucknall      mansions late on wednesday night in the rooms of a wellknown      artiste has recovered sufficiently to make a statement to the      police it appears that he was an unsuccessful admirer of the      lady in question and he admits that under the influence of      drink he broke into her rooms and there made a determined      attempt at suicide he further gave the name and address of the      firm from whom he purchased the revolver and cartridges a member      of which firm has since corroborated his statement       hills confession will finally refute a number of absurd stories      which have been in circulation during the last few days we      understand that notwithstanding the serious nature of the mans      injuries there is every possibility of his recovery  annabel pulled down her veil to hide the tears sir john filled his glass with trembling hand  thank god he exclaimed the fellow is not such a blackguard after all  annabels hand stole into his  and i have dragged you all over here for nothing she murmured  for nothing do you call it he declared i wouldnt have been without this trip for worlds it has been a real honeymoon trip annabel for i feel that it has given me a wife  annabel pulled up her veil  you are a dear she exclaimed affectionately i do hope that i shall be able to make it up to you  sir johns reply was incoherent he called a waiter  garçon he said will you ask the gentleman at the next table if he will do me the honour of taking a glass of wine with me  the stranger came over to them smiling he had been on the point of leaving the restaurant he accepted the glass of wine and bowed  i drink your very good health sir john and lady ferringhall he said and i wish you a pleasant journey back to england if i might take the liberty sir john he added with a humorous gleam in his eyes i should like to congratulate you upon your tie  oh damn the thing sir john exclaimed tucking the loose ends inside his coat                                       i propose sir john said that we pay for our dinnerwhich we havent hadtip the garçon a sovereign and take a cab to the ritz  annabel shook her head  look at our clothes she exclaimed and besides the funny little proprietor has gone down himself to help it along he would be so disappointed i am sure it will be good john and i could eat anything no let us dine here and then go and have our coffee on the boulevards we can take our things up with us and stay at the continental or the ritz  excellent sir john declared we will do paris like the tourists and thank god here comes dinner  everything was good the garçon was tipped as he had never been tipped before in his life they drove up into paris in an open fiacre with a soft cool wind blowing in their faces hand in hand beneath the rug they went first to a hotel and then out again on to the boulevards the natural gaiety of the place seemed to have affected them both they laughed and talked and stared about them she took his hand in hers  dear john she whispered we are to begin our married life tonighthere where i first met you i shall only pray that i may reward you for all your goodness to me  sir john frankly oblivious of the possibility of passersby took her into his arms and kissed her then he stood up and hailed a fiacre  hotel ritz     chapter xxxi  annas tea party   i suppose you havent the least idea who i am lady lescelles said as she settled herself in annas most comfortable chair  i have heard of you of course anna answered hesitatingly but  you cannot imagine what i have come to see you about well i am nigel ennisons sister  oh anna said  nigel is like all men lady lescelles continued he is a sad blunderer he has helped me out of scrapes though no end of times he is an awfully good sortand now he has come to me to help him if i can do you know that he is very much in love with you  anna smiled  well she admitted he has said something of the sort  and you have sent him about his business he tells me that you will not even see him i dont want to bother you of course a woman has a perfect right to choose her own husband but nigel seemed to think that there was something a little mysterious about your treatment of him you seemed he thought to have some grievance which you would not explain and which he thought must arise from a misunderstanding there that sounds frightfully involved doesnt it but perhaps you can make out what i mean dont you care for nigel at all  anna was silent for a moment or two  lady lescelles graceful very fashionably but quietly dressed leaned back and watched her with shrewd kindly eyes  i like your brother better than any other man i know anna said at last  well i dont think you told him as much as that did you lady lescelles asked  i did not anna answered to be frank with you lady lescelles when your brother asked me the other day to be his wife i was under a false impression as regards his relationswith some other person i know now that i was mistaken  that sounds more promising lady lescelles declared may i tell nigel to come and see you again i am not here to do his lovemaking for him you know i came to see you on my own account  thank you very much anna said it is very nice of you to come but i do not think for the present at any rate i could give him any other answer i do not intend to be married or to become engaged just at present  well why not lady lescelles asked smiling i can only be a few years older than you and i have been married four years i can assure you i wouldnt be single again for worlds one gets a lot more fun married  our cases are scarcely similar anna remarked  why not lady lescelles answered you are one of the hampshire pellissiers i know and your family are quite as good as ours as for money nigel has tons of it  it isnt exactly that anna answered but to tell you the truth i cannot bear to look upon myself as a rank failure we girls my sister and i were left quite alone when our father died and i made up my mind to make some little place in the world for myself i tried painting and couldnt get on then i came to london and tried almost everythingall failures i had two offers of marriage from men i liked very much indeed but it never occurred to me to listen to either of them you see i am rather obstinate at last i tried a dramatic agent and got on the music hall stage  well you cant say youre a failure there lady lescelles remarked smiling ive been to hear you lots of times  i have been more fortunate than i deserved anna answered but i only meant to stay upon the music hall stage until i could get something better i am rehearsing now for a new play at the garrick and i have quite made up my mind to try and make some sort of position for myself as an actress  do you think it is really worth while lady lescelles asked gently i am sure you will marry nigel sooner or later and then all your work will be thrown away  anna shook her head  if i were to marry now she said it would be with a sense of humiliation i should feel that i had been obliged to find some one else to fight my battles for me  what else lady lescelles murmured are men for  anna laughed  afterwards she said i should be perfectly content to have everything done for me but i do think that if a girl is to feel comfortable about it they should start fairly equal take your case for instance you brought your husband a large fortune your people were well known in society your family interest i have heard was useful to him in his parliamentary career so far as i am concerned i am just now a hopeless nonentity your brother has everythingi have not shown myself capable even of earning my own living except in a way which could not possibly bring any credit upon anybody and beyond this lady lescelles as you must know recent events have set a good many peoples tongues wagging and i am quite determined to live down all this scandal before i think of marrying any one  i am sure lady lescelles said gently that the last consideration need not weigh with you in the least no one in the world is beyond the shaft of scandalwe all catch it terribly sometimes it simply doesnt count  you are very kind anna said i do hope i have been able to make you understand how i feel that you dont consider me a hopeless prig it does sound a little horrid to talk so much about oneself and to have views  i think lady lescelles said putting down her teacup that i must send nigel to plead his own cause i may tell him at any rate that you will see him  i shall like to see him anna answered i really owe him something of an apology  i will tell him lady lescelles said and now let us leave the men alone and talk about ourselves                                       i am delighted to see you all here anna said smiling upon them from behind the teatray but i shall have to ask you to excuse me for a few minutes my agent is here and he has brought his contract for me to sign i will give you all some tea and then i must leave you for a few minutes  the three men who had arrived within a minute or two of one another received her little speech in dead silence ennison who had been standing with his back to the window came suddenly a little further into the room  miss pellissier he said i came here this afternoon hoping particularly to see you for a few moments before you signed that contract  she shook her head  we may just as well have our talk afterwards she said and i need not keep poor mr earles waiting  courtlaw suddenly interposed  may i be allowed to say he declared that i came here with the same intention  and i also brendon echoed  anna was suddenly very quiet  she was perhaps as near tears as ever before in her life  if i had three hands she said with a faint smile i would give one to each of you i know that you are all my friends and i know that you all have very good advice to give me but i am afraid i am a shockingly obstinate and a very ungrateful person no dont let me call myself that i am grateful indeed i am but on this matter my mind is quite made up  ennison hesitated for a moment  miss pellissier he said these gentlemen are your friends and therefore they are my friends if i am to have no other opportunity i will speak before them i came here to beg you not to sign that contract i came to beg you instead to do me the honour of becoming my wife  and i courtlaw said although i have asked before in vain have come to ask you once more the same thing  and i brendon said humbly although i am afraid there is no chance for me my errand was the same  anna looked at them for a moment with a pitiful attempt at a smile then her head disappeared suddenly in her hands and her shoulders shook violently  please forgive mefor one moment she sobbed ii shall be all right directly  brendon rushed to the piano and strummed out a tune  the others hurried to the window and anna was conscious of a few moments of exquisite emotion after all life had still its pulsations the joy of being loved thrilled her as nothing before had ever done a curious abstract joy which had nothing in it at that moment of regret or even pity  she called them back very soon  the signs of tears had all gone but some subtle change seemed to have stolen into her face she spoke readily enough but there was a new timidity in her manner  my friends she said my dear friends i am going to make the same answer to all of youand that is perhaps you will say no answer at all at present i cannot marry i will not become bound even to any one it would be very hard perhaps to make you understand just how i feel about it i wont try only i feel that you all want to make life too easy for me and i am determined to fight my own battles a little longer if any of youor all of you feel the same in six months time from today will you come if you care to and see me then  there was a brief silence ennison spoke at last  you will sign the contract  i shall sign the contract i think that i am very fortunate to have it to sign  do you mean courtlaw asked that from now to the end of the six months you do not wish to see usany of us  her eyes were a little dim again  i do mean that she declared i want to have no distractions my work will be all sufficient i have an aunt who is coming to live with me and i do not intend to receive any visitors at all it will be a little lonely sometimes she said looking around at them and i shall miss you all but it is the fairest for myselfand i think for you do not avoid me if we meet by accident but i trust to you all not to let the accident happen if you can help it  brendon rose and came towards her with outstretched hand  goodbye miss pellissier and success to you he said may you have as much good fortune as you deserve but not enough to make you forget us  courtlaw rose too  you are of the genus obstinate he said i do not know whether to wish you success or not i will wish you success or failure whichever is the better for you  and i ennison said holding her fingers tightly and forcing her to look into his eyes i will tell you what i have wished for you when we meet six months from today     chapter xxxii  six months after   up the mossgrown path where the rose bushes run wild almost met came anna in a spotless white gown with the flush of her early morning walk in her cheeks and something of the brightness of it in her eyes in one hand she carried a longstalked red rose dripping with dew in the other the postbag  she reached a tiny yellowfronted cottage covered with flowering creepers and entered the front room by the wideopen window breakfast was laid for one a dish of fruit and a shining coffee equipage by the side of her plate was a small key with trembling fingers she opened the postbag there was one letter one only  she opened and read it at once it was dated from the house of commons on the previous day       my dear miss pellissier       tomorrow the six months will be up for days i have been      undecided as to whether i would come to you or no i would like      you to believe that the decision i have arrived atto stay      awayis wholly and entirely to save you pain it should be the      happiest day of your life and i would not detract from its      happiness by letting you remember for a moment that there are      others to whom your inevitable decision must bring some pain       for i know that you love ennison you tried bravely enough to      hide your preference to look at us all with the same eyes to      speak to us in the same tone it was not your fault you failed      if by any chance i have made a mistake a word will bring me to      you but i know very well that that word will never be spoken       your great success has been my joy our joy as well as yours      you have made for yourself a unique place upon the stage we have      so many actresses who aspire to great things in the drama not      one who can interpret as you have interpreted it the delicate      finesse the finer lights and shades of true comedy ennison will      make a thousand enemies if he takes you from the stage yet i      think that he will do it       for my own part i have come fully now into my inheritance i am      bound to admit that i greatly enjoy my altered life every minute      i spend here is an education to me before very long i hope to      have definite work some of my schemes are already in hand      people shrug their shoulders and call me a crazy socialist yet i      fancy that we who have been poor ourselves must be the best      judges of the needs of the people       you will write to me i am sureand from the date of your      letter i trust most earnestly that i may come back to my old      place as                 your devoted friend                     walter brendon  she set the letter down and drew from her pocket another with a foreign post mark which had come the day before this one too she read                 hassells camp                     near colorado       on or about the day you receive this letter anna the six      months will be up do you expect me i wonder i think not at      any rate here i am and here i shall be twenty thousand feet      above all your poisonreeking cities up where gods wind comes      fresh from heaven very near indeed to the untrodden snows      sometimes i tremble anna to think how near i came to passing      through life without a single glimpse a moments revelation of      this greatest and most awful of mysteries the mystery of      primaeval nature it is a true saying that in the mountains there      is peace ones sense of proportion battered out of all shape in      the daily life of cities reasserts itself i love you still      anna but life holds other things than the love of man for woman      some day i shall come back and i will show you on canvas the      things which have come to me up here amongst the eternal silence       many nights i have thought of you anna your face has flitted      out of my watchfire and then i have been a haunted man but      with the morning the glorious unstained morning the passion of      living would stir even the blood of a clod it comes over the      mountains anna pink darkening into orange red everywhere a      wonderful cloud sea scintillating with colour it is enough to      make a man throw away canvas and brushes into the bottomless      precipices enough to make one weep with despair at his utter and      absolute impotence nature is god anna and the greatest artist      of us all a pigmy when i think of those ateliers of ours the      art jargon the decadents with their flamboyant talk i long for      a twoedged sword and a minute of divinity to perdition with      them all       i shall come back if at all a new man i have a new cult to      teach a new enthusiasm i feel years younger a man again my      first visit will be to you i must tell you all about gods land      this marvellous virgin country with its silent forests and      dazzling peaks i make no apology for not being with you now you      love ennison believe me the bitterness of it has almost      departed crushed out of me together with much of the weariness      and sorrow i brought with me here by the nameless glory of these      lonely months yet i shall think of you today i pray anna      that you may find your happiness                 your friend                     david courtlaw       psi do not congratulate you on your success i was certain      of it i am glad or sorry according as it has brought you      happiness  annas eyes were a little dim as she poured out her coffee and the laugh she attempted was not altogether a success  this is all very well she said but two out of the three are rank desertersand if the papers tell the truth the third is as bad i believe i am doomed to be an old maid  she finished her breakfast and strolled out across the garden with the letters still in her hand beyond was a field sloping steeply upwards and at the top a small pine plantation she climbed slowly towards it keeping close to the hedge side fragrant with wild roses and holding her skirts high above the dewladen grass arrived in the plantation she sat down with her back against a tree trunk  already the warm sun was drawing from the pines their delicious odour below her stretched a valley of rich meadowland of yellow cornfields and beyond moorland hillside glorious with purple heather and golden gorse she tried to compose her thoughts to think of the last six months to steep herself in the calm beauty of the surroundings and she found herself able to do nothing of the sort a new restlessness seemed to have stolen in upon her she started at the falling of a leaf at the lumbering of a cow through the hedge her heart was beating with quite unaccustomed vigour her hands were hot she was conscious of a warmth in her blood which the summer sunshine was scarcely responsible for she struggled against it quite uselessly she knew very well that a new thing was stirring in her the period of repression was over it is foolish she murmured to herself foolish he will not come he cannot  and then all her restlessness was turned to joy she sprang to her feet and stood listening with parted lips and eager eyes so he found her when he came round the corner of the spinney  anna he cried eagerly  she held out her arms to him and smiled                                       and where he asked are my rivals  deserters she answered laughing it is you alone nigel who have saved me from being an old maid here are their letters  he took them from her and read them when he came to a certain sentence in brendons letter he stopped short and looked up at her  so brendon and i he said have been troubled with the same fears i too anna have watched and read of your success withi must confess itsome misgiving  please tell me why she asked  do you need me to tell you you have tasted the luxury of power you have made your public you are already a personage and i want you for myselffor my wife  she took his hand and smiled upon him  dont you understand nigel she said softly that it was precisely for this i have worked so hard it is just the aim i have had in view all the time i wanted to have something to give up i did not careno woman really caresto play the beggar maid to your king cophetua  then you will really give it all up he exclaimed  she laughed  when we go indoors i will show you the offers i have refused she answered they have all been trying to turn my head i think that nearly every manager in london has made me an offer my reply to all of them has been the same my engagement at the garrick terminates saturday week and then i am free  you will make me horribly conceited he answered i think that i shall be the most unpopular man in london you are not playing tonight are you  not tonight she answered i am giving my understudy a chance i am going up to dine with my sister  annabel is a prophetess he declared i too am asked  it is a conspiracy she exclaimed come we must go home and have some luncheon my little maidservant will think that i am lost  they clambered down the hill together the air was sweet with the perfume of flowers and the melody of murmuring insects the blue sky was cloudless the heat of the sun was tempered by the heatherscented west wind ennison paused by the little gate  i think he said that you have found the real home of the lotuseaters here one might live the life of golden days  she shook her head gently  neither you nor i nigel are made of such stuff she answered these are the playgrounds of life the great heart of the world beats only where men and women are gathered together you have your work before you and i  he kissed her on the lips  i believe he said that you mean me to be prime minister
