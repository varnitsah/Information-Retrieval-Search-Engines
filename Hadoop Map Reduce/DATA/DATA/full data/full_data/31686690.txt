       141     introduction   there are two conspicuous faults in the literary culture which we are trying to give to our boys and girls in our elementary and secondary schools it is not sufficiently contemporaneous and it is not sufficiently national and american hence it lacks vitality and actuality so little of it is carried over into life because so little of it is interpretative of the life that is it is associated too exclusively in the childs mind with things dead and gonewith the puritan world of miles standish the revolutionary days of paul revere the dutch epoch of rip van winkle or with not even this comparatively recent national interest it takes the child back to the strange folk of the days of king arthur and king robert of sicily of ivanhoe and the ancient mariner thus when the child leaves school his literary studies do not connect helpfully with those forms of literature with whichif he reads at allhe is most likely to be concerned the short story the sketch and the popular essay of the magazines and newspapers the new novel or the plays which he may see at the theatre he has not been interested in the writers of his own time and has never been put in the way of the best contemporary fiction hence the ineffectualness and wastefulness of much of our school work it does not lead forward into the life of today nor help the young to judge intelligently of the popular books which later on will compete for their favor  to be sure not a little of the material used in our elementary schools is drawn from longfellow whittier and holmes from irving and hawthorne but because it is often studied in a socalled thorough and therefore very deadly wayslowly and laboriously for drill rather than briskly for pleasurethere is comparatively little of it read and almost no sense gained of its being part of a national literature in the high school owing to the unfortunate domination of the college entrance requirements the situation is not much better our students leave with a scant and hurried glimpseif any glimpse at allof emerson thoreau and whitman or of lowell lanier and poe with no intimate view of hawthorne our great classic none at all of parkman and fiske our historians or of writers like howells james and cable or wilkins jewett and deland and a worthy company of storytellers  we may well be on our guard against a vaunting nationalism it retards our culture there should be no confusion of the secondrate values of most of our american products with the supreme values of the greatest british classics we may work of course toward an ultimate appreciation of these greatest things we fail however in securing such appreciation because we have failed to enlist those forms of interest which vitalize and stimulate literary studiesabove all the patriotic or national interest concord and cambridge should be dearer as they are nearer to the young american than even stratford and abbotsford hawthorne should be as familiar as goldsmith and emerson as addison or burke ordinarily it is not so and we suffer the consequences in the failure of our youth to grasp the spiritual ideals and the distinctively american democratic spirit which find expression in the greatest work of our literary masters emerson and whitman lowell and lanier our culture and our nationalism both suffer thereby our literature suffers also because we have not an instructed and interested public to encourage excellence  among the living writers there is no one whose work has a more distinctively american savor than that of william dean howells and it is to make his delightful writings more widely known and more easily accessible that this volume of selections from his books for the young has been prepared as a readingbook for the elementary school these juvenile books of mr howells contain some of the very best pages ever written for the enjoyment of young people his two books for boysa boys town and the flight of pony bakerrank with such favorites as tom sawyer and the story of a bad boy  these should be introductory to the best of mr howells novels and essays in the high school for mr howells it need scarcely be said is one of our few masters of style his style is as individual and distinguished as it is felicitous and delicate more important still from the educational point of view he is one of our most modern writers the spiritual issues and social problems of our age which our older highschool pupils are anxious to deal with are alive in his books our young people should know his rise of silas lapham and a hazard of new fortunes as well as his social and literary criticism as stimulating and alluring a volume of selections may be made for highschool students as this volume will be we venture to predict for the younger boys and girls of the elementary school  in this little book of readings we have made we believe an entirely legitimate and desirable use of the books named above a boys town is a series of detachable pictures and episodes into which the boyor the healthy girl who loves boys booksmay dip as the selections here given will we believe tempt him to do the same is true of the flight of pony baker the volume is for classroom enjoyment for happy hours of profitable readingprofitable because happy much of it should be read aloud rather than silently and dramatic justice be done to the scenes and conversations which have dramatic quality                                percival chubb     i  adventures in a boys town     how pony baker came pretty near running off with a circus   just before the circus came about the end of july something happened that made pony mean to run off more than anything that ever was his father and mother were coming home from a walk in the evening it was so hot nobody could stay in the house and just as they were coming to the front steps pony stole up behind them and tossed a snowball which he had got out of the garden at his mother just for fun the flower struck her very softly on her hair for she had no bonnet on and she gave a jump and a hollo that made pony laugh and then she caught him by the arm and boxed his ears  oh my goodness it was you was it you goodfornothing boy i thought it was a bat she said and she broke out crying and ran into the house and would not mind his father who was calling after her lucy lucy my dear child  pony was crying too for he did not intend to frighten his mother and when she took his fun as if he had done something wicked he did not know what to think he stole off to bed and he lay there crying in the dark and expecting that she would come to him as she always did to have him say that he was sorry when he had been wicked or to tell him that she was sorry when she thought she had not been quite fair with him but she did not come and after a good while his father came and said are you awake pony i am sorry your mother misunderstood your fun but you mustnt mind it dear boy shes not well and shes very nervous  i dont care pony sobbed out she wont have a chance to touch me again for he had made up his mind to run off with the circus which was coming the next tuesday  he turned his face away sobbing and his father after standing by his bed a moment went away without saying anything but dont forget your prayers pony youll feel differently in the morning i hope  pony fell asleep thinking how he would come back to the boys town with the circus when he was grown up and when he came out in the ring riding three horses bareback he would see his father and mother and sisters in one of the lower seats they would not know him but he would know them and he would send for them to come to the dressingroom and would be very good to them all but his mother he would be very cold and stiff with her though he would know that she was prouder of him than all the rest put together and she would go away almost crying  illustration he began being cold and stiff with her the very next morning  he began being cold and stiff with her the very next morning although she was better than ever to him and gave him waffles for breakfast with unsalted butter and tried to pet him up that whole day she kept trying to do things for him but he would scarcely speak to her and at night she came to him and said what makes you act so strangely pony are you offended with your mother  yes i am said pony haughtily and he twitched away from where she was sitting on the side of his bed leaning over him  on account of last night pony she asked softly  i reckon you know well enough said pony and he tried to be disgusted with her for being such a hypocrite but he had to set his teeth hard hard or he would have broken down crying  if its for that you mustnt pony dear you dont know how you frightened me when your snowball hit me i felt sure it was a bat and im so afraid of bats you know i didnt mean to hurt my poor boys feelings so and you mustnt mind it any more pony  she stooped down and kissed him on the forehead but he did not move or say anything only after that he felt more forgiving toward his mother he made up his mind to be good to her along with the rest when he came back with the circus but still he meant to run off with the circus he did not see how he could do anything else for he had told all the boys that day that he was going to do it and when they just laughed and said oh yes think you can fool your grandmother itll be like running off with the indians pony wagged his head and said they would see whether it would or not and offered to bet them what they dared  the morning of the circus day all the fellows went out to the corporation line to meet the circus procession there were ladies and knights the first thing riding on spotted horses and then a bandchariot all made up of swans and dragons there were about twenty baggagewagons but before you got to them there was the greatest thing of all it was a chariot drawn by twelve shetland ponies and it was shaped like a big shell and around in the bottom of the shell there were little circus actors boys and girls dressed in their circus clothes and they all looked exactly like fairies they scarce seemed to see the fellows as they ran alongside of their chariot but hen billard and archy hawkins who were always cutting up got close enough to throw some peanuts to the circus boys and some of the little circus girls laughed and the driver looked around and cracked his whip at the fellows and they all had to get out of the way then  jim leonard said that the circus boys and girls were all stolen and nobody was allowed to come close to them for fear they would try to send word to their friends some of the fellows did not believe it and wanted to know how he knew it and he said he read it in a paper after that nobody could deny it but he said that if you went with the circus men of your own free will they would treat you firstrate only they would give you burnt brandy to keep you little nothing else but burnt brandy would do it but that would do it sure  pony was scared at first when he heard that most of the circus fellows were stolen but he thought if he went of his own accord he would be all right still he did not feel so much like running off with the circus as he did before the circus came he asked jim leonard whether the circus men made all the children drink burnt brandy and archy hawkins and hen billard heard him ask and began to mock him they took him up between them one by his arms and the other by the legs and ran along with him and kept saying does it want to be a great big circus actor then it shall so it shall and well tell the circus men to be very careful of you pony dear till pony wriggled himself loose and began to stone them  after that they had to let him alone for when a fellow began to stone you in the boys town you had to let him alone unless you were going to whip him and the fellows only wanted to have a little fun with pony but what they did made him all the more resolved to run away with the circus just to show them  he helped to carry water for the circus mens horses along with the boys who earned their admission that way he had no need to do it because his father was going to take him in anyway but jim leonard said it was the only way to get acquainted with the circus men still pony was afraid to speak to them and he would not have said a word to any of them if it had not been for one of them speaking to him first when he saw him come lugging a great pail of water and bending far over on the right to balance it  thats right the circus man said to pony if you ever fell into that bucket youd drown sure  he was a big fellow with funny eyes and he had a white bulldog at his heels and all the fellows said he was the one who guarded the outside of the tent when the circus began and kept the boys from hooking in under the curtain  even then pony would not have had the courage to say anything but jim leonard was just behind him with another bucket of water and he spoke up for him he wants to go with the circus  they both set down their buckets and pony felt himself turning pale when the circus man came toward them wants to go with the circus heigh lets have a look at you he took pony by the shoulders and turned him slowly round and looked at his nice clothes and took him by the chin orphan he asked  pony did not know what to say but jim leonard nodded perhaps he did not know what to say either but pony felt as if they had both told a lie  parents living the circus man looked at pony and pony had to say that they were  he gasped out yes so that you could scarcely hear him and the circus man said  well thats right when we take an orphan we want to have his parents living so that we can go and ask them what sort of a boy he is  he looked at pony in such a friendly smiling way that pony took courage to ask him whether they would want him to drink burnt brandy  what for  to keep me little  oh i see the circus man took off his hat and rubbed his forehead with a silk handkerchief which he threw into the top of his hat before he put it on again no i dont know as we will were rather short of giants just now how would you like to drink a glass of elephant milk every morning and grow into an eightfooter  pony said he didnt know whether he would like to be quite so big and then the circus man said perhaps he would rather go for an indiarubber man that was what they called the contortionists in those days  lets feel of you again the circus man took hold of pony and felt his joints youre put together pretty tight but i reckon we could make you do if youd let us take you apart with a screwdriver and limber up the pieces with rattlesnake oil wouldnt like it heigh well let me see the circus man thought a moment and then he said how would doublesomersaults on four horses bareback do  pony said that would do and then the circus man said well then weve just hit it because our doublesomersault fourhorse bareback is just going to leave us and we want a new one right away now theres more than one way of joining a circus but the best way is to wait on your front steps with your things all packed up and the procession comes along at about one oclock in the morning and picks you up whichd you rather do  pony pushed his toe into the turf as he always did when he was ashamed but he made out to say he would rather wait out on the front steps  well then thats all settled said the circus man well be along and he was going away with his dog but tim leonard called after him  you haint asked him whereabouts he lives  the circus man kept on and he said without looking around oh thats all right weve got somebody that looks after that  its the magician jim leonard whispered to pony and they walked away     the circus magician   a crowd of the fellows had been waiting to know what the boys had been talking about to the circus man but jim leonard said dont you tell pony baker and he started to run and that made pony run too and they both ran till they got away from the fellows  you have got to keep it a secret for if a lot of fellows find it out the constablell get to know it and hell be watching out around the corner of your house and when the procession comes along and he sees youre really going hell take you up and keep you in jail till your father comes and bails you out now you mind  pony said oh i wont tell anybody and when jim leonard said that if a circus man was to feel him over that way and act so kind of pleasant and friendly he would be too proud to speak to anybody pony confessed that he knew it was a great thing all the time  the wayll be said jim leonard to keep in with him and hell keep the others from picking on you theyll be afraid to on account of his dog youll see hell be the one to come for you tonight and if the constable is there the dog wont let him touch you i never thought of that  perhaps on account of thinking of it now jim leonard felt free to tell the other fellows how pony was going to run off for when a crowd of them came along he told them they said it was splendid and they said that if they could make their mothers let them or if they could get out of the house without their mothers knowing it they were going to sit up with pony and watch out for the procession and bid him goodbye  at dinnertime he found out that his father was going to take him and all his sisters to the circus and his father and mother were so nice to him asking him about the procession and everything that his heart ached at the thought of running away from home and leaving them but now he had to do it the circus man was coming for him and he could not back out he did not know what would happen if he did it seemed to him as if his mother had done everything she could to make it harder for him she had stewed chicken for dinner with plenty of gravy and hot biscuits to sop in and peach preserves afterward and she kept helping him to more because she said boys that followed the circus around got dreadfully hungry the eating seemed to keep his heart down it was trying to get into his throat all the time and he knew that she was being good to him but if he had not known it he would have believed his mother was just doing it to mock him  pony had to go to the circus with his father and sisters and to get on his shoes and a clean collar but a crowd of the fellows were there at the tent door to watch out whether the circus man would say anything to him when he went in and jim leonard rubbed against him when the man passed with his dog and did not even look at pony and said hes just pretending he dont want your father to know hell be round for you sure i saw him kind of smile to one of the other circus men  it was a splendid circus and there were more things than pony ever saw in a circus before but instead of hating to have it over it seemed to him that it would never come to an end he kept thinking and thinking and wondering whether he would like to be a circus actor and when the one came out who rode four horses bareback and stood on his head on the last horse and drove with the reins in his teeth pony thought that he never could learn to do it and if he could not learn he did not know what the circus men would say to him it seemed to him that it was very strange he had not told that circus man that he didnt know whether he could do it or not but he had not and now it was too late  a boy came around calling lemonade and ponys father bought some for each of the children but pony could hardly taste his  what is the matter with you pony are you sick his father asked  no i dont care for any thats all im well said pony but he felt very miserable  after supper jim leonard came round and went up to ponys room with him to help him pack and he was so gay about it and said he only wished he was going that pony cheered up a little jim had brought a large square of checked gingham that he said he did not believe his mother would ever want and that he would tell her he had taken if she asked for it he said it would be the very thing for pony to carry his clothes in for it was light and strong and would hold a lot he helped pony to choose his things out of his bureau drawers a pair of stockings and a pair of white pantaloons and a blue roundabout and a collar and two handkerchiefs that was all he said pony would need because he would have his circus clothes right away and there was no use taking things that he would never wear  jim did these up in the square of gingham and he tied it across catercornered twice in double knots and showed pony how he could put his hand through and carry it just as easy he hid it under the bed for him and he told pony that if he was in ponys place he should go to bed right away or pretty soon so that nobody would think anything and maybe he could get some sleep before he got up and went down to wait on the front steps for the circus to come along he promised to be there with the other boys and keep them from fooling or making a noise or doing anything to wake his father up or make the constable come you see pony he said if you can run off this year and come back with the circus next year then a whole lot of fellows can run off dont you see that  pony said he saw that but he said he wished some of the other fellows were going now because he did not know any of the circus boys and he was afraid he might feel kind of lonesome but jim leonard said he would soon get acquainted and anyway a year would go before he knew it and then if the other fellows could get off he would have plenty of company  as soon as jim leonard was gone pony undressed and got into bed he was not sleepy but he thought maybe it would be just as well to rest a little while before the circus procession came along for him and anyway he could not bear to go downstairs and be with the family when he was going to leave them so soon and not come back for a whole year  after a good while or about the time he usually came in from playing he heard his mother saying where in the world is pony has he come in yet have you seen him girls pony pony she called  but somehow pony could not get his voice up out of his throat he wanted to answer her but he could not speak he heard her say go out to the front steps girls and see if you can see him and then he heard her coming up the stairs and she came into his room and when she saw him lying there in bed she said why i believe in my heart the childs asleep pony are you awake  pony made out to say no and his mother said my what a fright you gave me why didnt you answer me are you sick pony your father said you didnt seem well at the circus and you didnt eat any supper hardly  pony said he was firstrate but he spoke very low and his mother came up and sat down on the side of his bed  what is the matter child she bent over and felt his forehead no you havent got a bit of fever she said and she kissed him and began to tumble his short black hair in the way she had and she got one of his hands between her two and kept rubbing it but youve had a long tiresome day and thats why youve gone to bed i suppose but if you feel the least sick pony ill send for the doctor  pony said he was not sick at all just tired and that was true he felt as if he never wanted to get up again  his mother put her arm under his neck and pressed her face close down to his and said very low pony dear you dont feel hard toward your mother for what she did the other night  he knew she meant boxing his ears when he was not to blame and he said oh no and then he threw his arms round her neck and cried and she told him not to cry and that she would never do such a thing again but she was really so frightened she did not know what she was doing  when he quieted down she said now say your prayers pony our father and she said our father all through with him and after that now i lay me just as when he was a very little fellow after they had finished she stooped over and kissed him again and when he turned his face into his pillow she kept smoothing his hair with her hand for about a minute then she went away  pony could hear them stirring about for a good while downstairs his father came in from uptown at last and asked has pony come in  and his mother said yes hes up in bed i wouldnt disturb him henry hes asleep by this time  his father said i dont know what to make of the boy if he keeps on acting so strangely i shall have the doctor see him in the morning  pony felt dreadfully to think how far away from them he should be in the morning and he would have given anything if he could have gone down to his father and mother and told them what he was going to do but it did not seem as if he could  byandby he began to be sleepy and then he dozed off but he thought it was hardly a minute before he heard the circus band and knew that the procession was coming for him he jumped out of bed and put on his things as fast as he could but his roundabout had only one sleeve to it somehow and he had to button the lower buttons of his trousers to keep it on he got his bundle and stole down to the front door without seeming to touch his feet to anything and when he got out on the front steps he saw the circus magician coming along by that time the music had stopped and pony could not see any procession the magician had on a tall peaked hat like a witch he took up the whole street he was so wide in the black glazed gown that hung from his arms when he stretched them out for he seemed to be groping along that way with his wand in one hand like a blind man  he kept saying in a kind of deep shaking voice its all glory its all glory and the sound of those words froze ponys blood he tried to get back into the house again so that the magician should not find him but when he felt for the doorknob there was no door there anywhere nothing but a smooth wall then he sat down on the steps and tried to shrink up so little that the magician would miss him but he saw his wide goggles getting nearer and nearer and then his father and the doctor were standing by him looking down at him and the doctor said  he has been walking in his sleep he must be bled and he got out his lancet when pony heard his mother calling pony pony whats the matter have you got the nightmare and he woke up and found it was just morning  the sun was shining in at his window and it made him so glad to think that by this time the circus was far away and he was not with it that he hardly knew what to do  he was not very well for two or three days afterward and his mother let him stay out of school to see whether he was really going to be sick or not when he went back most of the fellows had forgotten that he had been going to run off with the circus some of them that happened to think of it plagued him a little and asked how he liked being a circus actor  hen billard was the worst he said he reckoned the circus magician got scared when he saw what a whaler pony was and told the circus men that they would have to get a new tent to hold him and that was the reason why they didnt take him archy hawkins said how long did you have to wait on the front steps pony dear but after that he was pretty good to him and said he reckoned they had better not any of them pretend that pony had not tried to run off if they had not been up to see  pony himself could never be exactly sure whether he had waited on the front steps and seen the circus magician or not sometimes it seemed all of it like a dream and sometimes only part of it jim leonard tried to help him make it out but they could not he said it was a pity he had overslept himself for if he had come to bid pony goodbye the way he said then he could have told just how much of it was a dream and how much was not     jim leonards hairbreadth escape   jim leonards stable used to stand on the flat near the river and on a rise of ground above it stood jim leonards logcabin the boys called it jim leonards logcabin but it was really his mothers and the stable was hers too it was a log stable but up where the gable began the logs stopped and it was weatherboarded the rest of the way and the roof was shingled  jim leonard said it was all logs once and that the roof was loose clapboards held down by logs that ran across them like the roofs in the early times before there were shingles or nails or anything in the country but none of the oldest boys had ever seen it like that and you had to take jim leonards word for it if you wanted to believe it the little fellows nearly all did but everybody said afterward it was a good thing for jim leonard that it was not that kind of roof when he had his hairbreadth escape on it he said himself that he would not have cared if it had been but that was when it was all over and his mother had whipped him and everything and he was telling the boys about it  he said that in his pirate book lots of fellows on rafts got to land when they were shipwrecked and that the oldfashioned roof would have been just like a raft anyway and he could have steered it right across the river to deloracs island as easy pony baker thought very likely he could but hen billard said  well why didnt you do it with the kind of a roof you had  some of the boys mocked jim leonard but a good many of them thought he could have done it if he could have got into the eddy that there was over by the island if he could have landed there once he could have camped out and lived on fish till the river fell  it was that spring about fiftyfour years ago when the freshet which always came in the spring was the worst that anybody could remember the country above the boys town was under water for miles and miles the riverbottoms were flooded so that the corn had to be all planted over again when the water went down the freshet tore away pieces of orchard and appletrees in bloom came sailing along with logs and fencerails and chickencoops and pretty soon dead cows and horses there was a dog chained to a dogkennel that went by howling awfully the boys would have given anything if they could have saved him but the yellow river whirled him out of sight behind the middle pier of the bridge which everybody was watching from the bank expecting it to go any minute the water was up within four or five feet of the bridge and the boys believed that if a good big log had come along and hit it the bridge would have been knocked loose from its piers and carried down the river  perhaps it would and perhaps it would not the boys all ran to watch it as soon as school was out and stayed till they had to go to supper after supper some of their mothers let them come back and stay till bedtime if they would promise to keep a full yard back from the edge of the bank they could not be sure just how much a yard was and they nearly all sat down on the edge and let their legs hang over  jim leonard was there holloing and running up and down the bank and showing the other boys things away out in the river that nobody else could see he said he saw a man out there he had not been to supper and he had not been to school all day which might have been the reason why he would rather stay with the men and watch the bridge than go home to supper his mother would have been waiting for him with a sucker from the peartree he told the boys that while they were gone he went out with one of the men on the bridge as far as the middle pier and it shook like a leaf he showed with his hand how it shook  jim leonard was a fellow who believed he did all kinds of things that he would like to have done and the big boys just laughed that made jim leonard mad and he said that as soon as the bridge began to go he was going to run out on it and go with it and then they would see whether he was a liar or not they mocked him and danced round him till he cried but pony baker who had come with his father believed that jim leonard would really have done it and at any rate he felt sorry for him when jim cried  he stayed later than any of the little fellows because his father was with him and even all the big boys had gone home except hen billard when pony left jim leonard on the bank and stumbled sleepily away with his hand in his fathers  when pony was gone hen billard said well going to stay all night jim  and jim leonard answered back as cross as could be yes i am and he said the men who were sitting up to watch the bridge were going to give him some of their coffee and that would keep him awake but perhaps he thought this because he wanted some coffee so badly he was awfully hungry for he had not had anything since breakfast except a piece of breadandbutter that he got pony baker to bring him in his pocket when he came down from school at noontime  hen billard said well i suppose i wont see you any more jim goodbye and went away laughing and after a while one of the men saw jim leonard hanging about and asked him what he wanted there at that time of night and jim could not say he wanted coffee and so there was nothing for him to do but go there was nowhere for him to go but home and he sneaked off in the dark  when he came in sight of the cabin he could not tell whether he would rather have his mother waiting for him with a whipping and some supper or get to bed somehow with neither he climbed softly over the back fence and crept up to the back door but it was fast then he crept round to the front door and that was fast too there was no light in the house and it was perfectly still  all of a sudden it struck him that he could sleep in the stableloft and he thought what a fool he was not to have thought of it before the notion brightened him up so that he got the gourd that hung beside the wellcurb and took it out to the stable with him for now he remembered that the cow would be there unless she was in somebodys gardenpatch or cornfield  he noticed as he walked down toward the stable that the freshet had come up over the flat and just before the door he had to wade but he was in his bare feet and he did not care if he thought anything he thought that his mother would not come out to milk till the water went down and he would be safe till then from the whipping he must take sooner or later for playing hooky  sure enough the old cow was in the stable and she gave jim leonard a snort of welcome and then lowed anxiously he fumbled through the dark to her side and began to milk her she had been milked only a few hours before and so he got only a gourdful from her but it was all strippings and rich as cream and it was smoking warm it seemed to jim leonard that it went down to his very toes when he poured it into his throat and it made him feel so good that he did not know what to do  there really was not anything for him to do but to climb up into the loft by the ladder in the corner of the stable and lie down on the old last years fodder the rich warm milk made jim leonard awfully sleepy and he dropped off almost as soon as his head touched the cornstalks the last thing he remembered was the hoarse roar of the freshet outside and that was a lulling music in his ears  the next thing he knew and he hardly knew that was a soft jolting sinking motion first to one side and then to the other then he seemed to be going down down straight down and then to be drifting off into space he rubbed his eyes and found it was full daylight although it was the daylight of early morning and while he lay looking out of the stableloft window and trying to make out what it all meant he felt a wash of cold water along his back and his bed of fodder melted away under him and around him and some loose planks of the loft floor swam weltering out of the window then he knew what had happened the flood had stolen up while he slept and sapped the walls of the stable the logs had given way one after another and had let him down with the roof into the water  he got to his feet as well as he could and floundered over the rising and falling boards to the window in the floating gable one look outside showed him his mothers logcabin safe on its rise of ground and at the corner the old cow that must have escaped through the stable door he had left open and passed the night among the cabbages she seemed to catch sight of jim leonard when he put his head out and she lowed to him  jim leonard did not stop to make any answer he clambered out of the window and up onto the ridge of the roof and there in the company of a large gray rat he set out on the strangest voyage a boy ever made in a few moments the current swept him out into the middle of the river and he was sailing down between his native shore on one side and deloracs island on the other  all round him seethed and swirled the yellow flood in eddies and ripples where drift of all sorts danced and raced his vessel such as it was seemed seaworthy enough it held securely together fitting like a low wide cup over the water and perhaps finding some buoyancy from the air imprisoned in it above the window but jim leonard was not satisfied and so far from being proud of his adventure he was frightened worse even than the rat which shared it as soon as he could get his voice he began to shout for help to the houses on the empty shores which seemed to fly backward on both sides while he lay still on the gulf that swashed around him and tried to drown his voice before it swallowed him up at the same time the bridge which had looked so far off when he first saw it was rushing swiftly toward him and getting nearer and nearer  he wondered what had become of all the people and all the boys he thought that if he were safe there on shore he should not be sleeping in bed while somebody was out in the river on a roof with nothing but a rat to care whether he got drowned or not  where was hen billard that always made fun so or archy hawkins that pretended to be so goodnatured or pony baker that seemed to like a fellow so much he began to call for them by name hen billardo hen help help archy hawkinso archy im drowning pony ponyo pony dont you see me pony  he could see the top of pony bakers house and he thought what a good kind man ponys father was surely he would try to save him and jim leonard began to yell o mr baker look here mr baker its jim leonard and im floating down the river on a roof save me mr baker save me help help somebody fire fire fire murder fire  by this time he was about crazy and did not half know what he was saying just in front of where hen billards grandmother lived on the street that ran along the top of the bank the roof got caught in the branches of a tree which had drifted down and stuck in the bottom of the river so that the branches waved up and down as the current swashed through them jim leonard was glad of anything that would stop the roof and at first he thought he would get off on the tree that was what the rat did perhaps the rat thought jim leonard really was crazy and he had better let him have the roof to himself but the rat saw that he had made a mistake and he jumped back again after he had swung up and down on a limb two or three times jim leonard felt awfully when the rat first got into the tree for he remembered how it said in the pirate book that rats always leave a sinking ship and now he believed that he certainly was gone but that only made him hollo the louder and he holloed so loud that at last he made somebody hear  it was hen billards grandmother and she put her head out of the window with her nightcap on to see what the matter was jim leonard caught sight of her and he screamed fire fire fire im drownding mrs billard oh do somebody come  hen billards grandmother just gave one yell of fire the worlds aburnin up hen billard and you layin there sleepin and not helpin a bit somebodys out there in the river and she rushed into the room where hen was and shook him  he bounced out of bed and pulled on his pantaloons and was downstairs in a minute he ran bareheaded over to the bank and when jim leonard saw him coming he holloed ten times as loud its me hen its jim leonard oh do get somebody to come out and save me fire  as soon as hen heard that and felt sure it was not a dream which he did in about half a second he began to yell too and to say how did you get there fire fire fire what are you on fire are you in a tree or what fire fire are you in a flatboat fire fire fire if i had a skifffire  he kept racing up and down the bank and back and forth between the bank and the houses the river was almost up to the top of the bank and it looked a mile wide down at the bridge you could hardly see any light between the water and the bridge  pretty soon people began to look out of their doors and windows and hen billards grandmother kept screaming the worlds aburnin up the rivers on fire then boys came out of their houses and then men with no hats on and then women and girls with their hair half down the firebells began to ring and in less than five minutes both the fire companies were on the shore with the men at the brakes and the foremen of the companies holloing through their trumpets  then jim leonard saw what a good thing it was that he had thought of holloing fire he felt sure now that they would save him somehow and he made up his mind to save the rat too and pet it and maybe go around and exhibit it he would name it bolivar it was just the color of the elephant bolivar that came to the boys town every year these things whirled through his brain while he watched two men setting out in a skiff toward him  they started from the shore a little above him and they meant to row slanting across to his tree but the current when they got fairly into it swept them far below and they were glad to row back to land again without ever getting anywhere near him at the same time the treetop where his roof was caught was pulled southward by a sudden rush of the torrent it opened and the roof slipped out with jim leonard and the rat on it they both joined in one squeal of despair as the river leaped forward with them and a dreadful oh went up from the people on the bank  some of the firemen had run down to the bridge when they saw that the skiff was not going to be of any use and one of them had got out of the window of the bridge onto the middle pier with a long pole in his hand it had an iron hook at the end and it was the kind of pole that the men used to catch driftwood with and drag it ashore when the people saw blue bob with that pole in his hand they understood what he was up to he was going to wait till the water brought the roof with jim leonard on it down to the bridge and then catch the hook into the shingles and pull it up to the pier the strongest current set close in around the middle pier and the roof would have to pass on one side or the other that was what blue bob argued out in his mind when he decided that the skiff would never reach jim leonard and he knew that if he could not save him that way nothing could save him  blue bob must have had a last name but none of the little fellows knew what it was everybody called him blue bob because he had such a thick black beard that when he was just shaved his face looked perfectly blue he knew all about the river and its ways and if it had been of any use to go out with a boat he would have gone that was what all the boys said when they followed blue bob to the bridge and saw him getting out on the pier he was the only person that the watchman had let go on the bridge for two days  the water was up within three feet of the floor and if jim leonards roof slipped by blue bobs guard and passed under the bridge it would scrape jim leonard off and that would be the last of him  all the time the roof was coming nearer the bridge sometimes slower sometimes faster just as it got into an eddy or into the current once it seemed almost to stop and swayed completely round then it just darted forward  blue bob stood on the very point of the pier where the strong stonework divided the current and held his hooked pole ready to make a clutch at the roof whichever side it took jim leonard saw him there but although he had been holloing and yelling and crying all the time now he was still he wanted to say o bob save me but he could not make a sound  it seemed to him that bob was going to miss him when he made a lunge at the roof on the right side of the pier it seemed to him that the roof was going down the left side but he felt it quiver and stop and then it gave a loud crack and went to pieces and flung itself away upon the whirling and dancing flood at first jim leonard thought he had gone with it but it was only the rat that tried to run up blue bobs pole and slipped off into the water and then somehow jim was hanging onto blue bobs hands and scrambling onto the bridge  blue bob always said he never saw any rat and a good many people said there never was any rat on the roof with jim leonard they said that he just made the rat up  he did not mention the rat himself for several days he told pony baker that he did not think of it at first he was so excited  pony asked his father what he thought and ponys father said that it might have been the kind of rat that people see when they have been drinking too much and that blue bob had not seen it because he had signed the temperance pledge  but this was a good while after at the time the people saw jim leonard standing safe with blue bob on the pier they set up a regular election cheer and they would have believed anything jim leonard said they all agreed that blue bob had a right to go home with jim and take him to his mother for he had saved jims life and he ought to have the credit of it  before this and while everybody supposed that jim leonard would surely be drowned some of the people had gone up to his mothers cabin to prepare her for the worst she did not seem to understand exactly and she kept round getting breakfast with her old clay pipe in her mouth but when she got it through her head she made an awful face and dropped her pipe on the doorstone and broke it and then she threw her check apron over her head and sat down and cried  but it took so long for her to come to this that the people had not got over comforting her and trying to make her believe that it was all for the best when blue bob came up through the bars with his hand on jims shoulder and about all the boys in town tagging after them  jims mother heard the hurrahing and pulled off her apron and saw that jim was safe and sound there before her she gave him a look that made him slip round behind blue bob and she went in and got a tableknife and she came out and went to the peartree and cut a sucker  she said ill learn that limb to sleep in a cowbarn when hes got a decent bed in the house and then she started to come toward jim leonard     ii  life in a boys town     the town   i call it a boys town because i wish it to appear to the reader as a town appears to a boy from his third to his eleventh year when he seldom if ever catches a glimpse of life much higher than the middle of a man and has the most distorted and mistaken views of most things some people remain in this condition as long as they live and keep the ignorance of childhood after they have lost its innocence heaven has been shut but the earth is still a prison to them these will not know what i mean by much that i shall have to say but i hope that the ungrownup children will and that the boys of today will like to know what a boy of forty years ago was like even if he had no very exciting adventures or threadbare escapes perhaps i mean hairbreadth escapes but it is the same thingthey have been used so often i shall try to describe him very minutely in his daily doings and dreamings and it may amuse them to compare these doings and dreamings with their own for convenience i shall call this boy my boy but i hope he might have been almost anybodys boy and i mean him sometimes for a boy in general as well as a boy in particular  illustration the first lock  it seems to me that my boys town was a town peculiarly adapted for a boy to be a boy in it had a river the great miami river which was as blue as the sky when it was not as yellow as gold and it had another river called the old river which was the miamis former channel and which held an island in its sluggish loop the boys called it the island and it must have been about the size of australia perhaps it was not so large then this town had a canal and a canalbasin and a first lock and a second lock you could walk out to the first lock but the second lock was at the edge of the known world and when my boy was very little the biggest boy had never been beyond it then it had a hydraulic which brought the waters of old river for millpower through the heart of the town from a big reservoir and a little reservoir the big reservoir was as far off as the second lock and the hydraulic ran under mysterious culverts at every streetcrossing all these streams and courses had fish in them at all seasons and all summer long they had boys in them and now and then a boy in winter when the thin ice of the mild southern ohio winter let him through with his skates then there were the commons a wide expanse of open fields where the cows were pastured and the boys flew their kites and ran races and practised for their circuses in the tanbark rings of the real circuses     earliest memories   some of my boys memories reach a time earlier than his third year and relate to the little ohio river hamlet where he was born and where his mothers people who were riverfaring folk all lived every two or three years the river rose and flooded the village and his grandmothers household was taken out of the secondstory window in a skiff but no one minded a trivial inconvenience like that any more than the romans have minded the annual freshet of the tiber for the last three or four thousand years when the waters went down the family returned and scrubbed out the five or six inches of rich mud they had left in the mean time it was a godsend to all boys of an age to enjoy it but it was nothing out of the order of providence so if my boy ever saw a freshet it naturally made no impression upon him what he remembered was something much more important and that was waking up one morning and seeing a peachtree in bloom through the window beside his bed and he was always glad that this vision of beauty was his very earliest memory all his life he has never seen a peachtree in bloom without a swelling of the heart without some fleeting sense that      heaven lies about us in our infancy  over the spot where the little house once stood a railroad has drawn its erasing lines and the house itself was long since taken down and built up brick by brick in quite another place but the blooming peachtree glows before his childish eyes untouched by time or change the tender pathetic pink of its flowers repeated itself many long years afterward in the paler tints of the almond blossoms in italy but always with a reminiscence of that dim past and the little coalsmoky town on the banks of the ohio  perversely blended with that vision of the blooming peach is a glimpse of a pet deer in the kitchen of the same little house with its head up and its antlers erect as if he meditated offence my boy might never have seen him so he may have had the vision at second hand but it is certain that there was a pet deer in the family and that he was as likely to have come into the kitchen by the window as by the door one of the boys uncles had seen this deer swimming the mississippi far to the southward and had sent out a yawl and captured him and brought him home he began a checkered career of uselessness when they were ferrying him over from wheeling in a skiff by trying to help wear the pantaloons of the boy who was holding him he put one of his forelegs in at the watchpocket but it was disagreeable to the boy and ruinous to the trousers he grew very tame and butted children over right and left in the village streets and he behaved like one of the family whenever he got into a house he ate the sugar out of the bowl on the table and plundered the pantry of its sweet cakes one day a dog got after him and he jumped over the riverbank and broke his leg and had to be shot     home life   the house gave even to him a sense of space unknown before and he could recall his mothers satisfaction in it he has often been back there in dreams and found it on the old scale of grandeur but no doubt it was a very simple affair the fortunes of a whig editor in a place so overwhelmingly democratic as the boys town were not such as could have warranted his living in a palace and he must have been poor as the world goes now but the family always lived in abundance and in their way they belonged to the employing class that is the father had men to work for him on the other hand he worked with them and the boys as they grew old enough were taught to work with them too my boy grew old enough very young and was put to use in the printingoffice before he was ten years of age this was not altogether because he was needed there i dare say but because it was part of his fathers swedenborgian philosophy that every one should fulfil a use i do not know that when the boy wanted to go swimming or hunting or skating it consoled him much to reflect that the angels in the highest heaven delighted in uses nevertheless it was good for him to be of use though maybe not so much use  if his mother did her own work with help only now and then from a hired girl that was the custom of the time and country and her memory was always the more reverend to him because whenever he looked back at her in those dim years he saw her about some of those household offices which are so beautiful to a child she was always the best and tenderest mother and her love had the heavenly art of making each child feel itself the most important while she was partial to none in spite of her busy days she followed their father in his religion and literature and at night when her long toil was over she sat with the children and listened while he read aloud  the first book my boy remembered to have heard him read was moores lalla rookh of which he formed but a vague notion though while he struggled after its meaning he took all its music in and began at once to make rhymes of his own he had no conception of literature except the pleasure there was in making it and he had no outlook into the world of it which must have been pretty open to his father the father read aloud some of dickens christmas stories then new and the boy had a good deal of trouble with the haunted man one rarest night of all the family sat up till two oclock listening to a novel that my boy long ago forgot the name of if he ever knew its name it was all about a will forged or lost and there was a great scene in court and after that the mother declared that she could not go to bed till she heard the end his own first reading was in history at nine years of age he read the history of greece and the history of rome and he knew that goldsmith wrote them one night his father told the boys all about don quixote and a little while after he gave my boy the book he read it over and over again but he did not suppose it was a novel it was his elder brother who read novels and a novel was like handy andy or harry lorrequer or the bride of lammermoor his brother had another novel which they preferred to either it was in harpers old library of select novels and was called alamance or the great and final experiment and it was about the life of some sort of community in north carolina it bewitched them and though my boy could not afterward recall a single fact or figure in it he could bring before his minds eye every trait of its outward aspect  all this went along with great and continued political excitement and with some glimpses of the social problem it was very simple then nobody was very rich and nobody was in want but somehow as the boy grew older he began to discover that there were differences even in the little world about him some were higher and some were lower from the first he was taught by precept and example to take the side of the lower as the children were denied oftener than they were indulged the margin of their own abundance must have been narrower than they ever knew then but if they had been of the most prosperous their bent in this matter would have been the same once there was a church festival or something of that sort and there was a good deal of the provision left over which it was decided should be given to the poor this was very easy but it was not so easy to find the poor whom it should be given to at last a hardworking widow was chosen to receive it the ladies carried it to her front door and gave it her and she carried it to her back door and threw it into the alley no doubt she had enough without it but there were circumstances of indignity or patronage attending the gift which were recognized in my boys home and which helped afterward to make him doubtful of all giving except the humblest and restive with a world in which there need be any giving at all     the river   it seems to me that the best way to get at the heart of any boys town is to take its different watercourses and follow them into it  the house where my boy first lived was not far from the river and he must have seen it often before he noticed it but he was not aware of it till he found it under the bridge without the river there could not have been a bridge the fact of the bridge may have made him look for the river but the bridge is foremost in his mind it is a long wooden tunnel with two roadways and a footpath on either side of these there is a tollhouse at each end and from one to the other it is about as far as from the earth to the planet mars on the western shore of the river is a smaller town than the boys town and in the perspective the entrance of the bridge on that side is like a dim little doorway the timbers are of a hugeness to strike fear into the heart of the boldest little boy and there is something awful even about the dust in the roadways soft and thrillingly cool to the boys bare feet it lies thick in a perpetual twilight streaked at intervals by the sun that slants in at the high narrow windows under the roof it has a certain potent musty smell the bridge has three piers and at low water hardier adventurers than he wade out to the middle pier some heroes even fish there standing all day on the loose rocks about the base of the pier he shudders to see them and aches with wonder how they will get ashore once he is there when a big boy wades back from the middle pier where he has been to rob a gooses nest he has some loose silver change in his wet hand and my boy understands that it has come out of one of the goose eggs this fact which he never thought of questioning gets mixed up in his mind with an idea of riches of treasuretrove in the cellar of an old house that has been torn down near the end of the bridge  the river had its own climate and this climate was of course much such a climate as the boys for whom nature intended the river would have chosen i do not believe it was ever winter there though it was sometimes late autumn so that the boys could have some use for the caves they dug at the top of the bank with a hole coming through the turf to let out the smoke of the fires they built inside they had the joy of choking and blackening over these flues and they intended to live on corn and potatoes borrowed from the household stores of the boy whose house was nearest they never got so far as to parch the corn or to bake the potatoes in their caves but there was the fire and the draught was magnificent the light of the red flames painted the little happy foolish faces so long since wrinkled and grizzled with age or mouldered away to dust as the boys huddled before them under the bank and fed them with the drift or stood patient of the heat and cold in the afternoon light of some vast saturday waning to nightfall  the riverclimate with these autumnal intervals was made up of a quick eventful springtime followed by the calm of a cloudless summer that seemed never to end but the spring short as it was had its great attractions and chief of these was the freshet which it brought to the river they would hear somehow that the river was rising and then the boys who had never connected its rise with the rains they must have been having would all go down to its banks and watch the swelling waters these would be yellow and thick and the boiling current would have smooth oily eddies where pieces of drift would whirl round and round and then escape and slip down the stream there were sawlogs and whole trees with their branching tops lengths of fence and hencoops and pigpens once there was a stable and if the flood continued there began to come swollen bodies of horses and cattle this must have meant serious loss to the people living on the riverbottoms above but the boys counted it all gain they cheered the objects as they floated by and they were breathless with the excitement of seeing the men who caught fencerails and cordwood and even sawlogs with iron prongs at the points of long poles as they stood on some jutting point of shore and stretched far out over the flood the boys exulted in the turbid spread of the stream which filled its low western banks and stole over their tops and washed into all the hollow places along its shores and shone among the trunks of the sycamores on deloracs island which was almost of the geographical importance of the island in old river when the water began to go down their hearts sank with it and they gave up the hope of seeing the bridge carried away once the river rose to within a few feet of it so that if the right piece of drift had been there to do its duty the bridge might have been torn from its piers and swept down the raging tide into those unknown gulfs to the southward many a time they went to bed full of hope that it would at least happen in the night and woke to learn with shame and grief in the morning that the bridge was still there and the river was falling it was a little comfort to know that some of the big boys had almost seen it go watching as far into the night as nine oclock with the men who sat up near the bridge till daylight men of leisure and public spirit but not perhaps the leading citizens     swimming   there must have been a tedious time between the going down of the flood and the first days when the water was warm enough for swimming but it left no trace the boys are standing on the shore while the freshet rushes by and then they are in the water splashing diving ducking it is like that so that i do not know just how to get in that period of fishing which must always have come between there were not many fish in that part of the miami my boys experience was full of the ignominy of catching shiners and suckers or at the best mudcats as they called the yellow catfish but there were boys of those who cursed and swore who caught sunfish as they called the bream and there were men who were reputed to catch at will as it were silvercats and riverbass they fished with minnows which they kept in battered tin buckets that they did not allow you even to touch or hardly to look at my boy scarcely breathed in their presence when one of them got up to cast his line in a new place the boys all ran and then came slowly back these men often carried a flask of liquid that had the property when taken inwardly of keeping the damp out the boys respected them for their ability to drink whiskey and thought it a fit and honorable thing that they should now and then fall into the river over the brinks where they had set their poles but they disappear like persons in a dream and their fishingtime vanishes with them and the swimmingtime is in full possession of the river and of all the other waters of the boys town  illustration  the swimmingholes in the river were the greatest favorites my boy could not remember when he began to go into them though it certainly was before he could swim there was a time when he was afraid of getting in over his head but he did not know just when he learned to swim any more than he knew when he learned to read he could not swim and then he could swim he could not read and then he could read but i dare say the reading came somewhat before the swimming yet the swimming must have come very early and certainly it was kept up with continual practise he swam quite as much as he read perhaps more the boys had deep swimmingholes and shallow ones and over the deep ones there was always a springboard from which they threw somersaults or dived straight down into the depths where there were warm and cold currents mysteriously interwoven they believed that these deep holes were infested by watersnakes though they never saw any and they expected to be bitten by snappingturtles though this never happened fiery dragons could not have kept them out gallynippers whatever they were certainly did not they were believed to abound at the bottom of the deep holes but the boys never stayed long in the deep holes and they preferred the shallow places where the river broke into a long ripple they called it riffle on its gravelly bed and where they could at once soak and bask in the musical rush of the sunlit waters i have heard people in new england blame all the western rivers for being yellow and turbid but i know that after the spring floods when the miami had settled down to its summer business with the boys it was as clear and as blue as if it were spilled out of the summer sky the boys liked the riffle because they could stay in so long there and there were little landlocked pools and shallows where the water was even warmer and they could stay in longer at most places under the banks there was clay of different colors which they used for warpaint in their indian fights and after they had their indian fights they could rush screaming and clattering into the riffle when the stream had washed them clean down to their red sunburn or their leathern tan they could paint up again and have more indian fights  i wonder what sign the boys who read this have for challenging or inviting one another to go in swimming the boys in the boys town used to make the motion of swimming with both arms or they held up the forefinger and middlefinger in the form of a swallowtail they did this when it was necessary to be secret about it as in school and when they did not want the whole crowd of boys to come along and often when they just pretended they did not want some one to know they really had to be secret at times for some of the boys were not allowed to go in at all others were forbidden to go in more than once or twice a day and as they all had to go in at least three or four times a day some sort of sign had to be used that was understood among themselves alone since this is a true history i had better own that they nearly all at one time or other must have told lies about it either before or after the fact some habitually some only in great extremity here and there a boy like my boys elder brother would not tell lies at all even about going in swimming but by far the greater number bowed to their hard fate and told them they promised that they would not go in and then they said that they had not been in but sin for which they had made this sacrifice was apt to betray them either they got their shirts on wrong side out in dressing or else while they were in some enemy came upon them and tied their shirts there are few cruelties which public opinion in the boys world condemns but i am glad to remember to their honor that there were not many in that boys town who would tie shirts and i fervently hope that there is no boy now living who would do it as the crime is probably extinct i will say that in those wicked days if you were such a miscreant and there was some boy you hated you stole up and tied the hardest kind of a knot in one arm or both arms of his shirt then if the evil one put it into your heart you soaked the knot in water and pounded it with a stone  i am glad to know that in the days when he was thoughtless and senseless enough my boy never was guilty of any degree of this meanness it was his brother i suppose who taught him to abhor it and perhaps it was his own suffering from it in part for he too sometimes shed bitter tears over such a knot as i have seen hapless little wretches do tearing at it with their nails and gnawing at it with their teeth knowing that the time was passing when they could hope to hide the fact that they had been in swimming and foreseeing no remedy but to cut off the sleeve above the knot or else put on their clothes without the shirt and trust to untying the knot when it got dry  there must have been a lurking anxiety in all the boys hearts when they went in without leave or as my boy was apt to do when explicitly forbidden he was not apt at lying i dare say and so he took the course of open disobedience he could not see the danger that filled the home hearts with fear for him and he must have often broken the law and been forgiven before justice one day appeared for him on the riverbank and called him away from his stolen joys it was an awful moment and it covered him with shame before his mates who heartlessly rejoiced as children do in the doom which they are escaping that sin at least he fully expiated and i will whisper to the young people here at the end of the chapter that somehow soon or late our sins do overtake us and insist upon being paid for that is not the best reason for not sinning but it is well to know it and to believe it in our acts as well as our thoughts you will find people to tell you that things only happen so and so it may be only i know that no good thing ever happened to happen to me when i had done wrong     skating   i am afraid that the young people will think i am telling them too much about swimming but in the boys town the boys really led a kind of amphibious life and as long as the long summer lasted they were almost as much in the water as on the land the basin however unlike the river had a winter as well as a summer climate and one of the very first things that my boy could remember was being on the ice there he learned to skate but he did not know when any more than he knew just the moment of learning to read or to swim he became passionately fond of skating and kept at it all day long when there was ice for it which was not often in those soft winters they made a very little ice go a long way in the boys town and began to use it for skating as soon as there was a glazing of it on the basin none of them ever got drowned there though a boy would often start from one bank and go flying to the other trusting his speed to save him while the thin sheet sank and swayed but never actually broke under him usually the ice was not thick enough to have a fire built on it and it must have been on ice which was just strong enough to bear that my boy skated all one bitter afternoon at old river without a fire to warm by at first his feet were very cold and then they gradually felt less cold and at last he did not feel them at all he thought this very nice and he told one of the big boys why your feet are frozen said the big boy and he dragged off my boys skates and the little one ran all the long mile home crazed with terror and not knowing what moment his feet might drop off there in the road his mother plunged them in a bowl of icecold water and then rubbed them with flannel and so thawed them out but that could not save him from the pain of their coming to it was intense and there must have been a time afterward when he did not use his feet  his skates themselves were of a sort that i am afraid boys would smile at nowadays when you went to get a pair of skates forty or fifty years ago you did not make your choice between a barney  berry and an acme which fastened on with the turn of a screw or the twist of a clamp you found an assortment of big and little sizes of solid wood bodies with guttered blades turning up in front with a sharp point or perhaps curling over above the toe in this case they sometimes ended in an acorn if this acorn was of brass it transfigured the boy who wore that skate he might have been otherwise all rags and patches but the brass acorn made him splendid from head to foot when you had bought your skates you took them to a carpenter and stood awestrickenly about while he pierced the wood with strapholes or else you managed to bore them through with a hot iron yourself then you took them to a saddler and got him to make straps for them that is if you were rich and your father let you have a quarter to pay for the job if not you put strings through and tied your skates on they were always coming off or getting crosswise of your foot or feeblemindedly slumping down on one side of the wood but it did not matter if you had a fire on the ice fed with old barrels and boards and coopers shavings and could sit round it with your skates on and talk and tell stones between your flights and races afar and come whizzing back to it from the frozen distance and glide with one foot lifted almost among the embers     manners and customs   i sometimes wonder how much these have changed since my boys time of course they differ somewhat from generation to generation and from east to west and north to south but not so much i believe as grown people are apt to think everywhere and always the world of boys is outside of the laws that govern grownup communities and it has its unwritten usages which are handed down from old to young and perpetuated on the same level of years and are lived into and lived out of but are binding through all personal vicissitudes upon the great body of boys between six and twelve years old no boy can violate them without losing his standing among the other boys and he cannot enter into their world without coming under them he must do this and must not do that he obeys but he does not know why any more than the faroff savages from whom his customs seem mostly to have come his world is all in and through the world of men and women but no man or woman can get into it any more than if it were a world of invisible beings it has its own ideals and superstitions and these are often of a ferocity a depravity scarcely credible in afterlife it is a great pity that fathers and mothers cannot penetrate that world but they cannot and it is only by accident that they can catch some glimpse of what goes on in it no doubt it will be civilized in time but it will be very slowly and in the mean while it is only in some of its milder manners and customs that the boys world can be studied  the first great law was that whatever happened to you through another boy whatever hurt or harm he did you you were to right yourself upon his person if you could but if he was too big and you could not hope to revenge yourself then you were to bear the wrong not only for that time but for as many times as he chose to inflict it to tell the teacher or your mother or to betray your tormentor to any one outside of the boys world was to prove yourself a crybaby without honor or selfrespect and unfit to go with the other fellows they would have the right to mock you to point at you and call eee eee eee at you till you fought them after that whether you whipped them or not there began to be some feeling in your favor again and they had to stop  every boy who came to town from somewhere else or who moved into a new neighborhood had to fight the old residents there was no reason for this except that he was a stranger and there appeared to be no other means of making his acquaintance if he was generally whipped he became subject to the local tribe as the delawares were to the iroquois in the last century if he whipped the other boys then they adopted him into their tribe and he became a leader among them when you moved away from a neighborhood you did not lose all your rights in it you did not have to fight when you went back to see the boys or anything but if one of them met you in your new precincts you might have to try conclusions with him and perhaps if he was a boy who had been in the habit of whipping you you were quite ready to do so when my boys family left the smith house one of the boys from that neighborhood came up to see him at the falconer house and tried to carry things with a high hand as he always had done then my boy fought him quite as if he were not a delaware and the other boy not an iroquois with sovereign rights over him my boy was beaten but the difference was that if he had not been on new ground he would have been beaten without daring to fight his mother witnessed the combat and came out and shamed him for his behavior and had in the other boy and made them friends over some sugarcakes but after that the boys of the smith neighborhood understood that my boy would not be whipped without fighting the home instruction was all against fighting my boy was taught that it was not only wicked but foolish that if it was wrong to strike it was just as wrong to strike back that two wrongs never made a right and so on but all this was not of the least effect with a hot temper amid the trials and perplexities of life in the boys town  their fights were mostly informal scuffles on and off in a flash and conducted with none of the ceremony which i have read of concerning the fights of english boys it was believed that some of the fellows knew how to box and all the fellows intended to learn but nobody ever did the fights sprang usually out of some trouble of the moment but at times they were arranged to settle some question of moral or physical superiority then one boy put a chip on his shoulder and dared the other to knock it off it took a great while to bring the champions to blows and i have known the mere preparatory insults of a fight of this kind to wear out the spirit of the combatants and the patience of the spectators so that not a blow was struck finally and the whole affair fell through     girls   though they were so quarrelsome among themselves the boys that my boy went with never molested girls they mostly ignored them but they would have scorned to hurt a girl almost as much as they would have scorned to play with one of course while they were very little they played with girls and after they began to be big boys eleven or twelve years old they began to pay girls some attention but for the rest they simply left them out of the question except at parties when the games obliged them to take some notice of the girls even then however it was not good form for a boy to be greatly interested in them and he had to conceal any little fancy he had about this girl or that unless he wanted to be considered soft by the other fellows when they were having fun they did not want to have any girls around but in the backyard a boy might play teeter or seesaw or some such thing with his sisters and their friends without necessarily losing caste though such things were not encouraged on the other hand a boy was bound to defend them against anything that he thought slighting or insulting and you did not have to verify the fact that anything had been said or done you merely had to hear that it had     mothers   the boys had very little to do with the inside of one anothers houses they would follow a boy to his door and wait for him to come out and they would sometimes get him to go in and ask his mother for crullers or sugarcakes when they came to see him they never went indoors for him but stood on the sidewalk and called him with a peculiar cry something like eoowe eoowe and threw stones at trees or anything till he came out if he did not come after a reasonable time they knew he was not there or that his mother would not let him come a fellow was kept in that way now and then if a fellows mother came to the door the boys always ran  the mother represented the family sovereignty the father was seldom seen and he counted for little or nothing among the outside boys it was the mother who could say whether a boy might go fishing or in swimming and she was held a good mother or not according as she habitually said yes or no there was no other standard of goodness for mothers in the boys world and could be none and a bad mother might be outwitted by any device that the other boys could suggest to her boy such a boy was always willing to listen to any suggestion and no boy took it hard if the other fellows made fun when their plan got him into trouble at home if a boy came out after some such experience with his face wet and his eyes red and his lips swollen of course you had to laugh he expected it and you expected him to stone you for laughing  when a boys mother had company he went and hid till the guests were gone or only came out of concealment to get some sort of shy lunch if the other fellows mothers were there he might be a little bolder and bring out cake from the second table but he had to be pretty careful how he conformed to any of the usages of grownup society a fellow who brushed his hair and put on shoes and came into the parlor when there was company was not well seen among the fellows he was regarded in some degree as a girlboy a boy who wished to stand well with other boys kept in the woodshed and only went in as far as the kitchen to get things for his guests in the backyard yet there were mothers who would make a boy put on a collar when they had company and disgrace him before the world by making him stay round and help they acted as if they had no sense and no pity but such mothers were rare  most mothers yielded to public opinion and let their boys leave the house and wear just what they always wore i have told how little they wore in summer of course in winter they had to put on more things in those days knickerbockers were unknown and if a boy had appeared in short pants and long stockings he would have been thought dressed like a circusactor boys wore long pantaloons like men as soon as they put off skirts and they wore jackets or roundabouts such as the english boys still wear at eton when the cold weather came they had to put on shoes and stockings or rather longlegged boots such as are seen now only among lumbermen and teamsters in the country most of the fellows had stoga boots as heavy as iron and as hard they were splendid to skate in they kept your ankles so stiff sometimes they greased them to keep the water out but they never blacked them except on sunday and before saturday they were as red as a rusty stovepipe at night they were always so wet that you could not get them off without a bootjack and you could hardly do it anyway sometimes you got your brother to help you off with them and then he pulled you all round the room in the morning they were dry but just as hard as stone and you had to soap the heel of your woollen sock which your grandmother had knitted for you or maybe some of your aunts before you could get your foot in and sometimes the ears of the boot that you pulled it on by would give way and you would have to stamp your foot in and kick the toe against the mopboard then you gasped and limped round with your feet like fire till you could get out and limber your boots up in some water somewhere about noon your chilblains began  i have tried to give some notion of the general distribution of comfort which was never riches in the boys town but i am afraid that i could not paint the simplicity of things there truly without being misunderstood in these days of great splendor and great squalor everybody had enough but nobody had too much the richest man in town might be worth twenty thousand dollars there were distinctions among the grown people and no doubt there were the social cruelties which are the modern expression of the savage spirit otherwise repressed by civilization but these were unknown among the boys savages they were but not that kind of savages they valued a boy for his character and prowess and it did not matter in the least that he was ragged and dirty their mothers might not allow him the run of their kitchens quite so freely as some other boys but the boys went with him just the same and they never noticed how little he was washed and dressed the best of them had not an overcoat and underclothing was unknown among them when a boy had buttoned up his roundabout and put on his mittens and tied his comforter round his neck and over his ears he was warmly dressed     a brother   my boy was often kept from being a fool and worse by that elder brother of his and i advise every boy to have an elder brother have a brother about four years older than yourself i should say and if your temper is hot and your disposition revengeful and you are a vain and ridiculous dreamer at the same time that you are eager to excel in feats of strength and games of skill and to do everything that the other fellows do and are ashamed to be better than the worst boy in the crowd your brother can be of the greatest use to you with his larger experience and wisdom my boys brother seemed to have an ideal of usefulness while my boy only had an ideal of gloryto wish to help others while my boy only wished to help himself my boy would as soon have thought of his fathers doing a wrong thing as of his brothers doing it and his brother was a calm light of commonsense of justice of truth while he was a fantastic flicker of gaudy purposes which he wished to make shine before men in their fulfilment his brother was always doing for him and for the younger children while my boy only did for himself he had a very gray mustache before he began to have any conception of the fact that he was sent into the world to serve and to suffer as well as to rule and enjoy but his brother seemed to know this instinctively he bore the yoke in his youth patiently if not willingly he shared the anxieties as he parted the cares of his father and mother yet he was a boy among boys too he loved to swim to skate to fish to forage and passionately above all he loved to hunt but in everything he held himself in check that he might hold the younger boys in check and my boy often repaid his conscientious vigilance with hard words and hard names such as embitter even the most selfforgiving memories he kept mechanically within certain laws and though in his rage he hurled every other name at his brother he would not call him a fool because then he would be in danger of hellfire if he had known just what raca meant he might have called him raca for he was not so much afraid of the council but as it was his brother escaped that insult and held through all a rein upon him and governed him through his scruples as well as his fears  his brother was full of inventions and enterprises beyond most other boys and his undertakings came to the same end of nothingness that awaits all boyish endeavor he intended to make fireworks and sell them he meant to raise silkworms he prepared to take the contract of clearing the new cemetery grounds of stumps by blasting them out with gunpowder besides this he had a plan with another big boy for making money by getting slabs from the sawmill and sawing them up into stovewood and selling them to the cooks of canalboats the only trouble was that the cooks would not buy the fuel even when the boys had a halfcord of it all nicely piled up on the canalbank they would rather come ashore after dark and take it for nothing he had a good many other schemes for getting rich that failed and he wanted to go to california and dig gold only his mother would not consent he really did save the canalbasin once when the banks began to give way after a long rain he saw the break beginning and ran to tell his father who had the firebells rung the fire companies came rushing to the rescue but as they could not put the basin out with their engines they all got shovels and kept it in they did not do this before it had overflowed the street and run into the cellars of the nearest houses the water stood two feet deep in the kitchen of my boys house and the yard was flooded so that the boys made rafts and navigated it for a whole day my boys brother got drenched to the skin in the rain and lots of fellows fell off the rafts  he belonged to a military company of big boys that had real wooden guns such as the little boys never could get and silk oilcloth caps and nankeen roundabouts and white pantaloons with black stripes down the legs and once they marched out to a boys that had a father that had a farm and he gave them all a free dinner in an arbor before the house breadandbutter and applebutter and molasses and pound cake and peaches and apples it was splendid when the excitement about the mexican war was the highest the company wanted a fort and they got a farmer to come and scale off the sod with his plough in a grassy place there was near a piece of woods where a good many cows were pastured they took the pieces of sod and built them up into the walls of a fort about fifteen feet square they intended to build them higher than their heads but they got so eager to have the works stormed that they could not wait and they commenced having the battle when they had the walls only breast high there were going to be two parties one to attack the fort and the other to defend it and they were just going to throw sods but one boy had a real shotgun that he was to load up with powder and fire off when the battle got to the worst so as to have it more like a battle he thought it would be more like yet if he put in a few shot and he did it on his own hook it was a splendid gun but it would not stand cocked long and he was resting it on the wall of the fort ready to fire when the stormingparty came on throwing sods and yelling and holloing and all at once his gun went off and a cow that was grazing broadside to the fort gave a frightened bellow and put up her tail and started for home when they found out that the gun if not the boy had shot a cow the mexicans and americans both took to their heels and it was a good thing they did so for as soon as that cow got home and the owner found out by the blood on her that she had been shot though it was only a very slight wound he was so mad that he did not know what to do and very likely he would have half killed those boys if he had caught them he got a plough and he went out to their fort and he ploughed it all down flat so that not one sod remained upon another  my boys brother went to all sorts of places that my boy was too shy to go to and he associated with much older boys but there was one boy who as i have said was the dear friend of both of them and that was the boy who came to learn the trade in their fathers printingoffice and who began an historical romance at the time my boy began his great moorish novel the first day he came he was put to roll or ink the types while my boys brother worked the press and all day long my boy from where he was setting type could hear him telling the story of a book he had read it was about a person named monte cristo who was a count and who could do anything my boy listened with a gnawing literary jealousy of a boy who had read a book that he had never heard of he tried to think whether it sounded as if it were as great a book as the conquest of granada or gesta romanorum and for a time he kept aloof from this boy because of his envy afterward they came together on don quixote but though my boy came to have quite a passionate fondness for him he was long in getting rid of his grudge against him for his knowledge of monte cristo he was as great a laugher as my boy and his brother and he liked the same sports so that two by two or all three together they had no end of jokes and fun he became the editor of a country newspaper with varying fortunes but steadfast principles and when the war broke out he went as a private soldier he soon rose to be an officer and fought bravely in many battles then he came back to a countrynewspaper office where ever after he continued to fight the battles of right against wrong till he died not long ago at his post of dutya true generous and lofty soul he was one of those boys who grow into the men who seem commoner in america than elsewhere and who succeed far beyond our millionaires and statesmen in realizing the ideal of america in their nobly simple lives if his story could be faithfully written out word for word deed for deed it would be far more thrilling than that of monte cristo or any hero of romance and so would the common story of any common life but we cannot tell these stories somehow     a friend   my boys closest friend was a boy who was probably never willingly at school in his life and who had no more relish of literature or learning in him than the open fields or the warm air of an early spring day i dare say it was a sense of his kinship with nature that took my boy with him and rested his soul from all its wild dreams and vain imaginings he was like a piece of the genial earth with no more hint of toiling or spinning in him willing for anything but passive and without force or aim he lived in a belated logcabin that stood in the edge of a cornfield on the riverbank and he seemed one day when my boy went to find him there to have a mother who smoked a cobpipe and two or three large sisters who hulked about in the one dim low room but the boys had very little to do with each others houses or for that matter with each others yards his friend seldom entered my boys gate and never his door for with all the toleration his father felt for every manner of human creature he could not see what good the boy was to get from this queer companion it is certain that he got no harm for his companion was too vague and void even to think evil socially he was as low as the ground under foot but morally he was as good as any boy in the boys town and he had no bad impulses he had no impulses at all in fact and of his own motion he never did anything or seemed to think anything when he wished to get at my boy he simply appeared in the neighborhood and hung about the outside of the fence till he came out he did not whistle or call eoowe as the other fellows did but waited patiently to be discovered and to be gone off with wherever my boy listed he never had any plans himself and never any will but to go in swimming he neither hunted nor foraged he did not even fish and i suppose that money could not have hired him to run races he played marbles but not very well and he did not care much for the game the two boys soaked themselves in the river together and then they lay on the sandy shore or under some tree and talked but my boy could not have talked to him about any of the things that were in his books or the fume of dreams they sent up in his mind he must rather have soothed against his soft caressing ignorance the ache of his fantastic spirit and reposed his intensity of purpose in that lax and easy aimlessness their friendship was not only more innocent than any other friendship my boy had but it was wholly innocent they loved each other and that was all and why people love one another there is never any satisfactory telling but this friend of his must have had great natural good in him and if i could find a man of the make of that boy i am sure i should love him  my boys other friends wondered at his fondness for him and it was often made a question with him at home if not a reproach to him so that in the course of time it ceased to be that comfort it had been to him he could not give him up but he could not help seeing that he was ignorant and idle and in a fatal hour he resolved to reform him i am not able to say now just how he worked his friend up to the point of coming to school and of washing his hands and feet and face and putting on a new check shirt to come in but one day he came and my boy as he had planned took him into his seat and owned his friendship with him before the whole school this was not easy for though everybody knew how much the two were together it was a different thing to sit with him as if he thought him just as good as any boy and to help him get his lessons and stay him mentally as well as socially he struggled through one day and maybe another but it was a failure from the first moment and my boy breathed freer when his friend came one halfday and then never came again the attempted reform had spoiled their simple and harmless intimacy they never met again upon the old ground of perfect trust and affection perhaps the kindly earthspirit had instinctively felt a wound from the shame my boy had tried to brave out and shrank from their former friendship without quite knowing why perhaps it was my boy who learned to realize that there could be little in common but their common humanity between them and could not go back to that at any rate their friendship declined from this point and it seems to me somehow a pity  among the boys who were between my boy and his brother in age was one whom all the boys liked because he was clever with everybody with little boys as well as big boys he was a laughing pleasant fellow always ready for fun but he never did mean things and he had an open face that made a friend of every one who saw him he had a father that had a house with a lightningrod so that if you were in it when there was a thunderstorm you could not get struck by lightning as my boy once proved by being in it when there was a thunderstorm and not getting struck this in itself was a great merit and there were grapearbors and peachtrees in his yard which added to his popularity with clingstone peaches almost as big as oranges on them he was a fellow who could take you home to meals whenever he wanted to and he liked to have boys stay all night with him his mother was as clever as he was and even the sight of his father did not make the fellows want to go and hide his father was so clever that he went home with my boy one night about midnight when the boy had come to pass the night with his boys and the youngest of them had said he always had the nightmare and walked in his sleep and as likely as not he might kill you before he knew it my boy tried to sleep but the more he reflected upon his chances of getting through the night alive the smaller they seemed and so he woke up his potential murderer from the sweetest and soundest slumber and said he was going home but he was afraid and the boy had to go and wake his father very few fathers would have dressed up and gone home with a boy at midnight and perhaps this one did so only because the mother made him but it shows how clever the whole family was  it was their oldest boy whom my boy and his brother chiefly went with before that boy who knew about monte cristo came to learn the trade in their fathers office one saturday in july they three spent the whole day together it was just the time when the apples are as big as walnuts on the trees and a boy wants to try whether any of them are going to be sweet or not the boys tried a great many of them in an old orchard thrown open for buildinglots behind my boys yard but they could not find any that were not sour or that they could eat till they thought of putting salt on them if you put salt on it you could eat any kind of green apple whether it was going to be a sweet kind or not they went up to the basin bank and got lots of salt out of the holes in the barrels lying there and then they ate all the apples they could hold and after that they cut limber sticks off the trees and sharpened the points and stuck apples on them and threw them you could send an apple almost out of sight that way and you could scare a dog almost as far as you could see him  on monday my boy and his brother went to school but the other boy was not there and in the afternoon they heard he was sick then toward the end of the week they heard that he had the flux and on friday just before school let out the teacherit was the one that whipped so and that the fellows all likedrapped on his desk and began to speak very solemnly to the scholars he told them that their little mate whom they had played with and studied with was lying very sick so very sick that it was expected he would die and then he read them a serious lesson about life and death and tried to make them feel how passing and uncertain all things were and resolve to live so that they need never be afraid to die  some of the fellows cried and the next day some of them went to see the dying boy and my boy went with them his spirit was stricken to the earth when he saw his gay kind playmate lying there white as the pillow under his wasted face in which his sunken blue eyes showed large and strange the sick boy did not say anything that the other boys could hear but they could see the wan smile that came to his dry lips and the light come sadly into his eyes when his mother asked him if he knew this one or that and they could not bear it and went out of the room  in a few days they heard that he was dead and one afternoon school did not keep so that the boys might go to the funeral most of them walked in the procession but some of them were waiting beside the open grave that was dug near the grave of that man who believed there was a hole through the earth from pole to pole and had a perforated stone globe on top of his monument     iii  games and pastimes     marbles   in the boys town they had regular games and plays which came and went in a stated order the first thing in the spring as soon as the frost began to come out of the ground they had marbles which they played till the weather began to be pleasant for the game and then they left it off there were some meanspirited fellows who played for fun but any boy who was anything played for keeps that is keeping all the marbles he won as my boy was skilful at marbles he was able to start out in the morning with his toy or the marble he shot with and a commy or a brown marble of the lowest value and come home at night with a pocketful of whitealleys and bloodalleys striped plasters and bullseyes and crystals clear and clouded his gambling was not approved of at home but it was allowed him because of the hardness of his heart i suppose and because it was not thought well to keep him up too strictly and i suspect it would have been useless to forbid his playing for keeps though he came to have a bad conscience about it before he gave it up there were three kinds of games at marbles which the boys played one with a long ring marked out on the ground and a base some distance off which you began to shoot from another with a round ring whose line formed the base and another with holes three or five hollowed in the earth at equal distances from each other which was called knucks you could play for keeps in all these games and in knucks if you won you had a shot or shots at the knuckles of the fellow who lost and who was obliged to hold them down for you to shoot at fellows who were mean would twitch their knuckles away when they saw your toy coming and run but most of them took their punishment with the savage pluck of so many little sioux as the game began in the raw cold of the earliest spring every boy had chapped hands and nearly every one had the skin worn off the knuckle of his middle finger from resting it on the ground when he shot you could use a knuckledabster of fur or cloth to rest your hand on but is was considered effeminate and in the excitement you were apt to forget it anyway marbles were always very exciting and were played with a clamor as incessant as that of a blackbird roost a great many points were always coming up whether a boy tookup or edged beyond the very place where his toy lay when he shot whether he knuckled down or kept his hand on the ground in shooting whether when another boys toy drove one marble against another and knocked both out of the ring he holloed fen doubs before the other fellow holloed doubs whether a marble was in or out of the ring and whether the umpires decision was just or not the gambling and the quarrelling went on till the secondbell rang for school and began again as soon as the boys could get back to their rings when school let out the rings were usually marked on the ground with a stick but when there was a great hurry or there was no stick handy the side of a fellows boot would do and the hollows for knucks were always bored by twirling round on your bootheel this helped a boy to wear out his boots very rapidly but that was what his boots were made for just as the sidewalks were made for the boys marblerings and a citizens character for cleverness or meanness was fixed by his walking round or over the rings cleverness was used in the virginia sense for amiability a person who was clever in the english sense was smart   races  when the warm weather came on in april and the boys got off their shoes for good there came races in which they seemed to fly on wings life has a good many innocent joys for the human animal but surely none so ecstatic as the boy feels when his bare foot first touches the breast of our mother earth in the spring something thrills through him then from the heart of her inmost being that makes him feel kin with her and cousin to all her dumb children of the grass and trees his blood leaps as wildly as at that kiss of the waters when he plunges into their arms in june there is something even finer and sweeter in the rapture of the earlier bliss the day will not be long enough for his flights his races he aches more with regret than with fatigue when he must leave the happy paths under the stars outside and creep into his bed it is all like some glimpse some foretaste of the heavenly time when the earth and her sons shall be reconciled in a deathless love and they shall not be thankless nor she a stepmother any more  illustration  about the only drawback to going barefoot was stumping your toe which you were pretty sure to do when you first took off your shoes and before you had got used to your new running weight when you struck your toe against a rock or anything you caught it up in your hand and hopped about a hundred yards before you could bear to put it to the ground then you sat down and held it as tight as you could and cried over it till the fellows helped you to the pump to wash the blood off then as soon as you could you limped home for a rag and kept pretty quiet about it so as to get out again without letting on to your mother     a mean trick   there were shadetrees all along the street that you could climb if you wanted to or that you could lie down under when you had run yourself out of breath or play mumblethepeg my boy distinctly remembered that under one of these trees his elder brother first broached to him that awful scheme of reform about fibbing and applied to their own lives the moral of the trippings of tom pepper he remembered how a conviction of the righteousness of the scheme sank into his soul and he could not withhold his consent under the same tree and very likely at the same time a solemn conclave of boys all the boys there were discussed the feasibility of tying a tin can to a dogs tail and seeing how he would act they had all heard of the thing but none of them had seen it and it was not so much a question of whether you ought to do a thing that on the very face of it would be so much fun and if it did not amuse the dog as highly as anybody could certainly do him no harm as it was a question of whose dog you should get to take the dogs part in the sport it was held that an old dog would probably not keep still long enough for you to tie the can on he would have his suspicions or else he would not run when the can was tied on but very likely just go and lie down somewhere the lot finally fell to a young yellow dog belonging to one of the boys and the owner at once ran home to get him and easily lured him back to the other boys with flatteries and caresses the flatteries and caresses were not needed for a dog is always glad to go with boys upon any pretext and so far from thinking that he does them a favor he feels himself greatly honored but i dare say the boy had a guilty fear that if his dog had known why he was invited to be of that party of boys he might have pleaded a previous engagement as it was he came joyfully and allowed the can to be tied to his tail without misgiving if there had been any question with the boys as to whether he would enter fully into the spirit of the affair it must have been instantly dissipated by the dogs behavior when he felt the loop tighten on his tail and looked round to see what the matter was the boys hardly had a chance to cheer him before he flashed out of sight round the corner and they hardly had time to think before he flashed into sight again from the other direction he whizzed along the ground and the can hurtled in the air but there was no other sound and the cheers died away on the boys lips the boy who owned the dog began to cry and the other fellows began to blame him for not stopping the dog but he might as well have tried to stop a streak of lightning the only thing you could do was to keep out of the dogs way as an experiment it was successful beyond the wildest dreams of its projectors though it would have been a sort of relief if the dog had taken some other road for variety or had even reversed his course but he kept on as he began and by a common impulse the boys made up their minds to abandon the whole affair to him they all ran home and hid or else walked about and tried to ignore it but at this point the grownup people began to be interested the mothers came to their doors to see what was the matter yet even the mothers were powerless in a case like that and the enthusiast had to be left to his fate he was found under a barn at last breathless almost lifeless and he tried to bite the man who untied the can from his tail eventually he got well again and lived to be a solemn warning to the boys he was touchingly distrustful of their advances for a time but he finally forgot and forgave everything they did not forget and they never tried tying a tin can to a dogs tail again among all the things they tried and kept trying once was enough and they never even liked to talk of it the sight was so awful they were really fond of the dog and if they could have thought he would take the matter so seriously they would not have tried to have that kind of fun with him it cured them of ever wanting to have that kind of fun with any dog     tops   as the weather softened tops came in some weeks after marbles went out and just after footraces were over and a little before swimming began at first the boys bought their tops at the stores but after a while the boy whose father had the turningshop on the hydraulic learned to turn their tops and did it for nothing which was cheaper than buying tops especially as he furnished the wood too and you only had to get the metal peg yourself i believe he was the same boy who wanted to be a pirate and ended by inventing a steamgovernor he was very ingenious and he knew how to turn a top out of beech or maple that would outspin anything you could get in a store the boys usually chose a firm smooth piece of sidewalk under one of the big trees in the smith neighborhood and spun their tops there a fellow launched his top into the ring and the rest waited till it began to go to sleepthat is to settle in one place and straighten up and spin silently as if standing still then any fellow had a right to peg at it with his top and if he hit it he won it and if he split it as sometimes happened the fellow that owned it had to give him a top the boys came with their pockets bulged out with tops but before long they had to go for more tops to that boy who could turn them from this it was but another step to go to the shop with him and look on while he turned the tops and then in process of time the boys discovered that the smooth floor of the shop was a better place to fight tops than the best piece of sidewalk they would have given whole saturdays to the sport there but when they got to holloing too loudly the boys father would come up and then they would all run it was considered mean in him but the boy himself was awfully clever and the first thing the fellows knew they were back there again some few of the boys had hummingtops but though these pleased by their noise they were not much esteemed and could make no head against the good old turnipshaped tops solid and weighty that you could wind up with a stout cotton cord and launch with perfect aim from the flat button held between your forefinger and middle finger some of the boys had a very pretty art in the twirl they gave the top and could control its course somewhat as a skilful pitcher can govern that of a baseball     kites   i do not know why a certain play went out but suddenly the fellows who had been playing ball or marbles or tops would find themselves playing something else kites came in just about the time of the greatest heat in summer and lasted a good while but could not have lasted as long as the heat which began about the first of june and kept on well through september no play could last so long as that and i suppose kiteflying must have died into swimming after the fourth of july the kites were of various shapes bow kites twostick kites and house kites a bow kite could be made with half a barrel hoop carried over the top of a cross but it was troublesome to make and it did not fly very well and somehow it was thought to look babyish but it was held in greater respect than the twostick kite which only the smallest boys played with and which was made by fastening two sticks in the form of a cross any fellow more than six years old who appeared on the commons with a twostick kite would have been met with jeers as a kind of girl  the favorite kite the kite that balanced best took the wind best and flew best and that would stand all day when you got it up was the house kite which was made of three sticks and shaped nearly in the form of the gable of a gambrelroofed house only smaller at the base than at the point where the roof would begin the outline of all these kites was given and the sticks stayed in place by a string carried taut from stick to stick which was notched at the ends to hold it sometimes the sticks were held with a tack at the point of crossing and sometimes they were mortised into one another but this was apt to weaken them the frame was laid down on a sheet of paper and the paper was cut an inch or two larger and then pasted and folded over the string most of the boys used a paste made of flour and cold water but my boy and his brother could usually get paste from the printingoffice and when they could not they would make it by mixing flour and water creamthick and slowly boiling it that was a paste that would hold till the cows came home the boys said and my boy was courted for his skill in making it but after the kite was pasted and dried in the sun or behind the kitchen stove if you were in very much of a hurry and you nearly always were it had to be hung with bellybands and tailbands that is with strings carried from stick to stick over the face and at the bottom to attach the cord for flying it and to fasten on the tail by this took a good deal of art and unless it were well done the kite would not balance but would be always pitching and darting then the tail had to be of just the right weight if it was too heavy the kite kept sinking even after you got it up where otherwise it would stand if too light the kite would dart and dash itself to pieces on the ground a very pretty tail was made by tying twists of paper across a string a foot apart till there were enough to balance the kite but this sort of tail was apt to get tangled and the best tail was made of a long streamer of cotton rags with a gay tuft of dogfennel at the end dogfennel was added or taken away till just the right weight was got and when this was done after several experimental tests the kite was laid flat on its face in the middle of the road or on a long stretch of smooth grass the bands were arranged and the tail stretched carefully out behind where it would not catch on bushes you unwound a great length of twine running backward and letting the twine slip swiftly through your hands till you had run enough out then you seized the ball and with one look over your shoulder to see that all was right started swiftly forward the kite reared itself from the ground and swaying gracefully from side to side rose slowly into the air with its long tail climbing after it till the fennel tuft swung free if there was not much surface wind you might have to run a little way but as soon as the kite caught the upper currents it straightened itself pulled the twine taut and steadily mounted while you gave it more and more twine if the breeze was strong the cord burned as it ran through your hands till at last the kite stood still in the sky at such a height that the cord holding it sometimes melted out of sight in the distance  if it was a hot july day the sky would be full of kites and the commons would be dotted over with boys holding them or setting them up or winding them in and all talking and screaming at the tops of their voices under the roasting sun one might think that kiteflying at least could be carried on quietly and peaceably but it was not besides the wild debate of the rival excellences of the different kites there were always quarrels from getting the strings crossed for as the boys got their kites up they drew together for company and for an easier comparison of their merits it was only a mean boy who would try to cross another fellows string but sometimes accidents would happen two kites would become entangled and both would have to be hauled in while their owners cried and scolded and the other fellows cheered and laughed now and then the tail of a kite would part midway and then the kite would begin to dart violently from side to side and then to whirl round and round in swifter and narrower circles till it dashed itself to the ground sometimes the kitestring would break and the kite would waver and fall like a bird shot in the wing and the owner of the kite and all the fellows who had no kites would run to get it where it came down perhaps a mile or more away it usually came down in a tree and they had to climb for it but sometimes it lodged so high that no one could reach it and then it was slowly beaten and washed away in the winds and rains and its long tail left streaming all winter from the naked bough where it had caught it was so good for kites on the commons because there were no trees there and not even fences but a vast open stretch of level grass which the cows and geese kept cropped to the earth and for the most part the boys had no trouble with their kites there some of them had paper fringe pasted round the edges of their kites this made a fine rattling as the kite rose and when the kite stood at the end of its string you could hear the humming if you put your ear to the twine but the most fun was sending up messengers the messengers were cut out of thick paper with a slit at one side so as to slip over the string which would be pulled level long enough to give the messenger a good start and then released when the wind would catch the little circle and drive it up the long curving incline till it reached the kite  it was thought a great thing in a kite to pull and it was a favor to another boy to let him take hold of your string and feel how your kite pulled if you wanted to play mumblethepeg or anything while your kite was up you tied it to a stake in the ground or gave it to some other fellow to hold there were always lots of fellows eager to hold it but you had to be careful how you let a little fellow hold it for if it was a very powerful kite it would take him up it was not certain just how strong a kite had to be to take a small boy up and nobody had ever seen a kite do it but everybody expected to see it     the butler guards   the butler guards were the finest military company in the world i do not believe there was a fellow in the boys town who even tried to imagine a more splendid body of troops when they talked of them as they did a great deal it was simply to revel in the recognition of their perfection i forget just what their uniform was but there were white pantaloons in it and a tuft of whiteandred cockerel plumes that almost covered the front of the hat and swayed when the soldier walked and blew in the wind i think the coat was gray and the skirts were buttoned back with buff but i will not be sure of this and somehow i cannot say how the officers differed from the privates in dress it was impossible for them to be more magnificent they walked backward in front of the platoons with their swords drawn and held in their whitegloved hands at hilt and point and kept holloing shoulderrrarms carryarms presentarms and then faced round and walked a few steps forward till they could think of something else to make the soldiers do  illustration the butler guards  every boy intended to belong to the butler guards when he grew up and he would have given anything to be the drummer or the marker these were both boys and they were just as much dressed up as the guards themselves only they had caps instead of hats with plumes it was strange that the other fellows somehow did not know who these boys were but they never knew or at least my boy never knew they thought more of the marker than of the drummer for the marker carried a little flag and when the officers holloed out by the left flankleft wheel he set his flag against his shoulder and stood marking time with his feet till the soldiers all got by him and then he ran up to the front rank with the flag fluttering behind him the fellows used to wonder how he got to be marker and to plan how they could get to be markers in other companies if not in the butler guards there were other companies that used to come to town on the fourth of july and muster day from smaller places round about and some of them had richer uniforms one company had blue coats with gold epaulets and gold braid going down in loops on the sides of their legs all the soldiers of course had braid straight down the outer seams of their pantaloons one muster day a captain of one of the country companies came home with my boys father to dinner he was in full uniform and he put his plumed helmet down on the entry table just like any other hat  there was a company of germans or dutchmen as the boys always called them and the boys believed that they each had hay in his right shoe and straw in his left because a dutchman was too dumb as the boys said for stupid to know his feet apart any other way and that the dutch officers had to call out to the men when they were marching up mit de hayfoot down mit de strawfootlinks links links left left left but the boys honored even these imperfect intelligences so much in their quality of soldiers that they would any of them have been proud to be marker in the dutch company and they followed the dutchmen round in their march as fondly as any other body of troops of course school let out when there was a regular muster and the boys gave the whole day to it but i do not know just when the muster day came they fired the cannon a good deal on the riverbank and they must have camped somewhere near the town though no recollection of tents remained in my boys mind he believed with the rest of the boys that the right way to fire the cannon was to get it so hot you need not touch it off but just keep your thumb on the touchhole and take it away when you wanted the cannon to go off once he saw the soldiers ram the piece full of dogfennel on top of the usual charge and then he expected the cannon to burst but it only roared away as usual     pets  illustration   as there are no longer any whig boys in the world the coon can no longer be kept anywhere as a political emblem i dare say even in my boys time the boys kept coons just for the pleasure of it and without meaning to elect whig governors and presidents with them i do not know how they got themthey traded for them perhaps with fellows in the country that had caught them or perhaps their fathers bought them in market some people thought they were very good to eat and like poultry and other things for the table they may have been brought alive to market but anyhow when a boy had a coon he had to have a storebox turned open side down to keep it in behind the house and he had to have a little door in the box to pull the coon out through when he wanted to show it to other boys or to look at it himself which he did forty or fifty times a day when he first got it he had to have a small collar for the coon and a little chain because the coon would gnaw through a string in a minute the coon himself never seemed to take much interest in keeping a coon or to see much fun or sense in it he liked to stay inside his box where he had a bed of hay and whenever the boy pulled him out he did his best to bite the boy he had no tricks his temper was bad and there was nothing about him except the rings round his tail and his political principles that anybody could care for he never did anything but bite and try to get away or else run back into his box which smelled pretty soon like an animalshow he would not even let a fellow see him eat  my boys brother had a coon which he kept a good while at a time when there was no election for the mere satisfaction of keeping a coon during his captivity the coon bit his keeper repeatedly through the thumb and upon the whole seemed to prefer him to any other food i do not really know what coons eat in a wild state but this captive coon tasted the blood of nearly that whole family of children besides biting and getting away he never did the slightest thing worth remembering as there was no election he did not even take part in a whig procession he got away two or three times the first thing his owner would know when he pulled the chain out was that there was no coon at the end of it and then he would have to poke round the inside of the box pretty carefully with a stick so as not to get bitten after that he would have to see which tree the coon had gone up it was usually the tall locusttree in front of the house and in about half a second all the boys in town would be there telling the owner of the coon how to get him of course the only way was to climb for the coon which would be out at the point of a high and slender limb and would bite you awfully even if the limb did not break under you while the boys kept whooping and yelling and holloing out what to do and tip the dog just howled with excitement i do not know how that coon was ever caught but i know that the last time he got away he was not found during the day but after nightfall he was discovered by moonlight in the locusttree his owner climbed for him but the coon kept shifting about and getting higher and higher and at last he had to be left till morning in the morning he was not there nor anywhere  it had been expected perhaps that tip would watch him and grab him if he came down and tip would have done it probably if he had kept awake he was a dog of the greatest courage and he was especially fond of hunting he had been bitten oftener by that coon than anybody but the coons owner but he did not care for biting he was always getting bitten by rats but he was the greatest dog for rats that there almost ever was the boys hunted rats with him at night when they came out of the stables that backed down to the hydraulic for water and a dog who liked above all things to lie asleep on the backstep by day and would no more think of chasing a pig out of the garden than he would think of sitting up all night with a coon would get frantic about rats and would perfectly wear himself out hunting them on land and in the water and keep on after the boys themselves were tired he was so fond of hunting anyway that the sight of a gun would drive him about crazy he would lick the barrel all over and wag his tail so hard that it would lift his hind legs off the ground  i do not know how he came into that family but i believe he was given to it full grown by somebody it was some time after my boy failed to buy what he called a confoundland dog from a colored boy who had it for sale a pretty puppy with white and black spots which he had quite set his heart on but tip more than consoled him tip was of no particular breed and he had no personal beauty he was of the color of a mouse or an elephant and his tail was without the smallest grace it was smooth and round but it was so strong that he could pull a boy all over the town by it and usually did and he had the best and kindest and truest ugly old face in the world he loved the whole human race and as a watchdog he was a failure through his trustful nature he would no more have bitten a person than he would have bitten a pig but where other dogs were concerned he was a lion he might be lying fast asleep in the backyard and he usually was but if a dog passed the front of the house under a wagon he would be up and after that dog before you knew what you were about he seemed to want to fight country dogs the worst but any strange dog would do a good half the time he would come off best but however he came off he returned to the backyard with his tongue hanging out and wagging his tail in goodhumor with all the world nothing could stop him however where strange dogs were concerned he was a whig dog of course as any one could tell by his name which was tippecanoe in full and was given him because it was the nickname of general harrison the great whig who won the battle of tippecanoe the boys henry clay club used him to pull the little wagon that they went about in singing whig songs and he would pull five or six boys guided simply by a stick which he held in his mouth and which a boy held on either side of him but if he caught sight of a dog that he did not know he would drop that stick and start for that dog as far off as he could see him spilling the henry clay club out of the wagon piecemeal as he went and never stopping till he mixed up the strange dog in a fight where it would have been hard to tell which was either champion and which was the club wagon when the fight was over tip would come smilingly back to the fragments of the henry clay club with pieces of the vehicle sticking about him and profess himself in a dogs way ready to go on with the concert  any crowd of boys could get tip to go off with them in swimming or hunting or simply running races he was known through the whole town and beloved for his many endearing qualities of heart as to his mind it was perhaps not much to brag of and he certainly had some defects of character he was incurably lazy and his laziness grew upon him as he grew older till hardly anything but the sight of a gun or a bone would move him he lost his interest in politics and though there is no reason to suppose that he ever became indifferent to his principles it is certain that he no longer showed his early ardor he joined the freesoil movement in 1848 and supported van buren and adams but without the zeal he had shown for henry clay once a year as long as the family lived in the boys town the children were anxious about tip when the doglaw was put in force and the constables went round shooting all the dogs that were found running at large without muzzles at this time when tip was in danger of going mad and biting people he showed a most unseasonable activity and could hardly be kept in bounds a dog whose sole delight at other moments was to bask in the summer sun or dream by the winter fire would now rouse himself to an interest in everything that was going on in the dangerous world and make forays into it at all unguarded points the only thing to do was to muzzle him and this was done by my boys brother with a piece of heavy twine in such a manner as to interfere with tips happiness as little as possible it was a muzzle that need not be removed for either eating drinking or fighting but it satisfied the law and tip always came safely through the dogdays perhaps by favor or affection with the officers who were so inexorable with some dogs  while tip was still in his prime the family of children was further enriched by the possession of a goat but this did not belong to the whole family or it was at least nominally the property of that eldest brother they all looked up to i do not know how they came by the goat any more than i know how they came by tip i only know that there came a time when it was already in the family and that before it was got rid of it was a presence there was no mistaking nobody who has not kept a goat can have any notion of how many different kinds of mischief a goat can get into without seeming to try either but merely by following the impulses of its own goatishness this one was a nannygoat and it answered to the name of nanny with an intelligence that was otherwise wholly employed in making trouble it went up and down stairs from cellar to garret and in and out of all the rooms like anybody with a faint cynical indifference in the glance of its cold gray eyes that gave no hint of its purposes or performances in the chambers it chewed the sheets and pillowcases on the beds and in the diningroom if it found nothing else it would do its best to eat the tablecloth washingday was a perfect feast for it for then it would banquet on the shirtsleeves and stockings that dangled from the clothesline and simply glut itself with the family linen and cotton in default of these dainties nanny would gladly eat a chiphat she was not proud she would eat a splitbasket if there was nothing else at hand once she got up on the kitchen table and had a perfect orgy with a lot of freshbaked pumpkinpies she found there she cleaned all the pumpkin so neatly out of the pastry shells that if there had been any more pumpkin left they could have been filled up again and nobody could have told the difference the grandmother who was visiting in the house at the time declared to the mother that it would serve the father and the boys just right if she did fill these very shells up and give them to the father and the boys to eat but i believe this was not done and it was only suggested in a moment of awful exasperation and because it was the father who was to blame for letting the boys keep the goat the mother was always saying that the goat should not stay in the house another day but she had not the heart to insist on its banishment the children were so fond of it i do not know why they were fond of it for it never showed them the least affection but was always taking the most unfair advantages of them and it would butt them over whenever it got the chance it would try to butt them into the well when they leaned down to pull up the bucket from the curb and if it came out of the house and saw a boy cracking nuts at the low flat stone the children had in the backyard to crack nuts on it would pretend that the boy was making motions to insult it and before he knew what he was about it would fly at him and send him spinning head over heels it was not of the least use in the world and could not be but the children were allowed to keep it till one fatal day when the mother had a number of other ladies to tea as the fashion used to be in small towns when they sat down to a comfortable gossip over dainty dishes of stewed chicken hot biscuit peachpreserves sweet tomatopickles and poundcake that day they all laid off their bonnets on the hall table and the goat after demurely waiting and watching with its faded eyes which saw everything and seemed to see nothing discerned a golden opportunity and began to make such a supper of bonnetribbons as perhaps never fell to a goats lot in life before it was detected in its stolen joys just as it had chewed the ribbon of a best bonnet up to the bonnet and was chased into the backyard but as it had swallowed the ribbon without being able to swallow the bonnet it carried that with it the boy who specially owned the goat ran it down in a frenzy of horror and apprehension and managed to unravel the ribbon from its throat and get back the bonnet then he took the bonnet in and laid it carefully down on the table again and decided that it would be best not to say anything about the affair but such a thing as that could not be kept the goat was known at once to have done the mischief and this time it was really sent away all the children mourned it and the boy who owned it the most used to go to the house of the people who took it and who had a high board fence round their yard and try to catch sight of it through the cracks when he called nanny it answered him instantly with a plaintive baa and then after a vain interchange of lamentations he had to come away and console himself as he could with the pets that were left him  but all were trifling joys except maybe tip and nanny compared with the pony which the boys owned in common and which was the greatest thing that ever came into their lives i cannot tell just how their father came to buy it for them or where he got it but i dare say he thought they were about old enough for a pony and might as well have one it was a mexican pony and as it appeared on the scene just after the mexican war some volunteer may have brought it home one volunteer brought home a mexican dog that was smooth and hairless with a skin like an elephant and that was always shivering round with the cold he was not otherwise a remarkable dog and i do not know that he ever felt even the warmth of friendship among the boys his manners were reserved and his temper seemed doubtful but the pony never had any trouble with the climate of southern ohio which is indeed hot enough to fry a salamander in summer and though his temper was no better than other ponies he was perfectly approachable i mean that he was approachable from the side for it was not well to get where he could bite you or kick you he was of a bright sorrel color and he had a brand on one haunch  my boy had an ideal of a pony conceived from pictures in his readingbooks at school that held its head high and arched its neck and he strove by means of checks and martingales to make this real pony conform to the illustrations but it was of no use the real pony held his neck straight out like a ewe or if reined up like a camel and he hung his big head at the end of it with no regard whatever for the ideal his caparison was another mortification and failure what the boy wanted was an english saddle embroidered on the morocco seat in crimson silk and furnished with shining steel stirrups what he had was the framework of a mexican saddle covered with rawhide and cushioned with a blanket the stirrups were mexican too and clumsily fashioned out of wood the boys were always talking about getting their father to get them a pad but they never did it and they managed as they could with the saddle they had for the most part they preferred to ride the pony barebacked for then they could ride him double and when they first got him they all wanted to ride him so much that they had to ride him double they kept him going the whole day long but after a while they calmed down enough to take him one at a time and to let him have a chance for his meals  they had no regular stable and the father left the boys to fit part of the cowshed up for the pony which they did by throwing part of the hencoop open into it the pigeoncots were just over his head and he never could have complained of being lonesome at first everybody wanted to feed him as well as ride him and if he had been allowed time for it he might have eaten himself to death or if he had not always tried to bite you or kick you when you came in with his corn after a while the boys got so they forgot him and nobody wanted to go out and feed the pony especially after dark but he knew how to take care of himself and when he had eaten up everything there was in the cowshed he would break out and eat up everything there was in the yard  the boys got lots of good out of him when you were once on his back you were pretty safe for he was so lazy that he would not think of running away and there was no danger unless he bounced you off when he trotted he had a hard trot the boys wanted to ride him standing up like circusactors and the pony did not mind but the boys could not stay on though they practised a good deal turn about when the other fellows were riding their horses standing up on the commons he was not of much use in indian fights for he could seldom be lashed into a gallop and a pony that proposed to walk through an indian fight was ridiculous still with the help of imagination my boy employed him in some scenes of wild arab life and hurled the moorish javelin from him in midcareer when the pony was flying along at the mad pace of a canalboat the pony early gave the boys to understand that they could get very little out of him in the way of herding the family cow he would let them ride him to the pasture and he would keep up with the cow on the way home when she walked but if they wanted anything more than that they must get some other pony they tried to use him in carrying papers but the subscribers objected to having him ridden up to their front doors over the sidewalk and they had to give it up  when he became an old story and there was no competition for him among the brothers my boy sometimes took him into the woods and rode him in the wandering bridlepaths with a thrilling sense of adventure he did not like to be alone there and he oftener had the company of a boy who was learning the trade in his fathers printingoffice this boy was just between him and his elder brother in age and he was the good comrade of both all the family loved him and made him one of them and my boy was fond of him because they had some tastes in common that were not very common among the other boys they liked the same books and they both began to write historical romances my boys romance was founded on facts of the conquest of granada which he had read of again and again in washington irving with a passionate pity for the moors and yet with pride in the grave and noble spaniards he would have given almost anything to be a spaniard and he lived in a dream of some day sallying out upon the vega before granada in silk and steel with an arabian charger under him that champed its bit in the mean time he did what he could with the family pony and he had long rides in the woods with the other boy who used to get his fathers horse when he was not using it on sunday and race with him through the dangling wild grapevines and pawpaw thickets and over the reedy levels of the river their hearts both bounding with the same high hopes of a world that could never come true     indians   there was not a boy in the boys town who would not gladly have turned from the town and lived in the woods if his mother had let him and in every vague plan of running off the forest had its place as a city of refuge from pursuit and recapture the pioneer days were still so close to those times that the love of solitary adventure which took the boys fathers into the sylvan wastes of the great west might well have burned in the boys hearts and if their ideal of life was the free life of the woods no doubt it was because their near ancestors had lived it at any rate that was their ideal and they were always talking among themselves of how they would go farther west when they grew up and be trappers and hunters i do not remember any boy but one who meant to be a sailor they lived too hopelessly far from the sea and i dare say the boy who invented the marineengine governor and who wished to be a pirate would just as soon have been a bandit of the osage in those days oregon had just been opened to settlers and the boys all wanted to go and live in oregon where you could stand in your door and shoot deer and wild turkey while a salmon big enough to pull you in was tugging away at the line you had set in the river that ran before the logcabin  if they could the boys would rather have been indians than anything else but as there was really no hope of this whatever they were willing to be settlers and fight the indians they had rather a mixed mind about them in the mean time but perhaps they were not unlike other idolaters in both fearing and adoring their idols perhaps they came pretty near being indians in that and certainly they came nearer than they knew when they played war and the war was between the whites and the indians it was almost as low a thing to be white as it was to be british when there were americans on the other side in either case you had to be beaten the boys lived in the desire if not the hope of some time seeing an indian and they made the most of the indians in the circus whom they knew to be just white men dressed up but none of them dreamed that what really happened one day could ever happen this was at the arrival of several canalboat loads of genuine indians from the wyandot reservation in the northwestern part of the state on their way to new lands beyond the mississippi the boys fathers must have known that these indians were coming but it just shows how stupid the most of fathers are that they never told the boys about it all at once there the indians were as if the canalboats had dropped with them out of heaven there they were crowding the decks in their blankets and moccasins braves and squaws and pappooses standing about or squatting in groups not saying anything and looking exactly like the pictures the squaws had the pappooses on their backs and the men and boys had bows and arrows in their hands and as soon as the boats landed the indians all except the squaws and pappooses came ashore and went up to the courthouse yard and began to shoot with their bows and arrows it almost made the boys crazy  illustration all at once there the indians were  of course they would have liked to have the indians shoot at birds or some game but they were mighty glad to have them shoot at cents and bits and quarters that anybody could stick up in the ground the indians would all shoot at the mark till some one hit it and the one who hit it had the money whatever it was the boys ran and brought back the arrows and they were so proud to do this that i wonder they lived through it my boy was too bashful to bring the indians their arrows he could only stand apart and long to approach the filthy savages whom he revered to have touched the border of one of their blankets would have been too much some of them were rather handsome and two or three of the indian boys were so pretty that the boys town boys said they were girls they were of all ages from old withered men to children of six or seven but they were all alike grave and unsmiling the old men were not a whit more dignified than the children and the children did not enter into their sport with more zeal and ardor than the wrinkled sages who shared it in fact they were old and young alike savages and the boys who looked on and envied them were savages in their ideal of a world where people spent their lives in hunting and fishing and ranging the woods and never grew up into the toils and cares that can alone make men of boys they wished to escape these as many foolish persons do among civilized nations and they thought if they could only escape them they would be happy they did not know that they would be merely savage and that the great difference between a savage and a civilized man is work they would all have been willing to follow these indians away into the far west where they were going and be barbarians for the rest of their days and the wonder is that some of the fellows did not try it     guns   after the red men had flitted away like red leaves their memory remained with the boys and a plague of bows and arrows raged among them and it was a good while before they calmed down to their old desire of having a gun but they came back to that at last for that was the normal desire of every boy in the boys town who was not a girlboy and there were mighty few girlboys there up to a certain point a pistol would do especially if you had bulletmoulds and could run bullets to shoot out of it only your mother would be sure to see you running them and just as likely as not would be so scared that she would say you must not shoot bullets then you would have to use buckshot if you could get them anywhere near the right size or small marbles but a pistol was always a makeshift and you never could hit anything with it not even a board fence it always kicked or burst or something  very few boys ever came to have a gun though they all expected to have one but seven or eight boys would go hunting with one shotgun and take turnabout shooting some of the little fellows never got to shoot at all but they could run and see whether the big boys had hit anything when they fired and that was something this was my boys privilege for a long time before he had a gun of his own and he went patiently with his elder brother and never expected to fire the gun except perhaps to shoot the load off before they got back to town they were not allowed to bring the gun home loaded it was a gun that was pretty safe for anything in front of it but you never could tell what it was going to do it began by being simply an old gunbarrel which my boys brother bought of another boy who was sick of it for a fip as the halfreal piece was called and it went on till it got a lock from one gunsmith and a stock from another and was a complete gun but this took time perhaps a month for the gunsmiths would only work at it in their leisure they were delinquent subscribers and they did it in part pay for their papers when they got through with it my boys brother made himself a ramrod out of a straight piece of hickory or at least as straight as the gunbarrel which was rather swaybacked and had a little twist to one side so that one of the jour printers said it was a firstrate gun to shoot round a corner with then he made himself a powderflask out of an oxhorn that he got and boiled till it was soft it smelt the whole house up and then scraped thin with a piece of glass it hung at his side and he carried his shot in his pantaloons pocket he went hunting with this gun for a good many years but he had never shot anything with it when his uncle gave him a smoothbore rifle and he in turn gave his gun to my boy who must then have been nearly ten years old  it seemed to him that he was quite old enough to have a gun but he was mortified the very next morning after he got it by a citizen who thought differently he had risen at daybreak to go out and shoot kildees on the common and he was hurrying along with his gun on his shoulder when the citizen stopped him and asked him what he was going to do with that gun he said to shoot kildees and he added that it was his gun this seemed to surprise the citizen even more than the boy could have wished he asked him if he did not think he was a pretty small boy to have a gun and he took the gun from him and examined it thoughtfully and then handed it back to the boy who felt himself getting smaller all the time the man went his way without saying anything more but his behavior was somehow so sarcastic that the boy had no pleasure in his sport that morning partly perhaps because he found no kildees to shoot at on the common he only fired off his gun once or twice at a fence and then he sneaked home with it through alleys and byways and whenever he met a person he hurried by for fear the person would find him too small to have a gun  afterward he came to have a bolder spirit about it and he went hunting with it a good deal it was a very curious kind of gun you had to snap a good many caps on it sometimes before the load would go off and sometimes it would hang fire and then seem to recollect itself and go off maybe just when you were going to take it down from your shoulder the barrel was so crooked that it could not shoot straight but this was not the only reason why the boy never hit anything with it he could not shut his left eye and keep his right eye open so he had to take aim with both eyes or else with the left eye which was worse yet till one day when he was playing shinny or hockey at school and got a blow over his left eye from a shinnystick at first he thought his eye was put out he could not see for the blood that poured into it from the cut above it he ran homeward wild with fear but on the way he stopped at a pump to wash away the blood and then he found his eye was safe it suddenly came into his mind to try if he could not shut that eye now and keep the right one open he found that he could do it perfectly by help of his handkerchief he stanched his wound and made himself presentable with the glassy pool before the pump for a mirror and went joyfully back to school he kept trying his left eye to make sure it had not lost its newfound art and as soon as school was out he hurried home to share the joyful news with his family  he went hunting the very next saturday and at the first shot he killed a bird it was a suicidal sapsucker which had suffered him to steal upon it so close that it could not escape even the vagaries of that wandering gunbarrel and was blown into such small pieces that the boy could bring only a few feathers of it away in the evening when his father came home he showed him these trophies of the chase and boasted of his exploit with the minutest detail his father asked him whether he had expected to eat this sapsucker if he could have got enough of it together he said no sapsuckers were not good to eat then you took its poor little life merely for the pleasure of killing it said the father was it a great pleasure to see it die the boy hung his head in shame and silence it seemed to him that he would never go hunting again of course he did go hunting often afterward but his brother and he kept faithfully to the rule of never killing anything that they did not want to eat to be sure they gave themselves a wide range they were willing to eat almost anything that they could shoot even blackbirds which were so abundant and so easy to shoot but there were some things which they would have thought it not only wanton but wicked to kill like turtledoves which they somehow believed were sacred nor robins either because robins were hallowed by poetry and they kept about the house and were almost tame so that it seemed a shame to shoot them they were very plentiful and so were the turtledoves which used to light on the basin bank and pick up the grain scattered there from the boats and wagons  there were a good many things you could do with a gun you could fire your ramrod out of it and see it sail through the air you could fill the muzzle up with water on top of a charge and send the water in a straight column at a fence the boys all believed that you could fire that column of water right through a man and they always wanted to try whether it would go through a cow but they were afraid the owner of the cow would find it out there was a good deal of pleasure in cleaning your gun when it got so foul that your ramrod stuck in it and you could hardly get it out you poured hot water into the muzzle and blew it through the nipple till it began to show clear then you wiped it dry with soft rags wound on your gunscrew and then oiled it with greasy tow sometimes the tow would get loose from the screw and stay in the barrel and then you would have to pick enough powder in at the nipple to blow it out of course i am talking of the old muzzleloading shotgun which i dare say the boys never use nowadays  but the great pleasure of all in hunting was getting home tired and footsore in the evening and smelling the supper almost as soon as you came in sight of the house there was nearly always hot biscuit for supper with steak and with coffee such as nobody but a boys mother ever knew how to make and just as likely as not there was some kind of preserves at any rate there was applebutter you could hardly take the time to wash the powdergrime off your hands and face before you rushed to the table and if you had brought home a yellowhammer you left it with your gun on the back porch and perhaps the cat got it and saved you the trouble of cleaning it a cat can clean a bird a good deal quicker than a boy can and she does not hate to do it half as badly  next to the pleasure of getting home from hunting late was the pleasure of starting early as my boy and his brother sometimes did to shoot ducks on the little reservoir in the fall his brother had an alarmclock which he set at about four and he was up the instant it rang and pulling my boy out of bed where he would rather have stayed than shot the largest mallard duck in the world they raked the ashes off the bed of coals in the fireplace and while the embers ticked and bristled and flung out little showers of sparks they hustled on their clothes and ran down the back stairs into the yard with their guns  tip the dog was already waiting for them there for he seemed to know they were going that morning and he began whimpering for joy and twisting himself sideways up against them and nearly wagging his tail off and licking their hands and faces and kissing their guns all over he was about crazy when they started he knew where they were going and he rushed ahead through the silent little sleeping town and led the way across the wide commons where the cows lay in dim bulks on the grass and the geese waddled out of his way with wild clamorous cries till they came in sight of the reservoir then tip fell back with my boy and let the elder brother go ahead for he always had a right to the first shot and while he dodged down behind the bank and crept along to the place where the ducks usually were my boy kept a hold on tips collar and took in the beautiful mystery of the early morning the place so familiar by day was estranged to his eyes in that pale light and he was glad of old tips company for it seemed a time when there might very well be ghosts about the water stretched a sheet of smooth gray silver with little tufts of mist on its surface and through these at last he could see the ducks softly gliding to and fro and he could catch some dreamy sound from them his heart stood still and then jumped wildly in his breast as the still air was startled with the rush of wings and the water broke with the plunge of other flocks arriving then he began to make those bets with himself that a boy hopes he will lose he bet that his brother would not hit any of them he bet that he did not even see them he bet that if he did see them and got a shot at them they would not come back so that he could get a chance himself to kill any it seemed to him that he had to wait an hour and just when he was going to hollo and tell his brother where the ducks were the old smoothbore sent out a red flash and a white puff before he heard the report tip tore loose from his grasp and he heard the splashing rise of the ducks and the hurtling rush of their wings and he ran forward yelling how many did you hit where are they where are you are they coming back its my turn now and making an outcry that would have frightened away a fleet of ironclads but much less a flock of ducks  one shot always ended the mornings sport and there were always good reasons why this shot never killed anything     nutting   the woods were pretty full of the kind of hickorytrees called pignuts and the boys gathered the nuts and even ate their small bitter kernels and around the poorhouse woods there were some shagbarks but the boys did not go for them because of the bull and the crazy people their great and constant reliance in foraging was the abundance of black walnuts which grew everywhere along the roads and on the riverbanks as well as in the woods and the pastures long before it was time to go walnutting the boys began knocking off the nuts and trying whether they were ripe enough and just as soon as the kernels began to fill out the fellows began making walnut wagons i do not know why it was thought necessary to have a wagon to gather walnuts but i know that it was and that a boy had to make a new wagon every year  no boys walnut wagon could last till the next year it did very well if it lasted till the next day he had to make it nearly all with his pocketknife he could use a saw to block the wheels out of a pine board and he could use a hatchet to rough off the corners of the blocks but he had to use his knife to give them any sort of roundness and they were not very round then they were apt to be oval in shape and they always wabbled he whittled the axles out with his knife and he made the hubs with it he could get a tongue readymade if he used a broomhandle or a hooppole but that had in either case to be whittled so it could be fastened to the wagon he even bored the linchpin holes with his knife if he could not get a gimlet and if he could not get an auger he bored the holes through the wheels with a redhot poker and then whittled them large enough with his knife he had to use pine for nearly everything because any other wood was too hard to whittle and then the pine was always splitting it split in the axles when he was making the linchpin holes and the wheels had to be kept on by linchpins that were tied in the wheels themselves split and had to be strengthened by slats nailed across the rifts the wagonbed was a candlebox nailed to the axles and that kept the front axle tight so that it took the whole width of a street to turn a very little wagon in without upsetting  when the wagon was all done the boy who owned it started off with his brothers or some other boys who had no wagon to gather walnuts he started early in the morning of some bright autumn day while the frost still bearded the grass in the backyard and bristled on the fencetops and the roof of the woodshed and hurried off to the woods so as to get there before the other boys had got the walnuts the best place for them was in some woodspasture where the trees stood free of one another and around them in among the tall frosty grass the tumbled nuts lay scattered in groups of twos and threes or fives some still yellowishgreen in their hulls and some black but all sending up to the nostrils of the delighted boy the incense of their clean keen wildwoody smell to be a memory forever  illustration nutting  the leaves had dropped from the trees overhead and the branches outlined themselves against the blue sky and dangled from their outer stems clusters of the unfallen fruit as large as oranges and only wanting a touch to send them plumping down into the grass where sometimes their fat hulls burst and the nuts almost leaped into the boys hands the boys ran some of them to gather the fallen nuts and others to get clubs and rocks to beat them from the trees one was sure to throw off his jacket and kick off his shoes and climb the tree to shake every limb where a walnut was still clinging when they had got them all heaped up like a pile of grapeshot at the foot of the tree they began to hull them with blows of a stick or with stones and to pick the nuts from the hulls where the grubs were battening on their assured ripeness and to toss them into a little heap a very little heap indeed compared with the bulk of that they came from the boys gloried in getting as much walnut stain on their hands as they could for it would not wash off and it showed for days that they had been walnutting sometimes they got to staining one anothers faces with the juice and pretending they were indians  the sun rose higher and higher and burned the frost from the grass and while the boys worked and yelled and chattered they got hotter and hotter and began to take off their shoes and stockings till every one of them was barefoot then about three or four oclock they would start homeward with half a bushel of walnuts in their wagon and their shoes and stockings piled in on top of them that is if they had good luck in a story they would always have had good luck and always gone home with half a bushel of walnuts but this is a history and so i have to own that they usually went home with about two quarts of walnuts rattling round under their shoes and stockings in the bottom of the wagon they usually had no such easy time getting them as they always would in a story they did not find them under the trees or ready to drop off but they had to knock them off with about six or seven clubs or rocks to every walnut and they had to pound the hulls so hard to get the nuts out that sometimes they cracked the nuts that was because they usually went walnutting before the walnuts were ripe but they made just as much preparation for drying the nuts on the woodshed roof whether they got half a gallon or half a bushel for they did not intend to stop gathering them till they had two or three barrels they nailed a cleat across the roof to keep them from rolling off and they spread them out thin so that they could look more than they were and dry better they said they were going to keep them for christmas but they had to try pretty nearly every hour or so whether they were getting dry and in about three days they were all eaten up     the fireengines   there were two fireengines in the boys town but there seemed to be something always the matter with them so that they would not work if there was a fire when there was no fire the companies sometimes pulled them up through the town to the basin bank and practised with them against the roofs and fronts of the porkhouses it was almost as good as a muster to see the firemen in their red shirts and black trousers dragging the engine at a run two and two together one on each side of the rope  my boy would have liked to speak to a fireman but he never dared and the foreman of the neptune which was the larger and feebler of the engines was a figure of such worshipful splendor in his eyes that he felt as if he could not be just a common human being he was a storekeeper to begin with and he was tall and slim and his black trousers fitted him like a glove he had a patentleather helmet and a brass speakingtrumpet and he gave all his orders through this it did not make any difference how close he was to the men he shouted everything through the trumpet and when they manned the brakes and began to pump he roared at them down on her down on her boys so that you would have thought the neptune could put out the world if it was burning up instead of that there was usually a feeble splutter from the nozzle and sometimes none at all even if the hose did not break it was fun to see the hose break  the neptune was a favorite with the boys though they believed that the tremont could squirt farther and they had a belief in its quiet efficiency which was fostered by its reticence in public it was small and black but the neptune was large and painted of a gay color lit up with gilding that sent the blood leaping through a boys veins the boys knew the neptune was out of order but they were always expecting it would come right and in the mean time they felt that it was an honor to the town and they followed it as proudly back to the enginehouse after one of its magnificent failures as if it had been a magnificent success the boys were always making magnificent failures themselves and they could feel for the neptune     iv  glimpses of the larger world     the travelling circus   the boys made a very careful study of the circus bills and when the circus came they held the performance to a strict account for any difference between the feats and their representation for a fortnight beforehand they worked themselves up for the arrival of the circus into a fever of fear and hope for it was always a question with a great many whether they could get their fathers to give them the money to go in the full price was two bits and the halfprice was a bit or a spanish real then a commoner coin than the american dime in the west and every boy for that time only wished to be little enough to look young enough to go in for a bit editors of newspapers had a free ticket for every member of their families and my boy was sure of going to the circus from the first rumor of its coming but he was none the less deeply thrilled by the coming event and he was up early on the morning of the great day to go out and meet the circus procession beyond the corporation line  i do not really know how boys live through the wonder and the glory of such a sight once there were two chariotsone held the band in redandblue uniforms and was drawn by eighteen piebald horses and the other was drawn by a troop of shetland ponies and carried in a vast mythical seashell little boys in spangled tights and little girls in the gauze skirts and wings of fairies there was not a flaw in this splendor to the young eyes that gloated on it and that followed it in rapture through every turn and winding of its course in the boys town nor in the magnificence of the actors and actresses who came riding two by two in their circus dresses after the chariots and looking some haughty and contemptuous and others quiet and even bored as if it were nothing to be part of such a procession the boys tried to make them out by the pictures and names on the bills which was rivers the barebackrider and which was odale the champion tumbler which was the indiarubber man which the ringmaster which the clown  covered with dust gasping with the fatigue of a three hours run beside the procession but fresh at heart as in the beginning they arrived with it on the commons where the tentwagons were already drawn up and the ring was made and mighty men were driving the ironheaded tentstakes and stretching the ropes of the great skeleton of the pavilion which they were just going to clothe with canvas the boys were not allowed to come anywhere near except three or four who got leave to fetch water from a neighboring well and thought themselves richly paid with halfprice tickets the other boys were proud to pass a word with them as they went by with their brimming buckets fellows who had money to go in would have been glad to carry water just for the glory of coming close to the circus men they stood about in twos and threes and lay upon the grass in groups debating whether a tanbark ring was better than a sawdust ring there were different opinions they came as near the wagons as they dared and looked at the circus horses munching hay from the tailboards just like common horses the wagons were left standing outside of the tent but when it was up the horses were taken into the dressingroom and then the boys with many a backward look at the wide spread of canvas and the flags and streamers floating over it from the centrepole the centrepole was revered almost like a distinguished personage ran home to dinner so as to get back good and early and be among the first to go in  all round before the circus doors were open the doorkeepers of the sideshows were inviting people to come in and see the giants and fat woman and boaconstrictors and there were stands for peanuts and candy and lemonade the vendors cried icecold lemonade from fifteen hundred miles under ground walk up roll up tumble up any way you get up the boys thought this brilliant drolling but they had no time to listen after the doors were open and they had no money to spend on sideshows or dainties anyway inside the tent they found it dark and cool and their hearts thumped in their throats with the wild joy of being there they recognized one another with amaze as if they had not met for years and the excitement kept growing as other fellows came in it was lots of fun too watching the countryjakes as the boys called the farmerfolk and seeing how green they looked and now some of them tried to act smart with the circus men that came round with oranges to sell but the great thing was to see whether fellows that said they were going to hook in really got in the boys held it to be a high and creditable thing to hook into a show of any kind but hooking into a circus was something that a fellow ought to be held in special honor for doing he ran great risks and if he escaped the vigilance of the massive circus man who patrolled the outside of the tent with a cowhide and a bulldog perhaps he merited the fame he was sure to win  i do not know where boys get some of the notions of morality that govern them these notions are like the sports and plays that a boy leaves off as he gets older to the boys that are younger he outgrows them and other boys grow into them and then outgrow them as he did perhaps they come down to the boyhood of our time from the boyhood of the race and the unwritten laws of conduct may have prevailed among the earliest aryans on the plains of asia that i now find so strange in a retrospect of the boys town  the standard of honor there was in a certain way very high among the boys they would have despised a thief as he deserved and i cannot remember one of them who might not have been safely trusted none of them would have taken an apple out of a marketwagon or stolen a melon from a farmer who came to town with it but they would all have thought it fun if not right to rob an orchard or hook a watermelon out of a patch this would have been a foray into the enemys country and the fruit of the adventure would have been the same as the plunder of a city or the capture of a vessel belonging to him on the high seas in the same way if one of the boys had seen a circus man drop a quarter he would have hurried to give it back to him but he would only have been proud to hook into the circus mans show and the other fellows would have been proud of his exploit too as something that did honor to them all as a person who enclosed bounds and forbade trespass the circus man constituted himself the enemy of every boy who respected himself and challenged him to practise any sort of strategy there was not a boy in the crowd that my boy went with who would have been allowed to hook into a circus by his parents yet hooking in was an ideal that was cherished among them that was talked of and that was even sometimes attempted though not often once when a fellow really hooked in and joined the crowd that had ignobly paid one of the fellows could not stand it he asked him just how and where he got in and then he went to the door and got back his money from the doorkeeper upon the plea that he did not feel well and in five or ten minutes he was back among the boys a hero of such moral grandeur as would be hard to describe not one of the fellows saw him as he really wasa little lying thievish scoundrel not even my boy saw him so though he had on some other point of personal honesty the most fantastic scruples  the boys liked to be at the circus early so as to make sure of the grand entry of the performers into the ring where they caracoled round on horseback and gave a delicious foretaste of the wonders to come the fellows were united in this but upon other matters feeling variedsome liked tumbling best some the slackrope some barebackriding some the feats of tossing knives and balls and catching them there never was more than one ring in those days and you were not tempted to break your neck and set your eyes forever askew by trying to watch all the things that went on at once in two or three rings  the boys did not miss the smallest feats of any performance and they enjoyed them every one not equally but fully they had their preferences of course as i have hinted and one of the most popular acts was that where a horse has been trained to misbehave so that nobody can mount him and after the actors have tried him the ringmaster turns to the audience and asks if some gentleman among them wants to try it nobody stirs till at last a tipsy countryjake is seen making his way down from one of the top seats toward the ring he can hardly walk he is so drunk and the clown has to help him across the ringboard and even then he trips and rolls over on the sawdust and has to be pulled to his feet when they bring him up to the horse he falls against it and the little fellows think he will certainly get killed but the big boys tell the little fellows to shut up and watch out the ringmaster and the clown manage to get the countryjake on to the broad platform on the horses back and then the ringmaster cracks his whip and the two supes who have been holding the horses head let go and the horse begins cantering round the ring the little fellows are just sure the countryjake is going to fall off he reels and totters so but the big boys tell them to keep watching out and pretty soon the countryjake begins to straighten up he begins to unbutton his long gray overcoat and then he takes it off and throws it into the ring where one of the supes catches it then he sticks a short pipe into his mouth and pulls on an old wool hat and flourishes a stick that the supe throws to him and you see that he is an irishman just come across the sea and then off goes another coat and he comes out a british soldier in white duck trousers and red coat that comes off and he is an american sailor with his hands on his hips dancing a hornpipe suddenly away flash wig and beard and falseface the pantaloons are stripped off with the same movement the actor stoops for the reins lying on the horses neck and james rivers the greatest threehorse rider in the world nimbly capers on the broad pad and kisses his hand to the shouting and cheering spectators as he dashes from the ring past the braying and bellowing brassband into the dressingroom  the big boys have known all along that he was not a real countryjake but when the trained mule begins and shakes everybody off just like the horse and another countryjake gets up and offers to bet that he can ride that mule nobody can tell whether he is a real countryjake or not this is always the last thing in the performance and the boys have seen with heavy hearts many signs openly betokening the end which they knew was at hand the actors have come out of the dressingroom door some in their everyday clothes and some with just overcoats on over their circusdresses and they lounge about near the bandstand watching the performance in the ring some of the people are already getting up to go out and stand for this last act and will not mind the shouts of down in front down there which the boys eagerly join in to eke out their bliss a little longer by keeping away even the appearance of anything transitory in it the countryjake comes stumbling awkwardly into the ring but he is perfectly sober and he boldly leaps astride the mule which tries all its arts to shake him off plunging kicking rearing he sticks on and everybody cheers him and the owner of the mule begins to get mad and to make it do more things to shake the countryjake off at last with one convulsive spring it flings him from its back and dashes into the dressingroom while the countryjake picks himself up and vanishes among the crowd  a man mounted on a platform in the ring is imploring the ladies and gentlemen to keep their seats and to buy tickets for the negrominstrel entertainment which is to follow but which is not included in the price of admission the boys would like to stay but they have not the money and they go out clamoring over the performance and trying to decide which was the best feat as to which was the best actor there is never any question it is the clown who showed by the way he turned a double somersault that he can do anything and who chooses to be clown simply because he is too great a creature to enter into rivalry with the other actors  there will be another performance in the evening with real fights outside between the circus men and the countryjakes and perhaps some of the basin rounders but the boys do not expect to come that would be too much the boys brother once stayed away in the afternoon and went at night with one of the jour printers but he was not able to report that the show was better than it was in the afternoon he did not get home till nearly ten oclock though and he saw the sides of the tent dropped before the people got out that was a great thing and what was greater yet and reflected a kind of splendor on the boy at second hand was that the jour printer and the clown turned out to be old friends after the circus the boy actually saw them standing near the centrepole talking together and the next day the jour showed the grease that had dripped on his coat from the candles otherwise the boy might have thought it was a dream that some one he knew had talked on equal terms with the clown the boys were always intending to stay up and see the circus go out of town and they would have done so but their mothers would not let them this may have been one reason why none of them ever ran off with a circus  as soon as a circus had been in town the boys began to have circuses of their own and to practise for them everywhere you could see boys upside down walking on their hands or standing on them with their legs dangling over or stayed against house walls it was easy to stand on your head one boy stood on his head so much that he had to have it shaved in the brainfever that he got from standing on it but that did not stop the other fellows another boy fell head downward from a rail where he was skinningthecat and nearly broke his neck and made it so sore that it was stiff ever so long another boy who was playing samson almost had his leg torn off by the fellows that were pulling at it with a hook and he did have the leg of his pantaloons torn off nothing could stop the boys but time or some other play coming in and circuses lasted a good while some of the boys learned to turn handsprings anybody could turn cartwheels one fellow across the river could just run along and throw a somersault and light on his feet lots of fellows could light on their backs but if you had a springboard or shavings under a bank like those by the turningshop you could practise for somersaults pretty safely  all the time you were practising you were forming your circus company the great trouble was not that any boy minded paying five or ten pins to come in but that so many fellows wanted to belong there were hardly any left to form an audience you could get girls but even as spectators girls were a little too despicable they did not know anything they had no sense if a fellow got hurt they cried then another thing was where to have the circus of course it was simply hopeless to think of a tent and a boys circus was very glad to get a barn the boy whose father owned the barn had to get it for the circus without his father knowing it and just as likely as not his mother would hear the noise and come out and break the whole thing up while you were in the very middle of it then there were all sorts of anxieties and perplexities about the dress you could do something by turning your roundabout inside out and rolling your trousers up as far as they would go but what a fellow wanted to make him a real circusactor was a long pair of white cotton stockings and i never knew a fellow that got a pair i heard of many a fellow who was said to have got a pair but when you came down to the fact they vanished like ghosts when you try to verify them i believe the fellows always expected to get them out of a bureaudrawer or the clothesline at home but failed in most other ways a boys circus was always a failure like most other things boys undertake they usually broke up under the strain of rivalry everybody wanted to be the clown or ringmaster or else the boy they got the barn of behaved badly and went into the house crying and all the fellows had to run  illustration     passing shows   there were only two kinds of show known by that name in the boys town a nigger show or a performance of burntcork minstrels and an animal show or a strolling menagerie and the boys always meant a menagerie when they spoke of a show unless they said just what sort of show the only perfect joy on earth in the way of an entertainment of course was a circus but after the circus the show came unquestionably next it made a processional entry into the town almost as impressive as the circuss and the boys went out to meet it beyond the corporation line in the same way it always had two elephants at least and four or five camels and sometimes there was a giraffe these headed the procession the elephants in the very front with their keepers at their heads and then the camels led by halters dangling from their sneering lips and contemptuous noses after these began to come the showwagons with pictures on their sides very flattered portraits of the wild beasts and birds inside lions first then tigers never meaner than royal bengal ones which the boys understood to be a superior breed then leopards then pumas and panthers then bears then jackals and hyenas then bears and wolves then kangaroos muskoxen deer and such harmless cattle and then ostriches emus lyrebirds birdsofparadise and all the rest  from time to time the boys ran back from the elephants and camels to get what good they could out of the scenes in which these hidden wonders were dramatized in acts of rapine or the chase but they always came forward to the elephants and camels again even with them they had to endure a degree of denial for although you could see most of the camels figures the elephants were so heavily draped that it was a kind of disappointment to look at them the boys kept as close as they could and came as near getting under the elephants feet as the keepers would allow but after all they were driven off a good deal and had to keep stealing back they gave the elephants apples and bits of cracker and cake and some tried to put tobacco into their trunks though they knew very well that it was nearly certain death to do so for any elephant that was deceived that way would recognize the boy that did it and kill him the next time he came if it was twenty years afterward the boys used to believe that the miami bridge would break down under the elephants if they tried to cross it and they would have liked to see it do it but no one ever saw it perhaps because the elephants always waded the river some boys had seen them wading it and stopping to drink and squirt the water out of their trunks if an elephant got a boy that had given him tobacco into the river he would squirt water on him till he drowned him still some boys always tried to give the elephants tobacco just to see how they would act for the time being  a show was not so much in favor as a circus because there was so little performance in the ring you could go round and look at the animals mostly very sleepy in their cages but you were not allowed to poke them through the bars or anything and when you took your seat there was nothing much till herr driesbach entered the lions cage and began to make them jump over his whip it was some pleasure to see him put his head between the jaws of the great african king of beasts but the lion never did anything to him and so the act wanted a true dramatic climax the boys would really rather have seen a barebackrider like james rivers turn a backsomersault and light on his horses crupper any time though they respected herr driesbach too they did not care much for a woman who once went into the lions cage and made them jump round  the boys had their own beliefs about the different animals and one of these concerned the inappeasable ferocity of the zebra i do not know why the zebra should have had this repute for he certainly never did anything to deserve it but for the matter of that he was like all the other animals bears were not much esteemed but they would have been if they could have been really seen hugging anybody to death it was always hoped that some of the fiercest animals would get away and have to be hunted down and retaken after they had killed a lot of dogs if the elephants some of them had gone crazy it would have been something for then they would have roamed up and down the turnpike smashing buggies and wagons and had to be shot with the sixpound cannon that was used to celebrate the fourth of july with  another thing that was against the show was that the animals were fed after it was out and you could not see the tigers tearing their prey when the great lumps of beef were thrown them there was somehow not so much chance of hooking into a show as a circus because the seats did not go all round and you could be seen under the cages as soon as you got in under the canvas i never heard of a boy that hooked into a show perhaps nobody ever tried  but the great reason of all was that you could not have an animal show of your own as you could a circus you could not get the animals and no boy living could act a camel or a royal bengal tiger or an elephant so as to look the least like one  of course you could have negro shows and the boys often had them but they were not much fun and you were always getting the black on your shirtsleeves     the theatre comes to town   a great new experience which now came to the boy was the theatre which he had sometimes heard his father speak of there had once been a theatre in the boys town when a strolling company came up from cincinnati and opened for a season in an empty porkhouse but that was a long time ago and though he had written a tragedy all that the boy knew of a theatre was from a picture in a sundayschool book where a stage scene was given to show what kind of desperate amusements a person might come to in middle life if he began by breaking the sabbath in his youth his brother had once been taken to a theatre in pittsburg by one of their rivergoing uncles and he often told about it but my boy formed no conception of the beautiful reality from his accounts of a burglar who jumped from a roof and was chased by a watchman with a pistol up and down a street with houses painted on a curtain  the company which came to the boys town in his time was again from cincinnati and it was under the management of the father and mother of two actresses afterward famous who were then children just starting upon their career these pretty little creatures took the leading parts in bombastes furioso the first night my boy ever saw a play and he instantly fell impartially in love with both of them and tacitly remained their abject slave for a great while after when the smaller of them came out with a large pair of stage boots in one hand and a drawn sword in the other and said      whoever dares these boots displace     shall meet bombastes face to face  if the boy had not already been bereft of his senses by the melodrama preceding the burlesque he must have been transported by her beauty her grace her genius he indeed gave her and her sister his heart but his mind was already gone rapt from him by the adorable pirate who fought a losing fight with broadswords two up and two downclickclick clickclickand died all over the deck of the pirate ship in the opening piece this was called the beacon of death and the scene represented the forecastle of the pirate ship with a lantern dangling from the rigging to lure unsuspecting merchantmen to their doom afterward the boy remembered nothing of the story but a scrap of the dialogue meaninglessly remained with him and when the pirate captain appeared with his bloody crew and said hoarsely let us go below and get some brandy the boy would have bartered all his hopes of bliss to have been that abandoned ruffian in fact he always liked and longed to be the villain rather than any other person in the play and he so glutted himself with crime of every sort in his tender years at the theatre that he afterward came to be very tired of it and avoided the plays and novels that had very marked villains in them  he was in an ecstasy as soon as the curtain rose that night and he lived somewhere out of his body as long as the playing lasted which was well on to midnight for in those days the theatre did not meanly put the public off with one play but gave it a heartful and its moneys worth with three on his first night my boy saw the beacon of death bombastes furioso and blackeyed susan and he never afterward saw less than three plays each night and he never missed a night as long as the theatre languished in the unfriendly air of that mainly calvinistic community where the theatre was regarded by most good people as the eighth of the seven deadly sins the whole day long he dwelt in a dream of it that blotted out or rather consumed with more effulgent brightness all the other daydreams he had dreamed before and his heart almost burst with longing to be a villain like those villains on the stage to have a mustachea black mustachesuch as they wore at a time when every one off the stage was clean shaven and somehow to end bloodily murderously as became a villain  i dare say this was not quite a wholesome frame of mind for a boy of ten years but i do not defend it i only portray it being the boy he was he was destined somehow to dwell half the time in a world of dreamery and i have tried to express how when he had once got enough of villany he reformed his ideals and rather liked virtue     the world opened by books   every boy is two or three boys or twenty or thirty different kinds of boys in one he is all the time living many lives and forming many characters but it is a good thing if he can keep one life and one character when he gets to be a man he may turn out to be like an onion when he is grown up and be nothing but hulls that you keep peeling off one after another till you think you have got down to the heart at last and then you have got down to nothing  all the boys may have been like my boy in the boys town in having each an inward being that was not the least like their outward being but that somehow seemed to be their real self whether it truly was so or not but i am certain that this was the case with him and that while he was joyfully sharing the wild sports and conforming to the savage usages of the boys world about him he was dwelling in a wholly different world within him whose wonders no one else knew i could not tell now these wonders any more than he could have told them then but it was a world of dreams of hopes of purposes which he would have been more ashamed to avow for himself than i should be to avow for him it was all vague and vast and it came out of the books that he read and that filled his soul with their witchery and often held him aloof with their charm in the midst of the plays from which they could not lure him wholly away or at all away he did not know how or when their enchantment began and he could hardly recall the names of some of them afterward  first of them was goldsmiths history of greece which made him an athenian of pericles time and goldsmiths history of rome which naturalized him in a roman citizenship chiefly employed in slaying tyrants from the time of appius claudius down to the time of domitian there was hardly a tyrant that he did not slay after he had read these books not once or twice but twenty times over his father thought fit to put into his hands the travels of captain ashe in north america to encourage or perhaps to test his taste for useful reading but this was a failure the captains travels were printed with long esses and the boy could make nothing of them for other reasons the fancy nourished upon      the glory that was greece     and the grandeur that was rome  starved amid the robust plenty of the englishmans criticisms of our early manners and customs neither could money hire the boy to read maltebruns geography in three large folios of a thousand pages each for which there was a standing offer of fifty cents from the father who had never been able to read it himself  but shortly after he failed so miserably with captain ashe the boy came into possession of a priceless treasure it was that little treatise on greek and roman mythology which i have mentioned and which he must literally have worn out with reading since no fragment of it seems to have survived his boyhood heaven knows who wrote it or published it his father bought it with a number of other books at an auction and the boy who had about that time discovered the chapter on prosody in the back part of his grammar made poems from it for years and appeared in many transfigurations as this and that god and demigod and hero upon imagined occasions in the boys town to the fancied admiration of all the other fellows i do not know just why he wished to appear to his grandmother in a vision now as mercury with winged feet now as apollo with his drawn bow now as hercules leaning upon his club and resting from his twelve labors perhaps it was because he thought that his grandmother who used to tell the children about her life in wales and show them the picture of a castle where she had once slept when she was a girl would appreciate him in these apotheoses if he believed they would make a vivid impression upon the sweet old quaker lady no doubt he was right  there was another book which he read about this time and that was the greek soldier it was the story of a young greek a glorious athenian who had fought through the greek war of independence against the turks and then come to america and published the narrative of his adventures they fired my boy with a retrospective longing to have been present at the battle of navarino when the allied ships of the english french and russians destroyed the turkish fleet but it seemed to him that he could not have borne to have the allies impose a king upon the greeks when they really wanted a republic and so he was able to console himself for having been absent he did what he could in fighting the war over again and he intended to harden himself for the long struggle by sleeping on the floor as the greek soldier had done but the children often fell asleep on the floor in the warmth of the hearthfire and his preparation for the patriotic strife was not distinguishable in its practical effect from a reluctance to go to bed at the right hour  captain rileys narrative of his shipwreck on the coast of africa and his captivity among the arabs was a book which my boy and his brother prized with a kind of personal interest because their father told them that he had once seen a son of captain riley when he went to get his appointment of collector at columbus and that this son was named william willshire riley after the good english merchant william willshire who had ransomed captain riley william willshire seemed to them almost the best man who ever lived though my boy had secretly a greater fondness for the arab sidi hamet who was kind to captain riley and kept his brother seid from illtreating him whenever he could probably the boy liked him better because the arab was more picturesque than the englishman the whole narrative was very interesting it had a vein of sincere and earnest piety in it which was not its least charm and it was written in a style of oldfashioned stateliness which was not without its effect with the boys  somehow they did not think of the arabs in this narrative as of the same race and faith with the arabs of bagdad and the other places in the arabian nights they did not think whether these were mohammedans or not they naturalized them in the fairy world where all boys are citizens and lived with them there upon the same familiar terms as they lived with robinson crusoe their father once told them that robinson crusoe had robbed the real narrative of alexander selkirk of the place it ought to have held in the remembrance of the world and my boy had a feeling of guilt in reading it as if he were making himself the accomplice of an impostor  he liked the arabian nights but oddly enough these wonderful tales made no such impression on his fancy as the stories in a wretchedly inferior book made he did not know the name of this book or who wrote it from which i imagine that much of his reading was of the purblind sort that ignorant grownup people do without any sort of literary vision he read this book perpetually when he was not reading his greek and roman mythology and then suddenly one day as happens in childhood with so many things it vanished out of his possession as if by magic perhaps he lost it perhaps he lent it at any rate it was gone and he never got it back and he never knew what book it was till thirty years afterward when he picked up from a friends librarytable a copy of gesta romanorum and recognized in this collection of old monkish legends the longmissing treasure of his boyhood  these stories without beauty of invention without art of construction or character without spirituality in their crude materialization which were read aloud in the refectories of mediæval cloisters while the monks sat at meat laid a spell upon the soul of the boy that governed his life he conformed his conduct to the principles and maxims which actuated the behavior of the shadowy people of these dryasdust tales he went about drunk with the fumes of fables about roman emperors that never were in an empire that never was and though they tormented him by putting a mixed and impossible civilization in the place of that he knew from his goldsmith he was quite helpless to break from their influence he was always expecting some wonderful thing to happen to him as things happened there in fulfilment of some saying or prophecy and at every trivial moment he made sayings and prophecies for himself which he wished events to fulfil one sunday when he was walking in an alley behind one of the stores he found a fur cap that had probably fallen out of the storeloft window he ran home with it and in his simplehearted rapture he told his mother that as soon as he picked it up there came into his mind the words he who picketh up this cap picketh up a fortune and he could hardly wait for monday to come and let him restore the cap to its owner and receive an enduring prosperity in reward of his virtue heaven knows what form he expected this to take but when he found himself in the store he lost all courage his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth and he could not utter a syllable of the fine phrases he had made to himself he laid the cap on the counter without a word the storekeeper came up and took it in his hand whats this he said why this is ours and he tossed the cap into a loose pile of hats by the showcase and the boy slunk out cut to the heart and crushed to the dust it was such a cruel disappointment and mortification that it was rather a relief to have his brother mock him and come up and say from time to time he who picketh up this cap picketh up a fortune and then split into a jeering laugh at least he could fight his brother and when he ran could stone him and he could throw quads and quoins and pieces of riglet at the jour printers when the story spread to them and one of them would begin he who picketh  he could not make anything either of byron or cowper and he did not even try to read the little treecalf volumes of homer and virgil which his father had in the versions of pope and dryden the small copperplates with which they were illustrated conveyed no suggestion to him afterward he read goldsmiths deserted village and he formed a great passion for popes pastorals which he imitated in their easy heroics but till he came to read longfellow and tennyson and heine he never read any long poem without more fatigue than pleasure his father used to say that the taste for poetry was an acquired taste like the taste for tomatoes and that he would come to it yet but he never came to it or so much of it as some people seemed to do and he always had his sorrowful misgivings as to whether they liked it as much as they pretended i think too that it should be a flavor a spice a sweet a delicate relish in the high banquet of literature and never a chief dish and i should not know how to defend my boy for trying to make long poems of his own at the very time when he found it so hard to read other peoples long poems     v  the last of a boys town     the last of a boys town   my boy was twelve years old and was already a swift compositor though he was still so small that he had to stand on a chair to reach the case in setting type on taylors inaugural message but what he lacked in stature he made up in gravity of demeanor and he got the name of the old man from the printers as soon as he began to come about the office which he did almost as soon as he could walk his first attempt in literature an essay on the vain and disappointing nature of human life he set up and printed off himself in his sixth or seventh year and the printingoffice was in some sort his home as well as his school his university he could no more remember learning to set type than he could remember learning to read and in afterlife he could not come within smell of the ink the dusty types the humid paper of a printingoffice without that tender swelling of the heart which so fondly responds to any memorybearing perfume his youth his boyhood almost his infancy came back to him in it he now looked forward eagerly to helping on the new paper and somewhat proudly to living in the larger place the family were going to the moment it was decided he began to tell the boys that he was going to live in a city and he felt that it gave him distinction he had nothing but joy in it and he did not dream that as the time drew near it could be sorrow but when it came at last and he was to leave the house the town the boys he found himself deathly homesick  the parting days were days of gloom the parting was an anguish of bitter tears nothing consoled him but the fact that they were going all the way to the new place in a canalboat which his father chartered for the trip my boy and his brother had once gone to cincinnati in a canalboat with a friendly captain of their acquaintance and though they were both put to sleep in a berth so narrow that when they turned they fell out on the floor the glory of the adventure remained with him and he could have thought of nothing more delightful than such another voyage the household goods were piled up in the middle of the boat and the family had a cabin forward which seemed immense to the children they played in it and ran races up and down the long canalboat roof where their father and mother sometimes put their chairs and sat to admire the scenery  they arrived safely at their journeys end without any sort of accident they had made the whole forty miles in less than two days and were all as well as when they started without having suffered for a moment from seasickness the boat drew up at the towpath just before the stable belonging to the house which the father had already taken and the whole family at once began helping the crew put the things ashore the boys thought it would have been a splendid stable to keep the pony in only they had sold the pony but they saw in an instant that it would do for a circus as soon as they could get acquainted with enough boys to have one  the strangeness of the house and street and the necessity of meeting the boys of the neighborhood and paying with his person for his standing among them kept my boy interested for a time and he did not realize at first how much he missed the boys town and all the familiar fellowships there and all the manifold privileges of the place then he began to be very homesick and to be torn with the torment of a divided love his mother whom he loved so dearly so tenderly was here and wherever she was that was home and yet home was yonder far off at the end of those forty inexorable miles where he had left his lifelong mates the first months there was a dumb heartache at the bottom of every pleasure and excitement  after a while he was allowed to revisit the boys town it could only have been three or four months after he had left it but it already seemed a very long time and he figured himself returning as stage heroes do to the scenes of their childhood after an absence of some fifteen years he fancied that if the boys did not find him grown they would find him somehow changed and that he would dazzle them with the light accumulated by his residence in a city he was going to stay with his grandmother and he planned to make a long stay for he was very fond of her and he liked the quiet and comfort of her pleasant house he must have gone back by the canalpacket but his memory kept no record of the fact and afterward he knew only of having arrived and of searching about in a ghostly fashion for his old comrades they may have been at school at any rate he found very few of them and with them he was certainly strange enough too strange even they received him with a kind of surprise and they could not begin playing together at once in the old way he went to all the places that were so dear to him but he felt in them the same kind of refusal or reluctance that he felt in the boys his heart began to ache again he did not quite know why only it ached when he went up from his grandmothers to look at the faulkner house he realized that it was no longer home and he could not bear the sight of it there were other people living in it strange voices sounded from the open doors strange faces peered from the windows  he came back to his grandmothers bruised and defeated and spent the morning indoors reading after dinner he went out again and hunted up that queer earthspirit who had been so long and closely his only friend he at least was not changed he was as unwashed and as unkempt as ever but he seemed shy of my poor boy he had probably never been shaken hands with in his life before he dropped my boys hand and they stood looking at each other not knowing what to say my boy had on his best clothes which he wore so as to affect the boys town boys with the full splendor of a city boy after all he was not so very splendid but his presence altogether was too much for the earthspirit and he vanished out of his consciousness like an apparition  after school was out in the afternoon he met more of the boys but none of them knew just what to do with him the place that he had once had in their lives was filled he was an outsider who might be suffered among them but he was no longer of them he did not understand this at once nor well know what hurt him but something was gone that could not be called back something lost that could not be found  at teatime his grandfather came home and gravely made him welcome the uncle who was staying with them was jovially kind but a heavy homesickness weighed down the childs heart which now turned from the boys town as longingly as it had turned toward it before  they all knelt down with the grandfather before they went to the table there had been a good many deaths from cholera during the day and the grandfather prayed for grace and help amid the pestilence that walketh in darkness and wasteth at noonday in such a way that the boy felt there would be very little of either for him unless he got home at once all through the meal that followed he was trying to find the courage to say that he must go home when he managed to say it his grandmother and aunt tried to comfort and coax him and his uncle tried to shame him out of his homesickness to joke it off to make him laugh but his grandfathers tender heart was moved he could not endure the childs mute misery he said he must go home if he wished  in half an hour the boy was on the canalpacket speeding homeward at the highest pace of the threehorse team and the boys town was out of sight he could not sleep for excitement that night and he came and spent the time talking on quite equal terms with the steersman one of the canalers whom he had admired afar in earlier and simpler days he found him a very amiable fellow by no means haughty who began to tell him funny stories and who even let him take the helm for a while the rudderhandle was of polished iron very different from the clumsy wooden affair of a freightboat and the packet made in a single night the distance which the boys family had been nearly two days in travelling when they moved away from the boys town  he arrived home for breakfast a travelled and experienced person and wholly cured of that longing for his former home that had tormented him before he revisited its scenes he now fully gave himself up to his new environment and looked forward and not backward i do not mean to say that he ceased to love the boys town that he could not do and never did but he became more and more aware that the past was gone from him forever and that he could not return to it he did not forget it but cherished its memories the more fondly for that reason  there was no bitterness in it and no harm that he could not hope would easily be forgiven him he had often been foolish and sometimes he had been wicked but he had never been such a little fool or such a little sinner but he had wished for more sense and more grace there are some great fools and great sinners who try to believe in afterlife that they are the manlier men because they have been silly and mischievous boys but he has never believed that he is glad to have had a boyhood fully rounded out with all a boys interests and pleasures and he is glad that his lines were cast in the boys town but he knows or believes he knows that whatever is good in him now came from what was good in him then and he is sure that the town was delightful chiefly because his home in it was happy the town was small and the boys there were hemmed in by their inexperience and ignorance but the simple home was large with vistas that stretched to the ends of the earth and it was serenely bright with a fathers reason and warm with a mothers love   the end
