52810497	discourses on satire and on epic poetry  by john dryden     introduction    drydens discourses upon satire and epic poetry belong to the latter years of his life and represent maturer thought than is to be found in his essay of dramatic poesie  that essay published in 1667 draws its chief interest from the time when it was written  a dutch fleet was at the mouth of the thames  dryden represents himself taking a boat down the river with three friends one of them his brotherinlaw sir robert howard another sir charles sedley and another charles sackville lord buckhurst to whom as earl of dorset the discourse of satire is inscribed  they go down the river to hear the guns at sea and judge by the sound whether the dutch fleet be advancing or retreating  on the way they talk of the plague of odes that will follow an english victory their talk of verse proceeds to plays with particular attention to a question that had been specially argued before the public between dryden and his brotherinlaw sir robert howard  the question touched the use of blank verse in the drama  dryden had decided against it as a worthless measure and the chief feature of the essay which was written in dialogue was its support of drydens argument  but in that year 1667 paradise lost was published and miltons blank verse was the death of drydens theories  after a few years dryden recanted his error  the essay of dramatic poesie is interesting as a setting forth in 1667 of mistaken critical opinions which were at that time in the ascendant but had not very long to live dryden always wrote good masculine prose and all his critical essays are good reading as pieces of english  his essay of dramatic poesie is good reading as illustrative of the weakness of our literature in the days of the influence of france after the restoration  the essays on satire and on epic poetry represent also the influence of the french critical school but represent it in a larger way with indications of its strength as well as of its weakness  they represent also dryden himself with a riper mind covering a larger field of thought and showing abundantly the strength and independence of his own critical judgment while he cites familiarly and frequently the critics little remembered and less cared for now who then passed for the arbiters of taste  if english literature were really taught in schools and the eldest boys had received training that brought them in their last school year to a knowledge of the changes of intellectual fashion that set their outward mark upon successive periods there is no prose writing of dryden that could be used by a teacher more instructively than these discourses on satire and on epic poetry  they illustrate abundantly both dryden and his time and give continuous occasion for discussion of first principles whether in disagreement or agreement with the text  dryden was on his own ground as a critic of satire and the ideal of an epic that the times and perhaps also the different bent of his own genius would not allow him to work out at least finds such expression as might be expected from a man who had high aspirations and whose place in times unfavourable to his highest aims was still among the masterpoets of the world  the discourse on satire was prefixed to a translation of the satires of juvenal and persius and is dated the 18th of august 1692 when the poets age was sixtyone  in translating juvenal dryden was helped by his sons charles and john  william congreve translated one satire other translations were by nahum tate and george stepney  time modern reader of the introductory discourse has first to pass through the unmeasured compliments to the earl of dorset which represent a real esteem and gratitude in the extravagant terms then proper to the art of dedication  we get to the free sea over a slimy shore  we must remember that charles the second upon his death was praised by charles montague who knew his faults as the best good man that ever filled a throne and compared to god himself at the end of the first paragraph of montagues poem  but when we are clear of the conventional unmeasured flatteries and dryden lingers among epic poets on his way to the satirists there is equal interest in the mistaken criticisms in the aspirations that are blended with them and in the occasional touches of the poets personality in quiet references to his critics  the comparisons between horace and juvenal in this discourse and much of the criticism on virgil in the discourse on epic poetry are the utterances of a poet upon poets and full of right suggestions from an artists mind  the second discourse was prefixed in 1697three years before drydens deathto his translation of the aeneid  h m    a discourse on the original and progress of satire addressed to the right honourable charles earl of dorset and middlesex lord chamberlain of his majestys household knight of the most noble order of the garter etc    my lord  the wishes and desires of all good men which have attended your lordship from your first appearance in the world are at length accomplished from your obtaining those honours and dignities which you have so long deserved  there are no factions though irreconcilable to one another that are not united in their affection to you and the respect they pay you  they are equally pleased in your prosperity and would be equally concerned in your afflictions  titus vespasian was not more the delight of human kind  the universal empire made him only more known and more powerful but could not make him more beloved  he had greater ability of doing good but your inclination to it is not less  and though you could not extend your beneficence to so many persons yet you have lost as few days as that excellent emperor and never had his complaint to make when you went to bed that the sun had shone upon you in vain when you had the opportunity of relieving some unhappy man  this my lord has justly acquired you as many friends as there are persons who have the honour to be known to you  mere acquaintance you have none you have drawn them all into a nearer line and they who have conversed with you are for ever after inviolably yours  this is a truth so generally acknowledged that it needs no proof  it is of the nature of a first principle which is received as soon as it is proposed and needs not the reformation which descartes used to his for we doubt not neither can we properly say we think we admire and love you above all other men there is a certainty in the proposition and we know it  with the same assurance i can say you neither have enemies nor can scarce have any for they who have never heard of you can neither love or hate you and they who have can have no other notion of you than that which they receive from the public that you are the best of men  after this my testimony can be of no farther use than to declare it to be daylight at high noon  and all who have the benefit of sight can look up as well and see the sun  it is true i have one privilege which is almost particular to myself that i saw you in the east at your first arising above the hemisphere  i was as soon sensible as any man of that light when it was but just shooting out and beginning to travel upwards to the meridian  i made my early addresses to your lordship in my essay of dramatic poetry and therein bespoke you to the world wherein i have the right of a first discoverer  when i was myself in the rudiments of my poetry without name or reputation in the world having rather the ambition of a writer than the skill when i was drawing the outlines of an art without any living master to instruct me in itan art which had been better praised than studied here in england wherein shakespeare who created the stage among us had rather written happily than knowingly and justly and jonson who by studying horace had been acquainted with the rules yet seemed to envy to posterity that knowledge and like an inventor of some useful art to make a monopoly of his learning when thus as i may say before the use of the loadstone or knowledge of the compass i was sailing in a vast ocean without other help than the polestar of the ancients and the rules of the french stage amongst the moderns which are extremely different from ours by reason of their opposite taste yet even then i had the presumption to dedicate to your lordshipa very unfinished piece i must confess and which only can be excused by the little experience of the author and the modesty of the titlean essay  yet i was stronger in prophecy than i was in criticism  i was inspired to foretell you to mankind as the restorer of poetry the greatest genius the truest judge and the best patron  good sense and good nature are never separated though the ignorant world has thought otherwise  good nature by which i mean beneficence and candour is the product of right reason which of necessity will give allowance to the failings of others by considering that there is nothing perfect in mankind and by distinguishing that which comes nearest to excellency though not absolutely free from faults will certainly produce a candour in the judge  it is incident to an elevated understanding like your lordships to find out the errors of other men but it is your prerogative to pardon them to look with pleasure on those things which are somewhat congenial and of a remote kindred to your own conceptions and to forgive the many failings of those who with their wretched art cannot arrive to those heights that you possess from a happy abundant and native genius which are as inborn to you as they were to shakespeare and for aught i know to homer in either of whom we find all arts and sciences all moral and natural philosophy without knowing that they ever studied them  there is not an english writer this day living who is not perfectly convinced that your lordship excels all others in all the several parts of poetry which you have undertaken to adorn  the most vain and the most ambitions of our age have not dared to assume so much as the competitors of themistocles  they have yielded the first place without dispute and have been arrogantly content to be esteemed as second to your lordship and even that also with a longo sed proximi intervallo  if there have been or are any who go farther in their selfconceit they must be very singular in their opinion they must be like the officer in a play who was called captain lieutenant and company  the world will easily conclude whether such unattended generals can ever be capable of making a revolution in parnassus  i will not attempt in this place to say anything particular of your lyric poems though they are the delight and wonder of the age and will be the envy of the next  the subject of this book confines me to satire and in that an author of your own quality whose ashes i will not disturb has given you all the commendation which his self sufficiency could afford to any manthe best good man with the worstnatured muse  in that character methinks i am reading jonsons verses to the memory of shakespeare an insolent sparing and invidious panegyric  where good naturethe most godlike commendation of a manis only attributed to your person and denied to your writings for they are everywhere so full of candour that like horace you only expose the follies of men without arraigning their vices and in this excel him that you add that pointedness of thought which is visibly wanting in our great roman  there is more of salt in all your verses than i have seen in any of the moderns or even of the ancients  but you have been sparing of the gall by which means you have pleased all readers and offended none  donne alone of all our countrymen had your talent but was not happy enough to arrive at your versification and were he translated into numbers and english he would yet be wanting in the dignity of expression  that which is the prime virtue and chief ornament of virgil which distinguishes him from the rest of writers is so conspicuous in your verses that it casts a shadow on all your contemporaries we cannot be seen or but obscurely while you are present  you equal donne in the variety multiplicity and choice of thoughts you excel him in the manner and the words  i read you both with the same admiration but not with the same delight  he affects the metaphysics not only in his satires but in his amorous verses where nature only should reign and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations of philosophy when he should engage their hearts and entertain them with the softnesses of love in this if i may be pardoned for so bold a truth mr cowley has copied him to a fault  so great a one in my opinion that it throws his mistress infinitely below his pindarics and his later compositions which are undoubtedly the best of his poems and the most correct  for my own part i must avow it freely to the world that i never attempted anything in satire wherein i have not studied your writings as the most perfect model  i have continually laid them before me and the greatest commendation which my own partiality can give to my productions is that they are copies and no farther to be allowed than as they have something more or less of the original  some few touches of your lordship some secret graces which i have endeavoured to express after your manner have made whole poems of mine to pass with approbation  but take your verses all together and they are inimitable  if therefore i have not written better it is because you have not written more  you have not set me sufficient copy to transcribe and i cannot add one letter of my own invention of which i have not the example there  it is a general complaint against your lordship and i must have leave to upbraid you with it that because you need not write you will not  mankind that wishes you so well in all things that relate to your prosperity have their intervals of wishing for themselves and are within a little of grudging you the fulness of your fortune they would be more malicious if you used it not so well and with so much generosity  fame is in itself a real good if we may believe cicero who was perhaps too fond of it but even fame as virgil tells us acquires strength by going forward  let epicurus give indolency as an attribute to his gods and place in it the happiness of the blest the divinity which we worship has given us not only a precept against it but his own example to the contrary  the world my lord would be content to allow you a seventh day for rest or if you thought that hard upon you we would not refuse you half your time  if you came out like some great monarch to take a town but once a year as it were for your diversion though you had no need to extend your territories  in short if you were a bad or which is worse an indifferent poet we would thank you for our own quiet and not expose you to the want of yours  but when you are so great and so successful and when we have that necessity of your writing that we cannot subsist entirely without it any more i may almost say than the world without the daily course of ordinary providence methinks this argument might prevail with you my lord to forego a little of your repose for the public benefit  it is not that you are under any force of working daily miracles to prove your being but now and then somewhat of extraordinarythat is anything of your productionis requisite to refresh your character  this i think my lord is a sufficient reproach to you and should i carry it as far as mankind would authorise me would be little less than satire  and indeed a provocation is almost necessary in behalf of the world that you might be induced sometimes to write and in relation to a multitude of scribblers who daily pester the world with their insufferable stuff that they might be discouraged from writing any more  i complain not of their lampoons and libels though i have been the public mark for many years  i am vindictive enough to have repelled force by force if i could imagine that any of them had ever reached me  but they either shot at rovers and therefore missed or their powder was so weak that i might safely stand them at the nearest distance  i answered not the rehearsal because i knew the author sat to himself when he drew the picture and was the very bayes of his own farce because also i knew that my betters were more concerned than i was in that satire and lastly because mr smith and mr johnson the main pillars of it were two such languishing gentlemen in their conversation that i could liken them to nothing but to their own relations those noble characters of men of wit and pleasure about the town  the like considerations have hindered me from dealing with the lamentable companions of their prose and doggerel  i am so far from defending my poetry against them that i will not so much as expose theirs  and for my morals if they are not proof against their attacks let me be thought by posterity what those authors would be thought if any memory of them or of their writings could endure so long as to another age  but these dull makers of lampoons as harmless as they have been to me are yet of dangerous example to the public  some witty men may perhaps succeed to their designs and mixing sense with malice blast the reputation of the most innocent amongst men and the most virtuous amongst women  heaven be praised our common libellers are as free from the imputation of wit as of morality and therefore whatever mischief they have designed they have performed but little of it  yet these ill writers in all justice ought themselves to be exposed as persius has given us a fair example in his first satire which is levelled particularly at them and none is so fit to correct their faults as he who is not only clear from any in his own writings but is also so just that he will never defame the good and is armed with the power of verse to punish and make examples of the bad  but of this i shall have occasion to speak further when i come to give the definition and character of true satires  in the meantime as a counsellor bred up in the knowledge of the municipal and statute laws may honestly inform a just prince how far his prerogative extends so i may be allowed to tell your lordship who by an undisputed title are the king of poets what an extent of power you have and how lawfully you may exercise it over the petulant scribblers of this age  as lord chamberlain i know you are absolute by your office in all that belongs to the decency and good manners of the stage  you can banish from thence scurrility and profaneness and restrain the licentious insolence of poets and their actors in all things that shock the public quiet or the reputation of private persons under the notion of humour  but i mean not the authority which is annexed to your office i speak of that only which is inborn and inherent to your person what is produced in you by an excellent wit a masterly and commanding genius over all writers  whereby you are empowered when you please to give the final decision of wit to put your stamp on all that ought to pass for current and set a brand of reprobation on clipped poetry and false coin  a shilling dipped in the bath may go for gold amongst the ignorant but the sceptres on the guineas show the difference  that your lordship is formed by nature for this supremacy i could easily prove were it not already granted by the world from the distinguishing character of your writing which is so visible to me that i never could be imposed on to receive for yours what was written by any others or to mistake your genuine poetry for their spurious productions  i can farther add with truth though not without some vanity in saying it that in the same paper written by divers hands whereof your lordships was only part i could separate your gold from their copper and though i could not give back to every author his own brass for there is not the same rule for distinguishing betwixt bad and bad as betwixt ill and excellently good yet i never failed of knowing what was yours and what was not and was absolutely certain that this or the other part was positively yours and could not possibly be written by any other  true it is that some bad poems though not all carry their owners marks about them  there is some peculiar awkwardness false grammar imperfect sense or at the least obscurity some brand or other on this buttock or that ear that it is notorious who are the owners of the cattle though they should not sign it with their names  but your lordship on the contrary is distinguished not only by the excellency of your thoughts but by your style and manner of expressing them  a painter judging of some admirable piece may affirm with certainty that it was of holbein or vandyck but vulgar designs and common draughts are easily mistaken and misapplied  thus by my long study of your lordship i am arrived at the knowledge of your particular manner  in the good poems of other men like those artists i can only say this is like the draught of such a one or like the colouring of another in short i can only be sure that it is the hand of a good master  but in your performances it is scarcely possible for me to be deceived  if you write in your strength you stand revealed at the first view and should you write under it you cannot avoid some peculiar graces which only cost me a second consideration to discover you  for i may say it with all the severity of truth that every line of yours is precious  your lordships only fault is that you have not written more unless i could add another and that yet greater but i fear for the public the accusation would not be truethat you have written and out of a vicious modesty will not publish  virgil has confined his works within the compass of eighteen thousand lines and has not treated many subjects yet he ever had and ever will have the reputation of the best poet  martial says of him that he could have excelled varius in tragedy and horace in lyric poetry but out of deference to his friends he attempted neither  the same prevalence of genius is in your lordship but the world cannot pardon your concealing it on the same consideration because we have neither a living varius nor a horace in whose excellences both of poems odes and satires you had equalled them if our language had not yielded to the roman majesty and length of time had not added a reverence to the works of horace  for good sense is the same in all or most ages and course of time rather improves nature than impairs her  what has been may be again another homer and another virgil may possible arise from those very causes which produced the first though it would be impudence to affirm that any such have yet appeared  it is manifest that some particular ages have been more happy than others in the production of great men in all sorts of arts and sciences as that of euripides sophocles aristophanes and the rest for stagepoetry amongst the greeks that of augustus for heroic lyric dramatic elegiac and indeed all sorts of poetry in the persons of virgil horace varius ovid and many others especially if we take into that century the latter end of the commonwealth wherein we find varro lucretius and catullus and at the same time lived cicero and sallust and caesar  a famous age in modern times for learning in every kind was that of lorenzo de medici and his son leo the tenth wherein painting was revived and poetry flourished and the greek language was restored  examples in all these are obvious but what i would infer is this that in such an age it is possible some great genius may arise to equal any of the ancients abating only for the language for great contemporaries whet and cultivate each other and mutual borrowing and commerce makes the common riches of learning as it does of the civil government  but suppose that homer and virgil were the only of their species and that nature was so much worn out in producing them that she is never able to hear the like again yet the example only holds in heroic poetry in tragedy and satire i offer myself to maintain against some of our modern critics that this age and the last particularly in england have excelled the ancients in both those kinds and i would instance in shakespeare of the former of your lordship in the latter sort  thus i might safely confine myself to my native country  but if i would only cross the seas i might find in france a living horace and a juvenal in the person of the admirable boileau whose numbers are excellent whose expressions are noble whose thoughts are just whose language is pure whose satire is pointed and whose sense is close  what he borrows from the ancients he repays with usury of his own in coin as good and almost as universally valuable  for setting prejudice and partiality apart though he is our enemy the stamp of a louis the patron of all arts is not much inferior to the medal of an augustus caesar  let this be said without entering into the interests of factions and parties and relating only to the bounty of that king to men of learning and merita praise so just that even we who are his enemies cannot refuse it to him  now if it may be permitted me to go back again to the consideration of epic poetry i have confessed that no man hitherto has reached or so much as approached to the excellences of homer or of virgil i must farther add that statius the best versificator next to virgil knew not how to design after him though he had the model in his eye that lucan is wanting both in design and subject and is besides too full of heat and affectation that amongst the moderns ariosto neither designed justly nor observed any unity of action or compass of time or moderation in the vastness of his draught  his style is luxurious without majesty or decency and his adventures without the compass of nature and possibility  tasso whose design was regular and who observed the roles of unity in time and place more closely than virgil yet was not so happy in his action  he confesses himself to have been too lyricalthat is to have written beneath the dignity of heroic versein his episodes of sophronia erminia and armida  his story is not so pleasing as ariostos he is too flatulent sometimes and sometimes too dry many times unequal and almost always forced and besides is full of conceits points of epigram and witticisms all which are not only below the dignity of heroic verse but contrary to its nature virgil and homer have not one of them  and those who are guilty of so boyish an ambition in so grave a subject are so far from being considered as heroic poets that they ought to be turned down from homer to the anthologia from virgil to martial and owens epigrams and from spenser to flecknoethat is from the top to the bottom of all poetry  but to return to tasso  he borrows from the invention of boiardo and in his alteration of his poem which is infinitely for the worse imitates homer so very servilely that for example he gives the king of jerusalem fifty sons only because homer had bestowed the like number on king priam he kills the youngest in the same manner and has provided his hero with a patroclus under another name only to bring him back to the wars when his friend was killed  the french have performed nothing in this kind which is not far below those two italians and subject to a thousand more reflections without examining their st louis their pucelle or their alaric  the english have only to boast of spenser and milton who neither of them wanted either genius or learning to have been perfect poets and yet both of them are liable to many censures  for there is no uniformity in the design of spenser he aims at the accomplishment of no one action he raises up a hero for every one of his adventures and endows each of them with some particular moral virtue which renders them all equal without subordination or preference  every one is most valiant in his own legend  only we must do him that justice to observe that magnanimity which is the character of prince arthur shines throughout the whole poem and succours the rest when they are in distress  the original of every knight was then living in the court of queen elizabeth and he attributed to each of them that virtue which he thought was most conspicuous in theman ingenious piece of flattery though it turned not much to his account  had he lived to finish his poem in the six remaining legends it had certainly been more of a piece but could not have been perfect because the model was not true  but prince arthur or his chief patron sir philip sidney whom he intended to make happy by the marriage of his gloriana dying before him deprived the poet both of means and spirit to accomplish his design  for the rest his obsolete language and the ill choice of his stanza are faults but of the second magnitude for notwithstanding the first he is still intelligibleat least after a little practice and for the last he is the more to be admired that labouring under such a difficulty his verses are so numerous so various and so harmonious that only virgil whom he professedly imitated has surpassed him among the romans and only mr waller among the english  as for mr milton whom we all admire with so much justice his subject is not that of an heroic poem properly so called  his design is the losing of our happiness his event is not prosperous like that of all other epic works his heavenly machines are many and his human persons are but two  but i will not take mr rymers work out of his hands  he has promised the world a critique on that author wherein though he will not allow his poem for heroic i hope he will grant us that his thoughts are elevated his words sounding and that no man has so happily copied the manner of homer or so copiously translated his grecisms and the latin elegances of virgil it is true he runs into a flat of thought sometimes for a hundred lines together but it is when he has got into a track of scripture his antiquated words were his choice not his necessity for therein he imitated spenser as spencer did chaucer  and though perhaps the love of their masters may have transported both too far in the frequent use of them yet in my opinion obsolete words may then be laudably revived when either they are more sounding or more significant than those in practice and when their obscurity is taken away by joining other words to them which clear the sense according to the rule of horace for the admission of new words  but in both cases a moderation is to be observed in the use of them for unnecessary coinage as well as unnecessary revival runs into affectationa fault to be avoided on either hand  neither will i justify milton for his blank verse though i may excuse him by the example of hannibal caro and other italians who have used it for whatever causes he alleges for the abolishing of rhyme which i have not now the leisure to examine his own particular reason is plainly thisthat rhyme was not his talent he had neither the ease of doing it nor the graces of it  which is manifest in his juvenilia or verses written in his youth where his rhyme is always constrained and forced and comes hardly from him at an age when the soul is most pliant and the passion of love makes almost every man a rhymer though not a poet  by this time my lord i doubt not but that you wonder why i have run off from my bias so long together and made so tedious a digression from satire to heroic poetry but if you will not excuse it by the tattling quality of age which as sir william davenant says is always narrative yet i hope the usefulness of what i have to say on this subject will qualify the remoteness of it and this is the last time i will commit the crime of prefaces or trouble the world with my notions of anything that relates to verse  i have then as you see observed the failings of many great wits amongst the moderns who have attempted to write an epic poem  besides these or the like animadversions of them by other men there is yet a farther reason given why they cannot possibly succeed so well as the ancients even though we could allow them not to be inferior either in genius or learning or the tongue in which they write or all those other wonderful qualifications which are necessary to the forming of a true accomplished heroic poet  the fault is laid on our religion they say that christianity is not capable of those embellishments which are afforded in the belief of those ancient heathens  and it is true that in the severe notions of our faith the fortitude of a christian consists in patience and suffering for the love of god whatever hardships can befall in the worldnot in any great attempt or in performance of those enterprises which the poets call heroic and which are commonly the effects of interest ostentation pride and worldly honour that humility and resignation are our prime virtues and that these include no action but that of the soul whereas on the contrary an heroic poem requires to its necessary design and as its last perfection some great action of war the accomplishment of some extraordinary undertaking which requires the strength and vigour of the body the duty of a soldier the capacity and prudence of a general and in short as much or more of the active virtue than the suffering  but to this the answer is very obvious  god has placed us in our several stations the virtues of a private christian are patience obedience submission and the like but those of a magistrate or a general or a king are prudence counsel active fortitude coercive power awful command and the exercise of magnanimity as well as justice so that this objection hinders not but that an epic poem or the heroic action of some great commander enterprised for the common good and honour of the christian cause and executed happily may be as well written now as it was of old by the heathens provided the poet be endued with the same talents and the language though not of equal dignity yet as near approaching to it as our modern barbarism will allowwhich is all that can be expected from our own or any other now extant though more refined and therefore we are to rest contented with that only inferiority which is not possibly to be remedied  i wish i could as easily remove that other difficulty which yet remains  it is objected by a great french critic as well as an admirable poet yet living and whom i have mentioned with that honour which his merit exacts from me i mean boileau that the machines of our christian religion in heroic poetry are much more feeble to support that weight than those of heathenism  their doctrine grounded as it was on ridiculous fables was yet the belief of the two victorious monarchies the grecian and roman their gods did not only interest themselves in the event of wars which is the effect of a superior providence but also espoused the several parties in a visible corporeal descent managed their intrigues and fought their battles sometimes in opposition to each other though virgil more discreet than homer in that last particular has contented himself with the partiality of his deities their favours their counsels or commands to those whose cause they had espoused without bringing them to the outrageousness of blows  now our religion says he is deprived of the greatest part of those machinesat least the most shining in epic poetry though st michael in ariosto seeks out discord to send her amongst the pagans and finds her in a convent of friars where peace should reign which indeed is fine satire and satan in tasso excites soliman to an attempt by night on the christian camp and brings a host of devils to his assistance yet the archangel in the former example when discord was restive and would not be drawn from her beloved monastery with fair words has the whiphand of her drags her out with many stripes sets her on gods name about her business and makes her know the difference of strength betwixt a nuncio of heaven and a minister of hell  the same angel in the latter instance from tasso as if god had never another messenger belonging to the court but was confined like jupiter to mercury and juno to iris when he sees his timethat is when half of the christians are already killed and all the rest are in a fair way to be routedstickles betwixt the remainders of gods host and the race of fiends pulls the devils backward by the tails and drives them from their quarry or otherwise the whole business had miscarried and jerusalem remained untaken  this says boileau is a very unequal match for the poor devils who are sure to come by the worst of it in the combat for nothing is more easy than for an almighty power to bring his old rebels to reason when he pleases consequently what pleasure what entertainment can be raised from so pitiful a machine where we see the success of the battle from the very beginning of it unless that as we are christians we are glad that we have gotten god on our side to maul our enemies when we cannot do the work ourselves  for if the poet had given the faithful more courage which had cost him nothing or at least have made them exceed the turks in number he might have gained the victory for us christians without interesting heaven in the quarrel and that with as much ease and as little credit to the conqueror as when a party of a hundred soldiers defeats another which consists only of fifty  this my lord i confess is such an argument against our modern poetry as cannot be answered by those mediums which have been used we cannot hitherto boast that our religion has furnished us with any such machines as have made the strength and beauty of the ancient buildings  but what if i venture to advance an invention of my own to supply the manifest defect of our new writers  i am sufficiently sensible of my weakness and it is not very probable that i should succeed in such a project whereof i have not had the least hint from any of my predecessors the poets or any of their seconds or coadjutors the critics  yet we see the art of war is improved in sieges and new instruments of death are invented daily  something new in philosophy and the mechanics is discovered almost every year and the science of former ages is improved by the succeeding  i will not detain you with a long preamble to that which better judges will perhaps conclude to be little worth  it is this in shortthat christian poets have not hitherto been acquainted with their own strength  if they had searched the old testament as they ought they might there have found the machines which are proper for their work and those more certain in their effect than it may be the new testament is in the rules sufficient for salvation  the perusing of one chapter in the prophecy of daniel and accommodating what there they find with the principles of platonic philosophy as it is now christianised would have made the ministry of angels as strong an engine for the working up heroic poetry in our religion as that of the ancients has been to raise theirs by all the fables of their gods which were only received for truths by the most ignorant and weakest of the people  it is a doctrine almost universally received by christians as well protestants as catholics that there are guardian angels appointed by god almighty as his vicegerents for the protection and government of cities provinces kingdoms and monarchies and those as well of heathens as of true believers  all this is so plainly proved from those texts of daniel that it admits of no farther controversy  the prince of the persians and that other of the grecians are granted to be the guardians and protecting ministers of those empires  it cannot be denied that they were opposite and resisted one another st michael is mentioned by his name as the patron of the jews and is now taken by the christians as the protectorgeneral of our religion  these tutelar genii who presided over the several people and regions committed to their charge were watchful over them for good as far as their commissions could possibly extend  the general purpose and design of all was certainly the service of their great creator  but it is an undoubted truth that for ends best known to the almighty majesty of heaven his providential designs for the benefit of his creatures for the debasing and punishing of some nations and the exaltation and temporal reward of others were not wholly known to these his ministers else why those factious quarrels controversies and battles amongst themselves when they were all united in the same design the service and honour of their common master  but being instructed only in the general and zealous of the main design and as finite beings not admitted into the secrets of government the last resorts of providence or capable of discovering the final purposes of god who can work good out of evil as he pleases and irresistibly sways all manner of events on earth directing them finally for the best to his creation in general and to the ultimate end of his own glory in particular they must of necessity be sometimes ignorant of the means conducing to those ends in which alone they can jar and oppose each other one angel as we may suppose the prince of persia as he is called judging that it would be more for gods honour and the benefit of his people that the median and persian monarchy which delivered them from the babylonish captivity should still be uppermost and the patron of the grecians to whom the will of god might be more particularly revealed contending on the other side for the rise of alexander and his successors who were appointed to punish the backsliding jews and thereby to put them in mind of their offences that they might repent and become more virtuous and more observant of the law revealed  but how far these controversies and appearing enmities of those glorious creatures may be carried how these oppositions may be best managed and by what means conducted is not my business to show or determine  these things must be left to the invention and judgment of the poet if any of so happy a genius be now living or any future age can produce a man who being conversant in the philosophy of plato as it is now accommodated to christian use for as virgil gives us to understand by his example that is the only proper of all others for an epic poem who to his natural endowments of a large invention a ripe judgment and a strong memory has joined the knowledge of the liberal arts and sciences and particularly moral philosophy the mathematics geography and history and with all these qualifications is born a poet knows and can practise the variety of numbers and is master of the language in which he writesif such a man i say be now arisen or shall arise i am vain enough to think that i have proposed a model to him by which he may build a nobler a more beautiful and more perfect poem than any yet extant since the ancients  there is another part of these machines yet wanting but by what i have said it would have been easily supplied by a judicious writer he could not have failed to add the opposition of ill spirits to the good they have also their design ever opposite to that of heaven and this alone has hitherto been the practice of the moderns  but this imperfect system if i may call it such which i have given will infinitely advance and carry farther that hypothesis of the evil spirits contending with the good  for being so much weaker since their fall than those blessed beings they are yet supposed to have a permitted power from god of acting ill as from their own depraved nature they have always the will of designing ita great testimony of which we find in holy writ when god almighty suffered satan to appear in the holy synod of the angels a thing not hitherto drawn into example by any of the poets and also gave him power over all things belonging to his servant job excepting only life  now what these wicked spirits cannot compass by the vast disproportion of their forces to those of the superior beings they may by their fraud and cunning carry farther in a seeming league confederacy or subserviency to the designs of some good angel as far as consists with his purity to suffer such an aid the end of which may possibly be disguised and concealed from his finite knowledge  this is indeed to suppose a great error in such a being yet since a devil can appear like an angel of light since craft and malice may sometimes blind for a while a more perfect understanding and lastly since milton has given us an example of the like nature when satan appearing like a cherub to uriel the intelligence of the sun circumvented him even in his own province and passed only for a curious traveller through those newcreated regions that he might observe therein the workmanship of god and praise him in his worksi know not why upon the same supposition or some other a fiend may not deceive a creature of more excellency than himself but yet a creature at least by the connivance or tacit permission of the omniscient being  thus my lord i have as briefly as i could given your lordship and by you the world a rude draught of what i have been long labouring in my imagination and what i had intended to have put in practice though far unable for the attempt of such a poem and to have left the stage to which my genius never much inclined me for a work which would have taken up my life in the performance of it this too i had intended chiefly for the honour of my native country to which a poet is particularly obliged  of two subjects both relating to it i was doubtfulwhether i should choose that of king arthur conquering the saxons which being farther distant in time gives the greater scope to my invention or that of edward the black prince in subduing spain and restoring it to the lawful prince though a great tyrant don pedro the cruelwhich for the compass of time including only the expedition of one year for the greatness of the action and its answerable event for the magnanimity of the english hero opposed to the ingratitude of the person whom he restored and for the many beautiful episodes which i had interwoven with the principal design together with the characters of the chiefest english persons wherein after virgil and spenser i would have taken occasion to represent my living friends and patrons of the noblest families and also shadowed the events of future ages in the succession of our imperial linewith these helps and those of the machines which i have mentioned i might perhaps have done as well as some of my predecessors or at least chalked out a way for others to amend my errors in a like design but being encouraged only with fair words by king charles the second my little salary ill paid and no prospect of a future subsistence i was then discouraged in the beginning of my attempt and now age has overtaken me and want a more insufferable evil through the change of the times has wholly disenabled me though i must ever acknowledge to the honour of your lordship and the eternal memory of your charity that since this revolution wherein i have patiently suffered the ruin of my small fortune and the loss of that poor subsistence which i had from two kings whom i had served more faithfully than profitably to myselfthen your lordship was pleased out of no other motive but your own nobleness without any desert of mine or the least solicitation from me to make me a most bountiful present which at that time when i was most in want of it came most seasonably and unexpectedly to my relief  that favour my lord is of itself sufficient to bind any grateful man to a perpetual acknowledgment and to all the future service which one of my mean condition can be ever able to perform  may the almighty god return it for me both in blessing you here and rewarding you hereafter  i must not presume to defend the cause for which i now suffer because your lordship is engaged against it but the more you are so the greater is my obligation to you for your laying aside all the considerations of factions and parties to do an action of pure disinterested charity  this is one amongst many of your shining qualities which distinguish you from others of your rank but let me add a farther truththat without these ties of gratitude and abstracting from them all i have a most particular inclination to honour you and if it were not too bold an expression to say i love you  it is no shame to be a poet though it is to be a bad one  augustus caesar of old and cardinal richelieu of late would willingly have been such and david and solomon were such  you who without flattery are the best of the present age in england and would have been so had you been born in any other country will receive more honour in future ages by that one excellency than by all those honours to which your birth has entitled you or your merits have acquired you   ne forte pudori sit tibi musa lyrae solers et cantor apollo   i have formerly said in this epistle that i could distinguish your writings from those of any others it is now time to clear myself from any imputation of selfconceit on that subject  i assume not to myself any particular lights in this discovery they are such only as are obvious to every man of sense and judgment who loves poetry and understands it  your thoughts are always so remote from the common way of thinking that they are as i may say of another species than the conceptions of other poets yet you go not out of nature for any of them  gold is never bred upon the surface of the ground but lies so hidden and so deep that the mines of it are seldom found but the force of waters casts it out from the bowels of mountains and exposes it amongst the sands of rivers giving us of her bounty what we could not hope for by our search  this success attends your lordships thoughts which would look like chance if it were not perpetual and always of the same tenor  if i grant that there is care in it it is such a care as would be ineffectual and fruitless in other men it is the curiosa felicitas which petronius ascribes to horace in his odes  we have not wherewithal to imagine so strongly so justly and so pleasantly in short if we have the same knowledge we cannot draw out of it the same quintessence we cannot give it such a turn such a propriety and such a beauty  something is deficient in the manner or the words but more in the nobleness of our conception  yet when you have finished all and it appears in its full lustre when the diamond is not only found but the roughness smoothed when it is cut into a form and set in gold then we cannot but acknowledge that it is the perfect work of art and nature and every one will be so vain to think he himself could have performed the like until he attempts it  it is just the description that horace makes of such a finished piece it appears so easy   ut sibi quivis speret idem sudet multum frustraque laboret ausus idem   and besides all this it is your lordships particular talent to lay your thoughts so chose together that were they closer they would be crowded and even a due connection would be wanting  we are not kept in expectation of two good lines which are to come after a long parenthesis of twenty bad which is the april poetry of other writers a mixture of rain and sunshine by fits  you are always bright even almost to a fault by reason of the excess  there is continual abundance a magazine of thought and yet a perpetual variety of entertainment which creates such an appetite in your reader that he is not cloyed with anything but satisfied with all it is that which the romans call caena dubia where there is such plenty yet withal so much diversity and so good order that the choice is difficult betwixt one excellency and another and yet the conclusion by a due climax is evermore the bestthat is as a conclusion ought to be ever the most proper for its place  see my lord whether i have not studied your lordship with some application  and since you are so modest that you will not be judge and party i appeal to the whole world if i have not drawn your picture to a great degree of likeness though it is but in miniature and that some of the best features are yet wanting  yet what i have done is enough to distinguish you from any other which is the proposition that i took upon me to demonstrate  and now my lord to apply what i have said to my present business the satires of juvenal and persius appearing in this new english dress cannot so properly be inscribed to any man as to your lordship who are the first of the age in that way of writing  your lordship amongst many other favours has given me your permission for this address and you have particularly encouraged me by your perusal and approbation of the sixth and tenth satires of juvenal as i have translated them  my fellowlabourers have likewise commissioned me to perform in their behalf this office of a dedication to you and will acknowledge with all possible respect and gratitude your acceptance of their work  some of them have the honour to be known to your lordship already and they who have not yet that happiness desire it now  be pleased to receive our common endeavours with your wonted candour without entitling you to the protection of our common failings in so difficult an undertaking and allow me your patience if it be not already tired with this long epistle to give you from the best authors the origin the antiquity the growth the change and the completement of satire among the romans to describe if not define the nature of that poem with its several qualifications and virtues together with the several sorts of it to compare the excellencies of horace persius and juvenal and show the particular manners of their satires and lastly to give an account of this new way of version which is attempted in our performance  all which according to the weakness of my ability and the best lights which i can get from others shall be the subject of my following discourse  the most perfect work of poetry says our master aristotle is tragedy  his reason is because it is the most united being more severely confined within the rules of action time and place  the action is entire of a piece and one without episodes the time limited to a natural day and the place circumscribed at least within the compass of one town or city  being exactly proportioned thus and uniform in all its parts the mind is more capable of comprehending the whole beauty of it without distraction  but after all these advantages an heroic poem is certainly the greatest work of human nature  the beauties and perfections of the other are but mechanical those of the epic are more noble  though homer has limited his place to troy and the fields about it his actions to fortyeight natural days whereof twelve are holidays or cessation from business during the funeral of patroclus  to proceed  the action of the epic is greater the extension of time enlarges the pleasure of the reader and the episodes give it more ornament and more variety  the instruction is equal but the first is only instructive the latter forms a hero and a prince  if it signifies anything which of them is of the more ancient family the best and most absolute heroic poem was written by homer long before tragedy was invented  but if we consider the natural endowments and acquired parts which are necessary to make an accomplished writer in either kind tragedy requires a less and more confined knowledge moderate learning and observation of the rules is sufficient if a genius be not wanting  but in an epic poet one who is worthy of that name besides an universal genius is required universal learning together with all those qualities and acquisitions which i have named above and as many more as i have through haste or negligence omitted  and after all he must have exactly studied homer and virgil as his patterns aristotle and horace as his guides and vida and bossu as their commentators with many others both italian and french critics which i want leisure here to recommend  in a word what i have to say in relation to this subject which does not particularly concern satire is that the greatness of an heroic poem beyond that of a tragedy may easily be discovered by observing how few have attempted that work in comparison to those who have written dramas and of those few how small a number have succeeded  but leaving the critics on either side to contend about the preference due to this or that sort of poetry i will hasten to my present business which is the antiquity and origin of satire according to those informations which i have received from the learned casaubon heinsius rigaltius dacier and the dauphins juvenal to which i shall add some observations of my own  there has been a long dispute among the modern critics whether the romans derived their satire from the grecians or first invented it themselves  julius scaliger and heinsius are of the first opinion casaubon rigaltius dacier and the publisher of dauphins juvenal maintain the latter  if we take satire in the general signification of the word as it is used in all modern languages for an invective it is certain that it is almost as old as verse and though hymns which are praises of god may be allowed to have been before it yet the defamation of others was not long after it after god had cursed adam and eve in paradise the husband and wife excused themselves by laying the blame on one another and gave a beginning to those conjugal dialogues in prose which the poets have perfected in verse  the third chapter of job is one of the first instances of this poem in holy scripture unless we will take it higher from the latter end of the second where his wife advises him to curse his maker  this original i confess is not much to the honour of satire but here it was nature and that depraved  when it became an art it bore better fruit  only we have learnt thus much alreadythat scoffs and revilings are of the growth of all nations and consequently that neither the greek poets borrowed from other people their art of railing neither needed the romans to take it from them  but considering satire as a species of poetry here the war begins amongst the critics  scaliger the father will have it descend from greece to rome and derives the word satire from satyrus that mixed kind of animal or as the ancients thought him rural god made up betwixt a man and a goat with a human head hooked nose pouting lips a bunch or struma under the chin pricked ears and upright horns the body shagged with hair especially from the waist and ending in a goat with the legs and feet of that creature  but casaubon and his followers with reason condemn this derivation and prove that from satyrus the word satira as it signifies a poem cannot possibly descend  for satira is not properly a substantive but an adjective to which the word lanx in english a charger or large platter is understood  so that the greek poem made according to the manners of a  satyr and expressing his qualities must properly be called satirical and not satire and thus far it is allowed that the grecians had such poems but that they were wholly different in species from that to which the romans gave the name of satire  aristotle divides all poetry in relation to the progress of it into nature without art art begun and art completed  mankind even the most barbarous have the seeds of poetry implanted in them the first specimen of it was certainly shown in the praises of the deity and prayers to him and as they are of natural obligation so they are likewise of divine institution  which milton observing introduces adam and eve every morning adoring god in hymns and prayers  the first poetry was thus begun in the wild notes of natural poetry before the invention of feet and measures  the grecians and romans had no other original of their poetry festivals and holidays soon succeeded to private worship and we need not doubt but they were enjoined by the true god to his own people as they were afterwards imitated by the heathens who by the light of reason knew they were to invoke some superior being in their necessities and to thank him for his benefits  thus the grecian holidays were celebrated with offerings to bacchus and ceres and other deities to whose bounty they supposed they were owing for their corn and wine and other helps of life  and the ancient romans as horace tells us paid their thanks to mother earth or vesta to silvanus and their genius in the same manner  but as all festivals have a double reason of their institutionthe first of religion the other of recreation for the unbending of our mindsso both the grecians and romans agreed after their sacrifices were performed to spend the remainder of the day in sports and merriments amongst which songs and dances and that which they called wit for want of knowing better were the chiefest entertainments  the grecians had a notion of satyrs whom i have already described and taking them and the silenithat is the young satyrs and the oldfor the tutors attendants and humble companions of their bacchus habited themselves like those rural deities and imitated them in their rustic dances to which they joined songs with some sort of rude harmony but without certain numbers and to these they added a kind of chorus  the romans also as nature is the same in all places though they knew nothing of those grecian demigods nor had any communication with greece yet had certain young men who at their festivals danced and sang after their uncouth manner to a certain kind of verse which they called saturnian  what it was we have no certain light from antiquity to discover but we may conclude that like the grecian it was void of art or at least with very feeble beginnings of it those ancient romans at these holy days which were a mixture of devotion and debauchery had a custom of reproaching each other with their faults in a sort of extempore poetry or rather of tunable hobbling verse and they answered in the same kind of gross raillerytheir wit and their music being of a piece  the grecians says casaubon had formerly done the same in the persons of their petulant satyrs but i am afraid he mistakes the matter and confounds the singing and dancing of the satyrs with the rustical entertainments of the first romans  the reason of my opinion is this  that casaubon finding little light from antiquity of these beginnings of poetry amongst the grecians but only these representations of satyrs who carried canisters and cornucopias full of several fruits in their hands and danced with them at their public feasts and afterwards reading horace who makes mention of his homely romans jesting at one another in the same kind of solemnities might suppose those wanton satyrs did the same and especially because horace possibly might seem to him to have shown the original of all poetry in general including the grecians as well as romans though it is plainly otherwise that he only described the beginning and first rudiments of poetry in his own country  the verses are these which he cites from the first epistle of the second book which was written to augustus   agricolae prisci fortes parvoque beati condita post frumenta levantes tempore festo corpus et ipsum animum spe finis dura ferentem cum sociis operum et pueris et conjuge fida tellurem porco silvanum lacte piabant floribus et vino genium memorem brevis aevi fescennina per hunc inventa licentia morem versibus alternis opprobria rustica fudit   our brawny clowns of old who turned the soil content with little and inured to toil at harvesthome with mirth and country cheer restored their bodies for another year refreshed their spirits and renewed their hope of such a future feast and future crop then with their fellowjoggers of the ploughs their little children and their faithful spouse a sow they slew to vestas deity and kindly milk silvanus poured to thee with flowers and wine their genius they adored a short life and a merry was the word from flowing cups defaming rhymes ensue and at each other homely taunts they threw   yet since it is a hard conjecture that so great a man as casaubon should misapply what horace writ concerning ancient rome to the ceremonies and manners of ancient greece i will not insist on this opinion but rather judge in general that since all poetry had its original from religion that of the grecians and rome had the same beginning  both were invented at festivals of thanksgiving and both were prosecuted with mirth and raillery and rudiments of verses amongst the greeks by those who represented satyrs and amongst the romans by real clowns  for indeed when i am reading casaubon on these two subjects methinks i hear the same story told twice over with very little alteration  of which dacier taking notice in his interpretation of the latin verses which i have translated says plainly that the beginning of poetry was the same with a small variety in both countries and that the mother of it in all nations was devotion but what is yet more wonderful that most learned critic takes notice also in his illustrations on the first epistle of the second book that as the poetry of the romans and that of the grecians had the same beginning at feasts and thanksgiving as it has been observed and the old comedy of the greeks which was invective and the satire of the romans which was of the same nature were begun on the very same occasion so the fortune of both in process of time was just the samethe old comedy of the grecians was forbidden for its too much licence in exposing of particular persons and the rude satire of the romans was also punished by a law of the decemviri as horace tells us in these words   libertasque recurrentes accepta per annos lusit amabiliter donec jam saevus apertam in rabiem verti caepit jocus et per honestas ire domos impune minax  doluere cruento dente lacessiti fuit intactis quoque cura conditione super communi  quinetiam lex paenaque lata malo quae nollet carmine quenquam describi  vertere modum formidine fustis ad benedicendum delectandumque redacti   the law of the decemviri was this  siquis occentassit malum carmen sive condidissit quod infamiam faxit flagitiumve alteri capital esto  a strange likeness and barely possible but the critics being all of the same opinion it becomes me to be silent and to submit to better judgments than my own  but to return to the grecians from whose satiric dramas the elder scaliger and heinsius will have the roman satire to proceed i am to take a view of them first and see if there be any such descent from them as those authors have pretended  thespis or whoever he were that invented tragedy for authors differ mingled with them a chorus and dances of satyrs which had before been used in the celebration of their festivals and there they were ever afterwards retained  the character of them was also kept which was mirth and wantonness and this was given i suppose to the folly of the common audience who soon grow weary of good sense and as we daily see in our own age and country are apt to forsake poetry and still ready to return to buffoonery and farce from hence it came that in the olympic games where the poets contended for four prizes the satiric tragedy was the last of them for in the rest the satyrs were excluded from the chorus  amongst the plays of euripides which are yet remaining there is one of these satirics which is called the cyclops in which we may see the nature of those poems and from thence conclude what likeness they have to the roman satire  the story of this cyclops whose name was polyphemus so famous in the grecian fables was that ulysses who with his company was driven on the coast of sicily where those cyclops inhabited coming to ask relief from silenus and the satyrs who were herdsmen to that oneeyed giant was kindly received by them and entertained till being perceived by polyphemus they were made prisoners against the rites of hospitality for which ulysses eloquently pleaded were afterwards put down into the den and some of them devoured after which ulysses having made him drunk when he was asleep thrust a great firebrand into his eye and so revenging his dead followers escaped with the remaining party of the living and silenus and the satyrs were freed from their servitude under polyphemus and remitted to their first liberty of attending and accompanying their patron bacchus  this was the subject of the tragedy which being one of those that end with a happy event is therefore by aristotle judged below the other sort whose success is unfortunate notwithstanding which the satyrs who were part of the dramatis personae as well as the whole chorus were properly introduced into the nature of the poem which is mixed of farce and tragedy  the adventure of ulysses was to entertain the judging part of the audience and the uncouth persons of silenus and the satyrs to divert the common people with their gross railleries  your lordship has perceived by this time that this satiric tragedy and the roman satire have little resemblance in any of their features  the very kinds are different for what has a pastoral tragedy to do with a paper of verses satirically written  the character and raillery of the satyrs is the only thing that could pretend to a likeness were scaliger and heinsius alive to maintain their opinion  and the first farces of the romans which were the rudiments of their poetry were written before they had any communication with the greeks or indeed any knowledge of that people  and here it will be proper to give the definition of the greek satiric poem from casaubon before i leave this subject  the satiric says he is a dramatic poem annexed to a tragedy having a chorus which consists of satyrs  the persons represented in it are illustrious men the action of it is great the style is partly serious and partly jocular and the event of the action most commonly is happy  the grecians besides these satiric tragedies had another kind of poem which they called silli which were more of kin to the roman satire  those silli were indeed invective poems but of a different species from the roman poems of ennius pacuvius lucilius horace and the rest of their successors  they were so called says casaubon in one place from silenus the foster father of bacchus but in another place bethinking himself better he derives their name greek text which cannot be reproduced from their scoffing and petulancy  from some fragments of the silli written by timon we may find that they were satiric poems full of parodies that is of verses patched up from great poets and turned into another sense than their author intended them  such amongst the romans is the famous cento of ausonius where the words are virgils but by applying them to another sense they are made a relation of a weddingnight and the act of consummation fulsomely described in the very words of the most modest amongst all poets of the same manner are our songs which are turned into burlesque and the serious words of the author perverted into a ridiculous meaning  thus in timons silli the words are generally those of homer and the tragic poets but he applies them satirically to some customs and kinds of philosophy which he arraigns  but the romans not using any of these parodies in their satiressometimes indeed repeating verses of other men as persius cites some of neros but not turning them into another meaningthe silli cannot be supposed to be the original of roman satire  to these silli consisting of parodies we may properly add the satires which were written against particular persons such as were the iambics of archilochus against lycambes which horace undoubtedly imitated in some of his odes and epodes whose titles bear sufficient witness of it  i might also name the invective of ovid against ibis and many others  but these are the underwood of satire rather than the timbertrees they are not of general extension as reaching only to some individual person  and horace seems to have purged himself from those splenetic reflections in those odes and epodes before he undertook the noble work of satires which were properly so called  thus my lord i have at length disengaged myself from those antiquities of greece and have proved i hope from the best critics that the roman satire was not borrowed from thence but of their own manufacture  i am now almost gotten into my depth at least by the help of dacier i am swimming towards it  not that i will promise always to follow him any more than he follows casaubon but to keep him in my eye as my best and truest guide and where i think he may possibly mislead me there to have recourse to my own lights as i expect that others should do by me  quintilian says in plain words satira quidem tota nostra est and horace had said the same thing before him speaking of his predecessor in that sort of poetry et graecis intacti carminis auctor  nothing can be clearer than the opinion of the poet and the orator both the best critics of the two best ages of the roman empire that satire was wholly of latin growth and not transplanted to rome from athens  yet as i have said scaliger the father according to his custom that is insolently enough contradicts them both and gives no better reason than the derivation of satyrus from greek text which cannot be reproduced salacitas and so from the lechery of those fauns thinks he has sufficiently proved that satire is derived from them  as if wantonness and lubricity were essential to that sort of poem which ought to be avoided in it  his other allegation which i have already mentioned is as pitifulthat the satyrs carried platters and canisters full of fruit in their hands  if they had entered emptyhanded had they been ever the less satyrs  or were the fruits and flowers which they offered anything of kin to satire or any argument that this poem was originally grecian  casaubon judged better and his opinion is grounded on sure authority  that satire was derived from satura a roman word which signifies full and abundant and full also of variety in which nothing is wanting to its due perfection  it is thus says denier that we say a full colour when the wool has taken the whole tincture and drunk in as much of the dye as it can receive  according to this derivation from setur comes satura or satira according to the new spelling as optumus and maxumus are now spelled optimus and maximus  satura as i have formerly noted is an adjective and relates to the word lanx which is understood and this lanx in english a charger or large platter was yearly filled with all sorts of fruits which were offered to the gods at their festivals as the premices or first gatherings  these offerings of several sorts thus mingled it is true were not unknown to the grecians who called them greek text which cannot be reproduced a sacrifice of all sorts of fruits and greek text which cannot be reproduced when they offered all kinds of grain  virgil has mentioned these sacrifices in his georgics   lancibus et pandis fumantia reddimus exta   and in another place lancesque et liba feremusthat is we offer the smoking entrails in great platters and we will offer the chargers and the cakes  this word satura has been afterward applied to many other sorts of mixtures as festus calls it a kind of olla or hotchpotch made of several sorts of meats  laws were also called leges saturae when they were of several heads and titles like our tacked bills of parliament and per saturam legem ferre in the roman senate was to carry a law without telling the senators or counting voices when they were in haste  sallust uses the word per saturam sententias exquirere when the majority was visibly on one side  from hence it might probably be conjectured that the discourses or satires of ennius lucilius and horace as we now call them took their name because they are full of various matters and are also written on various subjectsas porphyrius says  but dacier affirms that it is not immediately from thence that these satires are so called for that name had been used formerly for other things which bore a nearer resemblance to those discourses of horace in explaining of which continues dacier a method is to be pursued of which casaubon himself has never thought and which will put all things into so clear a light that no further room will be left for the least dispute  during the space of almost four hundred years since the building of their city the romans had never known any entertainments of the stage  chance and jollity first found out those verses which they called saturnian and fescennine or rather human nature which is inclined to poetry first produced them rude and barbarous and unpolished as all other operations of the soul are in their beginnings before they are cultivated with art and study  however in occasions of merriment they were first practised and this roughcast unhewn poetry was instead of stageplays for the space of a hundred and twenty years together  they were made extempore and were as the french call them impromptus for which the tarsians of old were much renowned and we see the daily examples of them in the italian farces of harlequin and scaramucha  such was the poetry of that savage people before it was tuned into numbers and the harmony of verse  little of the saturnian verses is now remaining we only know from authors that they were nearer prose than poetry without feet or measure  they were greek text which cannot be reproduced but not greek text which cannot be reproduced  perhaps they might be used in the solemn part of their ceremonies and the fescennine which were invented after them in their afternoons debauchery because they were scoffing and obscene  the fescennine and saturnian were the same for as they were called saturnian from their ancientness when saturn reigned in italy they were also called fescennine from fescennia a town in the same country where they were first practised  the actors with a gross and rustic kind of raillery reproached each other with their failings and at the same time were nothing sparing of it to their audience  somewhat of this custom was afterwards retained in their saturnalia or feasts of saturn celebrated in december at least all kind of freedom in speech was then allowed to slaves even against their masters and we are not without some imitation of it in our christmas gambols  soldiers also used those fescennine verses after measure and numbers had been added to them at the triumph of their generals of which we have an example in the triumph of julius caesar over gaul in these expressions  caesar gallias subegit nicomedes caesarem  ecce caesar nunc triumphat qui subegit gallias nicomedes non triumphat qui subegit caesarem the vapours of wine made those first satirical poets amongst the romans which says dacier we cannot better represent than by imagining a company of clowns on a holiday dancing lubberly and upbraiding one another in extempore doggerel with their defects and vices and the stories that were told of them in bakehouses and barbers shops  when they began to be somewhat better bred and were entering as i may say into the first rudiments of civil conversation they left these hedgenotes for another sort of poem somewhat polished which was also full of pleasant raillery but without any mixture of obscenity  this sort of poetry appeared under the name of satire because of its variety and this satire was adorned with compositions of music and with dances but lascivious postures were banished from it  in the tuscan language says livy the word hister signifies a player and therefore those actors which were first brought from etruria to rome on occasion of a pestilence when the romans were admonished to avert the anger of the gods by plays in the year ab urbe condita cccxcthose actors i say were therefore called histriones  and that name has since remained not only to actors roman born but to all others of every nation  they played not the former extempore stuff of fescennine verses or clownish jests but what they acted was a kind of civil cleanly farce with music and dances and motions that were proper to the subject  in this condition livius andronicus found the stage when he attempted first instead of farces to supply it with a nobler entertainment of tragedies and comedies  this man was a grecian born and being made a slave by livius salinator and brought to rome had the education of his patrons children committed to him which trust he discharged so much to the satisfaction of his master that he gave him his liberty  andronicus thus become a freeman of rome added to his own name that of livius his master and as i observed was the first author of a regular play in that commonwealth  being already instructed in his native country in the manners and decencies of the athenian theatre and conversant in the archaea comaedia or old comedy of aristophanes and the rest of the grecian poets he took from that model his own designing of plays for the roman stage the first of which was represented in the year cccccxiv since the building of rome as tully from the commentaries of atticus has assured us it was after the end of the first punic war the year before atticus was born  dacier has not carried the matter altogether thus far he only says that one livius andronicus was the first stagepoet at rome  but i will adventure on this hint to advance another proposition which i hope the learned will approve and though we have not anything of andronicus remaining to justify my conjecture yet it is exceeding probable that having read the works of those grecian wits his countrymen he imitated not only the groundwork but also the manner of their writing and how grave soever his tragedies might be yet in his comedies he expressed the way of aristophanes eupolis and the rest which was to call some persons by their own names and to expose their defects to the laughter of the people the examples of which we have in the forementioned aristophanes who turned the wise socrates into ridicule and is also very free with the management of cleon alcibiades and other ministers of the athenian government  now if this be granted we may easily suppose that the first hint of satirical plays on the roman stage was given by the greeksnot from the satirica for that has been reasonably exploded in the former part of this discourse but from their old comedy which was imitated first by livius andronicus  and then quintilian and horace must be cautiously interpreted where they affirm that satire is wholly roman and a sort of verse which was not touched on by the grecians  the reconcilement of my opinion to the standard of their judgment is not however very difficult since they spoke of satire not as in its first elements but as it was formed into a separate workbegun by ennius pursued by lucilius and completed afterwards by horace the proof depends only on this postalatumthat the comedies of andronicus which were imitations of the greek were also imitations of their railleries and reflections on particular persons  for if this be granted me which is a most probable supposition it is easy to infer that the first light which was given to the roman theatrical satire was from the plays of livius andronicus which will be more manifestly discovered when i come to speak of ennius in the meantime i will return to dacier  the people says he ran in crowds to these new entertainments of andronicus as to pieces which were more noble in their kind and more perfect than their former satires which for some time they neglected and abandoned but not long after they took them up again and then they joined them to their comedies playing them at the end of every drama as the french continue at this day to act their farces in the nature of a separate entertainment from their tragedies  but more particularly they were joined to the atellane fables says casaubon which were plays invented by the osci  those fables says valerius maximus out of livy were tempered with the italian severity and free from any note of infamy or obsceneness and as an old commentator on juvenal affirms the exodiarii which were singers and dancers entered to entertain the people with light songs and mimical gestures that they might not go away oppressed with melancholy from those serious pieces of the theatre  so that the ancient satire of the romans was in extempore reproaches the next was farce which was brought from tuscany to that succeeded the plays of andronicus from the old comedy of the grecians and out of all these sprang two several branches of new roman satire like different scions from the same root which i shall prove with as much brevity as the subject will allow  a year after andronicus had opened the roman stage with his new dramas ennius was born who when he was grown to mans estate having seriously considered the genius of the people and how eagerly they followed the first satires thought it would be worth his pains to refine upon the project and to write satires not to be acted on the theatre but read  he preserved the groundwork of their pleasantry their venom and their raillery on particular persons and general vices and by this means avoiding the danger of any ill success in a public representation he hoped to be as well received in the cabinet as andronicus had been upon the stage  the event was answerable to his expectation  he made discourses in several sorts of verse varied often in the same paper retaining still in the title their original name of satire  both in relation to the subjects and the variety of matters contained in them the satires of horace are entirely like them only ennius as i said confines not himself to one sort of verse as horace does but taking example from the greeks and even from homer himself in his margites which is a kind of satire as scaliger observes gives himself the licence when one sort of numbers comes not easily to run into another as his fancy dictates for he makes no difficulty to mingle hexameters with iambic trimeters or with trochaic tetrameters as appears by those fragments which are yet remaining of him  horace has thought him worthy to be copied inserting many things of his into his own satires as virgil has done into his aeneids  here we have dacier making out that ennius was the first satirist in that way of writing which was of his inventionthat is satire abstracted from the stage and new modelled into papers of verses on several subjects  but he will have ennius take the groundwork of satire from the first farces of the romans rather than from the formed plays of livius andronicus which were copied from the grecian comedies  it may possibly be so but dacier knows no more of it than i do  and it seems to me the more probable opinion that he rather imitated the fine railleries of the greeks which he saw in the pieces of andronicus than the coarseness of his own countrymen in their clownish extemporary way of jeering  but besides this it is universally granted that ennius though an italian was excellently learned in the greek language  his verses were stuffed with fragments of it even to a fault and he himself believed according to the pythagorean opinion that the soul of homer was transfused into him which persius observes in his sixth satirepostquam destertuit esse maeonides  but this being only the private opinion of so inconsiderable a man as i am i leave it to the further disquisition of the critics if they think it worth their notice  most evident it is that whether he imitated the roman farce or the greek comedies he is to be acknowledged for the first author of roman satire as it is properly so called and distinguished from any sort of stageplay  of pacuvius who succeeded him there is little to be said because there is so little remaining of him only that he is taken to be the nephew of ennius his sisters son that in probability he was instructed by his uncle in his way of satire which we are told he has copied but what advances he made we know not  lucilius came into the world when pacuvius flourished most  he also made satires after the manner of ennius but he gave them a more graceful turn and endeavoured to imitate more closely the vetus comaedia of the greeks of the which the old original roman satire had no idea till the time of livius andronicus  and though horace seems to have made lucilius the first author of satire in verse amongst the romans in these words    quid cum est lucilius auses primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem    he is only thus to be understoodthat lucilius had given a more graceful turn to the satire of ennius and pacuvius not that he invented a new satire of his own and quintilian seems to explain this passage of horace in these words  satira quidem tota nostra est in qua primus insignem laudem adeptus est luciluis  thus both horace and quintilian give a kind of primacy of honour to lucilius amongst the latin satirists for as the roman language grew more refined so much more capable it was of receiving the grecian beauties in his time  horace and quintilian could mean no more than that lucilius writ better than ennius and pacuvius and on the same account we prefer horace to lucilius  both of them imitated the old greek comedy and so did ennius and pacuvius before them the polishing of the latin tongue in the succession of times made the only difference and horace himself in two of his satires written purposely on this subject thinks the romans of his age were too partial in their commendations of lucilius who writ not only loosely and muddily with little art and much less care but also in a time when the latin tongue was not yet sufficiently purged from the dregs of barbarism and many significant and sounding words which the romans wanted were not admitted even in the times of lucretius and cicero of which both complain  but to proceed  dacier justly taxes casaubon for saying that the satires of lucilius were wholly different in species from those of ennius and pacuvius casaubon was led into that mistake by diomedes the grammarian who in effect says this satire amongst the romans but not amongst the greeks was a biting invective poem made after the model of the ancient comedy for the reprehension of vices such as were the poems of lucilius of horace and of persius  but in former times the name of satire was given to poems which were composed of several sorts of verses such as were made by ennius and pacuviusmore fully expressing the etymology of the word satire from satura which we have observed  here it is manifest that diomedes makes a specifical distinction betwixt the satires of ennius and those of lucilius  but this as we say in english is only a distinction without a difference for the reason of it is ridiculous and absolutely false  this was that which cozened honest casaubon who relying on diomedes had not sufficiently examined the origin and nature of those two satires which were entirely the same both in the matter and the form for all that lucilius performed beyond his predecessors ennius and pacuvius was only the adding of more politeness and more salt without any change in the substance of the poem  and though lucilius put not together in the same satire several sorts of verses as ennius did yet he composed several satires of several sorts of verses and mingled them with greek verses  one poem consisted only of hexameters and another was entirely of iambics a third of trochaics as is visible by the fragments yet remaining of his works  in short if the satires of lucilius are therefore said to be wholly different from those of ennius because he added much more of beauty and polishing to his own poems than are to be found in those before him it will follow from hence that the satires of horace are wholly different from those of lucilius because horace has not less surpassed lucilius in the elegancy of his writing than lucilius surpassed ennius in the turn and ornament of his  this passage of diomedes has also drawn dousa the son into the same error of casaubon which i say not to expose the little failings of those judicious men but only to make it appear with how much diffidence and caution we are to read their works when they treat a subject of so much obscurity and so very ancient as is this of satire  having thus brought down the history of satire from its original to the times of horace and shown the several changes of it i should here discover some of those graces which horace added to it but that i think it will be more proper to defer that undertaking till i make the comparison betwixt him and juvenal  in the meanwhile following the order of time it will be necessary to say somewhat of another kind of satire which also was descended from the ancient it is that which we call the varronian satire but which varro himself calls the menippean because varro the most learned of the romans was the first author of it who imitated in his works the manners of menippus the gadarenian who professed the philosophy of the cynics  this sort of satire was not only composed of several sorts of verse like those of ennius but was also mixed with prose and greek was sprinkled amongst the latin  quintilian after he had spoken of the satire of lucilius adds what follows there is another and former kind of satire composed by terentius varro the most learned of the romans in which he was not satisfied alone with mingling in it several sorts of verse  the only difficulty of this passage is that quintilian tells us that this satire of varro was of a former kind for how can we possibly imagine this to be since varro who was contemporary to cicero must consequently be after lucilius but quintilian meant not that the satire of varro was in order of time before lucilius he would only give us to understand that the varronian satire with mixture of several sorts of verses was more after the manner of ennius and pacuvius than that of lucilius who was more severe and more correct and gave himself less liberty in the mixture of his verses in the same poem  we have nothing remaining of those varronian satires excepting some inconsiderable fragments and those for the most part much corrupted  the tithes of many of them are indeed preserved and they are generally double from whence at least we may understand how many various subjects were treated by that author  tully in his academics introduces varro himself giving us some light concerning the scope and design of those works wherein after he had shown his reasons why he did not ex professo write of philosophy he adds what follows notwithstanding says he that those pieces of mine wherein i have imitated menippus though i have not translated him are sprinkled with a kind of mirth and gaiety yet many things are there inserted which are drawn from the very entrails of philosophy and many things severely argued which i have mingled with pleasantries on purpose that they may more easily go down with the common sort of unlearned readers  the rest of the sentence is so lame that we can only make thus much out of itthat in the composition of his satires he so tempered philology with philosophy that his work was a mixture of them both  and tully himself confirms us in this opinion when a little after he addresses himself to varro in these words and you yourself have composed a most elegant and complete poem you have begun philosophy in many places sufficient to incite us though too little to instruct us  thus it appears that varro was one of those writers whom they called greek text which cannot be reproduced studious of laughter and that as learned as he was his business was more to divert his reader than to teach him  and he entitled his own satires menippean not that menippus had written any satires for his were either dialogues or epistles but that varro imitated his style his manner and his facetiousness  all that we know further of menippus and his writings which are wholly lost is that by some he is esteemed as amongst the rest by varro by others he is noted of cynical impudence and obscenity that he was much given to those parodies which i have already mentioned that is he often quoted the verses of homer and the tragic poets and turned their serious meaning into something that was ridiculous whereas varros satires are by tully called absolute and most elegant and various poems  lucian who was emulous of this menippus seems to have imitated both his manners and his style in many of his dialogues where menippus himself is often introduced as a speaker in them and as a perpetual buffoon particularly his character is expressed in the beginning of that dialogue which is called greek text which cannot be reproduced  but varro in imitating him avoids his impudence and filthiness and only expresses his witty pleasantry  this we may believe for certainthat as his subjects were various so most of them were tales or stories of his own invention which is also manifest from antiquity by those authors who are acknowledged to have written varronian satires in imitation of hisof whom the chief is petronius arbiter whose satire they say is now printing in holland wholly recovered and made complete when it is made public it will easily be seen by any one sentence whether it be supposititious or genuine  many of lucians dialogues may also properly be called varronian satires particularly his true history and consequently the golden ass of apuleius which is taken from him  of the same stamp is the mock deification of claudius by seneca and the symposium or caesars of julian the emperor amongst the moderns we may reckon the encomium moriae of erasmus barclays euphormio and a volume of german authors which my ingenious friend mr charles killigrew once lent me  in the english i remember none which are mixed with prose as varros were but of the same kind is mother hubbards tale in spenser and if it be not too vain to mention anything of my own the poems of absalom and macflecnoe  this is what i have to say in general of satire  only as dacier has observed before me we may take notice that the word satire is of a more general signification in latin than in french or english for amongst the romans it was not only used for those discourses which decried vice or exposed folly but for others also where virtue was recommended  but in our modern languages we apply it only to invective poems where the very name of satire is formidable to those persons who would appear to the world what they are not in themselves for in english to say satire is to mean reflection as we use that word in the worst sense or as the french call it more properly medisance  in the criticism of spelling it ought to be with i and not with y to distinguish its true derivation from satura not from satyrus and if this be so then it is false spelled throughout this book for here it is written satyr which having not considered at the first i thought it not worth correcting afterwards  but the french are more nice and never spell it any otherwise than satire  i am now arrived at the most difficult part of my undertaking which is to compare horace with juvenal and persius  it is observed by rigaltius in his preface before juvenal written to thuanus that these three poets have all their particular partisans and favourers every commentator as he has taken pains with any of them thinks himself obliged to prefer his author to the other two to find out their failings and decry them that he may make room for his own darling  such is the partiality of mankind to set up that interest which they have once espoused though it be to the prejudice of truth morality and common justice and especially in the productions of the brain  as authors generally think themselves the best poets because they cannot go out of themselves to judge sincerely of their betters so it is with critics who having first taken a liking to one of these poets proceed to comment on him and to illustrate him after which they fall in love with their own labours to that degree of blind fondness that at length they defend and exalt their author not so much for his sake as for their own it is a folly of the same nature with that of the romans themselves in their games of the circus  the spectators were divided in their factions betwixt the veneti and the prasini some were for the charioteer in blue and some for him in green  the colours themselves were but a fancy but when once a man had taken pains to set out those of his party and had been at the trouble of procuring voices for them the case was altered  he was concerned for his own labour and that so earnestly that disputes and quarrels animosities commotions and bloodshed often happened and in the declension of the grecian empire the very sovereigns themselves engaged in it even when the barbarians were at their doors and stickled for the preference of colours when the safety of their people was in question  i am now myself on the brink of the same precipice i have spent some time on the translation of juvenal and persius and it behoves me to be wary lest for that reason i should be partial to them or take a prejudice against horace  yet on the other side i would not be like some of our judges who would give the cause for a poor man right or wrong for though that be an error on the better hand yet it is still a partiality and a rich man unheard cannot be concluded an oppressor  i remember a saying of king charles ii on sir matthew hale who was doubtless an uncorrupt and upright man that his servants were sure to be cast on any trial which was heard before him not that he thought the judge was possibly to be bribed but that his integrity might be too scrupulous and that the causes of the crown were always suspicious when the privileges of subjects were concerned  it had been much fairer if the modern critics who have embarked in the quarrels of their favourite authors had rather given to each his proper due without taking from anothers heap to raise their own there is praise enough for each of them in particular without encroaching on his fellows and detracting from them or enriching themselves with the spoils of others  but to come to particulars heinsius and dacier are the most principal of those who raise horace above juvenal and persius  scaliger the father rigaltius and many others debase horace that they may set up juvenal and casaubon who is almost single throws dirt on juvenal and horace that he may exalt persius whom he understood particularly well and better than any of his former commentators even stelluti who succeeded him  i will begin with him who in my opinion defends the weakest cause which is that of persius and labouring as tacitus professes of his own writing to divest myself of partiality or prejudice consider persius not as a poet whom i have wholly translated and who has cost me more labour and time than juvenal but according to what i judge to be his own merit which i think not equal in the main to that of juvenal or horace and yet in some things to be preferred to both of them  first then for the verse neither casaubon himself nor any for him can defend either his numbers or the purity of his latin casaubon gives this point for lost and pretends not to justify either the measures or the words of persius he is evidently beneath horace and juvenal in both  then as his verse is scabrous and hobbling and his words not everywhere well chosen the purity of latin being more corrupted than in the time of juvenal and consequently of horace who wrote when the language was in the height of its perfection so his diction is hard his figures are generally too bold and daring and his tropes particularly his metaphors insufferably strained  in the third place notwithstanding all the diligence of casaubon stelluti and a scotch gentleman whom i have heard extremely commended for his illustrations of him yet he is still obscure whether he affected not to be understood but with difficulty or whether the fear of his safety under nero compelled him to this darkness in some places or that it was occasioned by his close way of thinking and the brevity of his style and crowding of his figures or lastly whether after so long a time many of his words have been corrupted and many customs and stories relating to them lost to us whether some of these reasons or all concurred to render him so cloudy we may be bold to affirm that the best of commentators can but guess at his meaning in many passages and none can be certain that he has divined rightly  after all he was a young man like his friend and contemporary lucanboth of them men of extraordinary parts and great acquired knowledge considering their youth but neither of them had arrived to that maturity of judgment which is necessary to the accomplishing of a formed poet  and this consideration as on the one hand it lays some imperfections to their charge so on the other side it is a candid excuse for those failings which are incident to youth and inexperience and we have more reason to wonder how they who died before the thirtieth year of their age could write so well and think so strongly than to accuse them of those faults from which human nature and more especially in youth can never possibly be exempted  to consider persius yet more closely  he rather insulted over vice and folly than exposed them like juvenal and horace and as chaste and modest as he is esteemed it cannot be denied but that in some places he is broad and fulsome as the latter verses of the fourth satire and of the sixth sufficiently witness  and it is to be believed that he who commits the same crime often and without necessity cannot but do it with some kind of pleasure  to come to a conclusion  he is manifestly below horace because he borrows most of his greatest beauties from him and casaubon is so far from denying this that he has written a treatise purposely concerning it wherein he shows a multitude of his translations from horace and his imitations of him for the credit of his author which he calls imitatio horatiana  to these defects which i casually observed while i was translating this author scaliger has added others he calls him in plain terms a silly writer and a trifler full of ostentation of his learning and after all unworthy to come into competition with juvenal and horace  after such terrible accusations it is time to hear what his patron casaubon can allege in his defence  instead of answering he excuses for the most part and when he cannot accuses others of the same crimes  he deals with scaliger as a modest scholar with a master  he compliments him with so much reverence that one would swear he feared him as much at least as he respected him  scaliger will not allow persius to have any wit casaubon interprets this in the mildest sense and confesses his author was not good at turning things into a pleasant ridicule or in other words that he was not a laughable writer  that he was ineptus indeed but that was non aptissimus ad jocandum but that he was ostentatious of his learning that by scaligers good favour he denies  persius showed his learning but was no boaster of it he did ostendere but not ostentare and so he says did scaliger where methinks casaubon turns it handsomely upon that supercilious critic and silently insinuates that he himself was sufficiently vainglorious and a boaster of his own knowledge  all the writings of this venerable censor continues casaubon which are greek text which cannot be reproduced more golden than gold itself are everywhere smelling of that thyme which like a bee he has gathered from ancient authors but far be ostentation and vainglory from a gentleman so well born and so nobly educated as scaliger  but says scaliger he is so obscure that he has got himself the name of scotinusa dark writer  now says casaubon it is a wonder to me that anything could be obscure to the divine wit of scaliger from which nothing could be hidden  this is indeed a strong compliment but no defence and casaubon who could not but be sensible of his authors blind side thinks it time to abandon a post that was untenable  he acknowledges that persius is obscure in some places but so is plato so is thucydides so are pindar theocritus and aristophanes amongst the greek poets and even horace and juvenal he might have added amongst the romans  the truth is persius is not sometimes but generally obscure and therefore casaubon at last is forced to excuse him by alleging that it was se defendendo for fear of nero and that he was commanded to write so cloudily by cornutus in virtue of holy obedience to his master  i cannot help my own opinion i think cornutus needed not to have read many lectures to him on that subject  persius was an apt scholar and when he was bidden to be obscure in some places where his life and safety were in question took the same counsel for all his book and never afterwards wrote ten lines together clearly  casaubon being upon this chapter has not failed we may be sure of making a compliment to his own dear comment  if persius says he be in himself obscure yet my interpretation has made him intelligible  there is no question but he deserves that praise which he has given to himself but the nature of the thing as lucretius says will not admit of a perfect explanation  besides many examples which i could urge the very last verse of his last satire upon which he particularly values himself in his preface is not yet sufficiently explicated  it is true holyday has endeavoured to justify his construction but stelluti is against it  and for my part i can have but a very dark notion of it  as for the chastity of his thoughts casaubon denies not but that one particular passage in the fourth satire at si unctus cesses c is not only the most obscure but the most obscene of all his works  i understood it but for that reason turned it over  in defence of his boisterous metaphors he quotes longinus who accounts them as instruments of the sublime fit to move and stir up the affections particularly in narration to which it may be replied that where the trope is far fetched and hard it is fit for nothing but to puzzle the understanding and may be reckoned amongst those things of demosthenes which aeschines called greek text which cannot be reproduced not greek text which cannot be reproducedthat is prodigies not words  it must be granted to casaubon that the knowledge of many things is lost in our modern ages which were of familiar notice to the ancients and that satire is a poem of a difficult nature in itself and is not written to vulgar readers and through the relation which it has to comedy the frequent change of persons makes the sense perplexed when we can but divine who it is that speakswhether persius himself or his friend and monitor or in some places a third person  but casaubon comes back always to himself and concludes that if persius had not been obscure there had been no need of him for an interpreter  yet when he had once enjoined himself so hard a task he then considered the greek proverb that he must greek text which cannot be reproduced either eat the whole snail or let it quite alone and so he went through with his laborious task as i have done with my difficult translation  thus far my lord you see it has gone very hard with persius  i think he cannot be allowed to stand in competition either with juvenal or horace  yet for once i will venture to be so vain as to affirm that none of his hard metaphors or forced expressions are in my translation  but more of this in its proper place where i shall say somewhat in particular of our general performance in making these two authors english  in the meantime i think myself obliged to give persius his undoubted due and to acquaint the world with casaubon in what he has equalled and in what excelled his two competitors  a man who is resolved to praise an author with any appearance of justice must be sure to take him on the strongest side and where he is least liable to exceptions he is therefore obliged to choose his mediums accordingly  casaubon who saw that persius could not laugh with a becoming grace that he was not made for jesting and that a merry conceit was not his talent turned his feather like an indian to another light that he might give it the better gloss moral doctrine says he and urbanity or wellmannered wit are the two things which constitute the roman satire but of the two that which is most essential to this poem and is as it were the very soul which animates it is the scourging of vice and exhortation to virtue  thus wit for a good reason is already almost out of doors and allowed only for an instrumenta kind of tool or a weapon as he calls itof which the satirist makes use in the compassing of his design  the end and aim of our three rivals is consequently the same but by what methods they have prosecuted their intention is further to be considered  satire is of the nature of moral philosophy as being instructive he therefore who instructs most usefully will carry the palm from his two antagonists  the philosophy in which persius was educated and which he professes through his whole book is the stoicthe most noble most generous most beneficial to humankind amongst all the sects who have given us the rules of ethics thereby to form a severe virtue in the soul to raise in us an undaunted courage against the assaults of fortune to esteem as nothing the things that are without us because they are not in our power not to value riches beauty honours fame or health any farther than as conveniences and so many helps to living as we ought and doing good in our generation  in short to be always happy while we possess our minds with a good conscience are free from the slavery of vices and conform our actions and conversation to the rules of right reason  see here my lord an epitome of epictetus the doctrine of zeno and the education of our persius and this he expressed not only in all his satires but in the manner of his life  i will not lessen this commendation of the stoic philosophy by giving you an account of some absurdities in their doctrine and some perhaps impieties if we consider them by the standard of christian faith  persius has fallen into none of them and therefore is free from those imputations  what he teaches might be taught from pulpits with more profit to the audience than all the nice speculations of divinity and controversies concerning faith which are more for the profit of the shepherd than for the edification of the flock  passion interest ambition and all their bloody consequences of discord and of war are banished from this doctrine  here is nothing proposed but the quiet and tranquillity of the mind virtue lodged at home and afterwards diffused in her general effects to the improvement and good of humankind  and therefore i wonder not that the present bishop of salisbury has recommended this our author and the tenth satire of juvenal in his pastoral letter to the serious perusal and practice of the divines in his diocese as the best commonplaces for their sermons as the storehouses and magazines of moral virtues from whence they may draw out as they have occasion all manner of assistance for the accomplishment of a virtuous life which the stoics have assigned for the great end and perfection of mankind herein then it is that persius has excelled both juvenal and horace  he sticks to his own philosophy he shifts not sides like horace who is sometimes an epicurean sometimes a stoic sometimes an eclectic as his present humour leads him nor declaims like juvenal against vices more like an orator than a philosopher persius is everywhere the sametrue to the dogmas of his master what he has learnt he teaches vehemently and what he teaches that he practises himself  there is a spirit of sincerity in all he says you may easily discern that he is in earnest and is persuaded of that truth which he inculcates  in this i am of opinion that he excels horace who is commonly in jest and laughs while he instructs and is equal to juvenal who was as honest and serious as persius and more he could not be  hitherto i have followed casaubon and enlarged upon him because i am satisfied that he says no more than truth the rest is almost all frivolous  for he says that horace being the son of a taxgatherer or a collector as we call it smells everywhere of the meanness of his birth and education his conceits are vulgar like the subjects of his satires that he does plebeium sepere and writes not with that elevation which becomes a satirist that persius being nobly born and of an opulent family had likewise the advantage of a better master cornutus being the most learned of his time a man of a most holy life the chief of the stoic sect at rome and not only a great philosopher but a poet himself and in probability a coadjutor of persius  that as for juvenal he was long a declaimer came late to poetry and had not been much conversant in philosophy  it is granted that the father of horace was libertinusthat is one degree removed from his grandfather who had been once a slave  but horace speaking of him gives him the best character of a father which i ever read in history and i wish a witty friend of mine now living had such another  he bred him in the best school and with the best company of young noblemen and horace by his gratitude to his memory gives a certain testimony that his education was ingenuous  after this he formed himself abroad by the conversation of great men  brutus found him at athens and was so pleased with him that he took him thence into the army and made him tribunus militum a colonel in a legion which was the preferment of an old soldier  all this was before his acquaintance with maecenas and his introduction into the court of augustus and the familiarity of that great emperor which had he not been well bred before had been enough to civilise his conversation and render him accomplished and knowing in all the arts of complacency and good behaviour and in short an agreeable companion for the retired hours and privacies of a favourite who was first minister  so that upon the whole matter persius may be acknowledged to be equal with him in those respects though better born and juvenal inferior to both  if the advantage be anywhere it is on the side of horace as much as the court of augustus caesar was superior to that of nero as for the subjects which they treated it will appear hereafter that horace wrote not vulgarly on vulgar subjects nor always chose them  his style is constantly accommodated to his subject either high or low  if his fault be too much lowness that of persius is the fault of the hardness of his metaphors and obscurity and so they are equal in the failings of their style where juvenal manifestly triumphs over both of them  the comparison betwixt horace and juvenal is more difficult because their forces were more equal  a dispute has always been and ever will continue betwixt the favourers of the two poets  non nostrum est tantas componere lites  i shall only venture to give my own opinion and leave it for better judges to determine  if it be only argued in general which of them was the better poet the victory is already gained on the side of horace  virgil himself must yield to him in the delicacy of his turns his choice of words and perhaps the purity of his latin  he who says that pindar is inimitable is himself inimitable in his odes but the contention betwixt these two great masters is for the prize of satire in which controversy all the odes and epodes of horace are to stand excluded  i say this because horace has written many of them satirically against his private enemies yet these if justly considered are somewhat of the nature of the greek silli which were invectives against particular sects and persons  but horace had purged himself of this choler before he entered on those discourses which are more properly called the roman satire  he has not now to do with a lyce a canidia a cassius severus or a menas but is to correct the vices and the follies of his time and to give the rules of a happy and virtuous life  in a word that former sort of satire which is known in england by the name of lampoon is a dangerous sort of weapon and for the most part unlawful  we have no moral right on the reputation of other men it is taking from them what we cannot restore to them  there are only two reasons for which we may be permitted to write lampoons and i will not promise that they can always justify us  the first is revenge when we have been affronted in the same nature or have been anywise notoriously abused and can make ourselves no other reparation  and yet we know that in christian charity all offences are to be forgiven as we expect the like pardon for those which we daily commit against almighty god  and this consideration has often made me tremble when i was saying our saviours prayer for the plain condition of the forgiveness which we beg is the pardoning of others the offences which they have done to us for which reason i have many times avoided the commission of that fault even when i have been notoriously provoked  let not this my lord pass for vanity in me for it is truth  more libels have been written against me than almost any man now living and i had reason on my side to have defended my own innocence  i speak not of my poetry which i have wholly given up to the criticslet them use it as they please posterity perhaps may be more favourable to me for interest and passion will lie buried in another age and partiality and prejudice be forgotten  i speak of my morals which have been sufficiently aspersedthat only sort of reputation ought to be dear to every honest man and is to me  but let the world witness for me that i have been often wanting to myself in that particular i have seldom answered any scurrilous lampoon when it was in my power to have exposed my enemies and being naturally vindicative have suffered in silence and possessed my soul in quiet  anything though never so little which a man speaks of himself in my opinion is still too much and therefore i will waive this subject and proceed to give the second reason which may justify a poet when he writes against a particular person and that is when he is become a public nuisance  all those whom horace in his satires and persius and juvenal have mentioned in theirs with a brand of infamy are wholly such  it is an action of virtue to make examples of vicious men  they may and ought to be upbraided with their crimes and follies both for their own amendment if they are not yet incorrigible and for the terror of others to hinder them from falling into those enormities which they see are so severely punished in the persons of others  the first reason was only an excuse for revenge but this second is absolutely of a poets office to perform  but how few lampooners are there now living who are capable of this duty  when they come in my way it is impossible sometimes to avoid reading them  but good god how remote they are in common justice from the choice of such persons as are the proper subject of satire and how little wit they bring for the support of their injustice  the weaker sex is their most ordinary theme and the best and fairest are sure to be the most severely handled amongst men those who are prosperously unjust are entitled to a panegyric but afflicted virtue is insolently stabbed with all manner of reproaches no decency is considered no fulsomeness omitted no venom is wanting as far as dulness can supply it for there is a perpetual dearth of wit a barrenness of good sense and entertainment  the neglect of the readers will soon put an end to this sort of scribbling  there can be no pleasantry where there is no wit no impression can be made where there is no truth for the foundation  to conclude  they are like the fruits of the earth in this unnatural season the corn which held up its head is spoiled with rankness but the greater part of the harvest is laid along and little of good income and wholesome nourishment is received into the barns  this is almost a digression i confess to your lordship but a just indignation forced it from me  now i have removed this rubbish i will return to the comparison of juvenal and horace  i would willingly divide the palm betwixt them upon the two heads of profit and delight which are the two ends of poetry in general  it must be granted by the favourers of juvenal that horace is the more copious and more profitable in his instructions of human life but in my particular opinion which i set not up for a standard to better judgments juvenal is the more delightful author  i am profited by both i am pleased with both but i owe more to horace for my instruction and more to juvenal for my pleasure  this as i said is my particular taste of these two authors  they who will have either of them to excel the other in both qualities can scarce give better reasons for their opinion than i for mine  but all unbiassed readers will conclude that my moderation is not to be condemned to such impartial men i must appeal for they who have already formed their judgment may justly stand suspected of prejudice and though all who are my readers will set up to be my judges i enter my caveat against them that they ought not so much as to be of my jury or if they be admitted it is but reason that they should first hear what i have to urge in the defence of my opinion  that horace is somewhat the better instructor of the two is proved from hencethat his instructions are more general juvenals more limited  so that granting that the counsels which they give are equally good for moral use horace who gives the most various advice and most applicable to all occasions which can occur to us in the course of our livesas including in his discourses not only all the rules of morality but also of civil conversationis undoubtedly to be preferred to him who is more circumscribed in his instructions makes them to fewer people and on fewer occasions than the other  i may be pardoned for using an old saying since it is true and to the purpose  bonum quo communius eo melius juvenal excepting only his first satire is in all the rest confined to the exposing of some particular vice that he lashes and there he sticks  his sentences are truly shining and instructive but they are sprinkled here and there  horace is teaching us in every line and is perpetually moral he had found out the skill of virgil to hide his sentences to give you the virtue of them without showing them in their full extent which is the ostentation of a poet and not his art  and this petronius charges on the authors of his time as a vice of writing which was then growing on the age  ne sententiae extra corpus orationis emineant he would have them weaved into the body of the work and not appear embossed upon it and striking directly on the readers view  folly was the proper quarry of horace and not vice and as there are but few notoriously wicked men in comparison with a shoal of fools and fops so it is a harder thing to make a man wise than to make him honest for the will is only to be reclaimed in the one but the understanding is to be informed in the other  there are blind sides and follies even in the professors of moral philosophy and there is not any one sect of them that horace has not exposed which as it was not the design of juvenal who was wholly employed in lashing vices some of them the most enormous that can be imagined so perhaps it was not so much his talent   omne vafer vitium ridenti flaccus amico tangit et admissus circum praecordia ludit   this was the commendation which persius gave him where by vitium he means those little vices which we call follies the defects of human understanding or at most the peccadilloes of life rather than the tragical vices to which men are hurried by their unruly passions and exorbitant desires  but in the word omne which is universal he concludes with me that the divine wit of horace left nothing untouched that he entered into the inmost recesses of nature found out the imperfections even of the most wise and grave as well as of the common people discovering even in the great trebatius to whom he addresses the first satire his hunting after business and following the court as well as in the prosecutor crispinus his impertinence and importunity  it is true he exposes crispinus openly as a common nuisance but he rallies the other as a friend more finely  the exhortations of persius are confined to noblemen and the stoic philosophy is that alone which he recommends to them juvenal exhorts to particular virtues as they are opposed to those vices against which he declaims but horace laughs to shame all follies and insinuates virtue rather by familiar examples than by the severity of precepts  this last consideration seems to incline the balance on the side of horace and to give him the preference to juvenal not only in profit but in pleasure  but after all i must confess that the delight which horace gives me is but languishing be pleased still to understand that i speak of my own taste only he may ravish other men but i am too stupid and insensible to be tickled  where he barely grins himself and as scaliger says only shows his white teeth he cannot provoke me to any laughter  his urbanitythat is his good mannersare to be commended but his wit is faint and his salt if i may dare to say so almost insipid  juvenal is of a more vigorous and masculine wit he gives me as much pleasure as i can bear he fully satisfies my expectation he treats his subject home his spleen is raised and he raises mine  i have the pleasure of concernment in all he says he drives his reader along with him and when he is at the end of his way i willingly stop with him  if he went another stage it would be too far it would make a journey of a progress and turn delight into fatigue  when he gives over it is a sign the subject is exhausted and the wit of man can carry it no farther  if a fault can be justly found in him it is that he is sometimes too luxuriant too redundant says more than he needs like my friend the plain dealer but never more than pleases  add to this that his thoughts are as just as those of horace and much more elevated his expressions are sonorous and more noble his verse more numerous and his words are suitable to his thoughts sublime and lofty  all these contribute to the pleasure of the reader and the greater the soul of him who reads his transports are the greater  horace is always on the amble juvenal on the gallop but his way is perpetually on carpetground  he goes with more impetuosity than horace but as securely and the swiftness adds a more lively agitation to the spirits  the low style of horace is according to his subjectthat is generally grovelling i question not but he could have raised it for the first epistle of the second book which he writes to augustus a most instructive satire concerning poetry is of so much dignity in the words and of so much elegancy in the numbers that the author plainly shows the sermo pedestris in his other satires was rather his choice than his necessity  he was a rival to lucilius his predecessor and was resolved to surpass him in his own manner  lucilius as we see by his remaining fragments minded neither his style nor his numbers nor his purity of words nor his run of verse  horace therefore copes with him in that humble way of satire writes under his own force and carries a dead weight that he may match his competitor in the race  this i imagine was the chief reason why he minded only the clearness of his satire and the cleanness of expression without ascending to those heights to which his own vigour might have carried him  but limiting his desires only to the conquest of lucilius he had his ends of his rival who lived before him but made way for a new conquest over himself by juvenal his successor he could not give an equal pleasure to his reader because he used not equal instruments  the fault was in the tools and not in the workman  but versification and numbers are the greatest pleasures of poetry  virgil knew it and practised both so happily that for aught i know his greatest excellency is in his diction  in all other parts of poetry he is faultless but in this he placed his chief perfection  and give me leave my lord since i have here an apt occasion to say that virgil could have written sharper satires than either horace or juvenal if he would have employed his talent that way  i will produce a verse and half of his in one of his eclogues to justify my opinion and with commas after every word to show that he has given almost as many lashes as he has written syllables  it is against a bad poet whose ill verses he describes   non tu in triviis indocte solebas stridenti miserum stipula disperdere carmen   but to return to my purpose  when there is anything deficient in numbers and sound the reader is uneasy and unsatisfied he wants something of his complement desires somewhat which he finds not and this being the manifest defect of horace it is no wonder that finding it supplied in juvenal we are more delighted with him  and besides this the sauce of juvenal is more poignant to create in us an appetite of reading him  the meat of horace is more nourishing but the cookery of juvenal more exquisite so that granting horace to be the more general philosopher we cannot deny that juvenal was the greater poeti mean in satire  his thoughts are sharper his indignation against vice is more vehement his spirit has more of the commonwealth genius he treats tyranny and all the vices attending it as they deserve with the utmost rigour and consequently a noble soul is better pleased with a zealous vindicator of roman liberty than with a temporising poet a well mannered court slave and a man who is often afraid of laughing in the right placewho is ever decent because he is naturally servile  after all horace had the disadvantage of the times in which he lived they were better for the man but worse for the satirist  it is generally said that those enormous vices which were practised under the reign of domitian were unknown in the time of augustus caesar that therefore juvenal had a larger field than horace little follies were out of doors when oppression was to be scourged instead of avarice it was no longer time to turn into ridicule the false opinions of philosophers when the roman liberty was to be asserted  there was more need of a brutus in domitians days to redeem or mend than of a horace if he had then been living to laugh at a flycatcher  this reflection at the same time excuses horace but exalts juvenal  i have ended before i was aware the comparison of horace and juvenal upon the topics of instruction and delight and indeed i may safely here conclude that commonplace for if we make horace our minister of state in satire and juvenal of our private pleasures i think the latter has no ill bargain of it  let profit have the preeminence of honour in the end of poetry pleasure though but the second in degree is the first in favour  and who would not choose to be loved better rather than to be more esteemed  but i am entered already upon another topic which concerns the particular merits of these two satirists however i will pursue my business where i left it and carry it farther than that common observation of the several ages in which these authors flourished  when horace writ his satires the monarchy of his caesar was in its newness and the government but just made easy to the conquered people  they could not possibly have forgotten the usurpation of that prince upon their freedom nor the violent methods which he had used in the compassing of that vast design they yet remembered his proscriptions and the slaughter of so many noble romans their defendersamongst the rest that horrible action of his when he forced livia from the arms of her husband who was constrained to see her married as dion relates the story and big with child as she was conveyed to the bed of his insulting rival  the same dion cassius gives us another instance of the crime before mentioned that cornelius sisenna being reproached in full senate with the licentious conduct of his wife returned this answer  that he had married her by the counsel of augustus intimating says my author that augustus had obliged him to that marriage that he might under that covert have the more free access to her  his adulteries were still before their eyes but they must be patient where they had not power  in other things that emperor was moderate enough propriety was generally secured and the people entertained with public shows and donatives to make them more easily digest their lost liberty but augustus who was conscious to himself of so many crimes which he had committed thought in the first place to provide for his own reputation by making an edict against lampoons and satires and the authors of those defamatory writings which my author tacitus from the lawterm calls famosos libellos  in the first book of his annals he gives the following account of it in these words primus augustus cognitionem de famosis libellis specie legis ejus tractavit commotus cassii severi libidine qua viros faeminasque illustres procacibus scriptis diffamaverat  thus in english augustus was the first who under the colour of that law took cognisance of lampoons being provoked to it by the petulancy of cassius severus who had defamed many illustrious persons of both sexes in his writings  the law to which tacitus refers was lex laesae majestatis commonly called for the sake of brevity majestas or as we say hightreason  he means not that this law had not been enacted formerly for it had been made by the decemviri and was inscribed amongst the rest in the twelve tables to prevent the aspersion of the roman majesty either of the people themselves or their religion or their magistrates and the infringement of it was capitalthat is the offender was whipped to death with the fasces which were borne before their chief officers of rome but augustus was the first who restored that intermitted law  by the words under colour of that law he insinuates that augustus caused it to be executed on pretence of those libels which were written by cassius severus against the nobility but in truth to save himself from such defamatory verses  suetonius likewise makes mention of it thus sparsos de se in curia famosos libellos nec exparit et magna cura redarguit  ac ne requisitis quidem auctoribus id modo censuit cognoscendum posthac de iis qui libellos aut carmina ad infamiam cujuspiam sub alieno nomine edant augustus was not afraid of libels says that author yet he took all care imaginable to have them answered and then decreed that for the time to come the authors of them should be punished  but aurelius makes it yet more clear according to my sense that this emperor for his own sake durst not permit them fecit id augustus in speciem et quasi gratificaretur populo romano et primoribus urbis sed revera ut sibi consuleret  nam habuit in animo comprimere nimiam quorundam procacitatem in loquendo a qua nec ipse exemptus fuit  nam suo nomine compescere erat invidiosum sub alieno facile et utile  ergo specie legis tractavit quasi populi romani majestas infamaretur  this i think is a sufficient comment on that passage of tacitus  i will add only by the way that the whole family of the caesars and all their relations were included in the law because the majesty of the romans in the time of the empire was wholly in that house  omnia caesar erat they were all accounted sacred who belonged to him  as for cassius severus he was contemporary with horace and was the same poet against whom he writes in his epodes under this title in cassium severum maledicum poctamperhaps intending to kill two crows according to our proverb with one stone and revenge both himself and his emperor together  from hence i may reasonably conclude that augustus who was not altogether so good as he was wise had some byrespect in the enacting of this law for to do anything for nothing was not his maxim  horace as he was a courtier complied with the interest of his master and avoiding the lashing of greater crimes confined himself to the ridiculing of petty vices and common follies excepting only some reserved cases in his odes and epodes of his own particular quarrels which either with permission of the magistrate or without it every man will revenge though i say not that he should for prior laesit is a good excuse in the civil law if christianity had not taught us to forgive  however he was not the proper man to arraign great vices at least if the stories which we hear of him are truethat he practised some which i will not here mention out of honour to him  it was not for a clodius to accuse adulterers especially when augustus was of that number  so that though his age was not exempted from the worst of villainies there was no freedom left to reprehend them by reason of the edict and our poet was not fit to represent them in an odious character because himself was dipped in the same actions  upon this account without further insisting on the different tempers of juvenal and horace i conclude that the subjects which horace chose for satire are of a lower nature than those of which juvenal has written  thus i have treated in a new method the comparison betwixt horace juvenal and persius  somewhat of their particular manner belonging to all of them is yet remaining to be considered persius was grave and particularly opposed his gravity to lewdness which was the predominant vice in neros court at the time when he published his satires which was before that emperor fell into the excess of cruelty  horace was a mild admonisher a court satirist fit for the gentle times of augustus and more fit for the reasons which i have already given  juvenal was as proper for his times as they for theirs his was an age that deserved a more severe chastisement vices were more gross and open more flagitious more encouraged by the example of a tyrant and more protected by his authority  therefore wheresoever juvenal mentions nero he means domitian whom he dares not attack in his own person but scourges him by proxy  heinsius urges in praise of horace that according to the ancient art and law of satire it should be nearer to comedy than to tragedy not declaiming against vice but only laughing at it  neither persius nor juvenal was ignorant of this for they had both studied horace  and the thing itself is plainly true  but as they had read horace they had likewise read lucilius of whom persius says secuit urbem    et genuinum fregit in illis meaning mutius and lupus and juvenal also mentions him in these words   ense velut stricto quoties lucilius ardens infremuit rubet auditor cui frigida mens est criminibus tacita sulant praecordia culpa   so that they thought the imitation of lucilius was more proper to their purpose than that of horace  they changed satire says holyday but they changed it for the better for the business being to reform great vices chastisement goes farther than admonition whereas a perpetual grin like that of horace does rather anger than amend a man  thus far that learned critic barten holyday whose interpretation and illustrations of juvenal are as excellent as the verse of his translation and his english are lame and pitiful for it is not enough to give us the meaning of a poet which i acknowledge him to have performed most faithfully but he must also imitate his genius and his numbers as far as the english will come up to the elegance of the original  in few words it is only for a poet to translate a poet  holyday and stapleton had not enough considered this when they attempted juvenal but i forbear reflections  only i beg leave to take notice of this sentence where holyday says a perpetual grin like that of horace rather angers than amends a man  i cannot give him up the manner of horace in low satire so easily let the chastisements of juvenal be never so necessary for his new kind of satire let him declaim as wittily and sharply as he pleases yet still the nicest and most delicate touches of satire consist in fine raillery  this my lord is your particular talent to which even juvenal could not arrive  it is not reading it is not imitation of an author which can produce this fineness it must be inborn it must proceed from a genius and particular way of thinking which is not to be taught and therefore not to be imitated by him who has it not from nature  how easy it is to call rogue and villain and that wittily but how hard to make a man appear a fool a blockhead or a knave without using any of those opprobrious terms  to spare the grossness of the names and to do the thing yet more severely is to draw a full face and to make the nose and cheeks stand out and yet not to employ any depth of shadowing  this is the mystery of that noble trade which yet no master can teach to his apprentice he may give the rules but the scholar is never the nearer in his practice  neither is it true that this fineness of raillery is offensive a witty man is tickled while he is hurt in this manner and a fool feels it not  the occasion of an offence may possibly be given but he cannot take it if it be granted that in effect this way does more mischief that a man is secretly wounded and though he be not sensible himself yet the malicious world will find it for him yet there is still a vast difference betwixt the slovenly butchering of a man and the fineness of a stroke that separates the head from the body and leaves it standing in its place  a man may be capable as jack ketchs wife said of his servant of a plain piece of work a bare hanging but to make a malefactor die sweetly was only belonging to her husband  i wish i could apply it to myself if the reader would be kind enough to think it belongs to me  the character of zimri in my absalom is in my opinion worth the whole poem it is not bloody but it is ridiculous enough and he for whom it was intended was too witty to resent it as an injury  if i had railed i might have suffered for it justly but i managed my own work more happily perhaps more dexterously  i avoided the mention of great crimes and applied myself to the representing of blindsides and little extravagances to which the wittier a man is he is generally the more obnoxious  it succeeded as i wished the jest went round and he was laughed at in his turn who began the frolic  and thus my lord you see i have preferred the manner of horace and of your lordship in this kind of satire to that of juvenal and i think reasonably  holyday ought not to have arraigned so great an author for that which was his excellency and his merit or if he did on such a palpable mistake he might expect that some one might possibly arise either in his own time or after him to rectify his error and restore to horace that commendation of which he has so unjustly robbed him  and let the manes of juvenal forgive me if i say that this way of horace was the best for amending manners as it is the most difficult  his was an ense rescindendum but that of horace was a pleasant cure with all the limbs preserved entire and as our mountebanks tell us in their bills without keeping the patient within doors for a day  what they promise only horace has effectually performed  yet i contradict not the proposition which i formerly advanced  juvenals times required a more painful kind of operation but if he had lived in the age of horace i must needs affirm that he had it not about him  he took the method which was prescribed him by his own genius which was sharp and eager he could not railly but he could declaim  and as his provocations were great he has revenged them tragically  this notwithstanding i am to say another word which as true as it is will yet displease the partial admirers of our horace i have hinted it before but it is time for me now to speak more plainly  this manner of horace is indeed the best but horace has not executed it altogether so happilyat least not often  the manner of juvenal is confessed to be inferior to the former but juvenal has excelled him in his performance  juvenal has railed more wittily than horace has rallied  horace means to make his reader laugh but he is not sure of his experiment  juvenal always intends to move your indignation and he always brings about his purpose horace for aught i know might have tickled the people of his age but amongst the moderns he is not so successful  they who say he entertains so pleasantly may perhaps value themselves on the quickness of their own understandings that they can see a jest farther off than other men they may find occasion of laughter in the witbattle of the two buffoons sarmentus and cicerrus and hold their sides for fear of bursting when rupilius and persius are scolding  for my own part i can only like the characters of all four which are judiciously given but for my heart i cannot so much as smile at their insipid raillery  i see not why persius should call upon brutus to revenge him on his adversary and that because he had killed julius caesar for endeavouring to be a king therefore he should be desired to murder rupilius only because his name was mr king  a miserable clench in my opinion for horace to record i have heard honest mr swan make many a better and yet have had the grace to hold my countenance  but it may be puns were then in fashion as they were wit in the sermons of the last age and in the court of king charles the second  i am sorry to say it for the sake of horace but certain it is he has no fine palate who can feed so heartily on garbage  but i have already wearied myself and doubt not but i have tired your lordships patience with this long rambling and i fear trivial discourse  upon the onehalf of the merits that is pleasure i cannot but conclude that juvenal was the better satirist  they who will descend into his particular praises may find them at large in the dissertation of the learned rigaltius to thuanus  as for persius i have given the reasons why i think him inferior to both of them yet i have one thing to add on that subject  barten holyday who translated both juvenal and persius has made this distinction betwixt them which is no less true than witty that in persius the difficulty is to find a meaning in juvenal to choose a meaning so crabbed is persius and so copious is juvenal so much the understanding is employed in one and so much the judgment in the other so difficult is it to find any sense in the former and the best sense of the latter  if on the other side any one suppose i have commended horace below his merit when i have allowed him but the second place i desire him to consider if juvenal a man of excellent natural endowments besides the advantages of diligence and study and coming after him and building upon his foundations might not probably with all these helps surpass him and whether it be any dishonour to horace to be thus surpassed since no art or science is at once begun and perfected but that it must pass first through many hands and even through several ages  if lucilius could add to ennius and horace to lucilius why without any diminution to the fame of horace might not juvenal give the last perfection to that work  or rather what disreputation is it to horace that juvenal excels in the tragical satire as horace does in the comical  i have read over attentively both heinsius and dacier in their commendations of horace but i can find no more in either of them for the preference of him to juvenal than the instructive part the part of wisdom and not that of pleasure which therefore is here allowed him notwithstanding what scaliger and rigaltius have pleaded to the contrary for juvenal and to show i am impartial i will here translate what dacier has said on that subject  i cannot give a more just idea of the two books of satires made by horace than by comparing them to the statues of the sileni to which alcibiades compares socrates in the symposium  they were figures which had nothing of agreeable nothing of beauty on their outside but when any one took the pains to open them and search into them he there found the figures of all the deities  so in the shape that horace presents himself to us in his satires we see nothing at the first view which deserves our attention it seems that he is rather an amusement for children than for the serious consideration of men but when we take away his crust and that which hides him from our sight when we discover him to the bottom then we find all the divinities in a full assemblythat is to say all the virtues which ought to be the continual exercise of those who seriously endeavour to correct their vices  it is easy to observe that dacier in this noble similitude has confined the praise of his author wholly to the instructive part the commendation turns on this and so does that which follows  in these two books of satire it is the business of horace to instruct us how to combat our vices to regulate our passions to follow nature to give bounds to our desires to distinguish betwixt truth and falsehood and betwixt our conceptions of things and things themselves to come back from our prejudicate opinions to understand exactly the principles and motives of all our actions and to avoid the ridicule into which all men necessarily fall who are intoxicated with those notions which they have received from their masters and which they obstinately retain without examining whether or no they be founded on right reason  in a word he labours to render us happy in relation to ourselves agreeable and faithful to our friends and discreet serviceable and wellbred in relation to those with whom we are obliged to live and to converse  to make his figures intelligible to conduct his readers through the labyrinth of some perplexed sentence or obscure parenthesis is no great matter and as epictetus says there is nothing of beauty in all this or what is worthy of a prudent man the principal business and which is of most importance to us is to show the use the reason and the proof of his precepts  they who endeavour not to correct themselves according to so exact a model are just like the patients who have open before them a book of admirable receipts for their diseases and please themselves with reading it without comprehending the nature of the remedies or how to apply them to their cure  let horace go off with these encomiums which he has so well deserved  to conclude the contention betwixt our three poets i will use the words of virgil in his fifth aeneid where aeneas proposes the rewards of the footrace to the three first who should reach the goal   tres praemia primi    accipient flauaque caput nectentur oliva   let these three ancients be preferred to all the moderns as first arriving at the goal let them all be crowned as victors with the wreath that properly belongs to satire  but after that with this distinction amongst themselves   primus equum phaleris insignem victor habeto   let juvenal ride first in triumph   alter amazoniam pharetram plenamque sagittis threiciis lato quam circumplectitur auro balteus et tereti subnectit fibula gemma   let horace who is the second and but just the second carry off the quiver and the arrows as the badges of his satire and the golden belt and the diamond button   tertius argolico hoc clypeo contentus abito   and let persius the last of the first three worthies be contented with this grecian shield and with victorynot only over all the grecians who were ignorant of the roman satirebut over all the moderns in succeeding ages excepting boileau and your lordship  and thus i have given the history of satire and derived it as far as from ennius to your lordshipthat is from its first rudiments of barbarity to its last polishing and perfection which is with virgil in his address to augustus    nomen fama tot ferre per annos    tithoni prima quot abest ab origine caesar   i said only from ennius but i may safely carry it higher as far as livius andronicus who as i have said formerly taught the first play at rome in the year ab urbe condita cccccxiv  i have since desired my learned friend mr maidwell to compute the difference of times betwixt aristophanes and livius andronicus and he assures me from the best chronologers that plutus the last of aristophanes plays was represented at athens in the year of the 97th olympiad which agrees with the year urbis conditae ccclxiv  so that the difference of years betwixt aristophanes and andronicus is 150 from whence i have probably deduced that livius andronicus who was a grecian had read the plays of the old comedy which were satirical and also of the new for menander was fifty years before him which must needs be a great light to him in his own plays that were of the satirical nature  that the romans had farces before this it is true but then they had no communication with greece so that andronicus was the first who wrote after the manner of the old comedy in his plays  he was imitated by ennius about thirty years afterwards  though the former writ fables the latter speaking properly began the roman satire according to that description which juvenal gives of it in his first   quicquid agunt homines votum timor ira voluptas gaudia discurses nostri est farrago libelli   this is that in which i have made hold to differ from casaubon rigaltius dacier and indeed from all the modern criticsthat not ennius but andronicus was the first who by the archaea comedia of the greeks added many beauties to the first rude and barbarous roman satire which sort of poem though we had not derived from rome yet nature teaches it mankind in all ages and in every country  it is but necessary that after so much has been said of satire some definition of it should be given  heinsius in his dissertations on horace makes it for me in these words satire is a kind of poetry without a series of action invented for the purging of our minds in which human vices ignorance and errors and all things besides which are produced from them in every man are severely reprehendedpartly dramatically partly simply and sometimes in both kinds of speaking but for the most part figuratively and occultly consisting in a low familiar way chiefly in a sharp and pungent manner of speech but partly also in a facetious and civil way of jesting by which either hatred or laughter or indignation is moved  where i cannot but observe that this obscure and perplexed definition or rather description of satire is wholly accommodated to the horatian way and excluding the works of juvenal and persius as foreign from that kind of poem the clause in the beginning of it without a series of action distinguishes satire properly from stageplays which are all of one action and one continued series of action  the end or scope of satire is to purge the passions so far it is common to the satires of juvenal and persius  the rest which follows is also generally belonging to all three till he comes upon us with the excluding clause consisting in a low familiar way of speech which is the proper character of horace and from which the other two for their honour be it spoken are far distant  but how come lowness of style and the familiarity of words to be so much the propriety of satire that without them a poet can be no more a satirist than without risibility he can be a man  is the fault of horace to be made the virtue and standing rule of this poem  is the grande sophos of persius and the sublimity of juvenal to be circumscribed with the meanness of words and vulgarity of expression  if horace refused the pains of numbers and the loftiness of figures are they bound to follow so ill a precedent  let him walk afoot with his pad in his hand for his own pleasure but let not them be accounted no poets who choose to mount and show their horsemanship  holyday is not afraid to say that there was never such a fall as from his odes to his satires and that he injuriously to himself untuned his harp the majestic way of persius and juvenal was new when they began it but it is old to us and what poems have not with time received an alteration in their fashionwhich alteration says holyday is to aftertimes as good a warrant as the first  has not virgil changed the manners of homers heroes in his aeneis  certainly he has and for the better for virgils age was more civilised and better bred and he writ according to the politeness of rome under the reign of augustus caesar not to the rudeness of agamemnons age or the times of homer  why should we offer to confine free spirits to one form when we cannot so much as confine our bodies to one fashion of apparel  would not donnes satires which abound with so much wit appear more charming if he had taken care of his words and of his numbers  but he followed horace so very close that of necessity he must fall with him and i may safely say it of this present age that if we are not so great wits as donne yet certainly we are better poets  but i have said enough and it may be too much on this subject will your lordship be pleased to prolong my audience only so far till i tell you my own trivial thoughts how a modern satire should be made  i will not deviate in the least from the precepts and examples of the ancients who were always our best masters i will only illustrate them and discover some of the hidden beauties in their designs that we thereby may form our own in imitation of them  will you please but to observe that persius the least in dignity of all the three has notwithstanding been the first who has discovered to us this important secret in the designing of a perfect satirethat it ought only to treat of one subject to be confined to one particular theme or at least to one principally if other vices occur in the management of the chief they should only be transiently lashed and not be insisted on so as to make the design double  as in a play of the english fashion which we call a tragicomedy there is to be but one main design and though there be an underplot or second walk of comical characters and adventures yet they are subservient to the chief fable carried along under it and helping to it so that the drama may not seem a monster with two heads  thus the copernican system of the planets makes the moon to be moved by the motion of the earth and carried about her orb as a dependent of hers  mascardi in his discourse of the doppia favola or double tale in plays gives an instance of it in the famous pastoral of guarini called il pastor fido where corisca and the satyr are the underparts yet we may observe that corisca is brought into the body of the plot and made subservient to it  it is certain that the divine wit of horace was not ignorant of this rulethat a play though it consists of many parts must yet be one in the action and must drive on the accomplishment of one designfor he gives this very precept sit quod vis simplex duntaxat et unum yet he seems not much to mind it in his satires many of them consisting of more arguments than one and the second without dependence on the first  casaubon has observed this before me in his preference of persius to horace and will have his own beloved author to be the first who found out and introduced this method of confining himself to one subject  i know it may be urged in defence of horace that this unity is not necessary because the very word satura signifies a dish plentifully stored with all variety of fruits and grains  yet juvenal who calls his poems a farrago which is a word of the same signification with satura has chosen to follow the same method of persius and not of horace and boileau whose example alone is a sufficient authority has wholly confined himself in all his satires to this unity of design  that variety which is not to be found in any one satire is at least in many written on several occasions and if variety be of absolute necessity in every one of them according to the etymology of the word yet it may arise naturally from one subject as it is diversely treated in the several subordinate branches of it all relating to the chief  it may be illustrated accordingly with variety of examples in the subdivisions of it and with as many precepts as there are members of it which all together may complete that olla or hotchpotch which is properly a satire  under this unity of theme or subject is comprehended another rule for perfecting the design of true satire  the poet is bound and that ex officio to give his reader some one precept of moral virtue and to caution him against some one particular vice or folly  other virtues subordinate to the first may be recommended under that chief head and other vices or follies may be scourged besides that which he principally intends but he is chiefly to inculcate one virtue and insist on that  thus juvenal in every satire excepting the first ties himself to one principal instructive point or to the shunning of moral evil  even in the sixth which seems only an arraignment of the whole sex of womankind there is a latent admonition to avoid ill women by showing how very few who are virtuous and good are to be found amongst them  but this though the wittiest of all his satires has yet the least of truth or instruction in it he has run himself into his old declamatory way and almost forgotten that he was now setting up for a moral poet  persius is never wanting to us in some profitable doctrine and in exposing the opposite vices to it  his kind of philosophy is one which is the stoic and every satire is a comment on one particular dogma of that sect unless we will except the first which is against bad writers and yet even there he forgets not the precepts of the porch  in general all virtues are everywhere to be praised and recommended to practice and all vices to be reprehended and made either odious or ridiculous or else there is a fundamental error in the whole design  i have already declared who are the only persons that are the adequate object of private satire and who they are that may properly be exposed by name for public examples of vices and follies and therefore i will trouble your lordship no further with them  of the best and finest manner of satire i have said enough in the comparison betwixt juvenal and horace it is that sharp well mannered way of laughing a folly out of countenance of which your lordship is the best master in this age  i will proceed to the versification which is most proper for it and add somewhat to what i have said already on that subject  the sort of verse which is called burlesque consisting of eight syllables or four feet is that which our excellent hudibras has chosen  i ought to have mentioned him before when i spoke of donne but by a slip of an old mans memory he was forgotten  the worth of his poem is too well known to need my commendation and he is above my censure  his satire is of the varronian kind though unmixed with prose  the choice of his numbers is suitable enough to his design as he has managed it but in any other hand the shortness of his verse and the quick returns of rhyme had debased the dignity of style  and besides the double rhyme a necessary companion of burlesque writing is not so proper for manly satire for it turns earnest too much to jest and gives us a boyish kind of pleasure  it tickles awkwardly with a kind of pain to the best sort of readers we are pleased ungratefully and if i may say so against our liking  we thank him not for giving us that unseasonable delight when we know he could have given us a better and more solid  he might have left that task to others who not being able to put in thought can only makes us grin with the excrescence of a word of two or three syllables in the close  it is indeed below so great a master to make use of such a little instrument  but his good sense is perpetually shining through all he writes it affords us not the time of finding faults  we pass through the levity of his rhyme and are immediately carried into some admirable useful thought after all he has chosen this kind of verse and has written the best in it and had he taken another he would always have excelled as we say of a court favourite that whatsoever his office be he still makes it uppermost and most beneficial to himself  the quickness of your imagination my lord has already prevented me and you know beforehand that i would prefer the verse of ten syllables which we call the english heroic to that of eight  this is truly my opinion for this sort of number is more roomy the thought can turn itself with greater ease in a larger compass  when the rhyme comes too thick upon us it straitens the expression we are thinking of the close when we should be employed in adorning the thought  it makes a poet giddy with turning in a space too narrow for his imagination he loses many beauties without gaining one advantage  for a burlesque rhyme i have already concluded to be none or if it were it is more easily purchased in ten syllables than in eight  in both occasions it is as in a tenniscourt when the strokes of greater force are given when we strike out and play at length  tassoni and boileau have left us the best examples of this way in the seechia rapita and the lutrin and next them merlin cocaius in his baldus  i will speak only of the two former because the last is written in latin verse  the secchia rapita is an italian poem a satire of the varronian kind  it is written in the stanza of eight which is their measure for heroic verse  the words are stately the numbers smooth the turn both of thoughts and words is happy  the first six lines of the stanza seem majestical and severe but the two last turn them all into a pleasant ridicule  boileau if i am not much deceived has modelled from hence his famous lutrin  he had read the burlesque poetry of scarron with some kind of indignation as witty as it was and found nothing in france that was worthy of his imitation but he copied the italian so well that his own may pass for an original  he writes it in the french heroic verse and calls it an heroic poem his subject is trivial but his verse is noble  i doubt not but he had virgil in his eye for we find many admirable imitations of him and some parodies as particularly this passage in the fourth of the aeneids    nec tibi diva parens generis nec dardanus auctor perfide sed duris genuit te cautibus horrens caucasus hyrrcanaeque admorunt ubera tigres   which he thus translates keeping to the words but altering the sense   non ton pere a paris ne fut point boulanger et tu nes point du sang de gervais lhorloger ta mere ne fut point la maitresse dun coche caucase dans ses flancs te forma dune roche une tigresse affreuse en quelque antre ecarte te fit avec son lait succer sa cruaute   and as virgil in his fourth georgic of the bees perpetually raises the lowness of his subject by the loftiness of his words and ennobles it by comparisons drawn from empires and from monarchs    admiranda tibi levium spectacula rerum magnanimosque duces totiusque ordine gentis mores et studia et populos et praelia dicam   and again    at genus immortale manet multosque per annos stat fortuna domus et avi numerantur avorum   we see boileau pursuing him in the same flights and scarcely yielding to his master  this i think my lord to be the most beautiful and most noble kind of satire  here is the majesty of the heroic finely mixed with the venom of the other and raising the delight which otherwise would be flat and vulgar by the sublimity of the expression  i could say somewhat more of the delicacy of this and some other of his satires but it might turn to his prejudice if it were carried back to france  i have given your lordship but this bare hintin what verse and in what manner this sort of satire may be best managed  had i time i could enlarge on the beautiful turns of words and thoughts which are as requisite in this as in heroic poetry itself of which the satire is undoubtedly a species  with these beautiful turns i confess myself to have been unacquainted till about twenty years ago  in a conversation which i had with that noble wit of scotland sir george mackenzie he asked me why i did not imitate in my verses the turns of mr waller and sir john denham of which he repeated many to me i had often read with pleasure and with some profit those two fathers of our english poetry but had not seriously enough considered those beauties which give the last perfection to their works  some sprinklings of this kind i had also formerly in my plays but they were casual and not designed  but this hint thus seasonably given me first made me sensible of my own wants and brought me afterwards to seek for the supply of them in other english authors  i looked over the darling of my youth the famous cowley there i found instead of them the points of wit and quirks of epigram even in the davideis an heroic poem which is of an opposite nature to those puerilities but no elegant turns either on the word or on the thought  then i consulted a greater genius without offence to the manes of that noble authori mean milton but as he endeavours everywhere to express homer whose age had not arrived to that fineness i found in him a true sublimity lofty thoughts which were clothed with admirable grecisms and ancient words which he had been digging from the minds of chaucer and spenser and which with all their rusticity had somewhat of venerable in them  but i found not there neither that for which i looked  at last i had recourse to his master spenser the author of that immortal poem called the faerie queen and there i met with that which i had been looking for so long in vain  spenser had studied virgil to as much advantage as milton had done homer and amongst the rest of his excellences had copied that  looking farther into the italian i found tasso had done the same nay more that all the sonnets in that language are on the turn of the first thoughtwhich mr walsh in his late ingenious preface to his poems has observed  in short virgil and ovid are the two principal fountains of them in latin poetry  and the french at this day are so fond of them that they judge them to be the first beauties delicate et bien tourne are the highest commendations which they bestow on somewhat which they think a masterpiece  an example of the turn of words amongst a thousand others is that in the last book of ovids metamorphoses   heu quantum scelus est in viscera viscera condi congestoque avidum pinguescere corpore corpus alteriusque animantem animantis vivere leto   an example on the turn both of thoughts and words is to be found in catullus in the complaint of ariadne when she was left by theseus   tum jam nulla viro juranti faemina credat nulla viri speret sermones esse fideles qui dum aliquid cupiens animus praegestit apisci nil metuunt jurare nihil promittere parcunt sed simul ac cupidae mentis satiata libido est dicta nihil metuere nihil perjuria curant   an extraordinary turn upon the words is that in ovids epistolae heroidum of sappho to phaon   si nisi quae forma poterit te digna videri nulla futura tua est nulla futura tua est   lastly a turn which i cannot say is absolutely on wordsfor the thought turns with themis in the fourth georgic of virgil where orpheus is to receive his wife from hell on express condition not to look on her till she was come on earth   cum subita incautum dementia cepit amantem ignoscenda quidem scirent si ignoscere manes   i will not burthen your lordship with more of them for i write to a master who understands them better than myself but i may safely conclude them to be great beauties  i might descend also to the mechanic beauties of heroic verse but we have yet no english prosodia not so much as a tolerable dictionary or a grammar so that our language is in a manner barbarous and what government will encourage any one or more who are capable of refining it i know not  but nothing under a public expense can go through with it  and i rather fear a declination of the language than hope an advancement of it in the present age  i am still speaking to you my lord though in all probability you are already out of hearing  nothing which my meanness can produce is worthy of this long attention  but i am come to the last petition of abraham  if there be ten righteous lines in this vast preface spare it for their sake and also spare the next city because it is but a little one  i would excuse the performance of this translation if it were all my own but the better though not the greater part being the work of some gentlemen who have succeeded very happily in their undertaking let their excellences atone for my imperfections and those of my sons  i have perused some of the satires which are done by other hands and they seem to me as perfect in their kind as anything i have seen in english verse  the common way which we have taken is not a literal translation but a kind of paraphrase or somewhat which is yet more loose betwixt a paraphrase and imitation  it was not possible for us or any men to have made it pleasant any other way  if rendering the exact sense of these authors almost line for line had been our business barten holyday had done it already to our hands and by the help of his learned notes and illustrations not only juvenal and persius but what yet is more obscure his own verses might be understood  but he wrote for fame and wrote to scholars we write only for the pleasure and entertainment of those gentlemen and ladies who though they are not scholars are not ignorantpersons of understanding and good sense who not having been conversant in the original or at least not having made latin verse so much their business as to be critics in it would be glad to find if the wit of our two great authors be answerable to their fame and reputation in the world  we have therefore endeavoured to give the public all the satisfaction we are able in this kind  and if we are not altogether so faithful to our author as our predecessors holyday and stapleton yet we may challenge to ourselves this praisethat we shall be far more pleasing to our readers  we have followed our authors at greater distance though not step by step as they have done for oftentimes they have gone so close that they have trod on the heels of juvenal and persius and hurt them by their too near approach  a noble author would not be pursued too close by a translator  we lose his spirit when we think to take his body  the grosser part remains with us but the soul is flown away in some noble expression or some delicate turn of words or thought  thus holyday who made this way his choice seized the meaning of juvenal but the poetry has always escaped him  they who will not grant me that pleasure is one of the ends of poetry but that it is only a means of compassing the only end which is instruction must yet allow that without the means of pleasure the instruction is but a bare and dry philosophy a crude preparation of morals which we may have from aristotle and epictetus with more profit than from any poet  neither holyday nor stapleton have imitated juvenal in the poetical part of him his diction and his elocution  nor had they been poets as neither of them were yet in the way they took it was impossible for them to have succeeded in the poetic part  the english verse which we call heroic consists of no more than ten syllables the latin hexameter sometimes rises to seventeen as for example this verse in virgil   pulverulenta putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum   here is the difference of no less than seven syllables in a line betwixt the english and the latin  now the medium of these is about fourteen syllables because the dactyl is a more frequent foot in hexameters than the spondee  but holyday without considering that he writ with the disadvantage of four syllables less in every verse endeavours to make one of his lines to comprehend the sense of one of juvenals  according to the falsity of the proposition was the success  he was forced to crowd his verse with illsounding monosyllables of which our barbarous language affords him a wild plenty and by that means he arrived at his pedantic end which was to make a literal translation  his verses have nothing of verse in them but only the worst part of itthe rhyme and that into the bargain is far from good  but which is more intolerable by cramming his illchosen and worsesounding monosyllables so close together the very sense which he endeavours to explain is become more obscure than that of his author so that holyday himself cannot be understood without as large a commentary as that which he makes on his two authors  for my own part i can make a shift to find the meaning of juvenal without his notes but his translation is more difficult than his author  and i find beauties in the latin to recompense my pains but in holyday and stapleton my ears in the first place are mortally offended and then their sense is so perplexed that i return to the original as the more pleasing task as well as the more easy  this must be said for our translationthat if we give not the whole sense of juvenal yet we give the most considerable part of it we give it in general so clearly that few notes are sufficient to make us intelligible  we make our author at least appear in a poetic dress  we have actually made him more sounding and more elegant than he was before in english and have endeavoured to make him speak that kind of english which he would have spoken had he lived in england and had written to this age  if sometimes any of us and it is but seldom make him express the customs and manners of our native country rather than of rome it is either when there was some kind of analogy betwixt their customs and ours or when to make him more easy to vulgar understandings we gave him those manners which are familiar to us  but i defend not this innovation it is enough if i can excuse it  for to speak sincerely the manners of nations and ages are not to be confounded we should either make them english or leave them roman  if this can neither be defended nor excused let it be pardoned at least because it is acknowledged and so much the more easily as being a fault which is never committed without some pleasure to the reader  thus my lord having troubled you with a tedious visit the best manners will be shown in the least ceremony  i will slip away while your back is turned and while you are otherwise employed with great confusion for having entertained you so long with this discourse and for having no other recompense to make you than the worthy labours of my fellowundertakers in this work and the thankful acknowledgments prayers and perpetual good wishes of  my lord your lordships most obliged most humble and most obedient servant john dryden    a discourse on epic poetry addressed to the most honourable john lord marquis of normanby earl of mulgrave etc and knight of the most noble order of the garter    an heroic poem truly such is undoubtedly the greatest work which the soul of man is capable to perform  the design of it is to form the mind to heroic virtue by example it is conveyed in verse that it may delight while it instructs  the action of it is always one entire and great  the least and most trivial episodes or under actions which are interwoven in it are parts either necessary or convenient to carry on the main designeither so necessary that without them the poem must be imperfect or so convenient that no others can be imagined more suitable to the place in which they are there is nothing to be left void in a firm building even the cavities ought not to be filled with rubbish which is of a perishable kinddestructive to the strengthbut with brick or stone though of less pieces yet of the same nature and fitted to the crannies  even the least portions of them must be of the epic kind all things must be grave majestical and sublime nothing of a foreign nature like the trifling novels which ariosto and others have inserted in their poems by which the reader is misled into another sort of pleasure opposite to that which is designed in an epic poem  one raises the soul and hardens it to virtue the other softens it again and unbends it into vice  one conduces to the poets aim the completing of his work which he is driving on labouring and hastening in every line the other slackens his pace diverts him from his way and locks him up like a knighterrant in an enchanted castle when he should be pursuing his first adventure statius as bossu has well observed was ambitions of trying his strength with his master virgil as virgil had before tried his with homer  the grecian gave the two romans an example in the games which were celebrated at the funerals of patroclus  virgil imitated the invention of homer but changed the sports  but both the greek and latin poet took their occasions from the subject though to confess the truth they were both ornamental or at best convenient parts of it rather than of necessity arising from it statius who through his whole poem is noted for want of conduct and judgment instead of staying as he might have done for the death of capaneus hippomedon tydeus or some other of his seven champions who are heroes all alike or more properly for the tragical end of the two brothers whose exequies the next successor had leisure to perform when the siege was raised and in the interval betwixt the poets first action and his second went out of his wayas it were on prepense maliceto commit a fault for he took his opportunity to kill a royal infant by the means of a serpent that author of all evil to make way for those funeral honours which he intended for him  now if this innocent had been of any relation to his thebais if he had either farthered or hindered the taking of the town the poet might have found some sorry excuse at least for detaining the reader from the promised siege  on these terms this capaneus of a poet engaged his two immortal predecessors and his success was answerable to his enterprise  if this economy must be observed in the minutest parts of an epic poem which to a common reader seem to be detached from the body and almost independent of it what soul though sent into the world with great advantages of nature cultivated with the liberal arts and sciences conversant with histories of the dead and enriched with observations on the living can be sufficient to inform the whole body of so great a work  i touch here but transiently without any strict method on some few of those many rules of imitating nature which aristotle drew from homers iliads and odysses and which he fitted to the dramafurnishing himself also with observations from the practice of the theatre when it flourished under aeschylus euripides and sophocles for the original of the stage was from the epic poem  narration doubtless preceded acting and gave laws to it  what at first was told artfully was in process of time represented gracefully to the sight and hearing  those episodes of homer which were proper for the stage the poets amplified each into an action  out of his limbs they formed their bodies what he had contracted they enlarged out of one hercules were made infinity of pigmies yet all endued with human souls for from him their great creator they have each of them the divinae particulam aurae  they flowed from him at first and are at last resolved into him  nor were they only animated by him but their measure and symmetry was owing to him his one entire and great action was copied by them according to the proportions of the drama  if he finished his orb within the year it sufficed to teach them that their action being less and being also less diversified with incidents their orb of consequence must be circumscribed in a less compass which they reduced within the limits either of a natural or an artificial day so that as he taught them to amplify what he had shortened by the same rule applied the contrary way he taught them to shorten what he had amplified  tragedy is the miniature of human life an epic poem is the draft at length  here my lord i must contract also for before i was aware i was almost running into a long digression to prove that there is no such absolute necessity that the time of a stageaction should so strictly be confined to twentyfour hours as never to exceed them for which aristotle contends and the grecian stage has practised  some longer space on some occasions i think may be allowed especially for the english theatre which requires more variety of incidents than the french  corneille himself after long practice was inclined to think that the time allotted by the ancients was too short to raise and finish a great action and better a mechanic rule were stretched or broken than a great beauty were omitted  to raise and afterwards to calm the passions to purge the soul from pride by the examples of human miseries which befall the greatest in few words to expel arrogance and introduce compassion are the great effects of tragedygreat i must confess if they were altogether as true as they are pompous  but are habits to be introduced at three hours warning  are radical diseases so suddenly removed  a mountebank may promise such a cure but a skilful physician will not undertake it  an epic poem is not in so much haste it works leisurely  the changes which it makes are slow but the cure is likely to be more perfect  the effects of tragedy as i said are too violent to be lasting  if it be answered that for this reason tragedies are often to be seen and the dose to be repeated this is tacitly to confess that there is more virtue in one heroic poem than in many tragedies  a man is humbled one day and his pride returns the next  chemical medicines are observed to relieve oftener than to cure for it is the nature of spirits to make swift impressions but not deep  galenical decoctions to which i may properly compare an epic poem have more of body in them they work by their substance and their weight  it is one reason of aristotles to prove that tragedy is the more noble because it turns in a shorter compassthe whole action being circumscribed within the space of fourandtwenty hours  he might prove as well that a mushroom is to be preferred before a peach because it shoots up in the compass of a night  a chariot may be driven round the pillar in less space than a large machine because the bulk is not so great  is the moon a more noble planet than saturn because she makes her revolution in less than thirty days and he in little less than thirty years  both their orbs are in proportion to their several magnitudes and consequently the quickness or slowness of their motion and the time of their circumvolutions is no argument of the greater or less perfection and besides what virtue is there in a tragedy which is not contained in an epic poem where pride is humbled virtue rewarded and vice punished and those more amply treated than the narrowness of the drama can admit  the shining quality of an epic hero his magnanimity his constancy his patience his piety or whatever characteristical virtue his poet gives him raises first our admiration we are naturally prone to imitate what we admire and frequent acts produce a habit  if the heros chief quality be viciousas for example the choler and obstinate desire of vengeance in achillesyet the moral is instructive and besides we are informed in the very proposition of the iliads that this anger was pernicious that it brought a thousand ills on the grecian camp the courage of achilles is proposed to imitation not his pride and disobedience to his general nor his brutal cruelty to his dead enemy nor the selling his body to his father  we abhor these actions while we read them and what we abhor we never imitate the poet only shows them like rocks or quicksands to be shunned  by this example the critics have concluded that it is not necessary the manners of the hero should be virtuous they are poetically good if they are of a piece though where a character of perfect virtue is set before us it is more lovely for there the whole hero is to be imitated  this is the aeneas of our author this is that idea of perfection in an epic poem which painters and statuaries have only in their minds and which no hands are able to express  these are the beauties of a god in a human body  when the picture of achilles is drawn in tragedy he is taken with those warts and moles and hard features by those who represent him on the stage or he is no more achilles for his creator homer has so described him  yet even thus he appears a perfect hero though an imperfect character of virtue  horace paints him after homer and delivers him to be copied on the stage with all those imperfections  therefore they are either not faults in an heroic poem or faults common to the drama  after all on the whole merits of the cause it must be acknowledged that the epic poem is more for the manners and tragedy for the passions  the passions as i have said are violent and acute distempers require medicines of a strong and speedy operation  ill habits of the mind are like chronical diseases to be corrected by degrees and cured by alteratives wherein though purges are sometimes necessary yet diet good air and moderate exercise have the greatest part  the matter being thus stated it will appear that both sorts of poetry are of use for their proper ends  the stage is more active the epic poem works at greater leisure yet is active too when need requires for dialogue is imitated by the drama from the more active parts of it  one puts off a fit like the quinquina and relieves us only for a time the other roots out the distemper and gives a healthful habit  the sun enlightens and cheers us dispels fogs and warms the ground with his daily beams but the corn is sowed increases is ripened and is reaped for use in process of time and in its proper season  i proceed from the greatness of the action to the dignity of the actorsi mean to the persons employed in both poems  there likewise tragedy will be seen to borrow from the epopee and that which borrows is always of less dignity because it has not of its own  a subject it is true may lend to his sovereign but the act of borrowing makes the king inferior because he wants and the subject supplies  and suppose the persons of the drama wholly fabulous or of the poets invention yet heroic poetry gave him the examples of that invention because it was first and homer the common father of the stage  i know not of any one advantage which tragedy can boast above heroic poetry but that it is represented to the view as well as read and instructs in the closet as well as on the theatre  this is an uncontended excellence and a chief branch of its prerogative yet i may be allowed to say without partiality that herein the actors share the poets praise  your lordship knows some modern tragedies which are beautiful on the stage and yet i am confident you would not read them  tryphon the stationer complains they are seldom asked for in his shop  the poet who flourished in the scene is damned in the ruelle nay more he is not esteemed a good poet by those who see and hear his extravagances with delight they are a sort of stately fustian and lofty childishness  nothing but nature can give a sincere pleasure where that is not imitated it is grotesque painting the fine woman ends in a fishs tail  i might also add that many things which not only please but are real beauties in the reading would appear absurd upon the stage and those not only the speciosa miracula as horace calls them of transformations of scylla antiphates and the laestrygons which cannot be represented even in operas but the prowess of achilles or aeneas would appear ridiculous in our dwarfheroes of the theatre  we can believe they routed armies in homer or in virgil but ne hercules contra duos in the drama  i forbear to instance in many things which the stage cannot or ought not to represent for i have said already more than i intended on this subject and should fear it might be turned against me that i plead for the preeminence of epic poetry because i have taken some pains in translating virgil if this were the first time that i had delivered my opinion in this dispute but i have more than once already maintained the rights of my two masters against their rivals of the scene even while i wrote tragedies myself and had no thoughts of this present undertaking  i submit my opinion to your judgment who are better qualified than any man i know to decide this controversy  you come my lord instructed in the cause and needed not that i should open it  your essay of poetry which was published without a name and of which i was not honoured with the confidence i read over and over with much delight and as much instruction and without flattering you or making myself more moral than i am not without some envy  i was loth to be informed how an epic poem should be written or how a tragedy should be contrived and managed in better verse and with more judgment than i could teach others  a native of parnassus and bred up in the studies of its fundamental laws may receive new lights from his contemporaries but it is a grudging kind of praise which he gives his benefactors  he is more obliged than he is willing to acknowledge there is a tincture of malice in his commendations  for where i own i am taught i confess my want of knowledge  a judge upon the bench may out of good nature or at least interest encourage the pleadings of a puny counsellor but he does not willingly commend his brotherserjeant at the bar especially when he controls his law and exposes that ignorance which is made sacred by his place  i gave the unknown author his due commendation i must confess but who can answer for me and for the rest of the poets who heard me read the poem whether we should not have been better pleased to have seen our own names at the bottom of the titlepage  perhaps we commended it the more that we might seem to be above the censure  we are naturally displeased with an unknown critic as the ladies are with a lampooner because we are bitten in the dark and know not where to fasten our revenge but great excellences will work their way through all sorts of opposition  i applauded rather out of decency than affection and was ambitious as some yet can witness to be acquainted with a man with whom i had the honour to converse and that almost daily for so many years together  heaven knows if i have heartily forgiven you this deceit  you extorted a praise which i should willingly have given had i known you  nothing had been more easy than to commend a patron of a long standing  the world would join with me if the encomiums were just and if unjust would excuse a grateful flatterer  but to come anonymous upon me and force me to commend you against my interest was not altogether so fair give me leave to say as it was politic for by concealing your quality you might clearly understand how your work succeeded and that the general approbation was given to your merit not your titles  thus like apelles you stood unseen behind your own venus and received the praises of the passing multitude  the work was commended not the author and i doubt not this was one of the most pleasing adventures of your life  i have detained your lordship longer than i intended in this dispute of preference betwixt the epic poem and the drama and yet have not formally answered any of the arguments which are brought by aristotle on the other side and set in the fairest light by dacier but i suppose without looking on the book i may have touched on some of the objections for in this address to your lordship i design not a treatise of heroic poetry but write in a loose epistolary way somewhat tending to that subject after the example of horace in his first epistle of the second book to augustus caesar and of that to the pisos which we call his art of poetry in both of which he observes no method that i can trace whatever scaliger the father or heinsius may have seen or rather think they had seen  i have taken up laid down and resumed as often as i pleased the same subject and this loose proceeding i shall use through all this prefatory dedication  yet all this while i have been sailing with some sidewind or other toward the point i proposed in the beginningthe greatness and excellence of an heroic poem with some of the difficulties which attend that work  the comparison therefore which i made betwixt the epopee and the tragedy was not altogether a digression for it is concluded on all hands that they are both the masterpieces of human wit  in the meantime i may be bold to draw this corollary from what has been already saidthat the file of heroic poets is very short all are not such who have assumed that lofty title in ancient or modern ages or have been so esteemed by their partial and ignorant admirers  there have been but one great ilias and one aeneis in so many ages the next but the next with a long interval betwixt was the jerusalemi mean not so much in distance of time as in excellence  after these three are entered some lord chamberlain should be appointed some critic of authority should be set before the door to keep out a crowd of little poets who press for admission and are not of quality  maevius would be deafening your lordships ears with his   fortunam priami cantabo et nobile bellum   mere fustian as horace would tell you from behind without pressing forward and more smoke than fire  pulci boiardo and ariosto would cry out make room for the italian poets the descendants of virgil in a right line  father le moine with his saint louis and scudery with his alaric for a godly king and a gothic conqueror and chapelain would take it ill that his maid should be refused a place with helen and lavinia  spenser has a better plea for his faerie queen had his action been finished or had been one and milton if the devil had not been his hero instead of adam if the giant had not foiled the knight and driven him out of his stronghold to wander through the world with his ladyerrant and if there had not been more machining persons than human in his poem after these the rest of our english poets shall not be mentioned i have that honour for them which i ought to have but if they are worthies they are not to be ranked amongst the three whom i have named and who are established in their reputation  before i quitted the comparison betwixt epic poetry and tragedy i should have acquainted my judge with one advantage of the former over the latter which i now casually remember out of the preface of segrais before his translation of the aeneis or out of bossuno matter which  the style of the heroic poem is and ought to be more lofty than that of the drama  the critic is certainly in the right for the reason already urgedthe work of tragedy is on the passions and in dialogue both of them abhor strong metaphors in which the epopee delights  a poet cannot speak too plainly on the stage for volat irrevocabile verbum the sense is lost if it be not taken flying but what we read alone we have leisure to digest there an author may beautify his sense by the boldness of his expression which if we understand not fully at the first we may dwell upon it till we find the secret force and excellence  that which cures the manners by alterative physic as i said before must proceed by insensible degrees but that which purges the passions must do its business all at once or wholly fail of its effectat least in the present operationand without repeated doses  we must beat the iron while it is hot but we may polish it at leisure thus my lord you pay the fine of my forgetfulness and yet the merits of both causes are where they were and undecided till you declare whether it be more for the benefit of mankind to have their manners in general corrected or their pride and hardheartedness removed  i must now come closer to my present business and not think of making more invasive wars abroad when like hannibal i am called back to the defence of my own country  virgil is attacked by many enemies he has a whole confederacy against him and i must endeavour to defend him as well as i am able  but their principal objections being against his moral the duration or length of time taken up in the action of the poem and what they have to urge against the manners of his hero i shall omit the rest as mere cavils of grammariansat the worst but casual slips of a great mans pen or inconsiderable faults of an admirable poem which the author had not leisure to review before his death  macrobius has answered what the ancients could urge against him and some things i have lately read in tannegui le febvre valois and another whom i name not which are scarce worth answering  they begin with the moral of his poem which i have elsewhere confessed and still must own not to be so noble as that of homer  but let both be fairly stated and without contradicting my first opinion i can show that virgils was as useful to the romans of his age as homers was to the grecians of his in what time soever he may be supposed to have lived and flourished  homers moral was to urge the necessity of union and of a good understanding betwixt confederate states and princes engaged in a war with a mighty monarch as also of discipline in an army and obedience in the several chiefs to the supreme commander of the joint forces  to inculcate this he sets forth the ruinous effects of discord in the camp of those allies occasioned by the quarrel betwixt the general and one of the next in office under him  agamemnon gives the provocation and achilles resents the injury  both parties are faulty in the quarrel and accordingly they are both punished the aggressor is forced to sue for peace to his inferior on dishonourable conditions the deserter refuses the satisfaction offered and his obstinacy costs him his best friend  this works the natural effect of choler and turns his rage against him by whom he was last affronted and most sensibly the greater anger expels the less but his character is still preserved  in the meantime the grecian army receives loss on loss and is half destroyed by a pestilence into the bargain   quicquid delirant reges plectuntur achivi   as the poet in the first part of the example had shown the bad effects of discord so after the reconcilement he gives the good effects of unity for hector is slain and then troy must fall  by this it is probable that homer lived when the median monarchy was grown formidable to the grecians and that the joint endeavours of his countrymen were little enough to preserve their common freedom from an encroaching enemy  such was his moral which all critics have allowed to be more noble than that of virgil though not adapted to the times in which the roman poet lived  had virgil flourished in the age of ennius and addressed to scipio he had probably taken the same moral or some other not unlike it for then the romans were in as much danger from the carthaginian commonwealth as the grecians were from the assyrian or median monarchy  but we are to consider him as writing his poem in a time when the old form of government was subverted and a new one just established by octavius caesarin effect by force of arms but seemingly by the consent of the roman people  the commonwealth had received a deadly wound in the former civil wars betwixt marius and sylla  the commons while the first prevailed had almost shaken off the yoke of the nobility and marius and cinna like the captains of the mob under the specious pretence of the public good and of doing justice on the oppressors of their liberty revenged themselves without form of law on their private enemies  sylla in his turn proscribed the heads of the adverse party  he too had nothing but liberty and reformation in his mouth for the cause of religion is but a modern motive to rebellion invented by the christian priesthood refining on the heathen  sylla to be sure meant no more good to the roman people than marius before him whatever he declared but sacrificed the lives and took the estates of all his enemies to gratify those who brought him into power  such was the reformation of the government by both parties  the senate and the commons were the two bases on which it stood and the two champions of either faction each destroyed the foundations of the other side so the fabric of consequence must fall betwixt them and tyranny must be built upon their ruins  this comes of altering fundamental laws and constitutions like him who being in good health lodged himself in a physicians house and was overpersuaded by his landlord to take physic of which be died for the benefit of his doctor  stavo ben was written on his monument ma per star meglio sto qui  after the death of those two usurpers the commonwealth seemed to recover and held up its head for a little time but it was all the while in a deep consumption which is a flattering disease  pompey crassus and caesar had found the sweets of arbitrary power and each being a check to the others growth struck up a false friendship amongst themselves and divided the government betwixt them which none of them was able to assume alone  these were the publicspirited men of their agethat is patriots for their own interest  the commonwealth looked with a florid countenance in their management spread in bulk and all the while was wasting in the vitals  not to trouble your lordship with the repetition of what you know after the death of crassus pompey found himself outwitted by caesar broke with him overpowered him in the senate and caused many unjust decrees to pass against him  caesar thus injured and unable to resist the faction of the nobles which was now uppermost for he was a marian had recourse to arms and his cause was just against pompey but not against his country whose constitution ought to have been sacred to him and never to have been violated on the account of any private wrong  but he prevailed and heaven declaring for him he became a providential monarch under the title of perpetual dictator  he being murdered by his own son whom i neither dare commend nor can justly blame though dante in his inferno has put him and cassius and judas iscariot betwixt them into the great devils mouth the commonwealth popped up its head for the third time under brutus and cassius and then sank for ever  thus the roman people were grossly gulled twice or thrice over and as often enslaved in one century and under the same pretence of reformation  at last the two battles of philippi gave the decisive stroke against liberty and not long after the commonwealth was turned into a monarchy by the conduct and good fortune of augustus it is true that the despotic power could not have fallen into better hands than those of the first and second caesar  your lordship well knows what obligations virgil had to the latter of them  he saw beside that the commonwealth was lost without resource the heads of it destroyed the senate new moulded grown degenerate and either bought off or thrusting their own necks into the yoke out of fear of being forced  yet i may safely affirm for our great author as men of good sense are generally honest that he was still of republican principles in heart   secretosque pios his dantem jura catonem   i think i need use no other argument to justify my opinion than that of this one line taken from the eighth book of the aeneis  if he had not well studied his patrons temper it might have ruined him with another prince  but augustus was not discontented at least that we can find that cato was placed by his own poet in elysium and there giving laws to the holy souls who deserved to be separated from the vulgar sort of good spirits for his conscience could not but whisper to the arbitrary monarch that the kings of rome were at first elective and governed not without a senate that romulus was no hereditary prince and though after his death he received divine honours for the good he did on earth yet he was but a god of their own making that the last tarquin was expelled justly for overt acts of tyranny and maladministration for such are the conditions of an elective kingdom and i meddle not with others being for my own opinion of montanges principlesthat an honest man ought to be contented with that form of government and with those fundamental constitutions of it which he received from his ancestors and under which himself was born though at the same time he confessed freely that if he could have chosen his place of birth it should have been at venice which for many reasons i dislike and am better pleased to have been born an englishman  but to return from my long rambling i say that virgil having maturely weighed the condition of the times in which he lived that an entire liberty was not to be retrieved that the present settlement had the prospect of a long continuance in the same family or those adopted into it that he held his paternal estate from the bounty of the conqueror by whom he was likewise enriched esteemed and cherished that this conqueror though of a bad kind was the very best of it that the arts of peace flourished under him that all men might be happy if they would be quiet that now he was in possession of the whole yet he shared a great part of his authority with the senate that he would be chosen into the ancient offices of the commonwealth and ruled by the power which he derived from them and prorogued his government from time to time still as it were threatening to dismiss himself from public cares which he exercised more for the common good than for any delight he took in greatness these things i say being considered by the poet he concluded it to be the interest of his country to be so governed to infuse an awful respect into the people towards such a prince by that respect to confirm their obedience to him and by that obedience to make them happy  this was the moral of his divine poem honest in the poet honourable to the emperor whom he derives from a divine extraction and reflecting part of that honour on the roman people whom he derives also from the trojans and not only profitable but necessary to the present age and likely to be such to their posterity  that it was the received opinion that the romans were descended from the trojans and julius caesar from iulus the son of aeneas was enough for virgil though perhaps he thought not so himself or that aeneas ever was in italy which bochartus manifestly proves  and homer where he says that jupiter hated the house of priam and was resolved to transfer the kingdom to the family of aeneas yet mentions nothing of his leading a colony into a foreign country and settling there  but that the romans valued themselves on their trojan ancestry is so undoubted a truth that i need not prove it  even the seals which we have remaining of julius caesar which we know to be antique have the star of venus over themthough they were all graven after his deathas a note that he was deified  i doubt not but one reason why augustus should be so passionately concerned for the preservation of the aeneis which its author had condemned to be burnt as an imperfect poem by his last will and testament was because it did him a real service as well as an honour that a work should not be lost where his divine original was celebrated in verse which had the character of immortality stamped upon it  neither were the great roman families which flourished in his time less obliged by him than the emperor  your lordship knows with what address he makes mention of them as captains of ships or leaders in the war and even some of italian extraction are not forgotten these are the single stars which are sprinkled through the aeneis but there are whole constellations of them in the fifth book and i could not but take notice when i translated it of some favourite families to which he gives the victory and awards the prizes in the person of his hero at the funeral games which were celebrated in honour of anchises  i insist not on their names but am pleased to find the memmii amongst them derived from mnestheus because lucretius dedicates to one of that family a branch of which destroyed corinth  i likewise either found or formed an image to myself of the contrary kindthat those who lost the prizes were such as had disobliged the poet or were in disgrace with augustus or enemies to maecenas and this was the poetical revenge he took for genus irritabile vatum as horace says  when a poet is thoroughly provoked he will do himself justice how ever dear it cost him animamque in vulnere ponit  i think these are not bare imaginations of my own though i find no trace of them in the commentators but one poet may judge of another by himself  the vengeance we defer is not forgotten  i hinted before that the whole roman people were obliged by virgil in deriving them from troy an ancestry which they affected  we and the french are of the same humour  they would be thought to descend from a son i think of hector and we would have our britain both named and planted by a descendant of aeneas  spenser favours this opinion what he can his prince arthur or whoever he intends by him is a trojan  thus the hero of homer was a grecian of virgil a roman of tasso an italian  i have transgressed my bounds and gone farther than the moral led me but if your lordship is not tired i am safe enough  thus far i think my author is defended  but as augustus is still shadowed in the person of aeneas of which i shall say more when i come to the manners which the poet gives his hero i must prepare that subject by showing how dexterously he managed both the prince and people so as to displease neither and to do good to both which is the part of a wise and an honest man and proves that it is possible for a courtier not to be a knave  i shall continue still to speak my thoughts like a freeborn subject as i am though such things perhaps as no dutch commentator could and i am sure no frenchman durst  i have already told your lordship my opinion of virgilthat he was no arbitrary man  obliged he was to his master for his bounty and he repays him with good counsel how to behave himself in his new monarchy so as to gain the affections of his subjects and deserve to be called the father of his country from this consideration it is that he chose for the groundwork of his poem one empire destroyed and another raised from the ruins of it  this was just the parallel  aeneas could not pretend to be priams heir in a lineal succession for anchises the heros father was only of the second branch of the royal family and helenus a son of priam was yet surviving and might lawfully claim before him  it may be virgil mentions him on that account neither has he forgotten priamus in the fifth of his aeneis the son of polites youngest son to priam who was slain by pyrrhus in the second book  aeneas had only married creusa priams daughter and by her could have no title while any of the male issue were remaining  in this case the poet gave him the next title which is that of an elective king  the remaining trojans chose him to lead them forth and settle them in some foreign country  ilioneus in his speech to dido calls him expressly by the name of king  our poet who all this while had augustus in his eye had no desire he should seem to succeed by any right of inheritance derived from julius caesar such a title being but one degree removed from conquest for what was introduced by force by force may be removed  it was better for the people that they should give than he should take since that gift was indeed no more at bottom than a trust  virgil gives us an example of this in the person of mezentius  he governed arbitrarily he was expelled and came to the deserved end of all tyrants  our author shows us another sort of kingship in the person of latinus  he was descended from saturn and as i remember in the third degree  he is described a just and a gracious prince solicitous for the welfare of his people always consulting with his senate to promote the common good  we find him at the head of them when he enters into the councilhallspeaking first but still demanding their advice and steering by it as far as the iniquity of the times would suffer him  and this is the proper character of a king by inheritance who is born a father of his country  aeneas though he married the heiress of the crown yet claimed no title to it during the life of his fatherinlaw  socer arma latinus hebeto c are virgils words  as for himself he was contented to take care of his country gods who were not those of latium wherein our divine author seems to relate to the afterpractice of the romans which was to adopt the gods of those they conquered or received as members of their commonwealth  yet withal he plainly touches at the office of the highpriesthood with which augustus was invested and which made his person more sacred and inviolable than even the tribunitial power  it was not therefore for nothing that the most judicious of all poets made that office vacant by the death of pantheus in the second book of the aeneis for his hero to succeed in it and consequently for augustus to enjoy  i know not that any of the commentators have taken notice of that passage  if they have not i am sure they ought and if they have i am not indebted to them for the observation  the words of virgil are very plain   sacra suosque tibi commendat troja penates   as for augustus or his uncle julius claiming by descent from aeneas that title is already out of doors  aeneas succeeded not but was elected  troy was foredoomed to fall for ever   postquam res asiae priamique evertere gentem immeritam visum superisaeneis i iii line 1   augustus it is true had once resolved to rebuild that city and there to make the seat of the empire but horace writes an ode on purpose to deter him from that thought declaring the place to be accursed and that the gods would as often destroy it as it should be raised  hereupon the emperor laid aside a project so ungrateful to the roman people  but by this my lord we may conclude that he had still his pedigree in his head and had an itch of being thought a divine king if his poets had not given him better counsel  i will pass by many less material objections for want of room to answer them  what follows next is of great importance if the critics can make out their charge for it is levelled at the manners which our poet gives his hero and which are the same which were eminently seen in his augustus  those manners were piety to the gods and a dutiful affection to his father love to his relations care of his people courage and conduct in the wars gratitude to those who had obliged him and justice in general to mankind  piety as your lordship sees takes place of all as the chief part of his character and the word in latin is more full than it can possibly be expressed in any modern language for there it comprehends not only devotion to the gods but filial love and tender affection to relations of all sorts  as instances of this the deities of troy and his own penates are made the companions of his flight they appear to him in his voyage and advise him and at last he replaces them in italy their native country  for his father he takes him on his back  he leads his little son his wife follows him but losing his footsteps through fear or ignorance he goes back into the midst of his enemies to find her and leaves not his pursuit till her ghost appears to forbid his farther search  i will say nothing of his duty to his father while he lived his sorrow for his death of the games instituted in honour of his memory or seeking him by his command even after death in the elysian fields  i will not mention his tenderness for his son which everywhere is visible of his raising a tomb for polydorus the obsequies for misenus his pious remembrance of deiphobus the funerals of his nurse his grief for pallas and his revenge taken on his murderer whom otherwise by his natural compassion he had forgiven  and then the poem had been left imperfect for we could have had no certain prospect of his happiness while the last obstacle to it was unremoved  of the other parts which compose his character as a king or as a general i need say nothing the whole aeneis is one continued instance of some one or other of them and where i find anything of them taxed it shall suffice me as briefly as i can to vindicate my divine master to your lordship and by you to the reader  but herein segrais in his admirable preface to his translation of the aeneis as the author of the dauphins virgil justly calls it has prevented me  him i follow and what i borrow from him am ready to acknowledge to him for impartially speaking the french are as much better critics than the english as they are worse poets  thus we generally allow that they better understand the management of a war than our islanders but we know we are superior to them in the day of battle they value themselves on their generals we on our soldiers  but this is not the proper place to decide that question if they make it one  i shall say perhaps as much of other nations and their poets excepting only tasso and hope to make my assertion good which is but doing justice to my countrypart of which honour will reflect on your lordship whose thoughts are always just your numbers harmonious your words chosen your expressions strong and manly your verse flowing and your turns as happy as they are easy  if you would set us more copies your example would make all precepts needless  in the meantime that little you have written is owned and that particularly by the poets who are a nation not overlavish of praise to their contemporaries as a principal ornament of our language but the sweetest essences are always confined in the smallest glasses  when i speak of your lordship it is never a digression and therefore i need beg no pardon for it but take up segrais where i left him and shall use him less often than i have occasion for him for his preface is a perfect piece of criticism full and clear and digested into an exact method mine is loose and as i intended it epistolary  yet i dwell on many things which he durst not touch for it is dangerous to offend an arbitrary master and every patron who has the power of augustus has not his clemency  in short my lord i would not translate him because i would bring you somewhat of my own  his notes and observations on every book are of the same excellency and for the same reason i omit the greater part  he takes no notice that virgil is arraigned for placing piety before valour and making that piety the chief character of his hero  i have said already from bossu that a poet is not obliged to make his hero a virtuous man therefore neither homer nor tasso are to be blamed for giving what predominant quality they pleased to their first character  but virgil who designed to form a perfect prince and would insinuate that augustus whom he calls aeneas in his poem was truly such found himself obliged to make him without blemish thoroughly virtuous and a thorough virtue both begins and ends in piety  tasso without question observed this before me and therefore split his hero in two he gave godfrey piety and rinaldo fortitude for their chief qualities or manners  homer who had chosen another moral makes both agamemnon and achilles vicious for his design was to instruct in virtue by showing the deformity of vice  i avoid repetition of that i have said above  what follows is translated literally from segrais  virgil had considered that the greatest virtues of augustus consisted in the perfect art of governing his people which caused him to reign for more than forty years in great felicity  he considered that his emperor was valiant civil popular eloquent politic and religious he has given all these qualities to aeneas but knowing that piety alone comprehends the whole duty of man towards the gods towards his country and towards his relations he judged that this ought to be his first character whom he would set for a pattern of perfection  in reality they who believe that the praises which arise from valour are superior to those which proceed from any other virtues have not considered as they ought that valour destitute of other virtues cannot render a man worthy of any true esteem  that quality which signifies no more than an intrepid courage may he separated from many others which are good and accompanied with many which are ill  a man may be very valiant and yet impious and vicious but the same cannot be said of piety which excludes all ill qualities and comprehends even valour itself with all other qualities which are good  can we for example give the praise of valour to a man who should see his gods profaned and should want the courage to defend them to a man who should abandon his father or desert his king in his last necessity  thus far segrais in giving the preference to piety before valour i will now follow him where he considers this valour or intrepid courage singly in itself and this also virgil gives to his aeneas and that in a heroical degree  having first concluded that our poet did for the best in taking the first character of his hero from that essential virtue on which the rest depend he proceeds to tell us that in the ten years war of troy he was considered as the second champion of his country allowing hector the first place and this even by the confession of homer who took all occasions of setting up his own countrymen the grecians and of undervaluing the trojan chiefs  but virgil whom segrais forgot to cite makes diomede give him a higher character for strength and courage  his testimony is this in the eleventh book   stetimus tela aspera contra contulimusque manus  experto credite quantus in clypeum adsurgat quo turbine torqueat hastam si duo praeterea tales inachias venisset ad urbes dardanus et versis lugeret graecia fatis quicquid apud durae cessatum est maenia trojae hectoris aeneaeque manu victoria grajum haesit et in decumum vestigia retulit annum ambo animis ambo insignes praestantibus armis hic pietate prior   i give not here my translation of these verses though i think i have not ill succeeded in them because your lordship is so great a master of the original that i have no reason to desire you should see virgil and me so near together  but you may please my lord to take notice that the latin author refines upon the greek and insinuates that homer had done his hero wrong in giving the advantage of the duel to his own countryman though diomedes was manifestly the second champion of the grecians and ulysses preferred him before ajax when he chose him for the companion of his nightly expedition for he had a headpiece of his own and wanted only the fortitude of another to bring him off with safety and that he might compass his design with honour  the french translator thus proceeds they who accuse aeneas for want of courage either understand not virgil or have read him slightly otherwise they would not raise an objection so easy to be answered  hereupon he gives so many instances of the heros valour that to repeat them after him would tire your lordship and put me to the unnecessary trouble of transcribing the greatest part of the three last aeneids  in short more could not be expected from an amadis a sir lancelot or the whole round table than he performs proxima quaeque metit galdio is the perfect account of a knight errant  if it be replied continues segrais that it was not difficult for him to undertake and achieve such hardy enterprises because he wore enchanted arms that accusation in the first place must fall on homer ere it can reach virgil  achilles was as well provided with them as aeneas though he was invulnerable without them and ariosto the two tassos bernardo and torquato even our own spenserin a word all modern poetshave copied homer as well as virgil he is neither the first nor last but in the midst of them and therefore is safe if they are so  who knows says segrais but that his fated armour was only an allegorical defence and signified no more than that he was under the peculiar protection of the gods born as the astrologers will tell us out of virgil who was well versed in the chaldean mysteries under the favourable influence of jupiter venus and the sun  but i insist not on this because i know you believe not there is such an art though not only horace and persius but augustus himself thought otherwise  but in defence of virgil i dare positively say that he has been more cautious in this particular than either his predecessor or his descendants for aeneas was actually wounded in the twelfth of the aeneis though he had the same godsmith to forge his arms as had achilles  it seems he was no warluck as the scots commonly call such men who they say are ironfree or leadfree  yet after this experiment that his arms were not impenetrable when he was cured indeed by his mothers help because he was that day to conclude the war by the death of turnus the poet durst not carry the miracle too far and restore him wholly to his former vigour he was still too weak to overtake his enemy yet we see with what courage he attacks turnus when he faces and renews the combat  i need say no more for virgil defends himself without needing my assistance and proves his hero truly to deserve that name  he was not then a secondrate champion as they would have him who think fortitude the first virtue in a hero  but being beaten from this hold they will not yet allow him to be valiant because he wept more often as they think than well becomes a man of courage  in the first place if tears are arguments of cowardice what shall i say of homers hero  shall achilles pass for timorous because he wept and wept on less occasions than aeneas  herein virgil must be granted to have excelled his master for once both heroes are described lamenting their lost loves  briseis was taken away by force from the grecians creusa was lost for ever to her husband but achilles went roaring along the salt seashore and like a booby was complaining to his mother when he should have revenged his injury by arms  aeneas took a nobler course for having secured his father and his son he repeated all his former dangers to have found his wife if she had been above ground  and here your lordship may observe the address of virgil it was not for nothing that this passage was related with all these tender circumstances aeneas told it dido heard it  that he had been so affectionate a husband was no ill argument to the coming dowager that he might prove as kind to her  virgil has a thousand secret beauties though i have not leisure to remark them  segrais on this subject of a heros shedding tears observes that historians commend alexander for weeping when he read the mighty actions of achilles and julius caesar is likewise praised when out of the same noble envy he wept at the victories of alexander  but if we observe more closely we shall find that the tears of aeneas were always on a laudable occasion  thus he weeps out of compassion and tenderness of nature when in the temple of carthage he beholds the pictures of his friends who sacrificed their lives in defence of their country  he deplores the lamentable end of his pilot palinurus the untimely death of young pallas his confederate and the rest which i omit  yet even for these tears his wretched critics dare condemn him they make aeneas little better than a kind of st swithin hero always raining  one of these censors was bold enough to argue him of cowardice when in the beginning of the first book he not only weeps but trembles at an approaching storm   extemplo aeneae solvuntur frigore membra ingemit et duplices tendens ad sidera palmas c   but to this i have answered formerly that his fear was not for himself but for his people  and who can give a sovereign a better commendation or recommend a hero more to the affection of the reader  they were threatened with a tempest and he wept he was promised italy and therefore he prayed for the accomplishment of that promiseall this in the beginning of a storm therefore he showed the more early piety and the quicker sense of compassion thus much i have urged elsewhere in the defence of virgil  and since i have been informed by mr moyle a young gentleman whom i can never sufficiently commend that the ancients accounted drowning an accursed death  so that if we grant him to have been afraid he had just occasion for that fear both in relation to himself and to his subjects  i think our adversaries can carry this argument no farther unless they tell us that he ought to have had more confidence in the promise of the gods  but how was he assured that he had understood their oracles aright  helenus might be mistaken phoebus might speak doubtfully even his mother might flatter him that he might prosecute his voyage which if it succeeded happily he should be the founder of an empire  for that she herself was doubtful of his fortune is apparent by the address she made to jupiter on his behalf to which the god makes answer in these words   parce metu cytherea manent immota tuorum fata tibi c   notwithstanding which the goddess though comforted was not assured for even after this through the course of the whole aeneis she still apprehends the interest which juno might make with jupiter against her son  for it was a moot point in heaven whether he could alter fate or not and indeed some passages in virgil would make us suspect that he was of opinion jupiter might defer fate though he could not alter it for in the latter end of the tenth book he introduces juno begging for the life of turnus and flattering her husband with the power of changing destiny tua qui potes orsa reflectas  to which he graciously answers   si mora praesentis leti tempusque caduco oratur juveni meque hoc ita ponere sentis tolle fuga turnum atquc instantibus eripe fatis hactenus indulsisse vacat  sin altior istis sub precibus venia ulla latet totumque moveri mutarive putas bellum spes pascis inanis   but that he could not alter those decrees the king of gods himself confesses in the book above cited when he comforts hercules for the death of pallas who had invoked his aid before he threw his lance at turnus   trojae sub maenibus altis tot nati cecidere deum quin occidit una sarpedon mea progenies etiam sua turnum fata vocant metasque dati pervenit ad aevi   where he plainly acknowledges that he could not save his own son or prevent the death which he foresaw  of his power to defer the blow i once occasionally discoursed with that excellent person sir robert howard who is better conversant than any man that i know in the doctrine of the stoics and he set me right from the concurrent testimony of philosophers and poets that jupiter could not retard the effects of fate even for a moment for when i cited virgil as favouring the contrary opinion in that verse    tolle fuga turnum atque instantibus eripe fatis    he replied and i think with exact judgment that when jupiter gave juno leave to withdraw turnus from the present danger it was because he certainly foreknew that his fatal hour was not come that it was in destiny for juno at that time to save him and that himself obeyed destiny in giving her that leave  i need say no more in justification of our heros courage and am much deceived if he ever be attacked on this side of his character again  but he is arraigned with more show of reason by the ladies who will make a numerous party against him for being false to love in forsaking dido and i cannot much blame them for to say the truth it is an ill precedent for their gallants to follow  yet if i can bring him off with flying colours they may learn experience at her cost and for her sake avoid a cave as the worse shelter they can choose from a shower of rain especially when they have a lover in their company  in the first place segrais observes with much acuteness that they who blame aeneas for his insensibility of love when he left carthage contradict their former accusation of him for being always crying compassionate and effeminately sensible of those misfortunes which befell others  they give him two contrary characters but virgil makes him of a piece always grateful always tenderhearted  but they are impudent enough to discharge themselves of this blunder by haying the contradiction at virgils door  he they say has shown his hero with these inconsistent charactersacknowledging and ungrateful compassionate and hard hearted but at the bottom fickle and selfinterested for dido had not only received his weatherbeaten troops before she saw him and given them her protection but had also offered them an equal share in her dominion   vultis et his mecum pariter considere regnis urbem quam statuo vesra est   this was an obligement never to be forgotten and the more to be considered because antecedent to her love  that passion it is true produced the usual effects of generosity gallantry and care to please and thither we refer them but when she had made all these advances it was still in his power to have refused them after the intrigue of the cavecall it marriage or enjoyment only he was no longer free to take or leave he had accepted the favour and was obliged to be constant if he would be grateful  my lord i have set this argument in the best light i can that the ladies may not think i write booty and perhaps it may happen to me as it did to doctor cudworth who has raised such strong objections against the being of a god and providence that many think he has not answered them  you may please at least to hear the adverse party  segrais pleads for virgil that no less than an absolute command from jupiter could excuse this insensibility of the hero and this abrupt departure which looks so like extreme ingratitude but at the same time he does wisely to remember you that virgil had made piety the first character of aeneas and this being allowed as i am afraid it must he was obliged antecedent to all other considerations to search an asylum for his gods in italyfor those very gods i say who had promised to his race the universal empire could a pious man dispense with the commands of jupiter to satisfy his passion ortake it in the strongest senseto comply with the obligations of his gratitude  religion it is true must have moral honesty for its groundwork or we shall be apt to suspect its truth but an immediate revelation dispenses with all duties of morality all casuists agree that theft is a breach of the moral law yet if i might presume to mingle things sacred with profane the israelites only spoiled the egyptians not robbed them because the propriety was transferred by a revelation to their lawgiver  i confess dido was a very infidel in this point for she would not believe as virgil makes her say that ever jupiter would send mercury on such an immoral errand  but this needs no answerat least no more than virgil gives it   fata obstant placidasque viri deus obstruit aures   this notwithstanding as segrais confesses he might have shown a little more sensibility when he left her for that had been according to his character  but let virgil answer for himself  he still loved her and struggled with his inclinations to obey the gods   curam sub corde premebat multa gemens magnoque animum labefactus amore   upon the whole matter and humanly speaking i doubt there was a fault somewhere and jupiter is better able to bear the blame than either virgil or aeneas  the poet it seems had found it out and therefore brings the deserting hero and the forsaken lady to meet together in the lower regions where he excuses himself when it is too late and accordingly she will take no satisfaction nor so much as hear him  now segrais is forced to abandon his defence and excuses his author by saying that the aeneis is an imperfect work and that death prevented the divine poet from reviewing it and for that reason he had condemned it to the fire though at the same time his two translators must acknowledge that the sixth book is the most correct of the whole aeneis  oh how convenient is a machine sometimes in a heroic poem  this of mercury is plainly one and virgil was constrained to use it here or the honesty of his hero would be ill defended and the fair sex however if they had the deserter in their power would certainly have shown him no more mercy than the bacchanals did orpheus  for if too much constancy may be a fault sometimes then want of constancy and ingratitude after the last favour is a crime that never will be forgiven  but of machines more in their proper place where i shall show with how much judgment they have been used by virgil and in the meantime pass to another article of his defence on the present subject where if i cannot clear the hero i hope at least to bring off the poet for here i must divide their causes  let aeneas trust to his machine which will only help to break his fall but the address is incomparable  plato who borrowed so much from homer and yet concluded for the banishment of all poets would at least have rewarded virgil before he sent him into exile but i go farther and say that he ought to be acquitted and deserved beside the bounty of augustus and the gratitude of the roman people  if after this the ladies will stand out let them remember that the jury is not all agreed for octavia was of his party and was of the first quality in rome  she was also present at the reading of the sixth aeneid and we know not that she condemned aeneas but we are sure she presented the poet for his admirable elegy on her son marcellus  but let us consider the secret reasons which virgil had for thus framing this noble episode wherein the whole passion of love is more exactly described than in any other poet  love was the theme of his fourth book and though it is the shortest of the whole aeneis yet there he has given its beginning its progress its traverses and its conclusion and had exhausted so entirely this subject that he could resume it but very slightly in the eight ensuing books  she was warmed with the graceful appearance of the hero she smothered those sparkles out of decency but conversation blew them up into a flame  then she was forced to make a confidante of her whom she best might trust her own sister who approves the passion and thereby augments it then succeeds her public owning it and after that the consummation  of venus and juno jupiter and mercury i say nothing for they were all machining work but possession having cooled his love as it increased hers she soon perceived the change or at least grew suspicious of a change  this suspicion soon turned to jealousy and jealousy to rage then she disdains and threatens and again is humble and entreats  and nothing availing despairs curses and at last becomes her own executioner  see here the whole process of that passion to which nothing can be added  i dare go no farther lest i should lose the connection of my discourse  to love our native country and to study its benefit and its glory to be interested in its concerns is natural to all men and is indeed our common duty  a poet makes a farther step for endeavouring to do honour to it  it is allowable in him even to be partial in its cause for he is not tied to truth or fettered by the laws of history  homer and tasso are justly praised for choosing their heroes out of greece and italy virgil indeed made his a trojan but it was to derive the romans and his own augustus from him but all the three poets are manifestly partial to their heroes in favour of their country  for dares phrygius reports of hector that he was slain cowardly aeneas according to the best account slew not mezentius but was slain by him and the chronicles of italy tell us little of that rinaldo deste who conquers jerusalem in tasso  he might be a champion of the church but we know not that he was so much as present at the siege  to apply this to virgil he thought himself engaged in honour to espouse the cause and quarrel of his country against carthage  he knew he could not please the romans better or oblige them more to patronise his poem than by disgracing the foundress of that city he shows her ungrateful to the memory of her first husband doting on a stranger enjoyed and afterwards forsaken by him  this was the original says he of the immortal hatred betwixt the two rival nations  it is true he colours the falsehood of aeneas by an express command from jupiter to forsake the queen who had obliged him but he knew the romans were to be his readers and them he bribedperhaps at the expense of his heros honesty but he gained his cause however as pleading before corrupt judges  they were content to see their founder false to love for still he had the advantage of the amour  it was their enemy whom he forsook and she might have forsaken him if he had not got the start of her  she had already forgotten her vows to her sichaeus and varium et nutabile semper femina is the sharpest satire in the fewest words that ever was made on womankind for both the adjectives are neuter and animal must be understood to make them grammar  virgil does well to put those words into the mouth of mercury  if a god had not spoken them neither durst he have written them nor i translated them yet the deity was forced to come twice on the same errand and the second time as much a hero as aeneas was he frighted him  it seems he feared not jupiter so much as dido for your lordship may observe that as much intent as he was upon his voyage yet he still delayed it till the messenger was obliged to tell him plainly that if he weighed not anchor in the night the queen would be with him in the morning notumque furens quid femina possit  she was injured she was revengeful she was powerful  the poet had likewise before hinted that the people were naturally perfidious for he gives their character in the queen and makes a proverb of punica fides many ages before it was invented  thus i hope my lord that i have made good my promise and justified the poet whatever becomes of the false knight  and sure a poet is as much privileged to lie as an ambassador for the honour and interest of his countryat least as sir henry wotton has defined  this naturally leads me to the defence of the famous anachronism in making aeneas and dido contemporaries for it is certain that the hero lived almost two hundred years before the building of carthage one who imitates boccalini says that virgil was accused before apollo for this error  the god soon found that he was not able to defend his favourite by reason for the case was clear he therefore gave this middle sentence  that anything might be allowed to his son virgil on the account of his other merits that being a monarch he had a dispensing power and pardoned him  but that this special act of grace might never be drawn into example or pleaded by his puny successors in justification of their ignorance he decreed for the futureno poet should presume to make a lady die for love two hundred years before her birth  to moralise this story virgil is the apollo who has this dispensing power  his great judgment made the laws of poetry but he never made himself a slave to them chronology at best is but a cobweb law and he broke through it with his weight  they who will imitate him wisely must choose as he did an obscure and a remote era where they may invent at pleasure and not be easily contradicted  neither he nor the romans had ever read the bible by which only his false computation of times can be made out against him  this segrais says in his defence and proves it from his learned friend bochartus whose letter on this subject he has printed at the end of the fourth aeneid to which i refer your lordship and the reader  yet the credit of virgil was so great that he made this fable of his own invention pass for an authentic history or at least as credible as anything in homer  ovid takes it up after him even in the same age and makes an ancient heroine of virgils newcreated dido dictates a letter for her just before her death to the ingrateful fugitive and very unluckily for himself is for measuring a sword with a man so much superior in force to him on the same subject  i think i may be judge of this because i have translated both  the famous author of the art of love has nothing of his own he borrows all from a greater master in his own profession and which is worse improves nothing which he finds  nature fails him and being forced to his old shift he has recourse to witticism  this passes indeed with his soft admirers and gives him the preference to virgil in their esteem but let them like for themselves and not prescribe to others for our author needs not their admiration  the motive that induced virgil to coin this fable i have showed already and have also begun to show that he might make this anachronism by superseding the mechanic rules of poetry for the same reason that a monarch may dispense with or suspend his own laws when he finds it necessary so to do especially if those laws are not altogether fundamental  nothing is to be called a fault in poetry says aristotle but what is against the art therefore a man may be an admirable poet without being an exact chronologer  shall we dare continues segrais to condemn virgil for having made a fiction against the order of time when we commend ovid and other poets who have made many of their fictions against the order of nature  for what else are the splendid miracles of the metamorphoses  yet these are beautiful as they are related and have also deep learning and instructive mythologies couched under them  but to give as virgil does in this episode the original cause of the long wars betwixt rome and carthage to draw truth out of fiction after so probable a manner with so much beauty and so much for the honour of his country was proper only to the divine wit of maro and tasso in one of his discourses admires him for this particularly  it is not lawful indeed to contradict a point of history which is known to all the worldas for example to make hannibal and scipio contemporaries with alexanderbut in the dark recesses of antiquity a great poet may and ought to feign such things as he finds not there if they can be brought to embellish that subject which he treats  on the other side the pains and diligence of ill poets is but thrown away when they want the genius to invent and feign agreeably  but if the fictions be delightful which they always are if they be natural if they be of a piece if the beginning the middle and the end be in their due places and artfully united to each other such works can never fail of their deserved success  and such is virgils episode of dido and aeneas where the sourest critic must acknowledge that if he had deprived his aeneis of so great an ornament because he found no traces of it in antiquity he had avoided their unjust censure but had wanted one of the greatest beauties of his poem  i shall say more of this in the next article of their charge against him which iswant of invention  in the meantime i may affirm in honour of this episode that it is not only now esteemed the most pleasing entertainment of the aeneis but was so accounted in his own age and before it was mellowed into that reputation which time has given it for which i need produce no other testimony than that of ovid his contemporary   nec pars ulla magis legitur de corpore toto quam non legitimo faedere junctus amor   where by the way you may observe my lord that ovid in those words non legitimo faedere junctus amor will by no means allow it to be a lawful marriage betwixt dido and aeneas  he was in banishment when he wrote those verses which i cite from his letter to augustus  you sir saith he have sent me into exile for writing my art of love and my wanton elegies yet your own poet was happy in your good graces though he brought dido and aeneas into a cave and left them there not overhonestly together  may i be so bold to ask your majesty is it a greater fault to teach the art of unlawful love than to show it in the action  but was ovid the courtpoet so bad a courtier as to find no other plea to excuse himself than by a plain accusation of his master  virgil confessed it was a lawful marriage betwixt the lovers that juno the goddess of matrimony had ratified it by her presence for it was her business to bring matters to that issue  that the ceremonies were short we may believe for dido was not only amorous but a widow mercury himself though employed on a quite contrary errand yet owns it a marriage by an innuendopulchramque uxorius urbem extruis  he calls aeneas not only a husband but upbraids him for being a fond husband as the word uxorius implies  now mark a little if your lordship pleases why virgil is so much concerned to make this marriage for he seems to be the father of the bride himself and to give her to the bridegroom it was to make way for the divorce which he intended afterwards for he was a finer flatterer than ovid and i more than conjecture that he had in his eye the divorce which not long before had passed betwixt the emperor and scribonia  he drew this dimple in the cheek of aeneas to prove augustus of the same family by so remarkable a feature in the same place  thus as we say in our homespun english proverb he killed two birds with one stonepleased the emperor by giving him the resemblance of his ancestor and gave him such a resemblance as was not scandalous in that age for to leave one wife and take another was but a matter of gallantry at that time of day among the romans neque haec in faedera veni is the very excuse which aeneas makes when he leaves his lady  i made no such bargain with you at our marriage to live always drudging on at carthage my business was italy and i never made a secret of it  if i took my pleasure had not you your share of it  i leave you free at my departure to comfort yourself with the next stranger who happens to be shipwrecked on your coast be as kind an hostess as you have been to me and you can never fail of another husband  in the meantime i call the gods to witness that i leave your shore unwillingly for though juno made the marriage yet jupiter commands me to forsake you  this is the effect of what he saith when it is dishonoured out of latin verse into english prose  if the poet argued not aright we must pardon him for a poor blind heathen who knew no better morals  i have detained your lordship longer than i intended on this objection which would indeed weigh something in a spiritual court but i am not to defend our poet there  the next i think is but a cavil though the cry is great against him and hath continued from the time of macrobius to this present age i hinted it before  they lay no less than want of invention to his chargea capital charge i must acknowledge for a poet is a maker as the word signifies and who cannot makethat is inventhath his name for nothing that which makes this accusation look so strong at the first sight is that he has borrowed so many things from homer apollonius rhodius and others who preceded him  but in the first place if invention is to be taken in so strict a sense that the matter of a poem must be wholly new and that in all its parts then scaliger hath made out saith segrais that the history of troy was no more the invention of homer than of virgil  there was not an old woman or almost a child but had it in their mouths before the greek poet or his friends digested it into this admirable order in which we read it  at this rate as solomon hath told us there is nothing new beneath the sun  who then can pass for an inventor if homer as well as virgil must be deprived of that glory  is versailles the less a new building because the architect of that palace hath imitated others which were built before it  walls doors and windows apartments offices rooms of convenience and magnificence are in all great houses  so descriptions figures fables and the rest must be in all heroic poems they are the common materials of poetry furnished from the magazine of nature  every poet hath as much right to them as every man hath to air or water   quid prohibetis aquas  usus communis aquarum est   but the argument of the work that is to say its principal action the economy and disposition of itthese are the things which distinguish copies from originals  the poet who borrows nothing from others is yet to be born he and the jews messias will come together  there are parts of the aeneis which resemble some parts both of the ilias and of the odysses as for example aeneas descended into hell and ulysses had been there before him aeneas loved dido and ulysses loved calypso  in few words virgil hath imitated homers odysses in his first six books and in his six last the ilias  but from hence can we infer that the two poets write the same history  is there no invention in some other parts of virgils aeneis  the disposition of so many various matters is not that his own  from what book of homer had virgil his episode of nysus and euryalus of mezentius and lausus  from whence did he borrow his design of bringing aeneas into italy of establishing the roman empire on the foundations of a trojan colony to say nothing of the honour he did his patron not only in his descent from venus but in making him so like her in his best features that the goddess might have mistaken augustus for her son  he had indeed the story from common fame as homer had his from the egyptian priestess aeneadum genetrix was no more unknown to lucretius than to him but lucretius taught him not to form his hero to give him piety or valour for his mannersand both in so eminent a degree that having done what was possible for man to save his king and country his mother was forced to appear to him and restrain his fury which hurried him to death in their revenge  but the poet made his piety more successful he brought off his father and his son and his gods witnessed to his devotion by putting themselves under his protection to be replaced by him in their promised italy  neither the invention nor the conduct of this great action were owing to homer or any other poet it is one thing to copy and another thing to imitate from nature  the copier is that servile imitator to whom horace gives no better a name than that of animal he will not so much as allow him to be a man  raffaelle imitated nature they who copy one of raffaelles pieces imitate but him for his work is their original  they translate him as i do virgil and fall as short of him as i of virgil  there is a kind of invention in the imitation of raffaelle for though the thing was in nature yet the idea of it was his own  ulysses travelled so did aeneas but neither of them were the first travellers  for cain went into the land of nod before they were born and neither of the poets ever heard of such a man  if ulysses had been killed at troy yet aeneas must have gone to sea or he could never have arrived in italy but the designs of the two poets were as different as the courses of their heroesone went home and the other sought a home  to return to my first similitude  suppose apelles and raffaelle had each of them painted a burning troy might not the modern painter have succeeded as well as the ancient though neither of them had seen the town on fire  for the drafts of both were taken from the ideas which they had of nature  cities have been burnt before either of them were in being  but to close the simile as i began it  they would not have designed it after the same manner apelles would have distinguished pyrrhus from the rest of all the grecians and showed him forcing his entrance into priams palace there he had set him in the fairest light and given him the chief place of all his figures because he was a grecian and he would do honour to his country  raffaelle who was an italian and descended from the trojans would have made aeneas the hero of his piece and perhaps not with his father on his back his son in one hand his bundle of gods in the other and his wife following for an act of piety is not half so graceful in a picture as an act of courage he would rather have drawn him killing androgeus or some other hand to hand and the blaze of the fires should have darted full upon his face to make him conspicuous amongst his trojans  this i think is a just comparison betwixt the two poets in the conduct of their several designs  virgil cannot be said to copy homer the grecian had only the advantage of writing first  if it be urged that i have granted a resemblance in some parts yet therein virgil has excelled him for what are the tears of calypso for being left to the fury and death of dido  where is there the whole process of her passion and all its violent effects to be found in the languishing episode of the odysses  if this be to copy let the critics show us the same disposition features or colouring in their original  the like may be said of the descent to hell which was not of homers invention either he had it from the story of orpheus and eurydice  but to what end did ulysses make that journey  aeneas undertook it by the express commandment of his fathers ghost  there he was to show him all the succeeding heroes of his race and next to romulus mark if you please the address of virgil his own patron augustus caesar anchises was likewise to instruct him how to manage the italian war and how to conclude it with his honourthat is in other words to lay the foundations of that empire which augustus was to govern this is the noble invention of our author but it hath been copied by so many signpost daubers that now it is grown fulsome rather by their want of skill than by the commonness  in the last place  i may safely grant that by reading homer virgil was taught to imitate his inventionthat is to imitate like him which is no more than if a painter studied raffaelle that he might learn to design after his manner  and thus i might imitate virgil if i were capable of writing an heroic poem and yet the invention be my own but i should endeavour to avoid a servile copying  i would not give the same story under other names with the same characters in the same order and with the same sequel for every common reader to find me out at the first sight for a plagiary and cry this i read before in virgil in a better language and in better verse  this is like merryandrew on the low rope copying lubberly the same tricks which his master is so dexterously performing on the high  i will trouble your lordship but with one objection more which i know not whether i found in le febvre or valois but i am sure i have read it in another french critic whom i will not name because i think it is not much for his reputation  virgil in the heat of actionsuppose for example in describing the fury of his hero in a battle when he is endeavouring to raise our concernments to the highest pitchturns short on the sudden into some similitude which diverts say they your attention from the main subject and misspends it on some trivial image  he pours cold water into the caldron when his business is to make it boil  this accusation is general against all who would be thought heroic poets but i think it touches virgil less than any he is too great a master of his art to make a blot which may so easily be hit similitudes as i have said are not for tragedy which is all violent and where the passions are in a perpetual ferment for there they deaden where they should animate they are not of the nature of dialogue unless in comedy  a metaphor is almost all the stage can suffer which is a kind of similitude comprehended in a word  but this figure has a contrary effect in heroic poetry there it is employed to raise the admiration which is its proper business and admiration is not of so violent a nature as fear or hope compassion or horror or any concernment we can have for such or such a person on the stage  not but i confess that similitudes and descriptions when drawn into an unreasonable length must needs nauseate the reader  once i remember and but once virgil makes a similitude of fourteen lines and his description of fame is about the same number  he is blamed for both and i doubt not but he would have contracted them had be lived to have reviewed his work but faults are no precedents  this i have observed of his similitudes in generalthat they are not placed as our unobserving critics tell us in the heat of any action but commonly in its declining when he has warmed us in his description as much as possibly he can then lest that warmth should languish he renews it by some apt similitude which illustrates his subject and yet palls not his audience  i need give your lordship but one example of this kind and leave the rest to your observation when next you review the whole aeneis in the original unblemished by my rude translation it is in the first hook where the poet describes neptune composing the ocean on which aeolus had raised a tempest without his permission  he had already chidden the rebellious winds for obeying the commands of their usurping master he had warned them from the seas he had beaten down the billows with his mace dispelled the clouds restored the sunshine while triton and cymothoe were heaving the ships from off the quicksands before the poet would offer at a similitude for illustration   ac veluti magno in populo cum saepe coorta est seditio saevitque animis ignobile vulgus jamque faces et saxa volant furor arma ministrat tum pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem conspexere silent arrectisque auribus adstant ille regit dictis animos et pectora mulcet sic cunctus pelagi cecidit fragor aequora postquam prospiciens genitor coeloque invectus aperto flectit equos curruque volans dat lora secundo   this is the first similitude which virgil makes in this poem and one of the longest in the whole for which reason i the rather cite it  while the storm was in its fury any allusion had been improper for the poet could have compared it to nothing more impetuous than itself consequently he could have made no illustration  if he could have illustrated it had been an ambitious ornament out of season and would have diverted our concernment nunc non erat his locus and therefore he deferred it to its proper place  these are the criticisms of most moment which have been made against the aeneis by the ancients or moderns  as for the particular exceptions against this or that passage macrobius and pontanus have answered them already  if i desired to appear more learned than i am it had been as easy for me to have taken their objections and solutions as it is for a country parson to take the expositions of the fathers out of junius and tremellius or not to have named the authors from whence i had them for so ruaeus otherwise a most judicious commentator on virgils works has used pontanus his greatest benefactor of whom he is very silent and i do not remember that he once cites him  what follows next is no objection for that implies a fault and it had been none in virgil if he had extended the time of his action beyond a yearat least aristotle has set no precise limits to it homers we know was within two months tasso i am sure exceeds not a summer and if i examined him perhaps he might be reduced into a much less compass  bossu leaves it doubtful whether virgils action were within the year or took up some months beyond it indeed the whole dispute is of no more concernment to the common reader than it is to a ploughman whether february this year had twentyeight or twentynine days in it but for the satisfaction of the more curious of which number i am sure your lordship is one i will translate what i think convenient out of segrais whom perhaps you have not read for he has made it highly probable that the action of the aeneis began in the spring and was not extended beyond the autumn and we have known campaigns that have begun sooner and have ended later  ronsard and the rest whom segrais names who are of opinion that the action of this poem takes up almost a year and half ground their calculation thus anchises died in sicily at the end of winter or beginning of the spring  aeneas immediately after the interment of his father puts to sea for italy he is surprised by the tempest described in the beginning of the first book and there it is that the scene of the poem opens and where the action must commence  he is driven by this storm on the coasts of africa he stays at carthage all that summer and almost all the winter following sets sail again for italy just before the beginning of the spring meets with contrary winds and makes sicily the second time  this part of the action completes the year  then he celebrates the anniversary of his fathers funerals and shortly after arrives at cumes  and from thence his time is taken up in his first treaty with latinus the overture of the war the siege of his camp by turnus his going for succours to relieve it his return the raising of the siege by the first battle the twelve days truce the second battle the assault of laurentum and the single fight with turnusall which they say cannot take up less than four or five months more by which account we cannot suppose the entire action to be contained in a much less compass than a year and half  segrais reckons another way and his computation is not condemned by the learned ruaeus who compiled and published the commentaries on our poet which we call the dauphins virgil  he allows the time of year when anchises died to be in the latter end of winter or the beginning of the spring he acknowledges that when aeneas is first seen at sea afterwards and is driven by the tempest on the coast of africa is the time when the action is naturally to begin he confesses farther that aeneas left carthage in the latter end of winter for dido tells him in express terms as an argument for his longer stay    quin etiam hiberno moliris sidere classem   but whereas ronsards followers suppose that when aeneas had buried his father he set sail immediately for italy though the tempest drove him on the coast of carthage segrais will by no means allow that supposition but thinks it much more probable that he remained in sicily till the midst of july or the beginning of august at which time he places the first appearance of his hero on the sea and there opens the action of the poem  from which beginning to the death of turnus which concludes the action there need not be supposed above ten months of intermediate time for arriving at carthage in the latter end of summer staying there the winter following departing thence in the very beginning of the spring making a short abode in sicily the second time landing in italy and making the war may be reasonably judged the business but of ten months  to this the ronsardians reply that having been for seven years before in quest of italy and having no more to do in sicily than to inter his fatherafter that office was performed what remained for him but without delay to pursue his first adventure to which segrais answers that the obsequies of his father according to the rites of the greeks and romans would detain him for many days that a longer time must be taken up in the refitting of his ships after so tedious a voyage and in refreshing his weather beaten soldiers on a friendly coast  these indeed are but suppositions on both sides yet those of segrais seem better grounded for the feast of dido when she entertained aeneas first has the appearance of a summers night which seems already almost ended when he begins his story  therefore the love was made in autumn the hunting followed properly when the heats of that scorching country were declining  the winter was passed in jollity as the season and their love required and he left her in the latter end of winter as is already proved  this opinion is fortified by the arrival of aeneas at the mouth of tiber which marks the season of the spring that season being perfectly described by the singing of the birds saluting the dawn and by the beauty of the place which the poet seems to have painted expressly in the seventh aeneid   aurora in roseis fulgebat lutea bigis cum venti posuere       variae circumque supraque assuetae ripis volucres et fluminis alveo aethera mulcebant cantu   the remainder of the action required but three months more for when aeneas went for succour to the tuscans he found their army in a readiness to march and wanting only a commander  so that according to this calculation the aeneas takes not up above a year complete and may be comprehended in less compass  this amongst other circumstances treated more at large by segrais agrees with the rising of orion which caused the tempest described in the beginning of the first book  by some passages in the pastorals but more particularly in the georgics our poet is found to be an exact astronomer according to the knowledge of that age  now ilioneus whom virgil twice employs in embassies as the best speaker of the trojans attributes that tempest to orion in his speech to dido   cum subito assurgens fluctu nimbosus orion   he must mean either the heliacal or achronical rising of that sign the heliacal rising of a constellation is when it comes from under the rays of the sun and begins to appear before daylight  the achronical rising on the contrary is when it appears at the close of day and in opposition of the suns diurnal course  the heliacal rising of orion is at present computed to be about the 6th of july and about that time it is that he either causes or presages tempests on the seas  segrais has observed farther that when anna counsels dido to stay aeneas during the winter she speaks also of orion   dum pelago desaevit hiems et aquosus orion   if therefore ilioneus according to our supposition understand the heliacal rising of orion anna must mean the achronical which the different epithets given to that constellation seem to manifest ilioneus calls him nimbosus anna aquosus  he is tempestuous in the summer when he rises heliacally and rainy in the winter when he rises achronically  your lordship will pardon me for the frequent repetition of these cant words which i could not avoid in this abbreviation of segrais who i think deserves no little commendation in this new criticism  i have yet a word or two to say of virgils machines from my own observation of them  he has imitated those of homer but not copied them  it was established long before this time in the roman religion as well as in the greek that there were gods and both nations for the most part worshipped the same deities as did also the trojans from whom the romans i suppose would rather be thought to derive the rites of their religion than from the grecians because they thought themselves descended from them each of those gods had his proper office and the chief of them their particular attendants  thus jupiter had in propriety ganymede and mercury and juno had iris  it was not for virgil then to create new ministers he must take what he found in his religion it cannot therefore be said that he borrowed them from homer any more than from apollo diana and the rest whom he uses as he finds occasion for them as the grecian poet did but he invents the occasions for which he uses them  venus after the destruction of troy had gained neptune entirely to her party therefore we find him busy in the beginning of the aeneis to calm the tempest raised by aeolus and afterwards conducting the trojan fleet to cumes in safety with the loss only of their pilot for whom he bargains  i name those two examplesamongst a hundred which i omitto prove that virgil generally speaking employed his machines in performing those things which might possibly have been done without them  what more frequent than a storm at sea upon the rising of orion  what wonder if amongst so many ships there should one be overset which was commanded by orontes though half the winds had not been there which aeolus employed  might not palinurus without a miracle fall asleep and drop into the sea having been overwearied with watching and secure of a quiet passage by his observation of the skies  at least aeneas who knew nothing of the machine of somnus takes it plainly in this sense   o nimium coelo et pelago confise sereno nudus in ignota palinure jacebis arena   but machines sometimes are specious things to amuse the reader and give a colour of probability to things otherwise incredible and besides it soothed the vanity of the romans to find the gods so visibly concerned in all the actions of their predecessors  we who are better taught by our religion yet own every wonderful accident which befalls us for the best to be brought to pass by some special providence of almighty god and by the care of guardian angels and from hence i might infer that no heroic poem can be writ on the epicurean principles which i could easily demonstrate if there were need to prove it or i had leisure  when venus opens the eyes of her son aeneas to behold the gods who combated against troy in that fatal night when it was surprised we share the pleasure of that glorious vision which tasso has not ill copied in the sacking of jerusalem  but the greeks had done their business though neither neptune juno or pallas had given them their divine assistance  the most crude machine which virgil uses is in the episode of camilla where opis by the command of her mistress kills aruns  the next is in the twelfth aeneid where venus cures her son aeneas  but in the last of these the poet was driven to a necessity for turnus was to be slain that very day and aeneas wounded as he was could not have engaged him in single combat unless his hurt had been miraculously healed and the poet had considered that the dittany which she brought from crete could not have wrought so speedy an effect without the juice of ambrosia which she mingled with it  after all that his machine might not seem too violent we see the hero limping after turnus the wound was skinned but the strength of his thigh was not restored  but what reason had our author to wound aeneas at so critical a time  and how came the cuishes to be worse tempered than the rest of his armour which was all wrought by vulcan and his journeymen  these difficulties are not easily to be solved without confessing that virgil had not life enough to correct his work though he had reviewed it and found those errors which he resolved to mend but being prevented by death and not willing to leave an imperfect work behind him he ordained by his last testament that his aeneis should be burned  as for the death of aruns who was shot by a goddess the machine was not altogether so outrageous as the wounding mars and venus by the sword of diomede  two divinities one would have thought might have pleaded their prerogative of impassibility or at least not have been wounded by any mortal hand beside that the greek text which cannot be reproduced which they shed was so very like our common blood that it was not to be distinguished from it but only by the name and colour  as for what horace says in his art of poetry that no machines are to be used unless on some extraordinary occasion   nec deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus    that rule is to be applied to the theatre of which he is then speaking and means no more than thisthat when the knot of the play is to be untied and no other way is left for making the discovery then and not otherwise let a god descend upon a rope and clear the business to the audience  but this has no relation to the machines which are used in an epic poem  in the last place for the dira or flying pest which flapping on the shield of turnus and fluttering about his head disheartened him in the duel and presaged to him his approaching deathi might have placed it more properly amongst the objections for the critics who lay want of courage to the charge of virgils hero quote this passage as a main proof of their assertion  they say our author had not only secured him before the duel but also in the beginning of it had given him the advantage in impenetrable arms and in his sword for that of turnus was not his own which was forged by vulcan for his father but a weapon which he had snatched in haste and by mistake belonging to his charioteer metiscus  that after all this jupiter who was partial to the trojan and distrustful of the event though he had hung the balance and given it a jog of his hand to weigh down turnus thought convenient to give the fates a collateral security by sending the screechowl to discourage him for which they quote these words of virgil   non me tua turbida virtus terret ait dii me terrent et jupiter hostis   in answer to which i say that this machine is one of those which the poet uses only for ornament and not out of necessity  nothing can be more beautiful or more poetical than his description of the three dirae or the setting of the balance which our milton has borrowed from him but employed to a different end for first he makes god almighty set the scales for st gabriel and satan when he knew no combat was to follow then he makes the good angels scale descend and the devils mountquite contrary to virgil if i have translated the three verses according to my authors sense   jupiter ipse duas aequota examine lances sustinet et fata imponit diversa duorum quem damnet labor et quo vergat pondere letum   for i have taken these words quem damnet labor in the sense which virgil gives them in another place damnabis tu quoque votis to signify a prosperous event  yet i dare not condemn so great a genius as milton for i am much mistaken if he alludes not to the text in daniel where belshazzar was put into the balance and found too light  this is digression and i return to my subject  i said above that these two machines of the balance and the dira were only ornamental and that the success of the duel had been the same without them for when aeneas and turnus stood fronting each other before the altar turnus looked dejected and his colour faded in his face as if he desponded of the victory before the fight and not only he but all his party when the strength of the two champions was judged by the proportion of their limbs concluded it was impar pugna and that their chief was overmatched  whereupon juturna who was of the same opinion took this opportunity to break the treaty and renew the war  juno herself had plainly told the nymph beforehand that her brother was to fight   imparibus fatis nec diis nec viribus aequis   so that there was no need of an apparition to fright turnus he had the presage within himself of his impending destiny  the dira only served to confirm him in his first opinion that it was his destiny to die in the ensuing combat  and in this sense are those words of virgil to be taken    non me tua turbida virtus terret ait dii me terrent et jupiter hostis   i doubt not but the adverb solum is to be understood it is not your valour only that gives me this concernment but i find also by this portent that jupiter is my enemy for turnus fled before when his first sword was broken till his sister supplied him with a better which indeed he could not use because aeneas kept him at a distance with his spear  i wonder ruaeus saw not this where he charges his author so unjustly for giving turnus a second sword to no purpose  how could he fasten a blow or make a thrust when he was not suffered to approach  besides the chief errand of the dira was to warn juturna from the field for she could have brought the chariot again when she saw her brother worsted in the duel  i might farther add that aeneas was so eager of the fight that he left the city now almost in his possession to decide his quarrel with turnus by the sword whereas turnus had manifestly declined the combat and suffered his sister to convey him as far from the reach of his enemy as she could  i say not only suffered her but consented to it for it is plain he knew her by these words   o soror et dudum agnovi cum prima per artem faedera turbasti teque haec in bella dedisti et tunc necquicquam fallis dea   i have dwelt so long on this subject that i must contract what i have to say in reference to my translation unless i would swell my preface into a volume and make it formidable to your lordship when you see so many pages yet behind  and indeed what i have already written either in justification or praise of virgil is against myself for presuming to copy in my coarse english the thoughts and beautiful expressions of this inimitable poet who flourished in an age when his language was brought to its last perfection for which it was particularly owing to him and horace  i will give your lordship my opinion that those two friends had consulted each others judgment wherein they should endeavour to excel and they seem to have pitched on propriety of thought elegance of words and harmony of numbers  according to this model horace wrote his odes and epodes for his satires and epistles being intended wholly for instruction required another style    ornari res ipsa negat contenta doceri    and therefore as he himself professes are sermoni propriora nearer prose than verse  but virgil who never attempted the lyric verse is everywhere elegant sweet and flowing in his hexameters  his words are not only chosen but the places in which he ranks them for the sound he who removes them from the station wherein their master sets them spoils the harmony  what he says of the sibyls prophecies may be as properly applied to every word of histhey must be read in order as they lie the least breath discomposes them and somewhat of their divinity is lost  i cannot boast that i have been thus exact in my verses but i have endeavoured to follow the example of my master and am the first englishman perhaps who made it his design to copy him in his numbers his choice of words and his placing them for the sweetness of the sound  on this last consideration i have shunned the caesura as much as possibly i could for wherever that is used it gives a roughness to the verse of which we can have little need in a language which is overstocked with consonants  such is not the latin where the vowels and consonants are mixed in proportion to each other yet virgil judged the vowels to have somewhat of an overbalance and therefore tempers their sweetness with caesuras such difference there is in tongues that the same figure which roughens one gives majesty to another and that was it which virgil studied in his verses  ovid uses it but rarely and hence it is that his versification cannot so properly be called sweet as luscious  the italians are forced upon it once or twice in every line because they have a redundancy of vowels in their language their metal is so soft that it will not coin without alloy to harden it  on the other side for the reason already named it is all we can do to give sufficient sweetness to our language we must not only choose our words for elegance but for soundto perform which a mastery in the language is required the poet must have a magazine of words and have the art to manage his few vowels to the best advantage that they may go the farther  he must also know the nature of the vowelswhich are more sonorous and which more soft and sweetand so dispose them as his present occasions require all which and a thousand secrets of versification beside he may learn from virgil if he will take him for his guide  if he be above virgil and is resolved to follow his own verve as the french call it the proverb will fall heavily upon him  who teaches himself has a fool for his master  virgil employed eleven years upon his aeneis yet he left it as he thought himself imperfect which when i seriously consider i wish that instead of three years which i have spent in the translation of his works i had four years more allowed me to correct my errors that i might make my version somewhat more tolerable than it is for a poet cannot have too great a reverence for his readers if he expects his labours should survive him  yet i will neither plead my age nor sickness in excuse of the faults which i have made  that i wanted time is all i have to say for some of my subscribers grew so clamorous that i could no longer defer the publication  i hope from the candour of your lordship and your oftenexperienced goodness to me that if the faults are not too many you will make allowances with horace   si plura nitent in carmine non ego paucis offendar maculis quas aut incuria fudit aut humana parum cavit natura   you may please also to observe that there is not to the best of my remembrance one vowel gaping on another for want of a caesura in this whole poem  but where a vowel ends a word the next begins either with a consonant or what is its equivalent for our w and h aspirate and our diphthongs are plainly such  the greatest latitude i take is in the letter y when it concludes a word and the first syllable of the next begins with a vowel  neither need i have called this a latitude which is only an explanation of this general rulethat no vowel can be cut off before another when we cannot sink the pronunciation of it as he she me i c  virgil thinks it sometimes a beauty to imitate the licence of the greeks and leave two vowels opening on each other as in that verse of the third pastoral   et succus pecori et lac subducitur agnis   but nobis non licet esse tam disertisat least if we study to refine our numbers  i have long had by me the materials of an english prosodia containing all the mechanical rules of versification wherein i have treated with some exactness of the feet the quantities and the pauses  the french and italians know nothing of the two firstat least their best poets have not practised them  as for the pauses malherbe first brought them into france within this last century and we see how they adorn their alexandrines  but as virgil propounds a riddle which he leaves unsolved    dic quibus in terris inscripti nomina regum nascantur flores et phyllida solus habeto    so i will give your lordship another and leave the exposition of it to your acute judgment  i am sure there are few who make verses have observed the sweetness of these two lines in coopers hill    though deep yet clear though gentle yet not dull strong without rage without oerflowing full    and there are yet fewer who can find the reason of that sweetness i have given it to some of my friends in conversation and they have allowed the criticism to be just  but since the evil of false quantities is difficult to be cured in any modern language since the french and the italians as well as we are yet ignorant what feet are to be used in heroic poetry since i have not strictly observed those rules myself which i can teach others since i pretend to no dictatorship among my fellowpoets since if i should instruct some of them to make wellrunning verses they want genius to give them strength as well as sweetness and above all since your lordship has advised me not to publish that little which i know i look on your counsel as your command which i shall observe inviolably till you shall please to revoke it and leave me at liberty to make my thoughts public  in the meantime that i may arrogate nothing to myself i must acknowledge that virgil in latin and spenser in english have been my masters  spenser has also given me the boldness to make use sometimes of his alexandrine line which we call though improperly the pindaric because mr cowley has often employed it in his odes  it adds a certain majesty to the verse when it is used with judgment and stops the sense from overflowing into another line  formerly the french like us and the italians had but five feet or ten syllables in their heroic verse but since ronsards time as i suppose they found their tongue too weak to support their epic poetry without the addition of another foot  that indeed has given it somewhat of the run and measure of a trimetre but it runs with more activity than strength  their language is not strong with sinews like our english it has the nimbleness of a greyhound but not the bulk and body of a mastiff our men and our verses overbear them by their weight and pondere non numero is the british motto  the french have set up purity for the standard of their language and a masculine vigour is that of ours  like their tongue is the genius of their poets light and trifling in comparison of the englishmore proper for sonnets madrigals and elegies than heroic poetry  the turn on thoughts and words is their chief talent  but the epic poem is too stately to receive those little ornaments  the painters draw their nymphs in thin and airy habits but the weight of gold and of embroideries is reserved for queens and goddesses  virgil is never frequent in those turns like ovid but much more sparing of them in his aeneis than in his pastorals and georgics   ignoscenda quidem scirent si ignoscere manes   that turn is beautiful indeed but he employs it in the story of orpheus and eurydice not in his great poem  i have used that licence in his aeneis sometimes but i own it as my fault it was given to those who understand no better  it is like ovids   semivirumque bovem semibovemque virum   the poet found it before his critics but it was a darling sin which he would not be persuaded to reform  the want of genius of which i have accused the french is laid to their charge by one of their own great authors though i have forgotten his name and where i read it  if rewards could make good poets their great master has not been wanting on his part in his bountiful encouragements for he is wise enough to imitate augustus if he had a maro  the triumvir and proscriber had descended to us in a more hideous form than they now appear if the emperor had not taken care to make friends of him and horace  i confess the banishment of ovid was a blot in his escutcheon yet he was only banished and who knows but his crime was capital  and then his exile was a favour  ariosto who with all his faults must be acknowledged a great poet has put these words into the mouth of an evangelist but whether they will pass for gospel now i cannot tell   non fu si santo ni benigno augusto come la tuba di virgilio suona lhaver havuto in poesia buon gusto la proscrittione iniqua gli pardona   but heroic poetry is not of the growth of france as it might be of england if it were cultivated  spenser wanted only to have read the rules of bossu for no man was ever born with a greater genius or had more knowledge to support it  but the performance of the french is not equal to their skill and hitherto we have wanted skill to perform better  segrais whose preface is so wonderfully good yet is wholly destitute of elevation though his version is much better than that of the two brothers or any of the rest who have attempted virgil  annibale caro is a great name amongst the italians yet his translation of the aeneis is most scandalously mean though he has taken the advantage of writing in blank verse and freed himself from the shackles of modern rhymeif it be modern for le clerc has told us lately and i believe has made it out that davids psalms were written in as errant rhyme as they are translated  now if a muse cannot run when she is unfettered it is a sign she has but little speed  i will not make a digression here though i am strangely tempted to it but will only say that he who can write well in rhyme may write better in blank verse  rhyme is certainly a constraint even to the best poets and those who make it with most ease though perhaps i have as little reason to complain of that hardship as any man excepting quarles and withers  what it adds to sweetness it takes away from sense and he who loses the least by it may be called a gainer it often makes us swerve from an authors meaning  as if a mark he set up for an archer at a great distance let him aim as exactly as he can the least wind will take his arrow and divert it from the white  i return to our italian translator of the aeneis he is a foot poet he lackeys by the side of virgil at the best but never mounts behind him  doctor morelli who is no mean critic in our poetry and therefore may be presumed to be a better in his own language has confirmed me in this opinion by his judgment and thinks withal that he has often mistaken his masters sense  i would say so if i durst but am afraid i have committed the same fault more often and more grossly for i have forsaken ruaeus whom generally i follow in many places and made expositions of my own in some quite contrary to him of which i will give but two examples because they are so near each other in the tenth aeneid   sorti pater aequus utrique   pallas says it to turnus just before they fight  ruaeus thinks that the word pater is to be referred to evander the father of pallas but how could he imagine that it was the same thing to evander if his son were slain or if he overcame  the poet certainly intended jupiter the common father of mankind who as pallas hoped would stand an impartial spectator of the combat and not be more favourable to turnus than to him  the second is not long after it and both before the duel is begun  they are the words of jupiter who comforts hercules for the death of pallas which was immediately to ensue and which hercules could not hinder though the young hero had addressed his prayers to him for his assistance because the gods cannot control destiny  the verse follows    sic ait atque oculos rutulorum rejicit arvis    which the same ruaeus thus construes  jupiter after he had said this immediately turns his eyes to the rutulian fields and beholds the duel  i have given this place another expositionthat he turned his eyes from the field of combat that he might not behold a sight so unpleasing to him  the word rejicit i know will admit of both senses but jupiter having confessed that he could not alter fate and being grieved he could not in consideration of hercules it seems to me that he should avert his eyes rather than take pleasure in the spectacle  but of this i am not so confident as the other though i think i have followed virgils sense  what i have said though it has the face of arrogance yet is intended for the honour of my country and therefore i will boldly own that this english translation has more of virgils spirit in it than either the french or the italian  some of our countrymen have translated episodes and other parts of virgil with great success as particularly your lordship whose version of orpheus and eurydice is eminently good  amongst the dead authors the silenus of my lord rescommon cannot be too much commended  i say nothing of sir john denham mr waller and mr cowley it is the utmost of my ambition to be thought their equal or not to be much inferior to them and some others of the living  but it is one thing to take pains on a fragment and translate it perfectly and another thing to have the weight of a whole author on my shoulders  they who believe the burden light let them attempt the fourth sixth or eighth pastoral the first or fourth georgic and amongst the aeneids the fourth the fifth the seventh the ninth the tenth the eleventh or the twelfth for in these i think i have succeeded best  long before i undertook this work i was no stranger to the original i had also studied virgils design his disposition of it his manners his judicious management of the figures the sober retrenchments of his sense which always leaves somewhat to gratify our imagination on which it may enlarge at pleasure but above all the elegance of his expressions and the harmony of his numbers for as i have said in a former dissertation the words are in poetry what the colours are in painting  if the design be good and the draft be true the colouring is the first beauty that strikes the eye  spenser and milton are the nearest in english to virgil and horace in the latin and i have endeavoured to form my style by imitating their masters  i will farther own to you my lord that my chief ambition is to please those readers who have discernment enough to prefer virgil before any other poet in the latin tongue such spirits as he desired to please such would i choose for my judges and would stand or fall by them alone  segrais has distinguished the readers of poetry according to their capacity of judging into three classes he might have said the same of writers too if he had pleased  in the lowest form he places those whom he calls les petits espritssuch things as are our uppergallery audience in a playhouse who like nothing but the husk and rind of wit prefer a quibble a conceit an epigram before solid sense and elegant expression  these are mobreaders  if virgil and martial steed for parliamentmen we know already who would carry it  but though they make the greatest appearance in the field and cry the loudest the best of it is they are but a sort of french huguenots or dutch boors brought ever in herds but not naturalised who have not land of two pounds per annum in parnassus and therefore are not privileged to poll  their authors are of the same level fit to represent them on a mountebanks stage or to be masters of the ceremonies in a beargarden  yet these are they who have the most admirers  but it often happens to their mortification that as their readers improve their stock of sense as they may by reading better books and by conversation with men of judgment they soon forsake them and when the torrent from the mountains falls no more the swelling writer is reduced into his shallow bed like the mancanares at madrid with scarce water to moisten his own pebbles there are a middle sort of readers as we held there is a middle state of souls such as have a farther insight than the former yet have not the capacity of judging right for i speak not of those who are bribed by a party and knew better if they were not corrupted but i mean a company of warm young men who are not yet arrived so far as to discern the difference betwixt fustian or ostentations sentences and the true sublime  these are above liking martial or owens epigrams but they would certainly set virgil below statius or lucan  i need not say their poets are of the same paste with their admirers  they affect greatness in all they write but it is a bladdered greatness like that of the vain man whom seneca describes an ill habit of body full of humours and swelled with dropsy  even these too desert their authors as their judgment ripens  the young gentlemen themselves are commonly misled by their pedagogue at school their tutor at the university or their governor in their travels and many of these three sorts are the most positive blockheads in the world  how many of these flatulent writers have i known who have sunk in their reputation after seven or eight editions of their works for indeed they are poets only for young men  they had great success at their first appearance but not being of god as a wit said formerly they could not stand  i have already named two sorts of judges but virgil wrote for neither of them and by his example i am not ambitious of pleasing the lowest or the middle form of readers  he chose to please the most judicious souls of the highest rank and truest understanding these are few in number but whoever is so happy as to gain their approbation can never lose it because they never give it blindly then they have a certain magnetism in their judgment which attracts others to their sense  every day they gain some new proselyte and in time become the church  for this reason a wellweighed judicious poem which at its first appearance gains no more upon the world than to be just received and rather not blamed than much applauded insinuates itself by insensible degrees into the liking of the reader the more he studies it the more it grows upon him every time he takes it up he discovers some new graces in it  and whereas poems which are produced by the vigour of imagination only have a gloss upon them at the first which time wears off the works of judgment are like the diamond the more they are polished the more lustre they receive  such is the difference betwixt virgils aeneis and marinis adone  and if i may be allowed to change the metaphor i would say that virgil is like the fame which he describes   mobilitate viget viresque acquirit eundo   such a sort of reputation is my aim though in a far inferior degree according to my motto in the titlepagesequiturque patrem non passibus aequisand therefore i appeal to the highest court of judicature like that of the peers of which your lordship is so great an ornament  without this ambition which i own of desiring to please the judices natos i could never have been able to have done anything at this age when the fire of poetry is commonly extinguished in other men yet virgil has given me the example of entellus for my encouragement when he was well heated the younger champion could not stand before him  and we find the elder contended not for the gift but for the honour nec dona moror for dampier has informed us in his voyages that the air of the country which produces gold is never wholesome  i had long since considered that the way to please the best judges is not to translate a poet literally and virgil least of any other for his peculiar beauty lying in his choice of words i am excluded from it by the narrow compass of our heroic verse unless i would make use of monosyllables only and these clogged with consonants which are the dead weight of our mother tongue  it is possible i confess though it rarely happens that a verse of monosyllables may sound harmoniously and some examples of it i have seen  my first line of the aeneis is not harsh    arms and the man i sing who forced by fate c    but a much better instance may be given from the last line of manilius made english by our learned and judicious mr creech    nor could the world have borne so fierce a flame    where the many liquid consonants are placed so artfully that they give a pleasing sound to the words though they are all of one syllable  it is true i have been sometimes forced upon it in other places of this work but i never did it out of choice  i was either in haste or virgil gave me no occasion for the ornament of words for it seldom happens but a monosyllable line turns verse to prose and even that prose is rugged and unharmonious  philarchus i remember taxes balzac for placing twenty monosyllables in file without one dissyllable betwixt them  the way i have taken is not so strait as metaphrase nor so loose as paraphrase some things too i have omitted and sometimes have added of my own  yet the omissions i hope are but of circumstances and such as would have no grace in english and the additions i also hope are easily deduced from virgils sense they will seem at least i have the vanity to think so not stuck into him but growing out of him  he studies brevity more than any other poet but he had the advantage of a language wherein much may be comprehended in a little space  we and all the modern tongues have more articles and pronouns besides signs of tenses and cases and other barbarities on which our speech is built by the faults of our forefathers  the romans founded theirs upon the greek and the greeks we know were labouring many hundred years upon their language before they brought it to perfection  they rejected all those signs and cut off as many articles as they could spare comprehending in one word what we are constrained to express in two which is one reason why we cannot write so concisely as they have done  the word pater for example signifies not only a father but your father my father his or her fatherall included in a word  this inconvenience is common to all modern tongues and this alone constrains us to employ more words than the ancients needed  but having before observed that virgil endeavours to be short and at the same time elegant i pursue the excellence and forsake the brevity  for there he is like ambergris a rich perfume but of so close and glutinous a body that it must be opened with inferior scents of musk or civet or the sweetness will not be drawn out into another language  on the whole matter i thought fit to steer betwixt the two extremes of paraphrase and literal translation to keep as near my author as i could without losing all his graces the most eminent of which are in the beauty of his words  and those words i must add are always figurative  such of these as would retain their elegance in our tongue i have endeavoured to graff on it but most of them are of necessity to be lest because they will not shine in any but their own  virgil has sometimes two of them in a line but the scantiness of our heroic verse is not capable of receiving more than one and that too must expiate for many others which have none  such is the difference of the languages or such my want of skill in choosing words  yet i may presume to say and i hope with as much reason as the french translator that taking all the materials of this divine author i have endeavoured to make virgil speak such english as he would himself have spoken if he had been born in england and in this present age  i acknowledge with segrais that i have not succeeded in this attempt according to my desire yet i shall not be wholly without praise if in some sort i may be allowed to have copied the clearness the purity the easiness and the magnificence of his style  but i shall have occasion to speak farther on this subject before i end the preface  when i mentioned the pindaric line i should have added that i take another licence in my verses for i frequently make use of triplet rhymes and for the same reasonbecause they bound the sense  and therefore i generally join these two licences together and make the last verse of the triplet a pindaric for besides the majesty which it gives it confines the sense within the barriers of three lines which would languish if it were lengthened into four  spenser is my example for both these privileges of english verses and chapman has followed him in his translation of homer  mr cowley has given in to them after both and all succeeding writers after him  i regard them now as the magna charta of heroic poetry and am too much an englishman to lose what my ancestors have gained for me  let the french and italians value themselves on their regularity strength and elevation are our standard  i said before and i repeat it that the affected purity of the french has unsinewed their heroic verse  the language of an epic poem is almost wholly figurative yet they are so fearful of a metaphor that no example of virgil can encourage them to be bold with safety  sure they might warm themselves by that sprightly blaze without approaching it so close as to singe their wings they may come as near it as their master not that i would discourage that purity of diction in which he excels all other poets but he knows how far to extend his franchises and advances to the verge without venturing a foot beyond it  on the other side without being injurious to the memory of our english pindar i will presume to say that his metaphors are sometimes too violent and his language is not always pure  but at the same time i must excuse him for through the iniquity of the times he was forced to travel at an age when instead of learning foreign languages he should have studied the beauties of his mother tongue which like all other speeches is to be cultivated early or we shall never write it with any kind of elegance  thus by gaining abroad he lost at home like the painter in the arcadia who going to see a skirmish had his arms lopped off and returned says sir philip sidney well instructed how to draw a battle but without a hand to perform his work  there is another thing in which i have presumed to deviate from him and spenser  they both make hemistichs or halfverses breaking off in the middle of a line  i confess there are not many such in the faerie queen and even those few might be occasioned by his unhappy choice of so long a stanza  mr cowley had found out that no kind of staff is proper for an heroic poem as being all too lyrical yet though he wrote in couplets where rhyme is freer from constraint he frequently affects halfverses of which we find not one in homer and i think not in any of the greek poets or the latin excepting only virgil  and there is no question but he thought he had virgils authority for that licence  but i am confident our poet never meant to leave him or any other such a precedent and i ground my opinion on these two reasons  first we find no example of a hemistich in any of his pastorals or georgics for he had given the last finishing strokes to both these poems but his aeneis he left so incorrect at least so short of that perfection at which he aimed that we know how hard a sentence he passed upon it  and in the second place i reasonably presume that he intended to have filled up all these hemistichs because in one of them we find the sense imperfect   quem tibi jam troja     aen iii 340   which some foolish grammarian has ended for him with a halfline of nonsense   peperit fumante creusa   for ascanius must have been born some years before the burning of that city which i need not prove  on the other side we find also that he himself filled up one line in the sixth aeneid the enthusiasm seizing him while he was reading to augustus   misenum aeolidem quo non praestantior alter aere ciere viros       to which he added in that transport martemque accendare cantu and never was any line more nobly finished for the reasons which i have given in the book of painting  on these considerations i have shunned hemistichs not being willing to imitate virgil to a fault like alexanders courtiers who affected to hold their necks awry because he could not help it  i am confident your lordship is by this time of my opinion and that you will look on those halflines hereafter as the imperfect products of a hasty muse like the frogs and serpents in the nile part of them kindled into life and part a lump of unformed unanimated mud  i am sensible that many of my whole verses are as imperfect as those halves for want of time to digest them better  but give me leave to make the excuse of boccace who when he was upbraided that some of his novels had not the spirit of the rest returned this answer that charlemagne who made the paladins was never able to raise an army of them  the leaders may be heroes but the multitude must consist of common men  i am also bound to tell your lordship in my own defence that from the beginning of the first georgic to the end of the last aeneid i found the difficulty of translation growing on me in every succeeding book  for virgil above all poets had a stock which i may call almost inexhaustible of figurative elegant and sounding words  i who inherit but a small portion of his genius and write in a language so much inferior to the latin have found it very painful to vary phrases when the same sense returns upon me  even he himself whether out of necessity or choice has often expressed the same thing in the same words and often repeated two or three whole verses which he had used before  words are not so easily coined as money and yet we see that the credit not only of banks but of exchequers cracks when little comes in and much goes out virgil called upon me in every line for some new word and i paid so long that i was almost bankrupt so that the latter end must needs be more burthensome than the beginning or the middle and consequently the twelfth aeneid cost me double the time of the first and second  what had become of me if virgil had taxed me with another book  i had certainly been reduced to pay the public in hammered money for want of milled that is in the same old words which i had used before and the receivers must have been forced to have taken anything where there was so little to be had  besides this difficulty with which i have struggled and made a shift to pass it ever there is one remaining which is insuperable to all translators  we are bound to our authors sense though with the latitudes already mentioned for i think it not so sacred as that one iota must not be added or diminished on pain of an anathema but slaves we are and labour on another mans plantation we dress the vineyard but the wine is the owners  if the soil be sometimes barren then we are sure of being scourged if it be fruitful and our care succeeds we are not thanked for the proud reader will only saythe poor drudge has done his duty  but this is nothing to what follows for being obliged to make his sense intelligible we are forced to untune our own verses that we may give his meaning to the reader  he who invents is master of his thoughts and words  he can turn and vary them as he pleases till he renders them harmonious  but the wretched translator has no such privilege for being tied to the thoughts he must make what music he can in the expression and for this reason it cannot always be so sweet as that of the original  there is a beauty of sound as segrais has observed in some latin words which is wholly lost in any modern language  he instances in that mollis amaracus on which venus lays cupid in the first aeneid  if i should translate it sweetmarjoram as the word signifies the reader would think i had mistaken virgil for these villagewords as i may call them give us a mean idea of the thing but the sound of the latin is so much more pleasing by the just mixture of the vowels with the consonants that it raises our fancies to conceive somewhat more noble than a common herb and to spread roses under him and strew lilies over hima bed not unworthy the grandson of the goddess  if i cannot copy his harmonious numbers how shall i imitate his noble flights where his thoughts and words are equally sublime quem       quisquis studet aemulari    caeratis ope dedalea nititur pennis vitreo daturus nomina ponto   what modern language or what poet can express the majestic beauty of this one verse amongst a thousand others   aude hospes contemnere opes et te quoque dignum finge deo       for my part i am lost in the admiration of it  i contemn the world when i think on it and myself when i translate it  lay by virgil i beseech your lordship and all my better sort of judges when you take up my version and it will appear a passable beauty when the original muse is absent but like spensers false florimel made of snow it melts and vanishes when the true one comes in sight  i will not excuse but justify myself for one pretended crime with which i am liable to be charged by false critics not only in this translation but in many of my original poemsthat i latinise too much  it is true that when i find an english word significant and sounding i neither borrow from the latin nor any other language but when i want at home i must seek abroad  if sounding words are not of our growth and manufacture who shall hinder me to import them from a foreign country  i carry not out the treasure of the nation which is never to return but what i bring from italy i spend in england  here it remains and here it circulates for if the coin be good it will pass from one hand to another  i trade both with the living and the dead for the enrichment of our native language we have enough in england to supply our necessity but if we will have things of magnificence and splendour we must get them by commerce  poetry requires ornament and that is not to be had from our old teuton monosyllables therefore if i find any elegant word in a classic author i propose it to be naturalised by using it myself and if the public approves of it the bill passes  but every man cannot distinguish betwixt pedantry and poetry every man therefore is not fit to innovate  upon the whole matter a poet must first be certain that the word he would introduce is beautiful in the latin and is to consider in the next place whether it will agree with the english idiom  after this he ought to take the opinion of judicious friends such as are learned in both languages and lastly since no man is infallible let him use this licence very sparingly for if too many foreign words are poured in upon us it looks as if they were designed not to assist the natives but to conquer them  i am now drawing towards a conclusion and suspect your lordship is very glad of it  but permit me first to own what helps i have had in this undertaking  the late earl of lauderdale sent me over his new translation of the aeneis which he had ended before i engaged in the same design  neither did i then intend it but some proposals being afterwards made me by my bookseller i desired his lordships leave that i might accept them which he freely granted and i have his letter yet to show for that permission  he resolved to have printed his work which he might have done two years before i could publish mine and had performed it if death had not prevented him  but having his manuscript in my hands i consulted it as often as i doubted of my authors sense for no man understood virgil better than that learned nobleman  his friends i hear have yet another and more correct copy of that translation by them which had they pleased to have given the public the judges must have been convinced that i have not flattered him  besides this help which was not inconsiderable mr congreve has done me the favour to review the aeneis and compare my version with the original  i shall never be ashamed to own that this excellent young man has shown me many faults which i have endeavoured to correct  it is true he might have easily found more and then my translation had been more perfect  two other worthy friends of mine who desire to have their names concealed seeing me straitened in my time took pity on me and gave me the life of virgil the two prefacesto the pastorals and the georgicsand all the arguments in prose to the whole translation which perhaps has caused a report that the two first poems are not mine  if it had been true that i had taken their verses for my own i might have gloried in their aid and like terence have farthered the opinion that scipio and laelius joined with me  but the same style being continued through the whole and the same laws of versification observed are proofs sufficient that this is one mans work and your lordship is too well acquainted with my manner to doubt that any part of it is anothers  that your lordship may see i was in earnest when i premised to hasten to an end i will not give the reasons why i writ not always in the proper terms of navigation landservice or in the cant of any profession  i will only say that virgil has avoided these proprieties because he writ not to mariners soldiers astronomers gardeners peasants c but to all in general and in particular to men and ladies of the first quality who have been better bred than to be too nicely knowing in the terms  in such cases it is enough for a poet to write so plainly that he may be understood by his readers to avoid impropriety and not affect to be thought learned in all things  i have emitted the four preliminary lines of the first aeneid because i think them inferior to any four others in the whole poem and consequently believe they are not virgils  there is too great a gap betwixt the adjective vicina in the second line and the substantive arva in the latter end of the third which keeps his meaning in obscurity too long and is contrary to the clearness of his style  ut quamvis avido is too ambitious an ornament to be his and gratum opus agricolis are all words unnecessary and independent of what he had said before  horrentia martis arma is worse than any of the rest  horrentia is such a flat epithet as tully would have given us in his verses  it is a mere filler to stop a vacancy in the hexameter and connect the preface to the work of virgil  our author seems to sound a charge and begins like the clangour of a trumpet   arma virumque cano trojae qui primus ab oris    scarce a word without an r and the vowels for the greater part sonorous  the prefacer began with ille ego which he was constrained to patch up in the fourth line with at nunc to make the sense cohere and if both those words are not notorious botches i am much deceived though the french translator thinks otherwise  for my own part i am rather of the opinion that they were added by tucca and varius than retrenched  i know it may be answered by such as think virgil the author of the four linesthat he asserts his title to the aeneis in the beginning of this work as he did to the two former in the last lines of the fourth georgic  i will not reply otherwise to this than by desiring them to compare these four lines with the four others which we know are his because no poet but he alone could write them  if they cannot distinguish creeping from flying let them lay down virgil and take up ovid de ponto in his stead  my master needed not the assistance of that preliminary poet to prove his claim  his own majestic mien discovers him to be the king amidst a thousand courtiers  it was a superfluous office and therefore i would not set those verses in the front of virgil but have rejected them to my own preface   i who before with shepherds in the groves sung to my oaten pipe their rural loves and issuing thence compelled the neighbring field a plenteous crop of rising corn to yield manured the glebe and stocked the fruitful plain a poem grateful to the greedy swain c   if there be not a tolerable line in all these six the prefacer gave me no occasion to write better  this is a just apology in this place but i have done great wrong to virgil in the whole translation  want of time the inferiority of our language the inconvenience of rhyme and all the other excuses i have made may alleviate my fault but cannot justify the boldness of my undertaking  what avails it me to acknowledge freely that i have not been able to do him right in any line  for even my own confession makes against me and it will always be returned upon me why then did you attempt it  to which no other answer can be made than that i have done him less injury than any of his former libellers  what they called his picture had been drawn at length so many times by the daubers of almost all nations and still so unlike him that i snatched up the pencil with disdain being satisfied beforehand that i could make some small resemblance of him though i must be content with a worse likeness  a sixth pastoral a pharmaceutria a single orpheus and some other features have been exactly taken but those holiday authors writ for pleasure and only showed us what they could have done if they would have taken pains to perform the whole  be pleased my lord to accept with your wonted goodness this unworthy present which i make you  i have taken off one trouble from you of defending it by acknowledging its imperfections and though some part of them are covered in the verse as ericthonius rode always in a chariot to hide his lameness such of them as cannot be concealed you will please to connive at though in the strictness of your judgment you cannot pardon  if homer was allowed to nod sometimes in so long a work it will be no wonder if i often fall asleep  you took my aurengzebe into your protection with all his faults and i hope here cannot be so many because i translate an author who gives me such examples of correctness  what my jury may be i know not but it is good for a criminal to plead before a favourable judge  if i had said partial would your lordship have forgiven me  or will you give me leave to acquaint the world that i have many times been obliged to your bounty since the revolution though i never was reduced to beg a charity nor ever had the impudence to ask one either of your lordship or your noble kinsman the earl of dorset much less of any other yet when i least expected it you have both remembered me so inherent it is in your family not to forget an old servant  it looks rather like ingratitude on my part that where i have been so often obliged i have appeared so seldom to return my thanks and where i was also so sure of being well received  somewhat of laziness was in the case and somewhat too of modesty but nothing of disrespect or of unthankfulness  i will not say that your lordship has encouraged me to this presumption lest if my labours meet with no success in public i may expose your judgment to be censured  as for my own enemies i shall never think them worth an answer and if your lordship has any they will not dare to arraign you for want of knowledge in this art till they can produce somewhat better of their own than your essay on poetry  it was on this consideration that i have drawn out my preface to so great a length  had i not addressed to a poet and a critic of the first magnitude i had myself been taxed for want of judgment and shamed my patron for want of understanding  but neither will you my lord so soon be tired as any other because the discourse is on your art neither will the learned reader think it tedious because it is ad clerum at least when he begins to be weary the church doors are open that i may pursue the allegory with a short prayer after a long sermon  may you live happily and long for the service of your country the encouragement of good letters and the ornament of poetry which cannot be wished more earnestly by any man than by  your lordships most humble most obliged and most obedient servant john dryden    postscript    what virgil wrote in the vigour of his age in plenty and at ease i have undertaken to translate in my declining years struggling with wants oppressed by sickness curbed in my genius liable to be misconstrued in all i write and my judges if they are not very equitable already prejudiced against me by the lying character which has been given them of my morals  yet steady to my principles and not dispirited with my afflictions i have by the blessing of god on my endeavours overcome all difficulties and in some measure acquitted myself of the debt which i owed the public when i undertook this work  in the first place therefore i thankfully acknowledge to the almighty power the assistance he has given me in the beginning the prosecution and conclusion of my present studies which are more happily performed than i could have promised to myself when i laboured under such discouragements  for what i have done imperfect as it is for want of health and leisure to correct it will be judged in afterages and possibly in the present to be no dishonour to my native country whose language and poetry would be more esteemed abroad if they were better understood somewhat give me leave to say i have added to both of them in the choice of words and harmony of numbers which were wanting especially the last in all our poets even in those who being endued with genius yet have not cultivated their mothertongue with sufficient care or relying on the beauty of their thoughts have judged the ornament of words and sweetness of sound unnecessary one is for raking in chaucer our english ennius for antiquated words which are never to be revived but when sound or significancy is wanting in the present language  but many of his deserve not this redemption any more than the crowds of men who daily die or are slain for sixpence in a battle merit to be restored to life if a wish could revive them  others have no ear for verse nor choice of words nor distinction of thoughts but mingle farthings with their gold to make up the sum  here is a field of satire opened to me but since the revolution i have wholly renounced that talent for who would give physic to the great when he is uncalled to do his patient no good and endanger himself for his prescription neither am i ignorant but i may justly be condemned for many of these faults of which i have too liberally arraigned others   cynthius aurem vellit et admonuit   it is enough for me if the government will let me pass unquestioned in the meantime i am obliged in gratitude to return my thanks to many of them who have not only distinguished me from others of the same party by a particular exception of grace but without considering the man have been bountiful to the poet have encouraged virgil to speak such english as i could teach him and rewarded his interpreter for the pains he has taken in bringing him over into britain by defraying the charges of his voyage  even cerberus when he had received the sop permitted aeneas to pass freely to elysium had it been offered me and i had refused it yet still some gratitude is due to such who were willing to oblige me  but how much more to those from whom i have received the favours which they have offered to one of a different persuasion amongst whom i cannot omit naming the earls of derby and of peterborough  to the first of these i have not the honour to be known and therefore his liberality was as much unexpected as it was undeserved  the present earl of peterborough has been pleased long since to accept the tenders of my service  his favours are so frequent to me that i receive them almost by prescription  no difference of interests or opinion has been able to withdraw his protection from me and i might justly be condemned for the most unthankful of mankind if i did not always preserve for him a most profound respect and inviolable gratitude  i must also add that if the last aeneid shine amongst its fellows it is owing to the commands of sir william trumbull one of the principal secretaries of state who recommended it as his favourite to my care and for his sake particularly i have made it mine  for who would confess weariness when he enjoined a fresh labour  i could not but invoke the assistance of a muse for this last office   extremum hunc arethusa       neget quis carmina gallo   neither am i to forget the noble present which was made me by gilbert dolben esq the worthy son of the late archbishop of york who when i began this work enriched me with all the several editions of virgil and all the commentaries of those editions in latin amongst which i could not but prefer the dauphins as the last the shortest and the most judicious  fabrini i had also sent me from italy but either he understands virgil very imperfectly or i have no knowledge of my author  being invited by that worthy gentleman sir william bowyer to denham court i translated the first georgic at his house and the greatest part of the last aeneid  a more friendly entertainment no man ever found  no wonder therefore if both these versions surpass the rest and own the satisfaction i received in his converse with whom i had the honour to be bred in cambridge and in the same college  the seventh aeneid was made english at burghley the magnificent abode of the earl of exeter  in a village belonging to his family i was born and under his roof i endeavoured to make that aeneid appear in english with as much lustre as i could though my author has not given the finishing strokes either to it or to the eleventh as i perhaps could prove in both if i durst presume to criticise my master  by a letter from william walsh esq of abberley who has so long honoured me with his friendship and who without flattery is the best critic of our nation i have been informed that his grace the duke of shrewsbury has procured a printed copy of the pastorals georgics and six first aeneids from my bookseller and has read them in the country together with my friend  this noble person having been pleased to give them a commendation which i presume not to insert has made me vain enough to boast of so great a favour and to think i have succeeded beyond my hopes the character of his excellent judgment the acuteness of his wit and his general knowledge of good letters being known as well to all the world as the sweetness of his disposition his humanity his easiness of access and desire of obliging those who stand in need of his protection are known to all who have approached him and to me in particular who have formerly had the honour of his conversation whoever has given the world the translation of part of the third georgic which he calls the power of love has put me to sufficient pains to make my own not inferior to his as my lord roscommons silenus had formerly given me the same trouble  the most ingenious mr addison of oxford has also been as troublesome to me as the other two and on the same account after his bees my latter swarm is scarcely worth the hiving  mr cowleys praise of a country life is excellent but it is rather an imitation of virgil than a version  that i have recovered in some measure the health which i had lost by too much application to this work is owing next to gods mercy to the skill and care of dr guibbons and dr hobbs the two ornaments of their profession whom i can only pay by this acknowledgment  the whole faculty has always been ready to oblige me and the only one of them who endeavoured to defame me had it not in his power  i desire pardon from my readers for saying so much in relation to myself which concerns not them and with my acknowledgments to all my subscribers have only to add that the few notes which follow are par maniere dacquit because i had obliged myself by articles to do somewhat of that kind  these scattering observations are rather guesses at my authors meaning in some passages than proofs that so he meant  the unlearned may have recourse to any poetical dictionary in english for the names of persons places or fables which the learned need not but that little which i say is either new or necessary and the first of these qualifications never fails to invite a reader if not to please him
