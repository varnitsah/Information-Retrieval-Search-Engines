60066193	odd craft  by ww jacobs    establishing relations  mr richard catesby second officer of the ss wizard emerged from the dockgates in high goodhumour to spend an evening ashore  the bustle of the day had departed and the inhabitants of wapping in search of coolness and fresh air were sitting at open doors and windows indulging in general conversation with anybody within earshot  illustration mr richard catesby second officer of the ss wizard emerged from the dockgates in high goodhumour  mr catesby turning into bashfords lane lost in a moment all this life and colour  the hum of distant voices certainly reached there but that was all for bashfords lane a retiring thoroughfare facing a blank dock wall capped here and there by towering spars set an example of gentility which neighbouring streets had long ago decided crossly was impossible for ordinary people to follow  its neatly grained shutters fastened back by the sides of the windows gave a pleasing idea of uniformity while its white steps and polished brass knockers were suggestive of almost a dutch cleanliness  mr catesby strolling comfortably along stopped suddenly for another look at a girl who was standing in the groundfloor window of no 5  he went on a few paces and then walked back slowly trying to look as though he had forgotten something  the girl was still there and met his ardent glances unmoved a fine girl with large dark eyes and a complexion which was the subject of much scandalous discussion among neighbouring matrons  it must be something wrong with the glass or else its the bad light said mr catesby to himself no girl is so beautiful as that  he went by again to make sure  the object of his solicitude was still there and apparently unconscious of his existence  he passed very slowly and sighed deeply  youve got it at last dick catesby he said solemnly fair and square in the most dangerous part of the heart  its serious this time  he stood still on the narrow pavement pondering and then in excuse of his flagrant misbehaviour murmured it was meant to be and went by again  this time he fancied that he detected a somewhat supercilious expression in the dark eyesa faint raising of wellarched eyebrows  his engagement to wait at aldgate station for the secondengineer and spend an evening together was dismissed as too slow to be considered  he stood for some time in uncertainty and then turning slowly into the beehive which stood at the corner went into the private bar and ordered a glass of beer  he was the only person in the bar and the landlord a stout man in his shirtsleeves was the soul of affability  mr catesby after various general remarks made a few inquiries about an uncle aged five minutes whom he thought was living in bashfords lane  illustration mr catesby made a few inquiries  i dont know im said the landlord  i had an idea that he lived at no 5 said catesby  the landlord shook his head  thats mrs truefitts house he said slowly  mr catesby pondered  truefitt truefitt he repeated what sort of a woman is she  widderwoman said the landlord she lives there with er daughter prudence  mr catesby said indeed and being a good listener learned that mrs truefitt was the widow of a masterlighterman and that her son fred truefitt after an absence of seven years in new zealand was now on his way home  he finished his glass slowly and the landlord departing to attend to another customer made his way into the street again  he walked along slowly picturing as he went the homecorning of the longabsent son  things were oddly ordered in this world and fred truefitt would probably think nothing of his brotherly privileges  he wondered whether he was like prudence  he wondered  by jove ill do it  he said recklessly as he turned  now for a row  he walked back rapidly to bashfords lane and without giving his courage time to cool plied the knocker of no 5 briskly  the door was opened by an elderly woman thin and somewhat querulous in expression  mr catesby had just time to notice this and then he flung his arm round her waist and hailing her as mother saluted her warmly  the faint scream of the astounded mrs truefitt brought her daughter hastily into the passage  mr catesbys idea was ever to do a thing thoroughly and relinquishing mrs truefitt he kissed prudence with all the ardour which a sevenyears absence might be supposed to engender in the heart of a devoted brother  in return he received a box on the ears which made his head ring  hes been drinking gasped the dismayed mrs truefitt  dont you know me mother  inquired mr richard catesby in grievous astonishment  hes mad said her daughter  am i so altered that you dont know me prudence  inquired mr catesby with pathos  dont you know your fred  go out said mrs truefitt recovering go out at once  mr catesby looked from one to the other in consternation  i know ive altered he said at last but id no idea  if you dont go out at once ill send for the police said the elder woman sharply  prudence scream  im not going to scream said prudence eyeing the intruder with great composure  im not afraid of him  despite her reluctance to have a scenea thing which was strongly opposed to the traditions of bashfords lanemrs truefitt had got as far as the doorstep in search of assistance when a sudden terrible thought occurred to her fred was dead and the visitor had hit upon this extraordinary fashion of breaking the news gently  come into the parlour she said faintly  mr catesby suppressing his surprise followed her into the room prudence her fine figure erect and her large eyes meeting his steadily took up a position by the side of her mother  you have brought bad news inquired the latter  no mother said mr catesby simply only myself thats all  mrs truefitt made a gesture of impatience and her daughter watching him closely tried to remember something she had once read about detecting insanity by the expression of the eyes  those of mr catesby were blue and the only expression in them at the present moment was one of tender and respectful admiration  when did you see fred last  inquired mrs truefitt making another effort  mother said mr catesby with great pathos dont you know me  he has brought bad news of fred said mrs truefitt turning to her daughter i am sure he has  i dont understand you said mr catesby with a bewildered glance from one to the other  i am fred  am i much changed  you look the same as you always did and it seems only yesterday since i kissed prudence goodbye at the docks  you were crying prudence  miss truefitt made no reply she gazed at him unflinchingly and then bent toward her mother  he is mad she whispered we must try and get him out quietly  dont contradict him  keep close to me said mrs truefitt who had a great horror of the insane  if he turns violent open the window and scream  i thought he had brought bad news of fred  how did he know about him  her daughter shook her head and gazed curiously at their afflicted visitor  she put his age down at twentyfive and she could not help thinking it a pity that so goodlooking a young man should have lost his wits  bade prudence goodbye at the docks continued mr catesby dreamily you drew me behind a pile of luggage prudence and put your head on my shoulder  i have thought of it ever since  miss truefitt did not deny it but she bit her lips and shot a sharp glance at him  she began to think that her pity was uncalledfor  im just going as far as the corner  tell me all thats happened since ive been away said mr catesby  mrs truefitt turned to her daughter and whispered  it might have been merely the effect of a guilty conscience but the visitor thought that he caught the word policeman  im just going as far as the corner said mrs truefitt rising and crossing hastily to the door  illustration im just going as far as the corner said mrs truefitt  the young man nodded affectionately and sat in doubtful consideration as the front door closed behind her  where is mother going  he asked in a voice which betrayed a little pardonable anxiety  not far i hope said prudence  i really think said mr catesby risingi really think that i had better go after her  at her age  he walked into the small passage and put his hand on the latch prudence now quite certain of his sanity felt sorely reluctant to let such impudence go unpunished  are you going she inquired  i think id better said mr catesby gravely  dear mother  youre afraid said the girl calmly  mr catesby coloured and his buoyancy failed him  he felt a little bit cheap  you are brave enough with two women continued the girl disdainfully but you had better go if youre afraid  mr catesby regarded the temptress uneasily  would you like me to stay he asked  i said miss truefitt tossing her head  no i dont want you besides youre frightened  mr catesby turned and with a firm step made his way back to the room prudence with a halfsmile took a chair near the door and regarded her prisoner with unholy triumph  i shouldnt like to be in your shoes she said agreeably mother has gone for a policeman  bless her said mr catesby fervently  what had we better say to him when he comes  youll be locked up said prudence and it will serve you right for your bad behaviour  mr catesby sighed  its the heart he said gravely  im not to blame really  i saw you standing in the window and i could see at once that you were beautiful and good and kind  i never heard of such impudence continued miss truefitt  i surprised myself admitted mr catesby  in the usual way i am very quiet and wellbehaved not to say shy  miss truefitt looked at him scornfully  i think that you had better stop your nonsense and go she remarked  dont you want me to be punished inquired the other in a soft voice  i think that you had better go while you can said the girl and at that moment there was a heavy knock at the frontdoor  mr catesby despite his assurance changed colour the girl eyed him in perplexity then she opened the small foldingdoors at the back of the room  youre onlystupid she whispered  quick  go in there  ill say youve gone  keep quiet and ill let you out byandby  she pushed him in and closed the doors  from his hidingplace he heard an animated conversation at the streetdoor and minute particulars as to the time which had elapsed since his departure and the direction he had taken  i never heard such impudence said mrs truefitt going into the frontroom and sinking into a chair after the constable had taken his departure  i dont believe he was mad  only a little weak in the head i think said prudence in a clear voice  he was very frightened after you had gone i dont think he will trouble us again  hed better not said mrs truefitt sharply  i never heard of such a thingnever  she continued to grumble while prudence in a low voice endeavoured to soothe her  her efforts were evidently successful as the prisoner was after a time surprised to hear the older woman laughat first gently and then with so much enjoyment that her daughter was at some pains to restrain her  he sat in patience until evening deepened into night and a line of light beneath the foldingdoors announced the lighting of the lamp in the frontroom  by a pleasant clatter of crockery he became aware that they were at supper and he pricked up his ears as prudence made another reference to him  if he comes tomorrow night while you are out i shant open the door she said  youll be back by nine i suppose  mrs truefitt assented  and you wont be leaving before seven continued prudence  i shall be all right  mr catesbys face glowed and his eyes grew tender prudence was as clever as she was beautiful  the delicacy with which she had intimated the fact of the unconscious mrs truefitts absence on the following evening was beyond all praise  the only depressing thought was that such resourcefulness savoured of practice  he sat in the darkness for so long that even the proximity of prudence was not sufficient amends for the monotony of it and it was not until past ten oclock that the foldingdoors were opened and he stood blinking at the girl in the glare of the lamp  quick  she whispered  mr catesby stepped into the lighted room  the frontdoor is open whispered prudence  make haste  ill close it  she followed him to the door he made an ineffectual attempt to seize her hand and the next moment was pushed gently outside and the door closed behind him  he stood a moment gazing at the house and then hastened back to his ship  seven tomorrow he murmured seven tomorrow  after all theres nothing pays in this world like cheeknothing  he slept soundly that night though the things that the secondengineer said to him about wasting a hardworking mans evening would have lain heavy on the conscience of a more scrupulous man  the only thing that troubled him was the manifest intention of his friend not to let him slip through his fingers on the following evening  at last in sheer despair at his inability to shake him off he had to tell him that he had an appointment with a lady  well ill come too said the other glowering at him  its very like shell have a friend with her they generally do  ill run round and tell her said catesby  id have arranged it before only i thought you didnt care about that sort of thing  female society is softening said the secondengineer  ill go and put on a clean collar  illustration ill go and put on a clean collar  catesby watched him into his cabin and then though it still wanted an hour to seven hastily quitted the ship and secreted himself in the private bar of the beehive  he waited there until a quarter past seven and then adjusting his tie for about the tenth time that evening in the glass behind the bar sallied out in the direction of no 5  he knocked lightly and waited  there was no response and he knocked again  when the fourth knock brought no response his heart sank within him and he indulged in vain speculations as to the reasons for this unexpected hitch in the programme  he knocked again and then the door opened suddenly and prudence with a little cry of surprise and dismay backed into the passage  you  she said regarding him with large eyes  mr catesby bowed tenderly and passing in closed the door behind him  i wanted to thank you for your kindness last night he said humbly  very well said prudence goodbye  mr catesby smiled  itll take me a long time to thank you as i ought to thank you he murmured  and then i want to apologise thatll take time too  you had better go said prudence severely kindness is thrown away upon you  i ought to have let you be punished  you are too good and kind said the other drifting by easy stages into the parlour  miss truefitt made no reply but following him into the room seated herself in an easychair and sat coldly watchful  how do you know what i am she inquired  your face tells me said the infatuated richard  i hope you will forgive me for my rudeness last night  it was all done on the spur of the moment  i am glad you are sorry said the girl softening  all the same if i hadnt done it pursued mr catesby i shouldnt be sitting here talking to you now  miss truefitt raised her eyes to his and then lowered them modestly to the ground  that is true she said quietly  and i would sooner be sitting here than anywhere pursued catesby that is he added rising and taking a chair by her side except here  miss truefitt appeared to tremble and made as though to rise  then she sat still and took a gentle peep at mr catesby from the corner of her eye  i hope that you are not sorry that i am here  said that gentleman  miss truefitt hesitated  no she said at last  are youare you glad asked the modest richard  miss truefitt averted her eyes altogether  yes she said faintly  a strange feeling of solemnity came over the triumphant richard  he took the hand nearest to him and pressed it gently  ii can hardly believe in my good luck he murmured  good luck said prudence innocently  isnt it good luck to hear you say that you are glad im here  said catesby  youre the best judge of that said the girl withdrawing her hand it doesnt seem to me much to be pleased about  mr catesby eyed her in perplexity and was about to address another tender remark to her when she was overcome by a slight fit of coughing at the same moment he started at the sound of a shuffling footstep in the passage  somebody tapped at the door  yes said prudence  cant find the knifepowder miss said a harsh voice  the door was pushed open and disclosed a tall bony woman of about forty  her red arms were bare to the elbow and she betrayed several evidences of a long and arduous days charing  its in the cupboard said prudence  why whats the matter mrs porter  mrs porter made no reply  her mouth was wide open and she was gazing with starting eyeballs at mr catesby  joe she said in a hoarse whisper  joe  mr catesby gazed at her in chilling silence  miss truefitt with an air of great surprise glanced from one to the other  joe said mrs porter again  aint you goin to speak to me  mr catesby continued to gaze at her in speechless astonishment  she skipped clumsily round the table and stood before him with her hands clasped  where ave you been all this long time  she demanded in a higher key  youyouve made a mistake said the bewildered richard  mistake  wailed mrs porter  mistake  oh wheres your art  before he could get out of her way she flung her arms round the horrified young mans neck and embraced him copiously  over her bony left shoulder the frantic richard met the ecstatic gaze of miss truefitt and in a flash he realised the trap into which he had fallen  mrs porter said prudence  its my usband miss said the amazon reluctantly releasing the flushed and dishevelled richard e left me and my five eighteen months ago  for eighteen months i avent ad a sight of is blessed face  she lifted the hem of her apron to her face and broke into discordant weeping  dont cry said prudence softly im sure he isnt worth it  mr catesby looked at her wanly  he was beyond further astonishment and when mrs truefitt entered the room with a laudable attempt to twist her features into an expression of surprise he scarcely noticed her  its my joe said mrs porter simply  good gracious said mrs truefitt  well youve got him now take care he doesnt run away from you again  ill look after that maam said mrs porter with a glare at the startled richard  illustration ill look after that maam  shes very forgiving said prudence  she kissed him just now  did she though said the admiring mrs truefitt  i wish id been here  i can do it agin maam said the obliging mrs porter  if you come near me again said the breathless richard stepping back a pace  i shouldnt force his love said mrs truefitt itll come back in time i dare say  im sure hes affectionate said prudence  mr catesby eyed his tormentors in silence the faces of prudence and her mother betokened much innocent enjoyment but the austerity of mrs porters visage was unrelaxed  better let bygones be bygones said mrs truefitt hell be sorry byandby for all the trouble he has caused  hell be ashamed of himselfif you give him time added prudence  mr catesby had heard enough he took up his hat and crossed to the door  take care he doesnt run away from you again repeated mrs truefitt  ill see to that maam said mrs porter taking him by the arm come along joe  mr catesby attempted to shake her off but in vain and he ground his teeth as he realised the absurdity of his position  a man he could have dealt with but mrs porter was invulnerable  sooner than walk down the road with her he preferred the sallies of the parlour  he walked back to his old position by the fireplace and stood gazing moodily at the floor  mrs truefitt tired of the sport at last  she wanted her supper and with a significant glance at her daughter she beckoned the redoubtable and reluctant mrs porter from the room  catesby heard the kitchendoor close behind them but he made no move  prudence stood gazing at him in silence  if you want to go she said at last now is your chance  catesby followed her into the passage without a word and waited quietly while she opened the door  still silent he put on his hat and passed out into the darkening street  he turned after a short distance for a last look at the house and with a sudden sense of elation saw that she was standing on the step  he hesitated and then walked slowly back  yes  said prudence  i should like to tell your mother that i am sorry he said in a low voice  it is getting late said the girl softly but if you really wish to tell hermrs porter will not be here tomorrow night  she stepped back into the house and the door closed behind her
