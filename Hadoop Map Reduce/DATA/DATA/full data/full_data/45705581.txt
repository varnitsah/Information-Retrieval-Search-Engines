just then put his hands over his ears  happy jack tried every trick he knew to get away from shadow the weasel  did you find out anything asked happy jack eagerly  it wasnt long before shadow began to receive many visitors     happy jack     chapter i  happy jack drops a nut      save a little every day     and for the future put away      happy jack   happy jack squirrel sat on the tip of one of the highest branches of a big hickory tree happy jack was up very early that morning in fact jolly round red mr sun was still in his bed behind the purple hills when happy jack hopped briskly out of bed he washed himself thoroughly and was ready for business by the time mr sun began his climb up in the blue blue sky  you see happy jack had found that big hickory tree just loaded with nuts all ripe and ready to gather he was quite sure that no one else had found that special tree and he wanted to get all the nuts before any one else found out about them so he was all ready and off he raced to the big tree just as soon as it was light enough to see      the nuts that grow in the hickory tree     theyre all for me theyre all for me  happy jack was humming that little song as he rested for a few minutes way up in the top of the tree and wondered if his storehouse would hold all these big fat nuts just then he heard a great scolding a little way over in the green forest happy jack stopped humming and listened he knew that voice it was his cousins voicethe voice of chatterer the red squirrel happy jack frowned i hope he wont come over this way muttered happy jack he does not love his cousin chatterer anyway and then there was the big tree full of hickory nuts he didnt want chatterer to find that  i am afraid that happy jack was selfish there were more nuts than he could possibly eat in one winter and yet he wasnt willing that his cousin chatterer the red squirrel should have a single one now chatterer is shorttempered and a great scold some one or something had upset him this morning and he was scolding as fast as his tongue could go as he came running right towards the tree in which happy jack was sitting happy jack sat perfectly still and watched he didnt move so much as the tip of his big gray tail would chatterer go past and not see that big tree full of nuts it looked very much as if he would for he was so busy scolding that he wasnt paying much attention to other things  happy jack smiled as chatterer came running under the tree without once looking up he was so tickled that he started to hug himself and didnt remember that he was holding a big fat nut in his hands of course he dropped it where do you think it went well sir it fell straight down from the top of that tall tree and it landed right on the head of chatterer the red squirrel  my stars cried chatterer stopping his scolding and his running together and rubbing his head where the nut had hit him then he looked up to see where it had come from of course he looked straight up at happy jack  you did that purposely screamed chatterer his short temper flaring up  i didnt snapped happy jack  you did  i didnt  oh dear oh dear such a sight two little squirrels one in a gray suit and one in a red suit contradicting each other and calling names it was such a sad sad sight for you know they were cousins     chapter ii  the quarrel      its up to you and up to me     to see how thrifty we can be     to do our bit like soldiers true     its up to me and up to you      happy jack   two angry little people were making a dreadful noise in the green forest it was a beautiful morning a very beautiful fall morning but all the beauty of it was being spoiled by the dreadful noise these two little people you see they were quarreling yes sir they were quarreling and it wasnt at all nice to see or nice to hear  you know who they were one was happy jack squirrel who wears a coat of gray and the other was chatterer the red squirrel who always wears a red coat with vest of white when happy jack had dropped that nut from the tiptop of the tall hickory tree and it had landed right on top of chatterers head it really had been an accident all the time happy jack had been sitting as still as still could be hoping that his cousin chatterer would pass by without looking up and so seeing the big fat nuts in the top of that tree you see happy jack was greedy and wanted all of them himself now chatterer the red squirrel has a sharp temper and also he has sharp eyes all the time he was scolding happy jack and calling him names chatterers bright eyes were taking note of all those big fat hickorynuts and his mouth began to water without wasting any more time he started up the tree to get some  happy jack grew very angry very angry indeed he hurried down to meet chatterer the red squirrel and to prevent him climbing the tree  you keep out of this tree its mine he shrieked  no such thing you dont own the tree and ive got just as much right here as you have screamed chatterer dodging around to the other side of the tree  tis too mine i found it first shouted happy jack youre a thief so there  im not  you are  youre a pig happy jack youre just a great big pig  im not a pig i found these nuts first and i tell you theyre mine shrieked happy jack so angry that every time he spoke he jerked his tail and all the time he was chasing round and round the trunk of the tree trying to prevent chatterer getting up  now happy jack is ever so much bigger than his cousin chatterer but he isnt as spry so in spite of him chatterer got past and like a little red flash was up in the top of the tree where the big fat nuts were but he didnt have time to pick even one for after him came happy jack so angry that chatterer knew that he would fare badly if happy jack should catch him round and round over and across this way and that way in the top of the tall hickory tree raced chatterer the red squirrel with his cousin happy jack the gray squirrel right at his heels and calling him everything bad to be thought of yes indeed it was truly dreadful and peter rabbit who happened along just then put his hands over his ears so as not to hear such a dreadful quarrel  illustration peter rabbit who happened along just then put his hands over his ears     chapter iii  striped chipmunk is kept very busy  i prefer big acorns but i never refuse little ones they fit in between  happy jack   striped chipmunk was sitting just inside a hollow log studying about how he could fill up his new storehouse for the winter striped chipmunk is very thrifty he likes to play and he is one of the merriest of all the little people who live on the green meadows or in the green forest he lives right on the edge of both and knows everybody and everybody knows him almost every morning the merry little breezes of old mother west wind hurry over to have a frolic with him the very first thing but though he dearly loves to play he never lets play interfere with work whatever he does be it play or work he does with all his might      i love the sun i love the rain        i love to work i love to play     whatever it may bring to me        i love each minute of each day  so said striped chipmunk as he sat in the hollow log and studied how he could fill that splendid big new storehouse pretty soon he pricked up his funny little ears what was all that noise over in the green forest striped chipmunk peeped out of the hollow log over in the top of a tall hickory tree a terrible fuss was going on striped chipmunk listened he heard angry voices such angry voices they were the voices of his big cousins happy jack the gray squirrel and chatterer the red squirrel  dear me dear me how those two do quarrel i must go over and see what it is all about thought striped chipmunk  so with a flirt of his funny little tail he scampered out of the hollow log and over to the tall hickory tree he knew all about that tree many many times he had looked up at the big fat nuts in the top of it watching them grow bigger and fatter and hoping that when they grew ripe old mother west wind would find time to shake them down to him you know striped chipmunk is not much of a climber and so he cannot go up and pick the nuts as do his big cousins happy jack and chatterer  when he reached the tall hickory tree what do you think was happening why those big fat nuts were rattling down to the ground on every side just as if old mother west wind was shaking the tree as hard as she could but old mother west wind wasnt there at all no sir there wasnt even one of the merry little breezes up in the treetops the big fat nuts were rattling down just on account of the dreadful quarrel of striped chipmunks two foolish cousins happy jack and chatterer  it was all because happy jack was greedy chatterer had climbed the tree and now happy jack who is bigger but not so spry was chasing chatterer round and round and over the treetop and both were so angry that they didnt once notice that they were knocking down the very nuts over which they were quarreling  striped chipmunk didnt stop to listen to the quarrel no siree he stuffed a big fat nut in each pocket in his cheeks and scampered back to his splendid new storehouse as fast as his little legs would take him back and forth back and forth scampered striped chipmunk and all the time he was laughing inside and hoping his big cousins would keep right on quarreling     chapter iv  happy jack and chatterer feel foolish      if you get and spend a penny     then of course you havent any     be like mea happy jack     and put it where youll get it back      happy jack   happy jack and chatterer were out of breath happy jack was puffing and blowing for he is big and fat and it is not so easy for him to race about in the treetops as it is for his smaller slim nimble cousin chatterer so happy jack was the first to stop he sat on a branch way up in the top of the tall hickory tree and glared across at chatterer who sat on a branch on the other side of the tall tree  couldnt catch me could you smarty taunted chatterer  you just wait until i do ill make you sorry you ever came near my hickory tree snapped happy jack  im waiting besides it isnt your tree any more than its mine replied chatterer and made a face at happy jack  happy jack hopped up as if he meant to begin the chase again but he had a pain in his side from running so hard and so long and so he sat down again right down in his heart happy jack knew that chatterer was right that the tree didnt belong to him any more than to his cousin but when he thought of all those big fat nuts with which the tall hickory tree had been loaded greedy thoughts chased out all thoughts of right and he said to himself again as he had said when he first saw his cousin that chatterer shouldnt have one of them he stopped scolding long enough to steal a look at them and thenwhat do you think happy jack did why he gave such a jump of surprise that he nearly lost his balance not a nut was to be seen happy jack blinked then he rubbed his eyes and looked again he couldnt see a nut anywhere  there were the husks in which the nuts had grown big and fat until they were ripe but now every husk was empty chatterer saw the queer look on happy jacks face and he looked too now chatterer the red squirrel had very quick wits and he guessed right away what had happened he knew that while they had been quarreling and racing over the top of the tall hickory tree they must have knocked down all the nuts which were just ready to fall anyway like a little red flash chatterer started down the tree then happy jack guessed too and down he started as fast as he could go crying stop thief all the way  when he reached the ground there was chatterer scurrying around and poking under the fallen leaves but he hadnt found a single nut happy jack couldnt stop to quarrel any more because you see he was afraid that chatterer would find the biggest and fattest nuts so he began to scurry around and hunt too it was queer very queer how those nuts could have hidden so they hunted and hunted but no nuts were to be found then they stopped and stared up at the top of the tall hickory tree not a nut could they see then they stared at each other and gradually a foolish a very foolish look crept over each face  wherewhere do you suppose they have gone asked happy jack in a queersounding voice  just then they heard some one laughing fit to kill himself it was peter rabbit  did you take our hickory nuts they both shouted angrily  no replied peter no i didnt take them though they were not yours anyway and then he went off into another fit of laughter for peter had seen striped chipmunk very hard at work taking away those very nuts while his two big cousins had been quarreling in the treetop     chapter v  happy jack suspects striped chipmunk  thrift is one test of true loyalty to your country  happy jack   happy jack didnt look happy a bit indeed happy jack looked very unhappy you see he looked just as he felt he had set his heart on having all the big fat nuts that he had found in the top of that tall hickory tree and now instead of having all of them he hadnt any of them worse still he knew right down in his heart that it was his own fault he had been too greedy but what had become of those nuts  happy jack was studying about this as he sat with his back against a big chestnut tree he remembered how hard peter rabbit had laughed when happy jack and his cousin chatterer the red squirrel had been so surprised because they could not find the nuts they had knocked down peter hadnt taken them for peter has no use for them but he must know what had become of them for he was still laughing as he had gone off down the lone little path while he was thinking of all this happy jacks bright eyes had been wide open as they usually are so that no danger should come near suddenly they saw something moving among the brownandyellow leaves on the ground happy jack looked sharply and then a sudden thought popped into his head  hi there cousin chipmunk he shouted  hi there your own self replied striped chipmunk for it was he  what are you doing down there asked happy jack  looking for hickory nuts replied striped chipmunk and his eyes twinkled as he said it for there wasnt a hickory tree near  happy jack looked hard at striped chipmunk for that sudden thought which had popped into his head when he first saw striped chipmunk was growing into a strong a very strong suspicion that striped chipmunk knew something about those lost hickory nuts but striped chipmunk looked back at him so innocently that happy jack didnt know just what to think  have you begun to fill your storehouse for winter yet inquired happy jack  of course i have i dont mean to let jack frost catch me with an empty storehouse replied striped chipmunk      when leaves turn yellow brown and red       and nuts come pitter patter down     when days are short and swiftly sped       and autumn wears her colored gown     im up before old mr sun       his nightcap has a chance to doff     and have my days work well begun       when others kick their bedclothes off  what are you filling your storehouse with asked happy jack trying not to show too much interest  corn nice ripe yellow corn and seeds and acorns and chestnuts answered striped chipmunk and now im looking for some big fat hickory nuts he added and his bright eyes twinkled have you seen any happy jack  happy jack said that he hadnt seen any and striped chipmunk remarked that he couldnt waste any more time talking and scurried away happy jack watched him go a puzzled little frown puckering up his brows  i believe he knows something about those nuts i think ill follow him and have a peep into his storehouse he muttered     chapter vi  happy jack spies on striped chipmunk  its more important to mind your own affairs than to know what your neighbors are doing but not nearly so interesting  happy jack   striped chipmunk was whisking about among the brownandyellow leaves that covered the ground on the edge of the green forest he is such a little fellow that he looked almost like a brown leaf himself and when one of old mother west winds merry little breezes whirled the brown leaves in a mad little dance around him it was the hardest work in the world to see striped chipmunk at all anyway happy jack squirrel found it so  you see happy jack was spying on striped chipmunk yes sir happy jack was spying spying you know is secretly watching other people and trying to find out what they are doing it isnt a nice thing to do not a bit nice happy jack knew it and all the time he was doing it he was feeling very much ashamed of himself but he said to himself that he just had to know where striped chipmunks storehouse was because he just had to peep inside and find out if it held any of the big fat hickory nuts that had disappeared from under the tall hickory tree while he was quarreling up in the top of it with his cousin chatterer the red squirrel  but spying on striped chipmunk isnt the easiest thing in the world happy jack was finding it the hardest work he had ever undertaken striped chipmunk is so spry and whisks about so that you need eyes all around your head to keep track of him happy jack found that his two eyes bright and quick as they are couldnt keep that little elf of a cousin of his always in sight every few minutes he would disappear and then bob up again in the most unexpected place and most provoking way      now im here and now im there     now i am not anywhere     watch me now for here i go     out of sight i told you so  with the last words striped chipmunk was nowhere to be seen it seemed as if the earth must have opened and swallowed him but it hadnt for two minutes later happy jack saw him flirting his funny little tail in the sauciest way as he scampered along an old log  happy jack began to suspect that striped chipmunk was just having fun with him what else could he mean by saying such things and yet happy jack was sure that striped chipmunk hadnt seen him for all the time he was watching happy jack had taken the greatest care to keep hidden himself no it couldnt be it just couldnt be that striped chipmunk knew that he was anywhere about he would just be patient a little longer and he would surely see that smart little cousin of his go to his storehouse so happy jack waited and watched     chapter vii  striped chipmunk has fun with happy jack  thrift is the meat in the nut of success  happy jack   striped chipmunk would shout in his shrillest voice      hipperty hopperty one two three     what do you think becomes of me  then he would vanish from sight all in the wink of an eye you couldnt tell where he went to at least happy jack couldnt and his eyes are sharper than yours or mine happy jack was spying you remember he was watching striped chipmunk without letting striped chipmunk know it at least he thought he was but really he wasnt those sharp twinkling eyes of striped chipmunk see everything you know he is such a very little fellow that he has to be very wideawake to keep out of danger  and he is wideawake oh my yes indeed when he is awake and that is every minute of the daytime he is the most wideawake little fellow you ever did see he had seen happy jack the very first thing and he had guessed right away that happy jack was spying on him so as to find out if he had any of the big fat hickory nuts now striped chipmunk had all of those fat hickory nuts safely hidden in his splendid new storehouse but he didnt intend to let happy jack know it so he just pretended not to see happy jack or to know that he was anywhere near but acted as if he was just going about his own business really he was just having the best time ever fooling happy jack      the corn is ripe the nuts do fall       acorns are sweet and plump     i soon will have my storehouse full       inside the hollow stump  striped chipmunk sang this just as if no one was anywhere near and he was singing just for joy of course happy jack heard it and he grinned  so your storehouse is in a hollow stump my smart little cousin said happy jack to himself if thats the case ill soon find it  striped chipmunk scurried along and now he took pains to always keep in sight happy jack followed hiding behind the trees pretty soon striped chipmunk picked up a plump acorn and put it in the pocket of his right cheek then he picked up another and put that in the pocket in his left cheek then he crowded another into each and his face was swelled so that you would hardly have guessed that it was striped chipmunk if you had chanced to meet him my my he was a funny sight happy jack grinned again as he watched partly because striped chipmunk looked so funny and partly because he knew that if striped chipmunk was going to eat the acorns right away he wouldnt stuff them into the pockets in his cheeks but he had done this very thing and so he must be going to take them to his storehouse  off scampered striped chipmunk and after him stole happy jack his eyes shining with excitement pretty soon he saw an old stump which looked as if it must be hollow happy jack grinned more than ever as he carefully hid himself and watched striped chipmunk scrambled up on the old stump looked this way and that way as if to be sure that no one was watching him then with a flirt of his funny little tail he darted into a little round doorway he was gone a long time but by and by out he popped looked this way and that way and then scampered off in the direction from which he had come happy jack didnt try to follow him he waited until he was sure that striped chipmunk was out of sight and hearing and then he walked over to the old stump  its his storehouse fast enough said happy jack     chapter viii  happy jack turns burglar      as trees from little acorns so     great sums from little pennies grow      happy jack   happy jack squirrel stood in front of the old stump into which he had seen striped chipmunk go with the pockets in his cheeks full of acorns and out of which he had come with the pockets of his cheeks quite empty  it certainly is his storehouse and now ill find out if he is the one who got all those big fat hickory nuts muttered happy jack  first he looked this way and then he looked that way to be sure that no one saw him for what he was planning to do was a very dreadful thing and he knew it happy jack was going to turn burglar a burglar you know is one who breaks into anothers house or barn to steal which is a very very dreadful thing to do yet this is just what happy jack squirrel was planning to do he was going to get into that old stump and if those big fat hickory nuts were there as he was sure they were he was going to take them he tried very hard to make himself believe that it wouldnt be stealing he had watched those nuts in the top of the tall hickory tree so long that he had grown to think that they belonged to him of course they didnt but he had made himself think they did  happy jack walked all around the old stump and then he climbed up on top of it there was only one doorway and that was the little round hole through which striped chipmunk had entered and then come out it was too small for happy jack to even get his head through though his cousin chatterer the red squirrel who is much smaller could have slipped in easily happy jack sniffed and sniffed he could smell nuts and corn and other good things my how good they did smell his eyes shone greedily  happy jack took one more hasty look around to see that no one was watching then with his long sharp teeth he began to make the doorway larger the wood was tough but happy jack worked with might and main for he wanted to get those nuts and get away before striped chipmunk should return or any one else should happen along and see him soon the hole was big enough for him to get his head inside it was a storehouse sure enough happy jack worked harder than ever and soon the hole was large enough for him to get wholly inside  what a sight there was corn and there were chestnuts and acorns and there were a few hickory nuts though these did not look so big and fat as the ones happy jack was looking for happy jack chuckled to himself a wicked greedy chuckle as he looked and then something happened  oh oh stop it leave me alone yelled happy jack     chapter ix  happy jack squirrels sad mistake  a squirrel always is thrifty be as wise as a squirrel  happy jack   let me go let me go yelled happy jack as he backed out of the hollow stump faster than he had gone in a great deal faster can you guess why ill tell you it was because he was being pulled out yes sir happy jack squirrel was being pulled out by his big bushy tail  happy jack was more frightened than hurt to be sure it is not at all comfortable to have ones tail pulled but happy jack wouldnt have minded this so much had it not been so unexpected or if he could have seen who was pulling it and then right inside happy jack didnt feel a bit good why well because he was doing a dreadful thing and he knew that it was a dreadful thing he had broken into somebodys storehouse to steal he was sure that it was striped chipmunks storehouse and he wouldnt admit to himself that he was going to steal actually steal but all the time right down deep in his heart he knew that if he took any of those hickory nuts it would be stealing  but happy jack had been careless when he had made the doorway big enough for him to crawl inside he had left his tail hanging outside some one had very very softly stolen up and grabbed it and begun to pull it was so sudden and unexpected that happy jack yelled with fright when he could get his wits together he thought of course striped chipmunk had come back and was pulling his tail when he thought that he got over his fright right away for striped chipmunk is such a little fellow that happy jack knew that he had nothing to fear from him  so as fast as he could happy jack backed out of the hole and whirled around of course he expected to face a very angry little chipmunk but he didnt no sir he didnt instead he looked right into the angry face of his other cousin chatterer the red squirrel and chatterer was angry oh my my how angry chatterer was for a minute he couldnt find his voice because his anger fairly choked him and when he did how his tongue did fly  you thief you robber what are you doing in my storehouse he shrieked  happy jack backed away hurriedly for though he is much bigger than chatterer he has a very wholesome respect for chatterers sharp teeth and when he is very angry chatterer is a great fighter  ii didnt know it was your storehouse said happy jack backing away still further  it doesnt make any difference if you didnt youre a thief just the same screamed chatterer and rushed at happy jack and what do you think happy jack did why he just turned tail and ran chatterer after him crying thief robber coward at the top of his lungs so that every one in the green forest could hear     chapter x  striped chipmunks happy thought      waste seems to me a dreadful sin     it works to lose and not to win      thrift will win it cannot lose     between them tis for you to choose      happy jack   striped chipmunk sat on a mossy old log laughing until his sides ached ha ha ha ho ho ho oh dear oh dear ho ho ho ho ho laughed striped chipmunk holding his sides over in the green forest he could still hear chatterer the red squirrel crying thief robber as he chased his big cousin happy jack and every time he heard it striped chipmunk laughed harder  you see striped chipmunk had known all the time that happy jack was spying on him and he had had no end of fun fooling happy jack by suddenly disappearing and then bobbing into view he had known that happy jack was following him so as to find out where his storehouse was then striped chipmunk had remembered the storehouse of chatterer the red squirrel he had filled the pockets in his cheeks with acorns and gone straight over to chatterers storehouse and put them inside knowing that happy jack would follow him and would think that that was his storehouse and that is just what happened  then striped chipmunk had hidden himself where he could see all that happened he had seen happy jack look all around to make sure that no one was near and then tear open the little round doorway of chatterers storehouse until it was big enough for him to squeeze through he had seen chatterer come up fly into a rage and pull happy jack out by the tail indeed he had had to clap both hands over his mouth to keep from laughing out loud then happy jack had turned tail and run away with chatterer after him shouting thief and robber at the top of his voice and this had tickled striped chipmunk still more for he knew that chatterer himself is one of the greatest thieves in the green forest so he sat on the mossy old log and laughed and laughed and laughed  finally striped chipmunk wiped the tears from his eyes and jumped up my my this will never do said he      idle hands and idle feet       never filled a storehouse yet     but instead so ive heard say       into mischief surely get  here it is almost thanksgiving and striped chipmunk stopped and scratched his head while a funny little pleased look crept into his face i wonder if happy jack and chatterer would come to a thanksgiving dinner he muttered i believe ill ask them just for fun  then striped chipmunk hurried home full of his new idea and chuckled as he planned his thanksgiving dinner of course he couldnt have it at his own house that wouldnt do at all in the first place the doorway would be altogether too small for happy jack anyway his home was a secret his very own secret and he didnt propose to let happy jack and chatterer know where it was even for a thanksgiving dinner then he thought of the big smooth mossy log he had been sitting on that very morning  the very place cried striped chipmunk and scurried away to find happy jack squirrel and chatterer the red squirrel to invite them to his thanksgiving dinner     chapter xi  striped chipmunks thanksgiving dinner      theres nothing quite so sweet in life     as making up and ending strife      happy jack   striped chipmunk jumped out of bed very early thanksgiving morning it was going to be a very busy day he had invited happy jack the gray squirrel and chatterer the red squirrel to eat thanksgiving dinner with him and each had promised to be there striped chipmunk chuckled as he thought how neither of his guests knew that the other was to be there he washed his face and hands brushed his hair and ate his breakfast then he scurried over to his splendid new storehouse which no one knew of but himself and stuffed the pockets in his cheeks with good things to eat when he couldnt stuff another thing in he scurried over to the nice mossy log on the edge of the green forest and there he emptied his pockets for that was to be his dining table  back and forth back and forth between his secret storehouse and the smooth mossy log hurried striped chipmunk he knew that happy jack and the chatterer have great appetites and he wanted to be sure that there was plenty of good things to eat and as he scurried along he sang a little song      thanksgiving comes but once a year     but when it comes it brings good cheer     for in my storehouse on this day     are piles of good things hid away     each day ive worked from early morn     to gather acorns nuts and corn     till now ive plenty and to spare     without a worry or a care     so light of heart the whole day long     ill sing a glad thanksgiving song  promptly at the dinner hour happy jack appeared coming from one direction and chatterer the red squirrel coming from another direction they didnt see each other until just as they reached striped chipmunks smooth mossy log then they stopped and scowled striped chipmunk pretended not to notice anything wrong and bustled about talking all the time as if his guests were the best of friends  on the smooth mossy log was a great pile of shining yellow corn there was another pile of plump ripe acorns and three little piles of dainty looking brown seeds but the thing that happy jack couldnt keep his eyes off was right in the middle it was a huge pile of big fat hickory nuts now who could remain illtempered and cross with such a lot of goodies spread before him certainly not happy jack or his cousin chatterer the red squirrel they just had to smile in spite of themselves and when striped chipmunk urged them to sit down and help themselves they did in three minutes they were so busy eating that they had forgotten all about their quarrel and were laughing and chatting like the best of friends  its quite a family party isnt it said striped chipmunk for you know they are all cousins  whitefoot the wood mouse happened along and striped chipmunk insisted that he should join the party later sammy jay came along and nothing would excuse him from sharing in the feast too when everybody had eaten and eaten until they couldnt hold another thing and it was time to think of going home striped chipmunk insisted that happy jack and chatterer should divide between them the big fat hickory nuts that were left and they did without once quarreling about it      thanksgiving comes but once a year     and when it comes it brings good cheer  said striped chipmunk to himself as he watched his guests depart     chapter xii  happy jack does some thinking  to call another a thief doesnt make him one  happy jack   happy jack sat up in a chestnut tree and his face was very sober the fact is happy jack was doing some very hard thinking this is so very unusual for him that sammy jay stopped to ask if he was sick you see he is naturally a happygolucky little scamp and that is one reason that he is called happy jack but this morning he was thinking and thinking hard so hard in fact that he almost lost his temper when sammy jay interrupted his thoughts with such a foolish question  what was he thinking about can you not guess why he was thinking about those big fat hickory nuts that striped chipmunk had had for his thanksgiving dinner and how striped chipmunk had given him some of them to bring home he was very sure that they were the very same nuts that he had watched grow big and fat in the top of the tall hickory tree and then had knocked down while chasing his cousin chatterer when they had reached the ground and found the nuts gone happy jack had at once suspected that striped chipmunk had taken them and now he felt sure about it  but all at once things looked very different to happy jack and the more he thought about how he had acted the more ashamed of himself he grew  there certainly must have been enough of those nuts for all of us and if i hadnt been so greedy we might all have had a share as it is ive got only those that striped chipmunk gave me and chatterer has only those that striped chipmunk gave him it must be that that sharp little cousin of mine with the striped coat has got the rest and i guess he deserves them  then all of a sudden happy jack realized how striped chipmunk had fooled him into thinking that the storehouse of chatterer was his storehouse and happy jack began to laugh the more he thought of it the harder he laughed  the joke certainly is on me he exclaimed the joke certainly is on me and it served me right hereafter ill mind my own business if i had spent half as much time looking for hickory nuts as i did looking for striped chipmunks storehouse i would be ready for winter now and chatterer couldnt call me a thief  then he laughed again as he thought how striped chipmunk must have enjoyed seeing him pulled out of chatterers storehouse by the tail  whats the joke asked bobby coon who happened along just then  ive just learned a lesson replied happy jack  what is it asked bobby  happy jack grinned as he answered      ive found that greed will never never pay     it makes one cross and ugly and it drives ones friends away     and being always selfish and always wanting more     ones very apt to lose the things that one has had before  pooh said bobby coon have you just found that out i learned that a long time ago     chapter xiii  happy jack gets a warning      it matters not how smart you are       so be it you are heedless too     it isnt what you know that counts       so much as what it is to you      happy jack   a fat gray squirrel is very tempting to a number of people in the green forest particularly in winter when getting a living is hard work almost every day reddy and granny fox stole softly through that part of the green forest where happy jack squirrel lived hoping to surprise and catch him on the ground but they never did roughleg the hawk and hooty the owl wasted a great deal of time sitting around near happy jacks home hoping to catch him when he was not watching but they never did  happy jack knew all about these big hungry neighbors and he was always on the watch for them he knew their ways and just where they would be likely to hide he took the greatest care to look into every such hiding place near at hand before he ventured down out of the trees and because these hungry neighbors are so big he never had any trouble in seeing them if they happened to be around so happy jack didnt do much worrying about them the fact is happy jack wasnt afraid of them at all for the simple reason that he knew they couldnt follow him into his hollow tree  having nuts stored away he would have been perfectly happy but for one thing yes sir there was only one thing to spoil happy jacks complete happiness and that was the fear that shadow the weasel might take it into his head to pay him a visit shadow can go through a smaller hole than happy jack can and so happy jack knew that while he was wholly safe from his other enemies he wasnt safe at all from shadow the weasel and this worried him yes sir it worried happy jack he hadnt seen or heard of shadow for a long time but he had a feeling that he was likely to turn up almost any time especially now that everything was covered with snow and ice and food was scarce and hard to get he sometimes actually wished that he wasnt as fat as he was then he would be less tempting to his hungry neighbors  but no good comes of worrying no sir not a bit of good comes of worrying and happy jack knows it  all i can do is to watch out and not be careless said he and dropped the shell of a nut on the head of reddy fox who happened to be passing under the tree in which happy jack was sitting reddy looked up and showed his teeth angrily happy jack laughed and scampered away through the treetops to another part of the green forest where he had some very secret stores of nuts  he was gone most of the day and when he started back home he was in the best of spirits for his stores had not been found by any one else he was in such good spirits that for once he quite forgot shadow the weasel he was just going to pop into his doorway without first looking inside a very foolish thing to do when he heard some one calling him he turned to see tommy tit the chickadee hurrying towards him and it was very clear that tommy was greatly excited  hello tommy tit what ails you exclaimed happy jack  dont go in there happy jack cried tommy tit shadow the weasel is in there waiting for you  happy jack turned quite pale are you sure he gasped  tommy tit nodded as if he would nod his head off i saw him go in and he hasnt come out for ive kept watch said he you better get away from here before he knows you are about  that was good advice but it was too late even as tommy tit spoke a sharp face with red angry eyes was thrust out of happy jacks doorway it was the face of shadow the weasel     chapter xiv  happy jacks run for life      a coward he who runs away       when he should stay and fight     but wise is he who knows when he       should run with all his might      happy jack   it isnt cowardly to run away when it is quite useless to stay and fight so it wasnt so cowardly of happy jack squirrel to turn tail and run the instant he caught sight of shadow the weasel no sir it wasnt cowardly at all although it might have looked so to you had you been there to see for happy jack is bigger than shadow but when it comes to a fight happy jack is no match at all for shadow the weasel and he knows it shadow is too quick for him and though happy jack were ever so brave he would have no chance at all in a fight with shadow  and so the very instant he saw the cruel face of shadow with its fierce red eyes glaring at him from his own doorway happy jack turned tail and ran yes sir that is just what he did and it was the wisest thing he could have done he hoped with a mighty hope that shadow would not follow him but he hoped in vain shadow had made up his mind to dine on squirrel and he didnt propose to see his dinner run away without trying to catch it so the instant happy jack started shadow started after him stopping only long enough to snarl an ugly threat at tommy tit the chickadee because tommy had warned happy jack that shadow was waiting for him  but tommy didnt mind that threat oh my no tommy didnt mind it at all he can fly and so he had no fear of shadow the weasel but he was terribly afraid for happy jack he knew just as happy jack knew that there wasnt a single place where happy jack could hide into which shadow could not follow him so tommy flitted from tree to tree behind happy jack hoping that in some way he might be able to help him  from tree to tree raced happy jack making desperately long leaps shadow the weasel followed and though he ran swiftly he didnt appear to be hurrying and he took no chances on those long leaps if the leap was too long to take safely shadow simply ran back down the tree across to the next one and up that it didnt worry him at all that happy jack was so far ahead that he was out of sight he knew that he could trust his nose to follow the scent of happy jack in fact it rather pleased him to have happy jack race away in such fright for in that way he would soon tire himself out  and this is just what happy jack did do he ran and jumped and jumped and ran as fast as he could until he was so out of breath that he just had to stop for a rest but he couldnt rest much he was too terribly frightened he shivered and shook while he got his breath and never for a second did he take his eyes from his back trail presently he saw a slim white form darting along the snow straight towards the tree in which he was resting once more happy jack ran and somehow he felt terribly helpless and hopeless  he had to rest oftener now and each rest was shorter than the one before because you know shadow was a less and less distance behind poor happy jack he had tried every trick he knew and not one of them had fooled shadow the weasel now he was too tired to run much farther the last little bit of hope left happy jacks heart he blinked his eyes very fast to keep back the tears as he thought that this was probably the last time he would ever look at the beautiful green forest he loved so then he gritted his teeth and made up his mind that anyway he would fight his best even if it was hopeless it was just at that very minute that he heard the voice of tommy tit the chickadee calling to him in great excitement and somehow he didnt know why a wee bit of hope sprang up in his heart     chapter xv  who saved happy jack squirrel      blessed he whose words of cheer     help put hope in place of fear      happy jack   it never has been fully decided among the little people of the green forest and the green meadows just who really did save happy jack squirrel some say that tommy tit the chickadee deserves all the credit and some say thatbut wait let me tell you just what happened and then perhaps you can decide for yourself who saved happy jack  you see it was this way happy jack had run and run and run and tried every trick he knew to get away from shadow the weasel but all in vain at last he was so out of breath and so tired that he felt that he couldnt run any more he had just made up his mind that he would wait right where he was for shadow and then put up the best fight he could even if it was hopeless when he heard tommy tit calling to him in great excitement  illustration happy jack tried every trick he knew to get away from shadow the weasel  dee dee chickadee come here quick happy jack come here quick called tommy tit  a wee bit of hope sprang up in happy jacks heart he couldnt imagine what possible help tommy tit could be but he would go see so taking a long breath he started on as fast as he could in the direction of tommys voice he couldnt run very fast because you know he was so tired but he did the best he could presently he saw tommy just ahead of him flying about in great excitement  dee dee dee there he is go to him go to him happy jack hurry hurry dee dee dee oh do hurry cried tommy tit  for just a second happy jack didnt know what he meant then he saw farmer browns boy watching tommy tit as if he didnt know what to make of the little fellows excitement  go to him go to him called tommy he wont hurt you and he wont let shadow the weasel hurt you see me see me dee dee see me and with that tommy tit flew right down on farmer browns boys hand for you know he and farmer browns boy are great friends  happy jack hesitated he knew that farmer browns boy had tried to make friends with him and every day since the ice and snow had come had put out nuts and corn for him but he couldnt quite forget the old fear of him he couldnt quite trust him so now he hesitated then he looked back shadow the weasel was only a few jumps behind him and his little eyes glowed red and savage farmer browns boy might not hurt him but shadow certainly would shadow would kill him happy jack made up his mind and with a little gasp raced madly across the snow straight to farmer browns boy and ran right up to his shoulder  shadow the weasel had been so intent on catching happy jack that he hadnt noticed farmer browns boy at all now he saw him for the first time and stopped short snarling and spitting whatever else you may say of shadow the weasel he is no coward for a minute it looked as if he really meant to follow happy jack and get him in spite of farmer browns boy and happy jack trembled as he looked down into those angry little red eyes but shadow knows when he is well off and now he knew better than to come a step nearer so he snarled and spit and then as farmer browns boy took a step forward leaped to one side and disappeared in the old stone wall  very gently and softly farmer browns boy talked to happy jack as he took him to the nearest tree then when happy jack was safely up in the tree he went over to the stone wall and tried to drive shadow the weasel out he pulled over the stones until at last shadow jumped out and then farmer browns boy chased him clear into the green forest  dee dee dee what did i tell you cried tommy tit happily as he flew over to where happy jack was sitting  now who really saved happy jacktommy tit or farmer browns boy     chapter xvi  happy jack misses farmer browns boy       one and one are always two       and two and two are four     and just as true it is youll find       that love and love make more      happy jack   go ask happy jack squirrel he knows he knows because he has proved it it began when farmer browns boy saved him from shadow the weasel perhaps i should say when farmer browns boy and tommy tit saved him for if it hadnt been for tommy it never would have entered happy jacks head to run to farmer browns boy after that of course happy jack and farmer browns boy became great friends farmer browns boy came over to the green forest every day to see happy jack and always he had the most delicious nuts in his pockets at first happy jack had been a wee bit shy he couldnt quite get over that old fear he had had so long then he would remember how farmer browns boy had saved him and that would make him ashamed and he would walk right up and take the nuts  farmer browns boy would talk to him in the nicest way and tell him that he loved him and that there wasnt the least thing in the world to be afraid of pretty soon happy jack began to love farmer browns boy a little he couldnt help it he just had to love any one who was so kind and gentle to him now as soon as he began to love a little and felt sure in his own heart that farmer browns boy loved him a little he found that love and love make more love and it wasnt any time at all before he had become very fond of farmer browns boy so fond of him that he was almost jealous of tommy tit who had been a friend of farmer browns boy for a long time it got so that happy jack looked forward each day to the visit of farmer browns boy and as soon as he heard his whistle he would hasten to meet him some folks were unkind enough to say that it was just because of the nuts and corn he was sure to find in farmer browns boys pockets but that wasnt so at all  at last there came a day when he missed that cheery whistle he waited and waited at last he went clear to the edge of the green forest but there was no whistle and no sign of farmer browns boy it was the same way the next day and the next happy jack forgot to frisk about the way he usually does he lost his appetite he just sat around and moped  when tommy tit the chickadee came to call as he did every day happy jack found that tommy was anxious too tommy had been up to farmer browns dooryard several times and he hadnt seen anything of farmer browns boy  i think he must have gone away said tommy  he would have come down here first and said goodby replied happy jack  youyou dont suppose something has happened to him do you asked tommy  i dont know i dont know what to think replied happy jack soberly do you know tommy ive grown very fond of farmer browns boy  of course dee dee dee of course everybody who really knows him is fond of him ive said all along that he is the best friend weve got but no one seemed to believe me im glad youve found it out for yourself i tell you what ill go up to his house and have another look around and without waiting for a reply tommy was off as fast as his little wings could take him  i hope i do hope that nothing has happened to him mumbled happy jack as he pretended to hunt for buried nuts while he waited for tommy tit to come back and by him he meant farmer browns boy     chapter xvii  tommy tit brings news  no one knows too much but many know too little  happy jack   happy jack very plainly was not happy his name was the only happy thing about him he fussed about on the edge of the green forest he just couldnt keep still when he thought anybody was looking he pretended to hunt for some of the nuts he had buried in the fall and dug holes down through the snow but as soon as he thought that no one was watching he would scamper up a tree where he could look over to farmer browns house and look and look it was very clear that happy jack was watching for some one and that he was anxious very anxious indeed  it was getting late in the afternoon and soon the black shadows would begin to creep out from the purple hills behind which jolly round red mr sun would go to bed it would be bedtime for happy jack then for you know he goes to bed very early just as soon as it begins to get dark the later it got the more anxious and uneasy happy jack grew he had just made up his mind that in a few minutes he would have to give up and go to bed when there was a flit of tiny wings and tommy tit the chickadee dropped into the tree beside him  did you find out anything asked happy jack eagerly before tommy had a chance to say a word  illustration did you find out anything asked happy jack eagerly  tommy nodded hes there he panted for he was quite out of breath from hurrying so  where happy jack fairly shouted the question  over there in the house replied tommy tit  then he hasnt gone away its just as i said he hasnt gone away cried happy jack and he was so relieved that he jumped up and down and as a result nearly tumbled out of the tree  no replied tommy he hasnt gone away but i think there is something the matter with him  happy jack grew very sober what makes you think so he demanded  if youll give me time to get my breath ill tell you all about it retorted tommy tit  all right only please hurry replied happy jack and tried to look patient even if he wasnt  tommy tit smoothed out some rumpled feathers and was most provokingly slow about it when i left here he began at last i flew straight up to farmer browns house as i said i would i flew all around it but all i saw was that horrid black pussy on the back doorsteps and she looked at me so hungrily that she made me dreadfully uncomfortable i dont see what farmer brown keeps her about for anyway  never mind her go on interrupted happy jack  then i flew all around the barn but i didnt see any one there but that ugly little upstart bully the english sparrow and he wanted to pick a fight with me right away tommy looked very indignant  never mind him go on cried happy jack impatiently  after that i flew back to the big maple tree close by the house continued tommy you know farmer browns boy has kept a piece of suet tied in that tree all winter for me i was hungry and i thought i would get a bite to eat but there wasnt any suet there that pig of a sammy jay had managed to get it untied and had carried it all away of course that made me angry and twice as hungry as before i was trying to make up my mind what to do next when i happened to look over on the window sill and what do you think i saw there  what demanded happy jack eagerly  a lot of cracked hickory nuts declared tommy i just knew that they were meant for me and when i was sure that the way was clear i flew over there they tasted so good that i almost forgot about farmer browns boy when i just happened to look in the window you know those windows are made of some queer stuff that looks like ice and isnt and that you can see right through  happy jack didnt know for he never had been near enough to see but he nodded and tommy tit went on  there were many queer things inside and i was wondering what they could be when all of a sudden i saw him he was lying down and there was something the matter with him i tapped on the window to him and then i hurried back here     chapter xviii  happy jack decides to make a call      youll find when all is said and done     two heads are better far than one      happy jack   happy jack squirrel hadnt slept very well he had had bad dreams ever so many times in the night he had waked up a very unusual thing for happy jack the fact is he had something on his mind yes sir happy jack had something on his mind and that something was farmer browns boy he often had had farmer browns boy on his mind before but in a very different way then it had been in the days when farmer browns boy hunted through the green forest and over the green meadows with his terrible gun then everybody had farmer browns boy on their minds most of the time happy jack had hated him then hated him because he had feared him you know fear almost always leads to hate but now it was different farmer browns boy had put away his terrible gun happy jack no longer feared him love had taken the place of hate in his heart for had not farmer browns boy saved him from shadow the weasel and brought him nuts and corn when food was scarce and now tommy tit had brought word that some thing was the matter with farmer browns boy it was this that was on happy jacks mind and had given him such a bad night  as soon as it was daylight happy jack scrambled out of bed to look for tommy tit he didnt have long to wait for tommy is quite as early a riser as happy jack       dee dee chickadee     i hope you feel as well as me  sang tommy merrily as he flitted over to where happy jack was looking for his breakfast the very sound of tommys voice made happy jack feel better one must feel very badly indeed not to be a little more cheerful when tommy tit is about the fact is tommy tit packs about so much good cheer in that small person of his that no one can be downhearted when he is about  hello tommy said happy jack if i could make other people feel as good as you do do you know what i would do  what asked tommy  id go straight up to farmer browns house and try to cheer up farmer browns boy replied happy jack  thats the very thing i have in mind chuckled tommy ive come over here to see if you wont come along with me ive been up to his house so often that he wont think half so much of a visit from me as he will from you will you do it  happy jack looked a little startled you see he never had been over to farmer browns house and somehow he couldnt get over the idea that it would be a very dangerous thing to do iido you really suppose i could he asked  im sure of it replied tommy tit theres no one to be afraid of but black pussy and bowser the hound and its easy enough to keep out of their way you can hide in the old stone wall until the way is clear and then run across to the big maple tree close to the house then you can look right in and see farmer browns boy and he can look out and see you will you do it  happy jack thought very hard for a few minutes then he made up his mind ill do it said he in a very decided tone of voice lets start right away  good for you dee dee good for you cried tommy tit and started to lead the way     chapter xix  tommy tit and happy jack pay a visit      as grows the mighty elm tree     from just a tiny seed     so often great things happen     from just a kindly deed      happy jack   great things were happening to happy jack squirrel he was actually on his way to farmer browns house and he had a feeling that other things were likely to happen when he got there now you may not think that it was anything very great that happy jack should be on his way to farmer browns house very likely you are saying pooh thats nothing this may be true and then again it may not suppose you do a little supposing suppose you had all your life been terribly afraid of a great giant fifty times bigger than you suppose that great giant had stopped hunting you and by little deeds of kindness had at last won your love suppose you learned that something was the matter with him and you made up your mind to visit him at his great castle where there were other great giants whom you did not know wouldnt you think that great things were happening to you  well that is exactly the way it was with happy jack squirrel as he and tommy tit the chickadee started to go over to farmer browns house to look for farmer browns boy tommy tit had been there often so he didnt think anything about it but happy jack never had been there and if the truth were known his heart was going pitapat pitapat with excitement and perhaps just a little fear through the old orchard they went tommy tit flitting ahead and keeping a sharp watch for danger when they reached the old stone wall on the edge of farmer browns dooryard tommy told happy jack to hide there while he went to see if the way was clear he was back in a few minutes  dee dee everything is all right said he bowser the hound is eating his breakfast out back where he cant see you at all and black pussy is nowhere about all you have to do is to follow me over to that big tree close to the house and i will show you where farmer browns boy is  iim afraid confessed happy jack  pooh theres nothing to be afraid of asserted tommy tit in the most positive way dont be a coward remember how farmer browns boy saved you from shadow the weasel come on dee dee dee come on with that tommy flew across to the tree close by the house  happy jack scrambled up on the old stone wall and looked this way and looked that way he couldnt see a thing to be afraid of he jumped down and ran a few steps then his heart failed and he scampered back to the old stone wall in a panic after a few minutes he tried again and once more a foolish fear sent him back the third time he gritted his teeth said to himself over and over i will i will i will and ran with all his might in no time at all he was across the dooryard and up in the big tree his heart pounding with excitement  dee dee dee called tommy tit  happy jack looked over to the house and there sat tommy on a windowsill helping himself to the most deliciouslooking cracked nuts the sight of them made happy jacks mouth water a long branch hung down over the window and almost touched the sill happy jack ventured half way and stopped somehow it seemed very dangerous to go so close to that window  come on come on what are you afraid of called tommy  something like shame that such a little fellow as tommy tit should dare to go where he did not crept into happy jacks heart with a quick little run and jump he was on the sill and a second later he was staring in at all the strange things inside at first he didnt see anything of farmer browns boy but in a few minutes he made him out he was lying down all covered over except his head there was something the matter with him happy jack didnt need to be told that and a great pity filled his heart he wanted to do something for farmer browns boy     chapter xx  what was the matter with farmer browns boy  he who climbs the highest has the farthest to fall but often it is worth the risk  happy jack   all the way home from his visit to farmer browns house happy jack squirrel puzzled and wondered over what he had seen he had peeped in at a window and seen farmer browns boy lying all covered up with only his head showing happy jack couldnt see very well but somehow that head didnt look just right one thing was sure and that was there was something wrong with farmer browns boy he never would have been lying still like that if there hadnt been  happy jack had been so troubled by what he saw that he had hardly tasted the nuts he had found on the windowsill i am going to make him another call tomorrow said he when he and tommy tit were once more back in the green forest  of course replied tommy i expected you would i will be around for you at the same time youre not afraid any more to go up there are you  noo replied happy jack slowly the truth is he was still a little afraid it seemed to him a terribly venturesome thing to cross that open dooryard but having done it once in safety he knew that it would be easier the next time it was the next morning he and tommy tit went just as before and this time happy jack scampered across the dooryard the very first time he tried they found things just as they had been the day before they saw farmer browns boy but he didnt see them tommy tit was just going to tap on the window to let him know they were there when a door inside opened and in walked mrs brown it frightened them so that tommy tit flew away without tasting a single nut and happy jack nearly fell as he scrambled back into the tree close by the window you see they never had made her acquaintance and having her walk in so suddenly frightened them terribly they didnt stop to think that there was nothing to fear because there was the window between somehow they couldnt understand that queer stuff that they could see through but which shut them out if they had seen mrs brown go to the window and put more cracked nuts on the sill perhaps they would have been less afraid but they had been too badly frightened to look back and so they didnt know anything about that  the next morning tommy tit was on hand as usual but he found happy jack a little doubtful about paying another visit he wasnt wholly over his scare of the day before it took him some time to make up his mind to go but finally he did this time when they reached the tree close by the house they found a great surprise awaiting them farmer browns boy was sitting just inside the window looking out at least they thought it was farmer browns boy but when they got a little nearer they grew doubtful it looked like farmer browns boy and yet it didnt his cheeks stuck way out just as striped chipmunks do when he has them stuffed full of corn or nuts  happy jack stared at him very hard my goodness i didnt know he carried his food that way he exclaimed i should think it would be dreadfully uncomfortable  if farmer browns boy could have heard that he certainly would have tried to laugh and if he hadwell it was bad enough when he tried to smile at the sight of tommy tit and happy jack he didnt smile at all but made up an awful face instead and clapped both hands to his cheeks happy jack and tommy tit didnt know what to make of it and it was some time before they made up their minds that it really was farmer browns boy and that they had nothing to fear but when they finally ventured on to the sill and as they helped themselves to nuts saw the smile in his eyes though he did not smile with his mouth at all they knew that it was he and that he was glad that they had called then they were glad too  but what was the matter with farmer browns boy happy jack puzzled over it all the rest of the day and then gave it up     chapter xxi  happy jack squirrel grows very bold      when you find a friend in trouble       pass along a word of cheer     often it is very helpful       just to feel a friend is near      happy jack   every day happy jack visited the window sill of farmer browns house to call on farmer browns boy who was always waiting for him just inside the window in fact happy jack had got into the habit of getting his breakfast there for always there were fat delicious nuts on the windowsill and it was much easier and more comfortable to breakfast there than to hunt up his own hidden supplies and perhaps have to dig down through the snow to get them most people are just like happy jackthey do the easiest thing  each day farmer browns boy looked more and more like himself his cheeks stuck out less and less and finally did not stick out at all and now he smiled at happy jack with his mouth as well as with his eyes you know when his cheeks had stuck out so he couldnt smile at all except with his eyes happy jack didnt know what had been the matter with farmer browns boy but whatever it was he was better now and that made happy jack feel better  one morning he got a surprise when he ran out along the branch of the tree that led to the windowsill he suddenly discovered something wrong there were no nuts on the sill more than this there was something very suspicious looking about the window it didnt look just right the truth is it was partly open but happy jack didnt understand this not then anyway he stopped short and scolded a way he has when things dont suit him farmer browns boy came to the window and called to him then he thrust a hand out and in it were some of the fattest nuts happy jack ever had seen his mouth watered right away there might be something wrong with the window but certainly the sill was all right it would do no harm to go that far  so happy jack nimbly jumped across to the windowsill farmer browns boys hand with the fat nuts was still there and happy jack lost no time in getting one then he sat up on the sill to eat it my but it was good it was just as good as it had looked happy jacks eyes twinkled as he ate when he had finished that nut he wanted another but now farmer browns boy had drawn his hand inside the window he was still holding it out with the nuts in it but to get them happy jack must go inside and he couldnt get it out of his head that that was a very dangerous thing to do what if that window should be closed while he was in there then he would be a prisoner  so he sat up and begged he knew that farmer browns boy knew what he wanted but farmer browns boy kept his hand just where it was  come on you little rascal said he you ought to know me well enough by this time to know that i wont hurt you or let any harm come to you hurry up because i cant stand here all day you see ive just got over the mumps and if i should catch cold i might be sick again come along now and show how brave you are  of course happy jack couldnt understand what he said if he could have he might have guessed that it was the mumps that had made farmer browns boy look so like striped chipmunk when he has his cheeks stuffed with nuts but if he couldnt understand what farmer browns boy said he had no difficulty in understanding that if he wanted those nuts he would have to go after them so at last he screwed up his courage and put his head inside nothing happened so he went wholly in and sat on the inside sill then by reaching out as far as he could without tumbling off he managed to get one of those nuts and as soon as he had it he dodged outside to eat it  farmer browns boy laughed and putting the rest of the nuts outside he closed the window happy jack ate his fill and then scampered back to the green forest he felt all puffed up with pride he felt that he had been very very bold and he was anxious to tell tommy tit the chickadee who had not been with him that morning how bold he had been  pooh thats nothing replied tommy when he had heard about it ive done that often     chapter xxii  happy jack dares tommy tit      a wise philosopher is he     who takes things as they chance to be     and in them sees that which is best     while trying to forget the rest      happy jack   somehow happy jacks day had been spoiled he knew that he had no business to allow it to be spoiled but it was just the same you see he had been all puffed up with pride because he thought himself a very bold fellow because he had really been inside farmer browns house he couldnt help feeling quite puffed up about it but when he told tommy tit the chickadee about it tommy had said pooh ive done that often  that was what had spoiled the day for happy jack he knew that if tommy tit said that he had done a thing he had for tommy always tells the truth and nothing but the truth so happy jack hadnt been so dreadfully bold after all and had nothing to brag about it made him feel quite put out he actually tried to make himself feel that it was all the fault of tommy tit and that he wanted to get even with him he thought about it all the rest of the day and just before he fell asleep that night an idea came to him  i know what ill do ill dare tommy to go as far inside farmer browns house as i do he exclaimed and went to sleep to dream that he was the boldest bravest squirrel that ever lived  the next morning when he reached the tree close by farmer browns house he found tommy tit already there flitting about impatiently and calling his loudest which wasnt very loud for you know tommy is a very little fellow and his voice is not very loud but he was doing his best to call farmer browns boy you see there wasnt a single nut on the windowsill and the window was closed pretty soon farmer browns boy came to the window and opened it but he didnt put out any nuts tommy tit at once flew over to the sill and to show that he was just as bold happy jack followed looking inside they saw farmer browns boy standing in the middle of the room holding out a dish of nuts and smiling at them this was the chance happy jack wanted to try the plan he had thought of the night before  i dare you to go way in there and get a nut said he to tommy tit he hoped that tommy would be afraid  but tommy wasnt anything of the kind dee dee dee come on he cried and flitted over and helped himself to a cracked nut and was back with it before happy jack could make up his mind to jump down inside of course now that he had dared tommy tit and tommy had taken the dare he just had to do it too it looked a long way in to where farmer browns boy was standing twice he started and turned back then he heard tommy tit chuckle that was too much he wouldnt be laughed at he just wouldnt he scampered across grabbed a nut and rushed back to the windowsill where he ate the nut it was easier to go after the second nut and when he went for the third he had made up his mind that it was perfectly safe in there and so he sat up on a chair and ate it presently he felt quite at home and when he had eaten all the nuts he wanted he ran all around the room examining all the strange things there  this was a little more than tommy tit could make up his mind to do he wasnt afraid to fly in for a nut and then fly out again but he couldnt feel easy inside a house like that of course this made happy jack feel good all over you see he felt that now he really did have something to boast about no one else in all the green forest or on the green meadows could say that they had been all over farmer browns boys room as he had happy jack swelled himself out at the thought now everybody would say what a bold fellow     chapter xxiii   sammy jay is quite upset      i know of nothing sweeter than     success to squirrel or to man      happy jack   very few people can be all puffed up with pride without showing it happy jack squirrel couldnt just to have looked at him you would have known that he was feeling very very good about something when he thought no one was looking he would actually strut and it was all because he considered himself a very bold fellow that was a new feeling for happy jack he knew that all his neighbors considered him rather timid and many a time he had envied actually envied jimmy skunk and reddy fox and unc billy possum and even sammy jay because they did such bold things and had dared to visit farmer browns dooryard and henhouse in spite of bowser the hound  but now he felt that he dared do a thing that not one of them dared do he dared go right into farmer browns house and make himself quite at home in the room of farmer browns boy he felt that he was a tremendously brave fellow you see he quite forgot one thing he forgot that he had found out that love destroys fear and that though it might look to others like a very bold thing to walk right into farmer browns house it really wasnt bold at all because all the time he knew that no harm would come to him it is never brave to do a thing that you are not afraid to do it had been brave of him to go in at that open window the first time because then he had been afraid but now he wasnt afraid and so it was no longer either brave or bold of him  tommy tit the chickadee knew all this and he used to chuckle to himself as he saw how proud of himself happy jack was but he said nothing to any one about it of course it wasnt long before others began to notice happy jacks pride one of the first was sammy jay there is very little that escapes sammy jays sharp eyes silently stealing through the green forest early one morning he surprised happy jack strutting  huh said he what are you feeling so big about  like a flash the thought came to happy jack that here was a chance to show what a bold fellow he had become hello sammy he exclaimed are you feeling very brave this morning  me feeling brave what are you talking about if i was as timid as you are i wouldnt ever talk about bravery to other people if there is anything you dare to do that i dont ive never heard of it retorted sammy jay  come on cried happy jack im going to get my breakfast and i dare you to follow me  sammy jay actually laughed right out go ahead wherever you go ill go he declared  happy jack started right away for farmer browns house and sammy followed through the old orchard across the dooryard and into the big maple tree happy jack led the way and sammy followed all the time wondering what was up he had been there many times in fact he had had many a good meal of suet there during the cold weather for farmer browns boy had kept a big piece tied to a branch of the maple tree for those who were hungry  sammy was a little surprised when he saw happy jack jump over on to the windowsill still he had been on that windowsill more than once himself when he had made sure that no one was near and had helped himself to the cracked nuts he had found there  come on called happy jack his eyes twinkling  sammy jay chuckled he thinks i dont dare go over there he thought well ill fool him  with a hasty look to see that no danger was near he spread his wings to follow happy jack on to the windowsill happy jack waited to make sure that he really was coming and then slipped in at the open window and scampered over to a table on the farther side of the room and helped himself from a dish of nuts there  when sammy saw happy jack disappear inside he gave a little gasp when he looked inside and saw happy jack making himself quite at home he gasped again and when he saw a door open and farmer browns boy enter and still happy jack did not run he was too upset for words he didnt dare stay to see more and for once in his life was quite speechless as he flew back to the green forest     chapter xxiv  a dream comes true      what are all our dreams made up of       that they often are so queer     wishes hopes and fond desires       all mixed up with foolish fears      happy jack   which is worse to have a very beautiful dream never come true or to have a bad dream really come true happy jack squirrel says the latter is worse much worse dreams do come true once in a great while you know one of happy jacks did it came true and it made a great difference in happy jacks life you see it was like this  happy jack had had so many things to think of that he had almost forgotten about shadow the weasel happy jack hadnt seen or heard anything of him since farmer browns boy had chased him into the green forest and so saved happy jacks life since then life had been too full of pleasant things to think of anything so unpleasant as shadow the weasel but one night happy jack had a bad dream yes sir it was a very bad dream he dreamed that once more shadow the weasel was after him and this time there was no farmer browns boy to run to for help shadow was right at his heels and in one more jump would have him happy jack opened his mouth to scream andawoke  he was all ashake with fright it was a great relief to find that it was only a dream but even then he couldnt get over it right away he was glad that it was almost morning and just as soon as it was light enough to see he crept out it was too early to go over to farmer browns house farmer browns boy wouldnt be up yet so happy jack ran over to one of his favorite lookouts a tall chestnut tree and there with his back against the trunk high above the ground he watched the green forest wake as the first sunbeams stole through it but all the time he kept thinking of that dreadful dream  a little spot of black moving against the white snow caught his sharp eyes what was it he leaned forward and held his breath as he tried to make sure ah now he could see just ahead of that black thing was a long slim fellow all in white and that black spot was his tail if it hadnt been for that happy jack very likely wouldnt have seen him at all it was shadow the weasel he was running swiftly first to one side and then to the other with his nose to the snow he was hunting there was no doubt about that he was hunting for his breakfast  happy jacks eyes grew wide with fear would shadow find his tracks it looked very much as if shadow was heading for happy jacks house and happy jack was glad very glad that that bad dream had waked him and made him so uneasy that he had come out otherwise he might have been caught right in his own bed shadow was almost at happy jacks house when he stopped abruptly with his nose to the snow and sniffed eagerly then he turned and with his nose to the snow started straight toward the tree where happy jack was happy jack waited to see no more he knew now that shadow had found his trail and that it was to be a case of run for his life  my dream has come true he sobbed as he ran my dream has come true and i dont know what to do but all the time he kept on running as fast as ever he could which really was the only thing to do     chapter xxv  happy jack has a happy thought      who runs when danger comes his way     will live to run some other day      happy jack   frightened and breathless running with all his might from shadow the weasel happy jack squirrel was in despair he didnt know what to do or where to go the last time he had run from shadow he had run to farmer browns boy who had just happened to be near and farmer browns boy had chased shadow the weasel away but now it was too early in the morning for him to expect to meet farmer browns boy in fact jolly round red mr sun had hardly kicked his bedclothes off yet and happy jack was very sure that farmer browns boy was still asleep  now most of us are creatures of habit we do the thing that we have been in the habit of doing and do it without thinking anything about it that is why good habits are such a blessing happy jack squirrel is just like the rest of us he has habits both good and bad of late he had been in the habit of getting his breakfast at farmer browns house every morning so now when he began to run from shadow the weasel he just naturally ran in the direction of farmer browns house from force of habit in fact he was halfway there before he realized in which direction he was running  right then a thought came to him it gave him a wee bit of hope and seemed to help him run just a little faster if the window of farmer browns boys room was open he would run in there and perhaps shadow the weasel wouldnt dare follow how he did hope that that window would be open he knew that it was his only chance he wasnt quite sure that it really was a chance for shadow was such a bold fellow that he might not be afraid to follow him right in but it was worth trying  along the stone wall beside the old orchard raced happy jack to the dooryard of farmer brown and after him ran shadow the weasel and shadow looked as if he was enjoying himself no doubt he was he knew just as well as happy jack did that there was small chance of meeting farmer browns boy so early in the morning so he felt very sure how that chase was going to end and that when it did end he would breakfast on squirrel  by the time happy jack reached the dooryard shadow was only a few jumps behind him and happy jack was pretty well out of breath he didnt stop to look to see if the way was clear there wasnt time for that besides there could be no greater danger in front than was almost at his heels and so without looking one way or another he scampered across the dooryard and up the big maple tree close to the house shadow the weasel was surprised he had not dreamed that happy jack would come over here but shadow is a bold fellow and it made little difference to him where happy jack went at least that is what he thought  so he followed happy jack across the dooryard and up the maple tree he took his time about it for he knew by the way happy jack had run that he was pretty nearly at the end of his strength he neverll get out of this tree thought shadow as he started to climb it he fully expected to find happy jack huddled in a miserable little heap somewhere near the top just imagine how surprised he was when he discovered that happy jack wasnt to be seen he rubbed his angry little red eyes and they grew angrier and redder than before  must be a hollow up here somewhere he muttered ill just follow the scent of his feet and that will lead me to him  but when that scent led him out on a branch the tip of which brushed against farmer browns house shadow got another surprise there was no sign of happy jack he couldnt have reached the roof there was no place he could have gone unless shadow stared across at a window open about two inches  he couldnt have muttered shadow he wouldnt dare he couldnt have  but happy jack had he had gone inside that window     chapter xxvi  farmer browns boy wakes with a start      never think another crazy just because it happens you     neverve heard of just the thing that they have started out to do      happy jack   isnt it queer how hard it seems to be for some boys to go to bed at the proper time and how much harder it is for them to get up in the morning it was just so with farmer browns boy i suppose he wouldnt have been a real boy if it hadnt been so of course while he was sick with the mumps he didnt have to get up and while he was getting over the mumps his mother let him sleep as long as he wanted to in the morning that was very nice but it made it all the harder to get up when he should after he was well again in summer it wasnt so bad getting up early but in winterwell that was the one thing about winter that farmer browns boy didnt like  on this particular morning farmer brown had called him and he had replied with a sleepy all right and then had rolled over and promptly gone to sleep again in two minutes he was dreaming just as if there were no such things as duties to be done for a while they were very pleasant dreams very pleasant indeed but suddenly they changed a terrible monster was chasing him it had great red eyes as big as saucers and sparks of fire flew from its mouth it had great claws as big as ice tongs and it roared like a lion in his dream farmer browns boy was running with all his might then he tripped and fell and somehow he couldnt get up again the terrible monster came nearer and nearer farmer browns boy tried to scream and couldnt he was so frightened that he had lost his voice the terrible monster was right over him now and reached out one of his huge paws with the great claws one of them touched him on the cheek and it burned like fire  with a yell a real genuine yell farmer browns boy awoke and sprang out of bed for a minute he couldnt think where he was then with a sigh of relief he realized that he was safe in his own snug little room with the first jolly little sunbeam creeping in at the window to wish him good morning and chide him for being such a lazy fellow a thump and a scurry of little feet caught his attention and he turned to see a gray squirrel running for the open window it jumped up on the sill looked out then jumped down inside again and ran over to a corner of the room where he crouched as if in great fear it was clear that he had been badly frightened by the yell of farmer browns boy and that he was still more frightened by something he had seen when he looked out of the window  a great light broke over farmer browns boy happy jack you little rascal i believe you are the terrible monster that scared me so he exclaimed i believe you were on my bed and that it was your claws that i felt on my face but what ails you you look frightened almost to death  he went over to the window and looked out a movement in the big maple tree just outside caught his attention he saw a long slim white form dart down the tree and disappear he knew who it was it was shadow the weasel  so that pesky weasel has been after you again and you came to me for help said he gently as he coaxed happy jack to come to him this is the place to come to every time poor little chap youre all of a tremble i guess i know how you feel when a weasel is after you i guess you feel just as i felt when i dreamed that that monster was after me my but you certainly did give me a scare when you touched my face he gently stroked happy jack as he talked and happy jack let him  breakfast called a voice from downstairs  coming replied farmer browns boy as he put happy jack on the table by a dish of nuts and began to scramble into his clothes     chapter xxvii  happy jack is afraid to go home  safety first is the best rule to insure a long life  happy jack   happy jack didnt dare go home can you think of anything more dreadful than to be afraid to go to your own home why home is the dearest place in the world and it should be the safest just think how you would feel if you should be away from home and then you should learn that it wouldnt be safe for you to go back there again and you had no other place to go it often happens that way with the little people of the green meadows and the green forest it was that way with happy jack squirrel now  you see happy jack knew that shadow the weasel is not one to give up easily shadow has one very good trait and that is persistence he is not easily discouraged when he sets out to do a thing usually he does it if he starts to get a thing usually he gets it no he isnt easily discouraged happy jack knows this no one knows it better so happy jack didnt dare to go home he knew that any minute of night or day shadow might surprise him there and that would be the end of him he more than half suspected that shadow was at that very time hiding somewhere along the way ready to spring out on him if he should try to go back home  he had stayed in the room of farmer browns boy until mrs brown had come to make the bed then he had jumped out the window into the big maple tree he wasnt quite sure of mrs brown yet she had kindly eyes they were just like the eyes of farmer browns boy but he didnt feel really acquainted yet and he felt safer outside than inside the room while she was there      oh dear oh dear what shall i do        i have no home and so     to keep me warm and snug and safe        i have no place to go  happy jack said this over and over as he sat in the maple tree trying to decide what was to be done  i wonder what ails that squirrel he seems to be doing a lot of scolding said mrs brown as she looked out of the window and that shows how easy it is to misunderstand people when we dont know all about their affairs mrs brown thought that happy jack was scolding when all the time he was just frightened and worried and wondering where he could go and what he could do to feel safe from shadow the weasel  because he didnt dare to go back to the green forest he spent most of the day in the big maple tree close to farmer browns house the window had been closed so he couldnt go inside he looked at it longingly a great many times during the day hoping that he would find it open but he didnt you see it was opened only at night when farmer browns boy went to bed so that he would have plenty of fresh air all night of course happy jack didnt know that all his life he had had plenty of fresh air all the time and be couldnt understand how people could live in houses all shut up  late that afternoon farmer browns boy who had been at school all day came whistling into the yard he noticed happy jack right away hello you back again isnt one good meal a day enough he exclaimed  hes been there all day said his mother who had come to the door just in time to overhear him i dont know what ails him  then farmer browns boy noticed how forlorn happy jack looked he remembered happy jacks fright that morning  i know whats the matter he cried its that weasel the poor little chap is afraid to go home we must see what we can do for him i wonder if he will stay if i make a new house for him i believe ill try it and see     chapter xxviii  happy jack finds a new home      they say the very darkest clouds       are lined with silver bright and fair     though how they know i do not see       and neither do i really care     its good to believe and so i try       to believe tis true with all my might     that nothing is so seeming dark       but has a hidden side thats bright      happy jack   certainly things couldnt look much darker than they did to happy jack squirrel as he sat in the big maple tree at the side of farmer browns house and saw jolly round red mr sun getting ready to go to bed behind the purple hills he was afraid to go to his home in the green forest because shadow the weasel might be waiting for him there he was afraid of the night which would soon come he was cold and he was hungry altogether he was as miserable a little squirrel as ever was seen  he had just made up his mind that he would have to go look for a hollow in one of the trees in the old orchard in which to spend the night when around the corner of the house came farmer browns boy with something under one arm and dragging a ladder he whistled cheerily to happy jack as he put the ladder against the tree and climbed up by this time happy jack had grown so timid that he was just a little afraid of farmer browns boy so he climbed as high up in the tree as he could get and watched what was going on below even if he was afraid there was comfort in having farmer browns boy near  for some time farmer browns boy worked busily at the place where the branch that happy jack knew so well started out from the trunk of the tree towards the window of farmer browns boys room when he had fixed things to suit him he went down the ladder and carried it away with him in the crotch of the tree he had left the queer thing that he had brought under his arm in spite of his fears happy jack was curious little by little he crept nearer what he saw was a box with a round hole just about big enough for him to go through in one end and in front of it a little shelf on the shelf were some of the nuts that he liked best  for a long time happy jack looked and looked was it a trap somehow he couldnt believe that it was what would farmer browns boy try to trap him for when they were such good friends at last the sight of the nuts was too much for him it certainly was safe enough to help himself to those how good they tasted almost before he knew it they were gone then he got up courage enough to peep inside the box was filled with soft hay it certainly did look inviting in there to a fellow who had no home and no place to go he put his head inside finally he went wholly in it was just as nice as it looked  i believe thought happy jack that he made this little house just for me and that he put all this hay in here for my bed he doesnt know much about making a bed but i guess he means well  with that he went to work happily to make up a bed to suit him and by the time the first black shadow had crept as far as the big maple tree happy jack was curled up fast asleep in his new house     chapter xxix  farmer browns boy takes a prisoner      the craftiest and cleverest the strongest and the bold     will make mistakes like other folks young middleaged and old      happy jack   happy jack squirrel was happy once more he liked his new house the house that farmer browns boy had made for him and fastened in the big maple tree close by the house in which he himself lived happy jack and farmer browns boy were getting to be greater friends than ever every morning happy jack jumped over to the windowsill and then in at the open window of the room of farmer browns boy there he was sure to find a good breakfast of fat hickory nuts when farmer browns boy overslept as he did sometimes happy jack would jump up on the bed and waken him he thought this great fun so did farmer browns boy though sometimes when he was very sleepy he pretended to scold especially on sunday mornings when he did not have to get up as early as on other days  of course black pussy had soon discovered that happy jack was living in the big maple tree and she spent a great deal of time sitting at the foot of it and glaring up at him with a hungry look in her eyes although she wasnt hungry at all for she had plenty to eat several times she climbed up in the tree and tried to catch him at first he had been afraid but he soon found out that black pussy was not at all at home in a tree as he was after that he rather enjoyed having her try to catch him it was almost like a game it was great fun to scold at her and let her get very near him and then just as she was sure that she was going to catch him to jump out of her reach after a while she was content to sit at the foot of the tree and just glare at him  happy jack had only one worry now and this didnt trouble him a great deal it was possible that shadow the weasel might take it into his head to try to surprise him some night happy jack knew that by this time shadow must know where he was living for of course sammy jay had found out and sammy is one of those who tells all he knows still being so close to farmer browns boy gave happy jack a very comfortable feeling  now all this time farmer browns boy had not forgotten shadow the weasel and how he had driven happy jack out of the green forest and he had wondered a great many times if it wouldnt be a kindness to the other little people if he should trap shadow and put him out of the way but you know he had given up trapping and somehow he didnt like to think of setting a trap even for such a mischiefmaker as shadow then something happened that made farmer browns boy very very angry one morning when he went to feed the biddies he found that shadow had visited the henhouse in the night and killed three of his best pullets that decided him he felt sure that shadow would come again and he meant to give shadow a surprise he hunted until he found the little hole through which shadow had got into the henhouse and there he set a trap  i dont like to do it but ive got to said he if he had been content with one it would have been bad enough but he killed three just from the love of killing and it is high time that something be done to get rid of him  the very next morning happy jack saw farmer browns boy coming from the henhouse with something under his arm he came straight over to the foot of the big maple tree and put the thing he was carrying down on the ground he whistled to happy jack and as happy jack came down to see what it was all about farmer browns boy grinned heres a friend of yours you probably will be glad to see said he  at first all happy jack could make out was a kind of wire box then he saw something white inside and it moved very suspiciously happy jack came nearer then his heart gave a great leap that wire box was a cage and glaring between the wires with red angry eyes was shadow the weasel he was a prisoner right away happy jack was so excited that he acted as if he were crazy he no longer had a single thing to be afraid of do you wonder that he was excited     chapter xxx  a prisoner without fear  a bad name is easy to get but hard to live down  happy jack   shadow the weasel was a prisoner he who always had been free to go and come as he pleased and to do as he pleased was now in a little narrow cage and quite helpless for once he had been careless and this was the result farmer browns boy had caught him in a trap of course he should have known better than to have visited the henhouse a second time after killing three of the best pullets there he should have known that farmer browns boy would be sure to do something about it the truth is he had yielded to temptation when common sense had warned him not to so he had no one to blame for his present difficulty but himself and he knew it  at first he had been in a terrible rage and had bitten at the wires until he had made his mouth sore when he had made sure that the wires were stouter than his teeth he wisely stopped trying to get out in that way and made up his mind that the only thing to do was to watch for a chance to slip out if the door of the cage should happen to be left unfastened  of course it hurt his pride terribly to be made fun of by those who always had feared him happy jack squirrel was the first one of these to see him farmer browns boy had put the cage down near the foot of the big maple tree in which happy jack was living because shadow had driven him out of the green forest as soon as happy jack had made sure that shadow really and truly was a prisoner and so quite harmless he had acted as if he were crazy perhaps he wascrazy with joy you see he no longer had anything to be really afraid of for there was no one but shadow from whom he could not get away by running into his house billy mink was the only other one who could follow him there and billy was not likely to come climbing up a tree so close to farmer browns house  so happy jack raced up and down the tree in the very greatest excitement and his tongue went quite as fast as his legs he wanted everybody to know that shadow was a prisoner at last at first he did not dare go very close to the cage you see he had so long feared shadow that he was still afraid of him even though he was so helpless but little by little happy jack grew bolder and came very close and then he began doing something not at all nice he began calling shadow names and making fun of him and telling him how he wasnt afraid of him it was all very foolish and worseit was like hitting a foe who was helpless  of course happy jack hastened to tell everybody he met all about shadow so it wasnt long before shadow began to receive many visitors whenever farmer browns boy was not around there was sure to be one or more of the little people who had feared shadow to taunt him and make fun of him somehow it seems as if always it is that way when people get into trouble you know it is very easy to appear to be bold and brave when there is nothing to be afraid of of course that isnt bravery at all though many seem to think it is  illustration it wasnt long before shadow began to receive many visitors  now what do you think that right down in their hearts all these little people who came to jeer at shadow the weasel hoped they would see why they hoped they would see shadow afraid yes sir that is just what they hoped but they didnt that is where they were disappointed not once did shadow show the least sign of fear he didnt know what farmer browns boy would do with him and he had every reason to fear that if he was not to be kept a prisoner for the rest of his natural life something dreadful would be the end but he was too proud and too brave to let any one know that any such fear ever entered his mind whatever his faults shadow is no coward he boldly took bits of meat which farmer browns boy brought to him and not once appeared in the least afraid so that much as he disliked him farmer browns boy actually had to admire him he was a prisoner but he kept just as stout a heart as ever     chapter xxxi  what farmer browns boy did with shadow      ribble dibble dibble dab     some people have the gift of gab     some people have no tongues at all     to trip them up and make them fall      happy jack   it is a fact one of the biggest facts in all the world that tongues make the greatest part of all the trouble that brings uncomfortable feelings and bitterness and sadness and suffering and sorrow if it wasnt for unruly careless mean tongues the great world would be a million times better to live in a million times happier it is because of his unruly tongue that sammy jay is forever getting into trouble it is the same way with chatterer the red squirrel and it is just the same way with a great many little boys and girls and with grownups as well  when the little people of the green forest and green meadows who fear shadow the weasel found that he was a prisoner many of them took particular pains to visit him when the way was clear just to make fun of him and tease him and tell him that they were not afraid of him and that they were glad that he was a prisoner and that they were sure something dreadful would happen to him and they hoped it would shadow said never a word in reply he was too wise to do that he just turned his back on them but all the time he was storing up in his mind all these hateful things and he meant if ever he got free again to make life very uncomfortable for those whose foolish tongues were trying to make him more miserable than he already felt  but these little people with the foolish tongues didnt stop to think of what might happen they just took it for granted that shadow never again would run wild and free in the green forest and so they just let their tongues run and enjoyed doing it perhaps they wouldnt have if they could have known just what was going on in the mind of farmer browns boy ever since he had found shadow in the trap which he had set for him in the henhouse farmer browns boy had been puzzling over what he should do with his prisoner at first he had thought he would keep him in a cage the rest of his life but somehow whenever he looked into shadows fierce little eyes and saw how unafraid they looked he got to thinking of how terrible it must be to be shut up in a little narrow cage when one has had all the green forest in which to go and come then he thought that he would kill shadow and put him out of his misery at once  he killed my pullets and he is always hunting the harmless little people of the green forest and the green meadows so he deserves to be killed thought farmer browns boy hes a pest  then he remembered that after all shadow was one of old mother natures little people and that he must serve some purpose in mother natures great plan bad as he seemed she must have some use for him perhaps it was to teach others through fear of him how to be smarter and take better care of themselves and so be better fitted to do their parts the more he thought of this the harder it was for farmer browns boy to make up his mind to kill him but if he couldnt keep him a prisoner and he couldnt kill him what could he do  he was scowling down at shadow one morning and puzzling over this when a happy idea came to him i know what ill do he exclaimed without another word he picked up the cage with shadow in it and started off across the green meadows which now you know were not green at all but covered with snow happy jack watched him out of sight he had gone in the direction of the old pasture he was gone a long time and when he did return the cage was empty  happy jack blinked at the empty cage then he began to ask in a scolding tone what did you do with him what did you do with him  farmer browns boy just smiled and tossed a nut to happy jack and far up in the old pasture shadow the weasel was once more free it was well for happy jacks peace of mind that he didnt know that     chapter xxxii  happy jack is perfectly happy      never say a thing is so     unless you absolutely know     just remember every day     to be quite sure of what you say      happy jack   taking things for granted doesnt do at all in this world to take a thing for granted is to think that it is so without taking the trouble to find out whether it is or not it is apt not only to get you yourself into trouble but to make trouble for other people as well happy jack saw farmer browns boy carry shadow the weasel away in a cage and he saw him bring back the cage empty what could he have done with shadow for a while he teased farmer browns boy to tell him but of course farmer browns boy didnt understand happy jacks language  now happy jack knew just what he would like to believe he would like to believe that farmer browns boy had taken shadow away and made an end of him and because he wanted to believe that it wasnt very hard to believe it there was the empty cage of course farmer browns boy wouldnt have gone to the trouble of trapping shadow unless he intended to get rid of him for good  hes made an end of him thats what hes done said happy jack to himself because that is what he would have done if he had been in farmer browns boys place so having made up his mind that this is what had been done with shadow he at once told all his friends that it was so and was himself supremely happy you see he felt that he no longer had anything to worry about yes sir happy jack was happy he liked the house farmer browns boy had made for him in the big maple tree close by his own house he was sure of plenty to eat because farmer browns boy always looked out for that and as a result happy jack was growing fat none of his enemies of the green forest dared come so near to farmer browns house and the only one he had to watch out for at all was black pussy by this time he wasnt afraid of her not a bit in fact he rather enjoyed teasing her and getting her to chase him when she was dozing on the doorstep he liked to steal very close wake her with a sharp bark and then race for the nearest tree and there scold her to his hearts content he had made friends with mrs brown and with farmer brown and he even felt almost friends with bowser the hound sometimes he would climb up on the roof of bowsers little house and drop nutshells on bowsers head when he was asleep the funny thing was bowser never seemed to mind he would lazily open his eyes and wink one of them at happy jack and thump with his tail he seemed to feel that now happy jack was one of the family just as he was  so happy jack was just as happy as a fat gray squirrel with nothing to worry him could be he was so happy that sammy jay actually became jealous you know sammy is a born trouble maker he visited happy jack every morning and while he helped himself to the good things that he always found spread for him for farmer browns boy always had something for the little feathered folk to eat he would hint darkly that such goodness and kindness was not to be trusted and that something was sure to happen that is just the way with some folks they always are suspicious  but nothing that sammy jay could say troubled happy jack and sammy would fly away quite put out because he couldnt spoil happy jacks happiness the least little bit     chapter xxxiii  sammy jay upsets happy jack  a good deed well done often is overlooked but you never are allowed to forget a mistake  happy jack   sammy jay chuckled as he flew across the snowcovered green meadows on his way to his home in the green forest he chuckled and he chuckled to have heard him you would have thought that either he had thought of something very pleasant or something very pleasant had happened to him once he turned in the direction of farmer browns house but changed his mind as he saw the black shadows creeping out from the purple hills and once more headed for the green forest  too late today time i was home now itll keep until tomorrow he muttered then he chuckled and he was still chuckling when he reached the big hemlock tree among the thick branches of which he spent each night  dont know what started me off to the old pasture this afternoon but im glad i went my my my but im glad i went said he as he fluffed out his feathers and prepared to tuck his head under his wing it pays to snoop around in this world and see what is going on i learned a long time ago not to believe everything i hear and that the surest way to make sure of things is to find out for myself nothing like using my own eyes and my own ears well i must get to sleep he began to chuckle again and he was still chuckling as he fell asleep  the next morning sammy jay was astir at the very first sign of light he waited just long enough to see that every feather was in place for sammy is a bit vain and very particular about his dress then he headed straight for farmer browns house just as he expected he found happy jack squirrel was awake for happy jack is an early riser  good morning said sammy jay and tried very hard to make his voice sound smooth and pleasant a very hard thing for sammy to do for his voice you know is naturally harsh and unpleasant you seem to be looking as happy as ever  of course i am replied happy jack why shouldnt i be i havent a thing to worry about of course im happy and i hope youre just as happy as i am im going to get my breakfast now and then ill be happier still  thats so theres nothing like a good breakfast to make one happy said sammy jay helping himself to some suet tied to a branch of the maple tree by the way i saw an old friend of yours yesterday he inquired after you particularly he didnt exactly send his love but he said that he hoped you are as well and fat as ever and that he will see you again some time he said that he didnt know of any one he likes to look at better than you  happy jack looked flattered that was very nice of him said he who was it  guess replied sammy  happy jack scratched his head thoughtfully there were not many friends in winter most of them were asleep or had gone to the far away southland  peter rabbit he ventured  sammy shook his head  jimmy skunk  again sammy shook his head  jumper the hare  guess again said sammy chuckling  little joe otter  wrong replied sammy  i give up who was it do tell me begged happy jack  it was shadow the weasel cried sammy triumphantly  happy jack dropped the nut he was just going to eat and in place of happiness something very like fear grew and grew in his eyes ii dont believe you he stammered farmer browns boy took him away and put an end to him i saw him take him  but you didnt see him put an end to shadow declared sammy because he didnt he took him way up in the old pasture and let him go and i saw him up there yesterday thats what comes of guessing at things shadow is no more dead than you are well i must be going along i hope youll enjoy your breakfast  with this off flew sammy jay chuckling as if he thought he had done a very smart thing in upsetting happy jack which goes to show what queer ideas some people have  as for happy jack he worried for a while but as shadow didnt come and there was nothing else to worry about little by little happy jacks high spirits returned until he was as happy as ever and now though he has had many adventures since then i must leave him for there is no more room in this book perhaps if you ask him he will tell you of these other adventures himself meanwhile bashful little mrs peter rabbit is anxious that you should know something about her so i have promised to call the next book mrs peter rabbit
