outset  they first met in boston but the match was made in europe where they afterwards saw each other whither indeed he followed her and there the match was also broken off why it was broken off and why it was renewed after a lapse of years is part of quite a long lovestory which i do not think myself qualified to rehearse distrusting my fitness for a sustained or involved narration though i am persuaded that a skillful romancer could turn the courtship of basil and isabel march to excellent account fortunately for me however in attempting to tell the reader of the weddingjourney of a newly married couple no longer very young to be sure but still fresh in the light of their love i shall have nothing to do but to talk of some ordinary traits of american life as these appeared to them to speak a little of wellknown and easily accessible places to present now a bit of landscape and now a sketch of character  they had agreed to make their weddingjourney in the simplest and quietest way and as it did not take place at once after their marriage but some weeks later it had all the desired charm of privacy from the outset  how much better said isabel to go now when nobody cares whether you go or stay than to have started off upon a wretched weddingbreakfast all tears and trousseau and had people wanting to see you aboard the cars now there will not be a suspicion of honeymoonshine about us we shall go just like anybody elsewith a difference dear with a difference and she took basils cheeks between her hands in order to do this she had to ran round the table for they were at dinner and isabels aunt with whom they had begun married life sat substantial between them it was rather a girlish thing for isabel and she added with a conscious blush we are past our first youth you know and we shall not strike the public as bridal shall we my one horror in life is an evident bride  basil looked at her fondly as if he did not think her at all too old to be taken for a bride and for my part i do not object to a womans being of isabels age if she is of a good heart and temper life must have been very unkind to her if at that age she have not won more than she has lost it seemed to basil that his wife was quite as fair as when they met first eight years before but he could not help recurring with an inextinguishable regret to the long interval of their broken engagement which but for that fatality they might have spent together he imagined in just such rapture as this the regret always haunted him more or less it was part of his love the loss accounted irreparable really enriched the final gain  i dont know he said presently with as much gravity as a man can whose cheeks are clasped between a ladys hands you dont begin very well for a bride who wishes to keep her secret if you behave in this way they will put us into the bridal chambers at all the hotels and the carstheyre beginning to have them on the palacecars  just then a shadow fell into the room  wasnt that thunder isabel asked her aunt who had been contentedly surveying the tender spectacle before her o dear youll never be able to go by the boat tonight if it storms it s actually raining now  in fact it was the beginning of that terrible storm of june 1870 all in a moment out of the hot sunshine of the day it burst upon us before we quite knew that it threatened even before we had fairly noticed the clouds and it went on from passion to passion with an inexhaustible violence in the square upon which our friends looked out of their diningroom windows the trees whitened in the gusts and darkened in the driving floods of the rainfall and in some paroxysms of the tempest bent themselves in desperate submission and then with a great shudder rent away whole branches and flung them far off upon the ground hail mingled with the rain and now the few umbrellas that had braved the storm vanished and the hurtling ice crackled upon the pavement where the lightning played like flames burning from the earth while the thunder roared overhead without ceasing there was something splendidly theatrical about it all and when a streetcar laden to the last inch of its capacity came by with horses that pranced and leaped under the stinging blows of the hailstones our friends felt as if it were an effective and very naturalistic bit of pantomime contrived for their admiration yet as to themselves they were very sensible of a potent reality in the affair and at intervals during the storm they debated about going at all that day and decided to go and not to go according to the changing complexion of the elements basil had said that as this was their first journey together in america he wished to give it at the beginning as pungent a national character as possible and that as he could imagine nothing more peculiarly american than a voyage to new york by a fall river boat they ought to take that route thither so much upholstery so much music such variety cf company he understood could not be got in any other way and it might be that they would even catch a glimpse of the inventor of the combination who represented the very excess and extremity of a certain kind of americanism isabel had eagerly consented but these aesthetic motives were paralyzed for her by the thought of passing point judith in a storm and she descended from her high intents first to the inside boats without the magnificence and the orchestra and then to the idea of going by land in a sleepingcar having comfortably accomplished this feat she treated basils consent as a matter of course not because she did not regard him but because as a woman she could not conceive of the steps to her conclusion as unknown to him and always treated her own decisions as the product of their common reasoning but her husband held out for the boat and insisted that if the storm fell before seven oclock they could reach it at newport by the last express and it was this obstinacy that in proof of isabels wisdom obliged them to wait two hours in the station before going by the land route the storm abated at five oclock and though the rain continued it seemed well by a quarter of seven to set out for the old colony depot in sight of which a sudden and vivid flash of lightning caused isabel to seize her husbands arm and to implore him o dont go by the boat on this basil had the incredible weakness to yield and bade the driver take them to the worcester depot it was the first swerving from the ideal in their wedding journey but it was by no means the last though it must be confessed that it was early to begin  they both felt more tranquil when they were irretrievably committed by the purchase of their tickets and when they sat down in the waiting room of the station with all the time between seven and nine oclock before them basil would have eked out the business of checking the trunks into an affair of some length but the baggagemaster did his duty with pitiless celerity and so basil in the mere excess of his disoccupation bought an accidentinsurance ticket this employed him half a minute and then he gave up the unequal contest and went and took his place beside isabel who sat prettily wrapped in her shawl perfectly content  isnt it charming she said gayly having to wait so long it puts me in mind of some of those other journeys we took together but i cant think of those times with any patience when we might really have had each other and didnt do you remember how long we had to wait at chambery and the numbers of military gentlemen that waited too with their little waists and their kisses when they met and that poor married military gentleman with the plain wife and the two children and a tarnished uniform he seemed to be somehow in misfortune and his mustache hung down in such a spiritless way while all the other military mustaches about curled and bristled with so much boldness i think salles dattente everywhere are delightful and there is such a community of interest in them all that when i come here only to go out to brookline i feel myself a traveller once morea blessed stranger in a strange land o dear basil those were happy times after all when we might have had each other and didnt and now were the more precious for having been so long lost  she drew closer and closer to him and looked at him in a way that threatened betrayal of her bridal character  isabel you will be having your head on my shoulder next said he  never she answered fiercely recovering her distance with a start but dearest if you do see me going toact absurdly you know do stop me  im very sorry but ive got myself to stop besides i didnt undertake to preserve the incognito of this bridal party  if any accident of the sort dreaded had really happened it would not have mattered so much for as yet they were the sole occupants of the waiting room to be sure the ticketseller was there and the lady who checked packages left in her charge but these must have seen so many endearments pass between passengersthat a fleeting caress or so would scarcely have drawn their notice to our pair yet isabel did not so much even as put her hand into her husbands and as basil afterwards said it was very good practice  our temporary state whatever it is is often mirrored in all that come near us and our friends were fated to meet frequent parodies of their happiness from first to last on this journey the travesty began with the very first people who entered the waitingroom after themselves and who were a very young couple starting like themselves upon a pleasure tour which also was evidently one of the first tours of any kind that they had made it was of modest extent and comprised going to new york and back but they talked of it with a fluttered and joyful expectation as if it were a voyage to europe presently there appeared a burlesque of their happiness but with a touch of tragedy in that kind of young man who is called by the females of his class a fellow and two young women of that kind known to him as girls he took a place between these and presently began a robust flirtation with one of them he possessed himself after a brief struggle of her parasol and twirled it about as he uttered with a sort of tender rudeness inconceivable vapidities such as you would expect from none but a man of the highest fashion the girl thus courted became selfishly unconscious of everything but her own joy and made no attempt to bring the other girl within its warmth but left her to languish forgotten on the other side the latter sometimes leaned forward and tried to divert a little of the flirtation to herself but the flirters snubbed her with short answers and presently she gave up and sat still in the sad patience of uncourted women in this attitude she became a burden to isabel who was glad when the three took themselves away and were succeeded by a very stylish couplefrom new york she knew as well as if they had given her their address on west 999th street the lady was not pretty and she was not isabel thought dressed in the perfect taste of boston but she owned frankly to herself that the newyorkeress was stylish undeniably effective the gentleman bought a ticket for new york and remained at the window of the office talking quite easily with the seller  you couldnt do that my poor basil said isabel youd be afraid  o dear yes im only too glad to get off without browbeating though i must say that this officer looks affable enough really he added as an acquaintance of the ticketseller came in and nodded to him and said hot today this is very strange i always felt as if these men had no private life no friendships like the rest of us on duty they seem so like sovereigns set apart from mankind and above us all that its quite incredible they should have the common personal relations  at intervals of their talk and silence there came vivid flashes of lightning and quite heavy shocks of thunder very consoling to our friends who took them as so many compliments to their prudence in not going by the boat and who had secret doubts of their wisdom whenever these acknowledgments were withheld isabel went so far as to say that she hoped nothing would happen to the boat but i think she would cheerfully have learnt that the vessel had been obliged to put back to newport on account of the storm or even that it had been driven ashore at a perfectly safe place  people constantly came and went in the waitingroom which was sometimes quite full and again empty of all but themselves in the course of their observations they formed many cordial friendships and bitter enmities upon the ground of personal appearance or particulars of dress with people whom they saw for half a minute upon an average and they took such a keen interest in every one that it would be hard to say whether they were more concerned in an old gentleman with vigorously upright irongray hair who sat fronting them and reading all the evening papers or a young man who hurled himself through the door bought a ticket with terrific precipitation burst out again and then ran down a departing train before it got out of the station they loved the old gentleman for a certain stubborn benevolence of expression and if they had been friends of the young man and his family for generations and felt bound if any harm befell him to go and break the news gently to his parents their nerves could not have been more intimately wrought upon by his hazardous behavior still as they had their tickets for new york and he was going out on a merely local trainto brookline i believe they could not even in their anxiety repress a feeling of contempt for his unambitious destination  they were already as completely cut off from local associations and sympathies as if they were a thousand miles and many months away from boston they enjoyed the lonely flaring of the gasjets as a gust of wind drew through the station they shared the gloom and isolation of a man who took a seat in the darkest corner of the room and sat there with folded arms the genius of absence in the patronizing spirit of travellers in a foreign country they noted and approved the vases of cutflowers in the booth of the lady who checked packages and the pots of ivy in her windows these poor bostonians they said have some love of the beautiful in their rugged natures  but after all was said and thought it was only eight oclock and they still had an hour to wait  basil grew restless and isabel said with a subtile interpretation of his uneasiness i dont want anything to eat basil but i think i know the weaknesses of men and you had better go and pass the next halfhour over a plate of something indigestible  this was said con stizza the least little suggestion of it but basil rose with shameful alacrity darling if its your wish  its my fate basil said isabel  ill go he exclaimed because it isnt bridal and will help us to pass for old married people  no no basil be honest fibbing isnt your forte i wonder you went into the insurance business you ought to have been a lawyer go because you like eating and are hungry perhaps or think you may be so before we get to new york  i shall amuse myself well enough here  i suppose it is always a little shocking and grievous to a wife when she recognizes a rival in butchersmeat and the vegetables of the season with her slender relishes for pastry and confectionery and her dainty habits of lunching she cannot reconcile with the idea of her husbands capacity for breakfasting dining supping and hot meals at all hours of the day and nightas they write it on the signboards of barbaric eatinghouses but isabel would have only herself to blame if she had not perceived this trait of basils before marriage she recurred now as his figure disappeared down the station to memorable instances of his appetite in their european travels during their first engagement yes he ate terribly at susa when i was too full of the notion of getting into italy to care for bouillon and cold roast chicken at rome i thought i must break with him on account of the wildboar and at heidelberg the sausage and the hamhow could he in my presence but i took him with all his faultsand was glad to get him she added ending her meditation with a little burst of candor and she did not even think of basils appetite when he reappeared  with the thronging of many sorts of people in parties and singly into the waiting room they became once again mere observers of their kind more or less critical in temper until the crowd grew so that individual traits were merged in the character of multitude even then they could catch glimpses of faces so sweet or fine that they made themselves felt like moments of repose in the tumult and here and there was something so grotesque in dress of manner that it showed distinct from the rest the ticketsellers stamp clicked incessantly as he sold tickets to all points south and west to new york philadelphia charleston to new orleans chicago omaha to st paul duluth st louis and it would not have been hard to find in that anxious bustle that unsmiling eagerness an image of the whole busy affair of life it was not a particularly sane spectacle that impatience to be off to some place that lay not only in the distance but also in the futureto which no line of road carries you with absolute certainty across an interval of time full of every imaginable chance and influence it is easy enough to buy a ticket to cincinnati but it is somewhat harder to arrive there say that all goes well is it exactly you who arrive  in the midst of the disquiet there entered at last an old woman so very infirm that she had to be upheld on either hand by her husband and the hackman who had brought them while a young girl went before with shawls and pillows which she arranged upon the seat there the invalid lay down and turned towards the crowd a white suffering face which was yet so heavenly meek and peaceful that it comforted whoever looked at it  in spirit our happy friends bowed themselves before it and owned that there was something better than happiness in it  what is it like isabel  o i dont know darling she said but she thought perhaps it is like some blessed sorrow that takes us out of this prison of a world and sets us free of our everyday hates and desires our aims our fears ourselves maybe a long and mortal sickness might come to wear such a face in one of us two and the other could see it and not regret the poor mask of youth and pretty looks that had fallen away  she rose and went over to the sick woman on whose face beamed a tender smile as isabel spoke to her a chord thrilled in two lives hitherto unknown to each other but what was said basil would not ask when the invalid had taken isabels hand between her own as for adieu and she came back to his side with swimming eyes perhaps his wife could have given no good reason for her emotion if he had asked it but it made her very sweet and dear to him and i suppose that when a tolerably unselfish man is once secure of a womans love he is ordinarily more affected by her compassion and tenderness for other objects than by her feelings towards himself he likes well enough to think she loves me but still better how kind and good she is  they lost sight of the invalid in the hurry of getting places on the cars and they never saw her again the man at the wicketgate leading to the train had thrown it up and the people were pressing furiously through as if their lives hung upon the chance of instant passage basil had secured his ticket for the sleepingcar and so he and isabel stood aside and watched the tumult when the rash was over they passed through and as they walked up and down the platform beside the train i was thinking said isabel after i spoke to that poor old lady of what clara williams says that she wonders the happiest women in the world can look each other in the face without bursting into tears their happiness is so unreasonable and so built upon and hedged about with misery she declares that theres nothing so sad to her as a bride unless its a young mother or a little girl growing up in the innocent gayety of her heart she wonders they can live through it  clara is very much of a reformer and would make an end of all of us men i supposeexcept her father who supports her in the leisure that enables her to do her deep thinking she little knows what we poor fellows have to suffer and how often we break down in business hours and sob upon one anothers necks did that old lady talk to you in the same strain  o no she spoke very calmly of her sickness and said she had lived a blessed life perhaps it was that made me shed those few small tears she seemed a very religious person  yes said basil it is almost a pity that religion is going out but then you are to have the franchise  all aboard  this warning cry saved him from whatever heresy he might have been about to utter and presently the train carried them out into the gassprinkled darkness with an evergrowing speed that soon left the city lamps far behind it is a phenomenon whose commonness alone prevents it from being most impressive that departure of the nightexpress the two hundred miles it is to travel stretch before it traced by those slender clews to lose which is ruin and about which hang so many dangers the draw bridges that gape upon the way the trains that stand smoking and steaming on the track the rail that has borne the wear so long that it must soon snap under it the deep cut where the overhanging mass of rock trembles to its fall the obstruction that a pitiless malice may have placed in your pathyou think of these after the journey is done but they seldom haunt your fancy while it lasts the knowledge of your helplessness in any circumstances is so perfect that it begets a sense of irresponsibility almost of security and as you drowse upon the pallet of the sleeping car and feel yourself hurled forward through the obscurity you are almost thankful that you can do nothing for it is upon this condition only that you can endure it and some such condition as this i suppose accounts for many heroic facts in the world to the fantastic mood which possesses you equally sleeping or waking the stoppages of the train have a weird character and worcester springfield new haven and stamford are rather points in dreamland than wellknown towns of new england as the train stops you drowse if you have been waking and wake if you have been in a doze but in any case you are aware of the locomotive hissing and coughing beyond the station of flaring gasjets of clattering feet of passengers getting on and off then of some one conductor or stationmaster walking the whole length of the train and then you are aware of an insane satisfaction in renewed flight through the darkness you think hazily of the folk in their beds in the town left behind who stir uneasily at the sound of your trains departing whistle and so all is a blank vigil or a blank slumber  by daylight basil and isabel found themselves at opposite ends of the car struggling severally with the problem of the mornings toilet when the combat was ended they were surprised at the decency of their appearance and isabel said i think im presentable to an early broadway public and ive a fancy for not going to a hotel lucy will be expecting us out there before noon and we can pass the time pleasantly enough for a few hours just wandering about  she was a woman who loved any cheap defiance of custom and she had an agreeable sense of adventure in what she proposed besides she felt that nothing could be more in the unconventional spirit in which they meant to make their whole journey than a stroll about new york at halfpast six in the morning  delightful answered basil who was always charmed with these small originalities you look well enough for an evening party and besides you wont meet one of your own critical class on broadway at this hour we will breakfast at one of those gilded metropolitan restaurants and then go round to leonards who will be able to give us just three unhurried seconds after that well push on out to his place  at that early hour there were not many people astir on the wide avenue down which our friends strolled when they left the station but in the aspect of those they saw there was something that told of a greater heat than they had yet known in boston and they were sensible of having reached a more southern latitude the air though freshened by the overnights storm still wanted the briskness and sparkle and pungency of the boston air which is as delicious in summer as it is terrible in winter and the faces that showed themselves were sodden from the yesterdays heat and perspiration a cornergrocer seated in a sort of fierce despondency upon a keg near his shop door had lightly equipped himself for the struggle of the day in the battered armor of the day before and in a pair of roomy pantaloons and a baggy shirt of neutral tintperhaps he had made a vow not to change it whilst the siege of the hot weather lastednow confronted the advancing sunlight before which the long shadows of the buildings were slowly retiring a marketing mother of a family paused at a provisionstore and looking weakly in at the whiteaproned butcher among his meats and flies passes without an effort to purchase hurried and wearied shopgirls tripped by in the draperies that betrayed their sad necessity to be both fine and shabby from a boardinghouse door issued briskly one of those cool young new yorkers whom no circumstances can oppress breezycoated whitelivened clean with a good cigar in the mouth a light cane caught upon the elbow of one of the arms holding up the paper from which the mornings news is snatched whilst the person sways lightly with the walk in the streetcars that slowly tinkled up and down were rows of people with baskets between their legs and papers before their faces and all showed by some peculiarity of air or dress the excess of heat which they had already borne and to which they seemed to look forward and gave by the scantiness of their number a vivid impression of the uncounted thousands within doors prolonging before the days terror began the oblivion of sleep  as they turned into one of the numerical streets to cross to broadway and found themselves in a yet deeper seclusion basilbegan to utter in a musing tone          a city against the worlds gray prime         lost in some desert far from time         where noiseless ages gliding through         have only sifted sands and dew         yet still a marble head of man         lying on all the haunted plan         the passions of the human heart         beating the marble breast of art         were not more lone to one who first         upon its giant silence burst         than this strange quiet where the tide         of life upheaved on either aide         hangs trembling ready soon to beat         with human waves the morning street  how lovely said isabel swiftly catching at her skirt and deftly escaping contact with one of a long row of ashbarrels posted sentinellike on the edge of the pavement whose is it basil  ah a poets answered her husband a man of whom we shall one day any of us be glad to say that we liked him before he was famous what a nebulous sweetness the first lines have and what a clear cool light of daybreak in the last  you could have been as good a poet as that basil said the everpersonal and concretelyspeaking isabel who could not look at a mountain without thinking what basil might have done in that way if he had tried  o no i couldnt dear its very difficult being any poet at all though its easy to be like one but ive done with it i broke with the muse the day you accepted me she came into my office looking so shabbynot unlike one of those poor shopgirls and as i was very well dressed from having just been to see you why you know i felt the difference well my dear said i not quite liking the look of reproach she was giving me you are groins to leave me she answered sadly well yes i suppose i must you see the insurance business is very absorbing and besides it has a bad appearance your coming about so in office hours and in those clothes o she moaned out you used to welcome me at all times out in the country and thought me prettily dressed yes yes but this is boston and boston makes a great difference in ones ideas and im going to be married too come i dont want to seem ungrateful we have had many pleasant times together i own it and ive no objections to your being present at christmas and thanksgiving and birthdays but really i must draw the line there she gave me a look that made my heart ache and went straight to my desk and took out of a pigeon hole a lot of papersodes upon your cruelty isabel songs to you sonnetsthe sonnet a mighty poor one id made the day beforeand threw them all into the grate then she turned to me again signed adieu with mute lips and passed out i could hear the bottom wire of the poor things hoopskirt clicking against each step of the stairway as she went slowly and heavily down to the street o dontdont basil said his wife it seems like something wrong i think you ought to have been ashamed  ashamed i was heart broken but it had to come to that as i got hopeful about you the muse became a sad bore and more than once i found myself smiling at her when her back was turned the muse doesnt like being laughed at any more than another woman would and she would have left me shortly no i couldnt be a poet like our morningstreet friend but see the human wave is beginning to sprinkle the pavement with cooks and secondgirls  they were frowzy servingmaids and silent each swept down her own door steps and the pavement in front of her own house and then knocked her broom on the curbstone and vanished into the house on which the hand of change had already fallen it was no longer a street solely devoted to the domestic gods but had been invaded at more than one point by the bustling deities of business in such streets the irregular inspired doctors and doctresses come first with inordinate doorplates then a milliner filling the parlor window with new bonnets here even a publisher had hung his sign beside a door through which the feet of young ladies used to trip and the feet of little children to patter here and there stood groups of dwellings unmolested as yet outwardly but even these had a certain careworn and guilty air as if they knew themselves to be cheapish boardinghouses or furnished lodgings for gentlemen and were trying to hide it to these belonged the frowzy servingwomen to these the rows of ashbarrels in which the decrepit children and mothers of the streets were clawing for bits of coal  by the time basil and isabel reached broadway there were already some omnibuses beginning their long days travel up and down the handsome tiresome length of that avenue but for the most part it was empty there was of course a hurry of footpassengers upon the sidewalks but these were sparse and uncharacteristic for new york proper was still fast asleep the waiter at the restaurant into which our friends stepped was so well aware of this and so perfectly assured they were not of the city that he could not forbear a little patronage of them which they did not resent he brought basil what he had ordered in barbaric abundance and charged for it with barbaric splendor it is all but impossible not to wish to stand well with your waiter i have myself been often treated with conspicuous rudeness by the tribe yet i have never been able to withhold the douceur that marked me for a gentleman in their eyes and entitled me to their dishonorable esteem basil was not superior to this folly and left the waster with the conviction that if he was not a new yorker he was a highbred man of the world at any rate  vexed by a sense of his own pitifulness this man of the world continued his pilgrimage down broadway which even in that desert state was full of a certain interest troops of laborers straggled along the pavements each with his dinnerpail in hand and in many places the eternal building up and pulling down was already going on carts were struggling up the slopes of vast cellars with loads of distracting rubbish here stood the halfdemolished walls of a house with a sad variety of wallpaper showing in the different rooms there clinked the trowel upon the brick yonder the hammer on the stone overhead swung and threatened the marble block that the derrick was lifting to its place as yet these forces of demolition and construction had the business of the street almost to themselves  why how shabby the street is said isabel at last when i landed after being abroad i remember that broadway impressed me with its splendor  ah i but you were merely coming from europe then and now you arrive from burton and are contrasting this poor broadway with washington street dont be hard upon it isabel every street cant be a boston street you know said basil isabel herself a bostonian of great intensity both by birth and conviction believed her husband the only man able to have thoroughly baffled the malignity of the stars in causing him to be born out of boston yet he sometimes trifled with his hardly achieved triumph and even showed an indifference to it with an insincerity of which there can be no doubt whatever  o stuff she retorted as if i had any of that silly local pride though you know well enough that boston is the best place in the world but basil i suppose broadway strikes us as so fine on coming ashore from europe because we hardly expect anything of america then  well i dont know perhaps the street has some positive grandeur of its own though it needs a multitude of people in it to bring out its best effects ill allow its disheartening shabbiness and meanness in many ways but to stand in front of grace church on a clear daya day of late september sayand look down the swarming length of broadway on the movement and the numbers while the niagara roar swelled and swelled from those human rapids was always like strong new wine to me i dont think the world affords such another sight and for one moment at such times id have been willing to be an irish councilman that i might have some right to the pride i felt in the capital of the irish republic what a fine thing it must be for each victim of six centuries of oppression to reflect that he owns at least a dozen americans and that with his fellows he rules a hundred helpless millionaires  like all daughters of a free country isabel knew nothing about politics and she felt that she was getting into deep water she answered buoyantly but she was glad to make her weariness the occasion of hailing a stage and changing the conversation the farther down town they went the busier the street grew and about the astor house where they alighted there was already a bustle that nothing but a fire could have created at the same hour in boston a little farther on the steeple of trinity rose high into the scorching sunlight while below in the shadow that was darker than it was cool slumbered the old graves among their flowers  how still they lie mused the happy wife peering through the iron fence in passing  yes their weddingjourneys are ended poor things said basil and through both their minds flashed the wonder if they should ever come to something like that but it appeared so impossible that they both smiled at the absurdity  its too early yet for leonard continued basil what a pity the churchyard is locked up we could spend the time so delightfully in it but never mind let us go down to the batteryit s not a very pleasant place but its near and its historical and its openwhere these drowsy friends of ours used to take the air when they were in the fashion and had some occasion for the element in its freshness you can imagineits cheaphow they used to see mr burr and mr hamilton down there  all places that fashion has once loved and abandoned are very melancholy but of all such places i think the battery is the most forlorn are there some sickly locusttrees there that cast a tremulous and decrepit shade upon the mangy grassplots i believe so but i do not make sure i am certain only of the mangy grassplots or rather the spaces between the paths thinly overgrown with some kind of refuse and opprobrious weed a stunted and pauper vegetation proper solely to the new york battery at that hour of the summer morning when our friends with the aimlessness of strangers who are waiting to do something else saw the ancient promenade a few scant and hungryeyed little boys and girls were wandering over this weedy growth not playing but moving listlessly to and fro fantastic in the wild inaptness of their costumes one of these little creatures wore with an odd involuntary jauntiness the castoff best drew of some happier child a gay little garment cut low in the neck and short in the sleeves which gave her the grotesque effect of having been at a party the night before presently came two jaded women a mother and a grandmother that appeared when they had crawled out of their beds to have put on only so much clothing as the law compelled they abandoned themselves upon the green stuff whatever it was and with their lean hands clasped outside their knees sat and stared silent and hopeless at the eastern sky at the heart of the terrible furnace into which in those days the world seemed cast to be burnt up while the child which the younger woman had brought with her feebly wailed unheeded at her side on one side of these women were the shameless houses out of which they might have crept and which somehow suggested riotous maritime dissipation on the other side were those houses in which had once dwelt rich and famous folk but which were now dropping down the boardinghouse scale through various unhomelike occupations to final dishonor and despair down nearer the water and not far from the castle that was once a playhouse and is now the depot of emigration stood certain expresswagons and about these lounged a few hardlooking men beyond laughed and danced the fresh blue water of the bay dotted with sails and smokestacks  well said basil i think if i could choose i should like to be a friendless german boy setting foot for the first time on this happy continent fancy his rapture on beholding this lovely spot and these charming american faces what a smiling aspect life in the new world must wear to his young eyes and how his heart must leap within him  yes basil its all very pleasing and thank you for bringing me but if you dont think of any other new york delights to show me do let us go and sit in leonards office till he comes and then get out into the country as soon as possible  basil defended himself against the imputation that he had been trying to show new york to his wife or that he had any thought but of whiling away the long morning hours until it should be time to go to leonard he protested that a knowledge of europe made new york the most uninteresting town in america and that it was the last place in the world where he should think of amusing himself or any one else and then they both upbraided the citys bigness and dullness with an enjoyment that none but bostonians can know they particularly derided the notion of new yorks being loved by any one it was immense it was grand in some ways parts of it were exceedingly handsome but it was too vast too coarse too restless they could imagine its being liked by a successful young man of business or by a rich young girl ignorant of life and with not too nice a taste in her pleasures but that it should be dear to any poet or scholar or any woman of wisdom and refinement that they could not imagine they could not think of any ones loving new york as dante loved florence or as madame de stael loved paris or as johnson loved black homely homelike london and as they twittered their little dispraises the giant mother of commerce was growing more and more conscious of herself waking from her nights sleep and becoming aware of her fleets and trains and the myriad hands and wheels that throughout the whole sea and land move for her and do her will even while she sleeps all about the weddingjourneyers swelled the deep tide of life back from its nightlong ebb broadway had filled her length with people not yet the most characteristic new york crowd but the not less interesting multitude of strangers arrived by the early boats and trams and that easily distinguishable class of lately newyorkized people from other places about whom in the metropolis still hung the provincial traditions of early rising and over all from moment to moment the eager audacious welldressed proper life of the mighty city was beginning to prevailthough this was not so notable where basil and isabel had paused at a certain window it was the office of one of the english steamers and he was saying it was by this line i sailed you knowand she was interrupting him with when who could have dreamed that you would ever be telling me of it here so the old marvel was wondered over anew till it filled the world in which there was room for nothing but the strangeness that they should have loved each other so long and not made it known that they should ever have uttered it and that being uttered it should be so much more and better than ever could have been dreamed the broken engagement was a fable of disaster that only made their present fortune more prosperous the city ceased about them and they walked on up the street the first man and first woman in the garden of the newmade earth as they were both very conscious people they recognized in themselves some sense of this and presently drolled it away in the opulence of a time when every moment brought some beautiful dream and the soul could be prodigal of its bliss  i think if i had the naming of the animals over again this morning i shouldnt call snakes snakes should you eve laughed basil in intricate acknowledgment of his happiness  o no adam wed look out all the most graceful euphemisms in the newspapers and we wouldnt hurt the feelings of a spider     ii midsummerdays dream  they had waited to see leonard in order that they might learn better how to find his house in the country and now when they came in upon him at nine oclock he welcomed them with all his friendly heart he rose from the pile of mornings letters to which he had but just sat down he placed them the easiest chairs he made a feint of its not being a busy hour with him and would have had them look upon his office which was still damp and odorous from the porters broom as a kind of downtown parlor but after they had briefly accounted to his amazement for their appearance then and there and isabel had boasted of the original fashion in which they had that morning seen new york they took pity on him and bade him adieu till evening  they crossed from broadway to the noisome street by the ferry and in a little while had taken their places in the train on the other side of the water  dont tell me basil said isabel that leonard travels fifty miles every day by rail going to and from his work  i must dearest if i would be truthful  then darling there are worse things in this world than living up at the south end arent there and in agreement upon boston as a place of the greatest natural advantages as well as all acquirable merits with after talk that need not be recorded they arrived in the best humor at the little country station near which the leonards dwelt  i must inevitably follow mrs isabel thither though i do it at the cost of the reader who suspects the excitements which a long description of the movement would delay the ladies were very old friends and they had not met since isabels return from europe and renewal of her engagement upon the news of this mrs leonard had swallowed with surprising ease all that she had said in blame of basils conduct during the rupture and exacted a promise from her friend that she should pay her the first visit after their marriage and now that they had come together their only talk was of husbands whom they viewed in every light to which husbands could be turned and still found an inexhaustible novelty in the theme mrs leonard beheld in her friends joy the sweet reflection of her own honeymoon and isabel was pleased to look upon the prosperous marriage of the former as the image of her future thus with immense profit and comfort they reassured one another by every question and answer and in their weak content lapsed far behind the representative women of our age when husbands are at best a necessary evil and the relation of wives to them is known to be one of pitiable subjection when these two pretty fogies put their heads of false hair together they were as silly and benighted as their greatgrandmothers could have been in the same circumstances and as i say shamefully encouraged each other in their absurdity the absurdity appeared too good and blessed to be true do you really suppose basil isabel would say to her oppressor after having given him some elegant extract from the last conversation upon husbands that we shall get on as smoothly as the leonards when we have been married ten years lucy says that things go more hitchily the first year than ever they do afterwards and that people love each other better and better just because theyve got used to it well our bliss does seem a little crude and garish compared with their happiness and yetshe put up both her palms against his and gave a vehement little pushthere is something agreeable about it even at this stage of the proceedings  isabel said her husband with severity this is bridal  no matter i only want to seem an old married woman to the general public but the application of it is that you must be careful not to contradict me or cross me in anything so that we can be like the leonards very much sooner than they became so the great object is not to have any hitchiness and you know you are provokingat times  they both educated themselves for continued and tranquil happiness by the example and precept of their friends and the time passed swiftly in the pleasant learning and in the novelty of the life led by the leonards this indeed merits a closer study than can be given here for it is the life led by vast numbers of prosperous new yorkers who love both the excitement of the city and the repose of the country and who aspire to unite the enjoyment of both in their daily existence the suburbs of the metropolis stretch landward fifty miles in every direction and everywhere are handsome villas like leonards inhabited by men like himself whom strict study of the timetable enables to spend all their working hours in the city and all their smoking and sleeping hours in the country  the home and the neighborhood of the leonards put on their best looks for our bridal pair and they were charmed they all enjoyed the visit said guests and hosts they were all sorry to have it come to an end yet they all resigned themselves to this conclusion practically it had no other result than to detain the travellers into the very heart of the hot weather in that weather it was easy to do anything that did not require an active effort and resignation was so natural with the mercury at ninety that i am not sure but there was something sinful in it  they had given up their cherished purpose of going to albany by the day boat which was represented to them in every impossible phase it would be dreadfully crowded and whenever it stopped the heat would be insupportable besides it would bring them to albany at an hour when they must either spend the night there or push on to niagara by the night train you had better go by the evening boat it will be light almost till you reach west point and youll see all the best scenery then you can get a good nights rest and start fresh in the morning so they were counseled and they assented as they would have done if they had been advised you had better go by the morning boat its deliciously cool travelling you see the whole of the river you reach albany for supper and you push through to niagara that night and are done with it  they took leave of leonard at breakfast and of his wife at noon and fifteen minutes later they were rushing from the heat of the country into the heat of the city where some affairs and pleasures were to employ them till the evening boat should start  their spirits were low for the terrible spell of the great heat brooded upon them all abroad burned the fierce white light of the sun in which not only the earth seemed to parch and thirst but the very air withered and was faint and thin to the troubled respiration their train was full of people who had come long journeys from broiling cities of the west and who were dusty and ashen and reeking in the slumbers at which some of them still vainly caught on every one lay an awful languor here and there stirred a fan like the broken wing of a dying bird now and then a sweltering young mother shifted her hot baby from one arm to another after every station the desperate conductor swung through the long aisle and punched the ticket which each passenger seemed to yield him with a tacit malediction a suffering child hung about the empty tank which could only gasp out a cindery drop or two of icewater the wind buffeted faintly at the windows when the door was opened the clatter of the rails struck through and through the car like a demoniac yell  yet when they arrived at the station by the ferryside they seemed to have entered its stifling darkness from fresh and vigorous atmosphere so close and dead and mined with the carbonic breath of the locomotives was the air of the place the thin old wooden walls that shut out the glare of the sun transmitted an intensified warmth the roof seemed to hover lower and lower and in its coalsmoked raftery hollow to generate a heat deadlier than that poured upon it from the skies  in a convenient place in the station hung a thermometer before which every passenger on going aboard the ferryboat paused as at a shrine and mutely paid his devotions at the altar of this fetich our friends also paused and saw that the mercury was above ninety and exulting with the pride that savages take in the cruel might of their idols bowed their souls to the great god heat  on the boat they found a place where the breath of the sea struck cool across their faces and made them forget the thermometer for the brief time of the transit but presently they drew near that strange irregular row of wooden buildings and jutting piers which skirts the river on the new york aide and before the boats motion ceased the air grew thick and warm again and tainted with the foulness of the street on which the buildings front upon this the boats passengers issued passing up through a gangway on one side of which a throng of returnpassengers was pent by a gate of iron barn like a herd of wild animals they were streaming with perspiration and according to their different temperaments had faces of deep crimson or deadly pallor  now the question is my dear said basil when free of the press they lingered for a moment in the shade outside whether we had better walk up to broadway at an immediate sacrifice of fibre and get a stage there or take one of these cars here and be landed a little nearer with half the exertion by this route we shall have sights end smells which the other cant offer us but whichever we take we shall be sorry  then i say take this decided isabel i want to be sorry upon the easiest possible terms this weather  they hailed the first car that passed and got into it well for them both if she could have exercised this philosophy with regard to the whole days business or if she could have given up her plans for it with the same resignation she had practiced in regard to the day boat it seems to me a proof of the small advance our race has made in true wisdom that we find it so hard to give up doing anything we have meant to do it matters very little whether the affair is one of enjoyment or of business we feel the same bitter need of pursuing it to the end the mere fact of intention gives it a flavor of duty and dutiolatry as one may call the devotion has passed so deeply into our life that we have scarcely a sense any more of the sweetness of even a neglected pleasure we will not taste the fine guilty rapture of a deliberate dereliction the gentle sin of omission is all but blotted from the calendar of our crimes if i had been columbus i should have thought twice before setting sail when i was quite ready to do so and as for plymouth rock i should have sternly resisted the blandishments of those twin sirens starvation and cold who beckoned the puritans shoreward and as soon as ever i came in sight of their granite perch should have turned back to england but it is now too late to repair these errors and so on one of the hottest days of last year behold my obdurate bridal pair in a tenth or twentieth avenue horsecar setting forth upon the fulfillment of a series of intentions any of which had wiselier been left unaccomplished isabel had said they would call upon certain people in fiftieth street and then shop slowly down icecreaming and staging and variously cooling and calming by the way until they reached the ticketoffice on broadway whence they could indefinitely betake themselves to the steamboat an hour or two before her departure she felt that they had yielded sufficiently to circumstances and conditions already on this journey and she was resolved that the present halfday in new york should be the halfday of her original design  it was not the most advisable thing as i have allowed but it was inevitable and it afforded them a spectacle which is by no means wanting in sublimity and which is certainly uniquethe spectacle of that great city on a hot day defiant of the elements and prospering on with every form of labor and at a terrible cost of life the man carrying the hod to the top of the walls that rankly grow and grow as from his lifes blood will only lay down his load when he feels the mortal glare of the sun blaze in upon heart and brain the plethoric millionaire for whom he toils will plot and plan in his office till he swoons at the desk the trembling beast must stagger forward while the flamefaced tormentor on the box has strength to lash him on in all those vast palaces of commerce there are ceaseless sale and purchase packing and unpacking lifting up and laying down arriving and departing loads in thousands of shops is the unspared and unsparing weariness of selling in the street filled by the hurry and suffering of tens of thousands is the weariness of buying  their afternoons experience was something that basil and isabel could when it was past look upon only as a kind of vision magnificent at times and at other times full of indignity and pain they seemed to have dreamed of a long horsecar pilgrimage through that squalid street by the riverside where presently they came to a market opening upon the view hideous vistas of carnage and then into a wide avenue with processions of cars like their own coming and going up and down the centre of a foolish and useless breadth which made even the tall buildings rising gauntly up among the older houses of one or two stories on either hand look low and let in the sun to bake the dust that the hot breaths of wind caught up and gent swirling into the shabby shops here they dreamed of the eternal demolition and construction of the city and farther on of vacant lots full of granite boulders clambered over by goats in their dream they had fellowpassengers whose sufferings made them odious and whom they were glad to leave behind when they alighted from the car and running out of the blaze of the avenue quenched themselves in the shade of the crossstreet a little strip of shadow lay along the row of brownstone fronts but there were intervals where the vacant lots cast no shadow with great bestowal of thought they studied hopelessly how to avoid these spaces as if they had been difficult torrents or vast expanses of desert sand they crept slowly along till they came to such a place and dashed swiftly across it and then fainter than before moved on they seemed now and then to stand at doors and to be told that people were out and again that they were in and they had a sense of cool dark parlors and the airy rustling of lightmuslined ladies of chat and of fans and icewater and then they came forth again and evermore       the day increased from heat to heat  at last they were aware of an end of their visits and of a purpose to go down town again and of seeking the nearest car by endless blocks of brownstone fronts which with their eternal brownstone flights of steps and their handsome intolerable uniformity oppressed them like a procession of houses trying to pass a given point and never getting by upon these streets there was seldom a soul to be seen so that when their ringing at a door had evoked answer it had startled them with a vague sad surprise in the distance on either hand they could see cars and carts and wagons toiling up and down the avenues and on the next intersecting pavement sometimes a laborer with his jacket slung across his shoulder or a dog that had plainly made up his mind to go mad up to the time of their getting into one of those phantasmal cars for the return downtownwards they had kept up a show of talk in their wretched dream they had spoken of other hot days that they had known elsewhere and they had wondered that the tragical character of heat had been so little recognized they said that the daily new york murder might even at that moment be somewhere taking place and that no murder of the whole homicidal year could have such proper circumstance they morbidly wondered what that days murder would be and in what swarming tenementhouse or den of the assassin streets by the riversidesif indeed it did not befall in some such high closeshuttered handsome dwelling as those they passed in whose twilight it would be so easy to strike down the master and leave him undiscovered and unmourned by the family ignorantly absent at the mountains or the seaside they conjectured of the horror of midsummer battles and pictured the anguish of shipwrecked men upon a tropical coast and the grimy misery of stevedores unloading shiny cargoes of anthracite coal at city docks but now at last as they took seats opposite one another in the crowded car they seemed to have drifted infinite distances and long epochs asunder they looked hopelessly across the intervening gulf and mutely questioned when it was and from what far city they or some remote ancestors of theirs had set forth upon a wedding journey they bade each other a tacit farewell and with patient pathetic faces awaited the end of the world  when they alighted they took their way up through one of the streets of the great wholesale businesses to broadway on this street was a throng of trucks and wagons lading and unlading bales and boxes rose and sank by pulleys overhead the footway was a labyrinth of packages of every shape and size there was no flagging of the pitiless energy that moved all forward no sign of how heavy a weight lay on it save in the reeking faces of its helpless instruments but when the weddingjourneyers emerged upon broadway the other passages and incidents of their dream faded before the superior fantasticality of the spectacle it was four oclock the deadliest hour of the deadly summer day the spiritless air seemed to have a quality of blackness in it as if filled with the gloom of lowhovering wings one half the street lay in shadow and one half in sun but the sunshine itself was dim as if a heat greater than its own had smitten it with languor little gusts of sick warm wind blew across the great avenue at the corners of the intersecting streets in the upward distance at which the journeyers looked the loftier roofs and steeples lifted themselves dim out of the livid atmosphere and far up and down the length of the street swept a stream of tormented life all sorts of wheeled things thronged it conspicuous among which rolled and jarred the gaudily painted stages with quivering horses driven each by a man who sat in the shade of a branching white umbrella and suffered with a moody truculence of aspect and as if he harbored the bitterness of death in his heart for the crowding passengers within when one of them pulled the strap about his legs and summoned him to halt most of the footpassengers kept to the shady side and to the unaccustomed eyes of the strangers they were not less in number than at any other time though there were fewer women among them indomitably resolute of soul they held their course with the swift pace of custom and only here and there they showed the effect of the heat one man collarless with waistcoat unbuttoned and hat set far back from his forehead waved a fan before his deathwhite flabby face and set down one foot after the other with the heaviness of a somnambulist another as they passed him was saying huskily to the friend at his side i cant stand this much longer my hands tingle as if they had gone to sleep my heart but still the multitude hurried on passing repassing encountering evading vanishing into shopdoors and emerging from them dispersing down the side streets and swarming out of them it was a scene that possessed the beholder with singular fascination and in its effect of universal lunacy it might well have seemed the last phase of a world presently to be destroyed they who were in it but not of it as they fancied though there was no reason for thislooked on it amazed and at last their own errands being accomplished and themselves so far cured of the madness of purpose they cried with one voice that it was a hideous sight and strove to take refuge from it in the nearest place where the sodafountain sparkled  it was a vain desire at the front door of the apothecarys hung a thermometer and as they entered they heard the next comer cry out with a maniacal pride in the affliction laid upon mankind ninetyseven degrees behind them at the door there poured in a ceaseless stream of people each pausing at the shrine of heat before he tossed off the hissing draught that two pale closeclipped boys served them from either side of the fountain then in the order of their coming they issued through another door upon the side street each as he disappeared turning his face half round and casting a casual glance upon a little group near another counter the group was of a very patient halffrightened halfpuzzled looking gentleman who sat perfectly still on a stool and of a lady who stood beside him rubbing all over his head a handkerchief full of pounded ice and easing one hand with the other when the first became tired basil drank his soda and paused to look upon this group which he felt would commend itself to realistic sculpture as eminently characteristic of the local life and as the sunstroke would sell enormously in the hot season better take a little more of that the apothecary said looking up from his prescription and as the organized sympathy of the seemingly indifferent crowd smiling very kindly at his patient who thereupon tasted something in the glass he held do you still feel like fainting asked the humane authority slightly now and then answered the other but im hanging on hard to the bottom curve of that icicled s on your sodafountain and i feel that im all right as long as i can see that the people get rather hazy occasionally and have no features to speak of but i dont know that i look very impressive myself he added in the jesting mood which seems the natural condition of americans in the face of all embarrassments  o youll do the apothecary answered with a laugh but he said in answer to an anxious question from the lady he mustnt be moved for an hour yet and gayly pestled away at a prescription while she resumed her office of grinding the pounded ice round and round upon her husbands skull isabel offered her the commiseration of friendly words and of looks kinder yet and then seeing that they could do nothing she and basil fell into the endless procession and passed out of the side door what a shocking thing she whispered did you see how all the people looked one after another so indifferently at that couple and evidently forgot them the next instant it was dreadful i shouldnt like to have you sunstruck in new york  thats very considerate of you but place for place if any accident must happen to me among strangers i think i should prefer to have it in new york the biggest place is always the kindest as well as the cruelest place amongst the thousands of spectators the good samaritan as well as the levite would be sure to be as for a sunstroke it requires peculiar gifts but if you compel me to a choice in the matter then i say give me the busiest part of broadway for a sunstroke there is such experience of calamity there that you could hardly fall the first victim to any misfortune probably the gentleman at the apothecarys was merely exhausted by the heat and ran in there for revival the apothecary has a case of the kind on his hands every blazing afternoon and knows just what to do the crowd may be a little ennuye of sunstrokes and to that degree indifferent but they most likely know that they can only do harm by an expression of sympathy and so they delegate their pity as they have delegated their helpfulness to the proper authority and go about their business if a man was overcome in the middle of a village street the blundering country druggist wouldnt know what to do and the tenderhearted people would crowd about so that no breath of air could reach the victim  may be so dear said the wife pensively but if anything did happen to you in new york i should like to have the spectators look as if they saw a human being in trouble perhaps im a little exacting  i think you are nothing is so hard as to understand that there are human beings in this world besides ones self and ones set but let us be selfishly thankful that it isnt you and i there in the apothecarys shop as it might very well be and let us get to the boat as soon as we can and end this horrible midsummerdays dream we must have a carriage he added with tardy wisdom hailing an empty hack as we ought to have had all day though im not sorry now the worsts over to have seen the worst     iii the night boat  there is little proportion about either pain or pleasure a headache darkens the universe while it lasts a cup of tea really lightens the spirit bereft of all reasonable consolations therefore i do not think it trivial or untrue to say that there is for the moment nothing more satisfactory in life than to have bought your ticket on the night boat up the hudson and secured your stateroom key an hour or two before departure and some time even before the pressure at the clerks office has begun in the transaction with this castellated baron you have of course been treated with haughtiness but not with ferocity and your selfrespect swells with a sense of having escaped positive insult your key clicks cheerfully in your pocket against its guttapercha number and you walk up and down the gorgeously carpeted singlecolumned twostory cabin amid a multitude of plush sofas and chairs a glitter of glass and a tinkle of prismatic chandeliers overhead unawed even by the aristocratic gloom of the yellow waiters your own stateroom as you enter it from time to time is an evernew surprise of splendors a magnificent effect of amplitude of mahogany bedstead of lace curtains and of marble topped washstand in the mere wantonness of an unalloyed prosperity you say to the saffron nobleman nearest your door bring me a pitcher of icewater quick please and you do not find the halfhour that he is gone very long  if the ordinary wayfarer experiences so much pleasure from these things then imagine the infinite comfort of our weddingjourneyers transported from broadway on that pitiless afternoon to the shelter and the quiet of that absurdly palatial steamboat it was not yet crowded and by the riverside there was almost a freshness in the air they disposed of their troubling bags and packages they complimented the ridiculous princeliness of their stateroom and then they betook themselves to the sheltered space aft of the saloon where they sat down for the tranquiller observance of the wharf and whatever should come to be seen by them like all people who have just escaped with their lives from some menacing calamity they were very philosophical in spirit and having got aboard of their own motion and being neither of them apparently the worse for the ordeal they had passed through were of a light conversational temper  what an amusingly superb affair basil cried as they glanced through an open window down the long vista of the saloon good heavens isabel does it take all this to get us plain republicans to albany in comfort and safety or are we really a nation of princes in disguise well i shall never be satisfied with less hereafter he added i am spoilt for ordinary paint and upholstery from this hour i am a ruinous spendthrift and a humble threestory swellfront up at the south end is no longer the place for me dearest       let us swear an oath and keep it with an equal mind  never to leave this aladdinspalacelike steamboat but spend our lives in perpetual trips up and down the hudson  to which not very costly banter isabel responded in kind and rapidly sketched the life they could lead aboard since they could not help it they mocked the public provision which leaving no interval between disgraceful squalor and ludicrous splendor accommodates our democratic menage to the taste of the richest and most extravagant plebeian amongst us he unhappily minds danger and oppression as little as he minds money so long as he has a spectacle and a sensation and it is this ruthless imbecile who will have lace curtains to the steamboat berth into which he gets with his pantaloons on and out of which he may be blown by an exploding boiler at any moment it is he who will have for supper that overgrown and shapeless dinner in the lower saloon and will not let any one else buy tea or toast for a less sum than he pays for his surfeit it is he who perpetuates the insolence of the clerk and the reluctance of the waiters it is he in fact who now comes out of the saloon with his womenkind and takes chairs under the awning where basil and isabel sit personally he is not so bad he is goodlooking like all of us he is better dressed than most of us he behaves himself quietly if not easily and no lord so loathes a scene next year he is going to europe where he will not show to so much advantage as here but for the present it would be hard to say in what way he is vulgar and perhaps vulgarity is not so common a thing after all  it was something besides the river that made the air so much more sufferable than it had been over the city since our friends had come aboard the boat a black cloud had gathered and now hung low upon it while the wind from the face of the water took the dust in the neighboring streets and frolicked it about the housetops and in the faces of the arriving passengers who as the moment of departure drew near appeared in constantly increasing numbers and in greater variety with not only the trepidation of going upon them but also with the electrical excitement people feel before a tempest  the breast of the black cloud was now zigzagged from moment to moment by lightning and claps of deafening thunder broke from it at last the long endurance of the day was spent and out of its convulsion burst floods of rain again and again sweeping the promenadedeck where the people sat and driving them disconsolate into the saloon the air was darkened as by night and with many regrets for the vanishing prospect mingled with a sense of relief from the heat our friends felt the boat tremble away from her moorings and set forth upon her trip  ah if we had only taken the day boat moaned isabel now we shall see nothing of the river landscape and we shall never be able to put ourselves down when we long for europe by declaring that the scenery of the hudson is much finer than that of the rhine  yet they resolved this indomitably goodnatured couple that they would be just even to the elements which had by no means been generous to them and they owned that if so noble a storm had celebrated their departure upon some storied river from some more romantic port than new york they would have thought it an admirable thing even whilst they contented themselves the storm passed and left a veiled and humid sky overhead that gave a charming softness to the scene on which their eyes fell when they came out of the saloon again and took their places with a largely increased companionship on the deck  they had already reached that part of the river where the uplands begin and their course was between stately walls of rocky steepness or wooded slopes or grassy hollows the scene forever losing and taking grand and lovely shape wreaths of mist hung about the tops of the loftier headlands and long shadows draped their sides as the night grew lights twinkled from a lonely house here and there in the valleys a swarm of lamps showed a town where it lay upon the lap or at the foot of the hills behind them stretched the great gray river haunted with many sails now a group of canalboats grappled together and having an air of coziness in their adventure upon this strange current out of their own sluggish waters drifted out of sight and now a smaller and slower steamer making a laborious show of keeping up was passed and reluctantly fell behind along the waters edge rattled and hooted the frequent trains they could not tell at any time what part of the river they were on and they could not if they would have made its beauty a matter of conscientious observation but all the more therefore they deeply enjoyed it without reference to time or place they felt some natural pain when they thought that they might unwittingly pass the scenes that irving has made part of the common dreamland and they would fair have seen the lighted windows of the house out of which a cheerful ray has penetrated to so many hearts but being sure of nothing as they were they had the comfort of finding the tappan zee in every expanse of the river and of discovering sunnyside on every pleasant slope by virtue of this helplessness the hudson without ceasing to be the hudson became from moment to moment all fair and stately streams upon which they had voyaged or read of voyaging from the nile to the mississippi there is no other travel like river travel it is the perfection of movement and one might well desire never to arrive at ones destination the abundance of room the free pure air the constant delight of the eyes in the changing landscape the soft tremor of the boat so steady upon her keel the variety of the little world on boardall form a charm which no good heart in a sound body can resist so whilst the twilight held well content in contiguous chairs they purred in flattery of their kindly fate imagining different pleasures certainly but none greater and tasting to its subtlest flavor the happiness conscious of itself  their own satisfaction indeed was so interesting to them in this objective light that they had little desire to turn from its contemplation to the people around them and when at last they did so it was still with lingering glances of selfrecognition and enjoyment they divined rightly that one of the main conditions of their present felicity was the fact that they had seen so much of time and of the world that they had no longer any desire to take beholding eyes or to make any sort of impressive figure and they understood that their prosperous love accounted as much as years and travel for this result if they had had a loftier opinion of themselves their indifference to others might have made them offensive but with their modest estimate of their own value in the world they could have all the comfort of selfsufficiency without its vulgarity  o yes said basil in answer to some apostrophe to their bliss from isabel its the greatest imaginable satisfaction to have lived past certain things i always knew that i was not a very handsome or otherwise captivating person but i can remember yearsnow blessedly remotewhen i never could see a young girl without hoping she would mistake me for something of that sort i couldnt help desiring that some fascination of mine which had escaped my own analysis would have an effect upon her i dare say all young men are so i used to live for the possible interest i might inspire in your sex isabel they controlled my movements my attitudes they forbade me repose and yet i believe i was no ass but a tolerably sensible fellow blessed be marriage i am free at last all the loveliness that exists outside of you dearestand it s mighty littleis mere pageant to me and i thank heaven that i can meet the most stylish girl now upon the broad level of our common humanity besides it seems to me that our experience of life has quieted us in many other ways what a luxury it is to sit here and reflect that we do not want any of these people to suppose us rich or distinguished or beautiful or well dressed and do not care to show off in any sort of way before them  this content was heightened no doubt by a just sense of their contrast to the group of people nearest therea young man of the second or third qualityand two young girls the eldest of these was carrying on a vivacious flirtation with the young man who was apparently an acquaintance of brief standing the other was scarcely more than a child and sat somewhat abashed at the sparkle of the colloquy they were conjecturally sisters going home from some visit and not skilled in the world but of a certain repute in their country neighborhood for beauty and wit the young man presently gave himself out as one who in pursuit of trade for the drygoods house he represented had travelled many thousands of miles in all parts of the country the encounter was visibly that kind of adventure which both would treasure up for future celebration to their different friends and it had a brilliancy and interest which they could not even now consent to keep to themselves they talked to each other and at all the company within hearing and exchanged curt speeches which had for them all the sensation of repartee  young man they say that beauty unadorned is adorned the most  young woman bridling and twitching her head from side to side in the high excitement of the dialogue flattery is out of place  young man well never mind if you dont believe me you ask your mother when you get home  titter from the younger sister  young woman scornfully umph my mother has no control over me  young man nobody else has either i should gay admiringly  young woman yes youve told the truth for once for a wonder im able to take care of myselfperfectly almost hoarse with a sense of sarcastic performance  young man whole team and big dog under the wagon as they say out west  young woman better a big dog than a puppy any day  giggles and horror from the younger sister sensation in the young man and so much rapture in the young woman that she drops the key of her stateroom from her hand they both stoop and a jocose scuffle for it ensues after which the talk takes an autobiographical turn on the part of the young man and drops into an unintelligible murmur ah poor real life which i love can i make others share the delight i find in thy foolish and insipid face  not far from this group sat two hebrews one young and the other old talking of some business out of which the latter had retired the younger had been asked his opinion upon some point and he was expanding with a flattered consciousness of the elders perception of his importance and toadying to him with the pleasure which all young men feel in winning the favor of seniors in their vocation well as i was asayn isaac dont seem to haf no natcheral pent for the glothing business man gomes in and wands a goathe seemed to be speaking of a garment and not a domestic animalisaacll zell him the goat he wands him to puy and hell make him believe it a the goat he was a lookin for well now thats well enough as far as it goes but you know and i know mr rosenthal that that s no way to do business a man gant zugzeed that goes upon that brincible ids wrong ids easy enough to make a man puy the goat you want him to if he wands a goat but the thing is to make him puy the goat that you wand to zell when he dont wand no goat at all youve asked me what i thought and ive dold you isaacll never zugzeed in the redail glothingbusiness in the world  well sighed the elder who filled his armchair quite full and quivered with a comfortable jellylike tremor in it at every pulsation of the engine i was afraid of something of the kind as you say benjamin he dont seem to have no pent for it and yet i proughd him up to the business i drained him to it myself  besides these talkers there were scattered singly or grouped about in twos and threes and fours the various people one encounters on a hudson river boat who are on the whole different from the passengers on other rivers though they all have features in common there was that man of the sudden gains who has already been typified and there was also the smoother rich man of inherited wealth from whom you can somehow know the former so readily they were each attended by their several retinues of womankind the daughters all much alike but the mothers somewhat different they were going to saratoga where perhaps the exigencies of fashion would bring them acquainted and where the blue blood of a quarter of a century would be kind to the yesterdays fluid of warmer hue there was something pleasanter in the face of the hereditary aristocrat but not so strong nor altogether so admirable particularly if you reflected that he really represented nothing in the world no great culture no political influence no civic aspiration not even a pecuniary force nothing but a social set an alien clublife a tradition of dining we live in a true fairy land after all where the hoarded treasure turns to a heap of dry leaves the almighty dollar defeats itself and finally buys nothing that a man cares to have the very highest pleasure that such an americans money can purchase is exile and to this rich man doubtless europe is a twicetold tale let us clap our empty pockets dearest reader and be glad  we can be as glad apparently and with the same reason as the poorly dressed young man standing near beside the guard whose face basil and isabel chose to fancy that of a poet and concerning whom they romanced that he was going home wherever his home was with the manuscript of a rejected book in his pocket they imagined him no great things of a poet to be sure but his pensive face claimed delicate feeling for him and a graceful sombre fancy and they conjectured unconsciously caught flavors of tennyson and browning in his verse with a moderner tint from morris for was it not a story out of mythology with gods and heroes of the nineteenth century that he was now carrying back from new york with him basil sketched from the colors of his own longaccepted disappointments a moving little picture of this poor imagined poets adventures with what kindness and unkindness he had been put to shame by publishers and how descending from his high hopes of a book he had tried to sell to the magazines some of the shorter pieces out of the and other poems which were to have filled up the volume hes going back rather stunned and bewildered but its something to have tasted the city and its bitter may turn to sweet on his palate at last till he finds himself longing for the tumult that he abhors now poor fellow one compassionate cutthroat of a publisher even asked him to lunch being struck as we are with something fine in his face i hope hes got somebody who believes in him at home otherwise hed be more comfortable for the present if he went over the railing there  so the play of which they were both actors and spectators went on about them like all passages of life it seemed now a grotesque mystery with a bluntly enforced moral now a farce of the broadest now a latent tragedy folded in the disguises of comedy all the elements indeed of either were at work there and this was but one brief scene of the immense complex drama which was to proceed so variously in such different times and places and to have its denouement only in eternity the contrasts were sharp each group had its travesty in some other the talk of one seemed the rude burlesque the bitter satire of the next but of all these parodies none was so terribly effective as the two women who sat in the midst of the company yet were somehow distinct from the rest one wore the deepest black of widowhood the other was dressed in bridal white and they were both alike awful in their mockery of guiltless sorrow and guiltless joy they were not old but the soul of youth was dead in their pretty lamentable faces and ruin ancient as sin looked from their eyes their talk and laughter seemed the echo of an innumerable multitude of the lost haunting the world in every land and time each solitary forever yet all bound together in the unity of an imperishable slavery and shame  what a stale effect what hackneyed characters let us be glad the night drops her curtain upon the cheap spectacle and shuts these with the other actors from our view  within the cabin through which basil and isabel now slowly moved there were numbers of people lounging about on the sofas in various attitudes of talk or vacancy and at the tables there were others reading lothair a new book in the remote epoch of which i write and a very fashionable book indeed there was in the air that odor of paint and carpet which prevails on steamboats the glass drops of the chandeliers ticked softly against each other as the vessel shook with her respiration like a comfortable sleeper and imparted a delicious feeling of coziness and security to our travellers  a few hours later they struggled awake at the sharp sound of the pilots bell signaling the engineer to slow the boat there was a moment of perfect silence then all the drops of the chandeliers in the saloon clashed musically together then fell another silence and at last came wild cries for help strongly qualified with blasphemies and curses send out a boat there was a woman aboard that steamboat lower your boats run a craft right down with your big boat send out a boat and pick up the crew the cries rose and sank and finally ceased through the lattice of the stateroom window some lights shone faintly on the water at a distance  wait here isabel said her husband weve run down a boat we dont seem hurt but ill go see ill be back in a minute  isabel had emerged into a world of dishabille a world wildly unbuttoned and unlaced where it was the fashion for ladies to wear their hair down their backs and to walk about in their stockings and to speak to each other without introduction the place with which she had felt so familiar a little while before was now utterly estranged there was no motion of the boat and in the momentary suspense a quiet prevailed in which those grotesque shapes of disarray crept noiselessly round whispering panicstricken conjectures there was no rushing to and fro nor tumult of any kind and there was not a man to be seen for apparently they had all gone like basil to learn the extent of the calamity a mist of sleep involved the whole and it was such a topsyturvy world that it would have seemed only another dreamland but that it was marked for reality by one signal fact with the rest appeared the woman in bridal white and the woman in widows black and there amidst the fright that made all others friends and for aught that most knew in the presence of death itself these two moved together shunned and friendless  somehow even before basil returned it had become known to isabel and the rest that their own steamer had suffered no harm but that she had struck and sunk another convoying a flotilla of canal boats from which those alarming cries and curses had come the steamer was now lying by for the small boats she had sent out to pick up the crew of the sunken vessel  why i only heard a little tinkling of the chandeliers said one of the ladies is it such a very alight matter to run down another boat and sink it  she appealed indirectly to basil who answered lightly i dont think you ladies ought to have been disturbed at all in running over a common towboat on a perfectly clear night like this there should have been no noise and no perceptible jar they manage better on the mississippi and both boats often go down without waking the lightest sleeper on board  the ladies perhaps from a deficient sense of humor listened with undisguised displeasure to this speech it dispersed them in fact some turned away to bivouac for the rest of the night upon the armchairs and sofas while others returned to their rooms with the latter went isabel lock me in basil she said with a bold meekness and if anything more happens dont wake me till the last moment it was hard to part from him but she felt that his vigil would somehow be useful to the boat and she confidingly fell into a sleep that lasted till daylight  meantime her husband on whom she had tacitly devolved so great a responsibility went forward to the promenade in front of the saloon in hopes of learning something more of the catastrophe from the people whom he had already found gathered there  a large part of the passengers were still there seated or standing about in earnest colloquy they were in that mood which follows great excitement and in which the feeblestminded are sure to lead the talk at such times one feels that a sensible frame of mind is unsympathetic and if expressed unpopular or perhaps not quite safe and basil warned by his fate with the ladies listened gravely to the voice of the common imbecility and incoherence  the principal speaker was a tall person wearing a silk travellingcap he had a face of stupid benignity and a selfsatisfied smirk and he was formally trying to put at his ease and hopelessly confusing the loutish youth before him you say you saw the whole accident and youre probably the only passenger that did see it youll be the most important witness at the trial he added as if there would ever be any trial about it now how did the towboat hit us  well she came bows on  ah bows on repeated the other with great satisfaction and a little murmur of bows on ran round the listening circle  that is added the witness it seemed as if we struck her amidships and cut her in two and sunk her  just so continued the examiner accepting the explanation bows on now i want to ask if you saw our captain or any of the crew about  not a soul said the witness with the solemnity of a man already on oath  thatll do exclaimed the other this gentlemans experience coincides exactly with my own i didnt see the collision but i did see the cloud of steam from the sinking boat and i saw her go down there wasnt an officer to be found anywhere on board our boat i looked about for the captain and the mate myself and couldnt find either of them high or low  the officers ought all to have been sitting here on the promenade deck suggested one ironical spirit in the crowd but no one noticed him  the gentleman in the silk travellingcap now took a chair and a number of sympathetic listeners drew their chairs about him and then began an interchange of experience in which each related to the last particular all that he felt thought and said and if married what his wife felt thought and said at the moment of the calamity they turned the disaster over and over in their talk and rolled it under their tongues then they reverted to former accidents in which they had been concerned and the silkcapped gentleman told to the common admiration of a fearful escape of his on the erie road from being thrown down a steep embankment fifty feet high by a piece of rock that had fallen on the track now just see gentlemen what a little thing humanly speaking life depends upon if that old woman had been able to sleep and hadnt sent that boy down to warn the train we should have run into the rock and been dashed to pieces the passengers made up a purse for the boy and i wrote a full account of it to the papers  well said one of the group a man in a hard hat i never lie down on a steamboat or a railroad train i want to be ready for whatever happens  the others looked at this speaker with interest as one who had invented a safe method of travel  i happened to be up tonight but i almost always undress and go to bed just as if i were in my own house said the gentleman of the silk cap  i dont say your way isnt the best but thats my way  the champions of the rival systems debated their merits with suavity and mutual respect but they met with scornful silence a compromising spirit who held that it was better to throw off your coat and boots but keep your pantaloons on meanwhile the steamer was hanging idle upon the current against which it now and then stirred a careless wheel still waiting for the return of the small boats thin gray clouds through rifts of which a star sparkled keenly here and there veiled the heavens shadowy bluffs loomed up on either hand in a hollow on the left twinkled a drowsy little town a beautiful stillness lay on all  after an hours interval a shout was heard from far down the river then later the plash of oars then a cry hailing the approaching boats and the answer all safe presently the boats had come alongside and the passengers crowded down to the guard to learn the details of the search basil heard a hollow moaning gurgling sound regular as that of the machinery for some note of which he mistook it clear the gangway there shouted a gruff voice man scalded here and a burden was carried by from which fluttered with its terrible regularity that utterance of mortal anguish  basil went again to the forward promenade and sat down to see the morning come  the boat swiftly ascended the current and presently the steeper shores were left behind and the banks fell away in long upward sloping fields with farmhouses and with stacks of harvest dimly visible in the generous expanses by and by they passed a fisherman drawing his nets and bending from his boat there near albany n y in the picturesque immortal attitudes of raphaels galilean fisherman and now a flush mounted the pale face of the east and through the dewy coolness of the dawn there came more to the sight than any other sense a vague menace of heat but as yet the air was deliciously fresh and sweet and basil bathed his weariness in it thinking with a certain luxurious compassion of the scalded man and how he was to fare that day this poor wretch seemed of another order of beings as the calamitous always seem to the happy and basils pity was quite an abstraction which again amused and shocked him and he asked his heart of bliss to consider of sorrow a little more earnestly as the lot of all men and not merely of an alien creature here and there he dutifully tried to imagine another issue to the disaster of the night and to realize himself suddenly bereft of her who so filled his life he bade his soul remember that in the security of sleep death had passed them both so close that his presence might well have chilled their dreams as the iceberg that grazes the ship in the night freezes all the air about it but it was quite idle where love was life only was and sense and spirit alike put aside the burden that he would have laid upon them his revery reflected with delicious caprice the looks the tones the movements that he loved and bore him far away from the sad images that he had invited to mirror themselves in it     iv a days railroading  happiness has commonly a good appetite and the thought of the fortunately ended adventures of the night the fresh morning air and the content of their own hearts gifted our friends by the time the boat reached albany with a wholesome hunger so that they debated with spirit the question of breakfast and the best place of breakfasting in a city which neither of them knew save in the most fugitive and sketchy way  they decided at last in view of the early departure of the train and the probability that they would be more hurried at a hotel to breakfast at the station and thither they went and took places at one of the many tables within where they seemed to have been expected only by the flies the waitress plainly had not looked for them and for a time found their presence so incredible that she would not acknowledge the rattling that basil was obliged to make on his glass then it appeared that the cook would not believe in them and he did not send them till they were quite faint the peppery and muddy draught which impudently affected to be coffee the oily slices of fugacious potatoes slipping about in their shallow dish and skillfully evading pursuit the pieces of beef that simulated steak the hot greasy biscuit steaming evilly up into the face when opened and then soddening into masses of condensed dyspepsia  the weddingjourneyers looked at each other with eyes of sad amaze they bowed themselves for a moment to the viands and then by an equal impulse refrained they were sufficiently young they were happy they were hungry nature is great and strong but art is greater and before these triumphs of the cook at the albany depot appetite succumbed by a terrible tour de force they swallowed the fierce and turbid liquor in their cups and then speculated fantastically upon the character and history of the materials of that breakfast  presently isabel paused played a little with her knife and after a moment looked up at her husband with an arch regard and said i was just thinking of a small station somewhere in the south of france where our train once stopped for breakfast i remember the freshness and brightness of everything on the little tablesthe plates the napkins the gleaming halfbottles of wine they seemed to have been preparing that breakfast for us from the beginning of time and we were hardly seated before they served us with great cups of cafeaulait and the sweetest rolls and butter then a delicate cutlet with an unspeakable gravy and potatoessuch potatoes dear me how little i ate of it i wish for once id had your appetite basil i do indeed  she ended with a heartless laugh in which despite the tragical contrast her words had suggested basil finally joined so much amazement had probably never been got before out of the misery inflicted in that place but their lightness did not at all commend them the waitress had not liked it from the first and had served them with reluctance and the proprietor did not like it and kept his eye upon them as if he believed them about to escape without payment here then they had enforced a great fact of travellingthat people who serve the public are kindly and pleasant in proportion as they serve it well the unjust and the inefficient have always that consciousness of evil which will not let a man forgive his victim or like him to be cheerful  our friends however did not heat themselves over the fact there was already such heat from without even at eight oclock in the morning that they chose to be as cool as possible in mind and they placidly took their places in the train which had been made up for departure they had deliberately rejected the notion of a drawingroom car as affording a less varied prospect of humanity and as being less in the spirit of ordinary american travel now in reward they found themselves quite comfortable in the common passengercar and disposed to view the scenery into which they struck an hour after leaving the city with much complacency there was sufficient draught through the open window to make the heat tolerable and the great brooding warmth gave to the landscape the charm which it alone can impart it is a landscape that i greatly love for its mild beauty and tranquil picturesqueness and it is in honor of our friends that i say they enjoyed it there are nowhere any considerable hills but everywhere generous slopes and pleasant hollows and the wide meadows of a grazing country with the pretty brown mohawk river rippling down through all and at frequent intervals the life of the canal now near now far away with the lazy boats that seem not to stir and the horses that the train passes with a whirl and leaves slowly stepping forward and swiftly slipping backward there are farms that had once or still have the romance to them of being dutch farmsif there is any romance in thatand one conjectures a dutch thrift in their waving grass and grain spaces of woodland here and there dapple the slopes and the cozy red farmhouses repose by the side of their capacious red barns truly there is no ground on which to defend the idleness and yet as the train strives furiously onward amid these scenes of fertility and abundance i like in fancy to loiter behind it and to saunter at will up and down the landscape i stop at the farmyard gates and sit upon the porches or thresholds and am served with cups of buttermilk by old dutch ladies who have done their mornings work and have leisure to be knitting or sewing or if there are no old ladies with decent caps upon their gray hair then i do not complain if the drink is brought me by some redcheeked comely young girl out of washington irvings pages with no cap on her golden braids who mirrors my diffidence and takes an attitude of pretty awkwardness while she waits till i have done drinking in the same easily contented spirit as i lounge through the barnyard if i find the old hens gone about their family affairs i do not mind a meadowlarks singing in the top of the elmtree beside the pump in these excursions the watchdogs know me for a harmless person and will not open their eyes as they lie coiled up in the sun before the gate at all the places i have the people keep bees and in the garden full of worthy potherbs such idlers in the vegetable world as hollyhocks and larkspurs and fouroclocks near a great bed in which the asparagus has gone to sleep for the season with a dream of delicate spray hanging over it i walk unmolested through the farmers tall grass and ride with him upon the perilous seat of his voluble mowingmachine and learn to my hearts content that his name begins with van and that his family has owned that farm ever since the days of the patroon which i dare say is not true then i fall asleep in a corner of the hayfield and wake up on the towpath of the canal beside that wonderfully lean horse whose bones you cannot count only because they are so many he never wakes up but with a faltering underlip and halfshut eyes hobbles stiffly on unconscious of his anatomical interest the captain hospitably asks me on board with a twist of the rudder swinging the stern of the boat up to the path so that i can step on she is laden with flour from the valley of the genesee and may have started on her voyage shortly after the canal was made she is succinctly manned by the captain the driver and the cook a fieryhaired lady of imperfect temper and the cabin which i explore is plainly furnished with a cookstove and a flask of whiskey nothing but profane language is allowed on board and so in a life of wicked jollity and ease we glide imperceptibly down the canal unvexed by the faroff future of arrival  such i say are my own unambitious mental pastimes but i am aware that less superficial spirits could not be satisfied with them and i can not pretend that my weddingjourneyers were so  they cast an absurd poetry over the landscape they invited themselves to be reminded of passages of european travel by it and they placed villas and castles and palaces upon all the eligible buildingsites ashamed of these devices presently basil patriotically tried to reconstruct the dutch and indian past of the mohawk valley but here he was foiled by the immense ignorance of his wife who as a true american woman knew nothing of the history of her own country and less than nothing of the barbarous regions beyond the borders of her native province she proved a bewildering labyrinth of error concerning the events which basil mentioned and she had never even heard of the massacres by the french and indians at schenectady which he in his boyhood had known so vividly that he was scalped every night in his dreams and woke up in the morning expecting to see marks of the tomahawk on the headboard so failing at last to extract any sentiment from the scenes without they turned their faces from the window and looked about them for amusement within the car  it was in all respects an ordinary carful of human beings and it was perhaps the more worthy to be studied on that account as in literature the true artist will shun the use even of real events if they are of an improbable character so the sincere observer of man will not desire to look upon the heroic or occasional phases but will seek him in his habitual moods of vacancy and tiresomeness to me at any rate he is at such times very precious and i never perceive him to be so much a man and a brother as when i feel the pressure of his vast natural unaffected dullness then i am able to enter confidently into his life and inhabit there to think his shallow and feeble thoughts to be moved by his dumb stupid desires to be dimly illumined by his stinted inspirations to share his foolish prejudices to practice his obtuse selfishness yes it is a very amusing world if you do not refuse to be amused and our friends were very willing to be entertained they delighted in the precise thickfingered old ladies who bought sweet apples of the boys come aboard with baskets and who were so long in finding the right change that our travellers leaping in thought with the boys from the moving train felt that they did so at the peril of their lives then they were interested in people who went out and found their friends waiting for them or else did not find them and wandered disconsolately up and down before the country stations carpetbag in hand in women who came aboard and were awkwardly shaken hands with or sheepishly kissed by those who hastily got seats for them and placed their bags or their babies in their laps and turned for a nod at the door in young ladies who were seen to places by young men the latter seemed not to care if the train did go off with them and then threw up their windows and talked with girlfriends on the platform without till the train began to move and at last turned with gleaming eyes and moist red lips and panted hard in the excitement of thinking about it and could not calm themselves to the dull level of the travel around them in the conductor coldly and inaccessibly vigilant as he went his rounds reaching blindly for the tickets with one hand while he bent his head from time to time and listened with a faint sarcastic smile to the questions of passengers who supposed they were going to get some information out of him in the trainboy who passed through on his many errands with prize candies gumdrops popcorn papers and magazines and distributed books and the police journals with a blind impartiality or a prodigious ignorance or a supernatural perception of character in those who received them  a through train from east to west presents some peculiar features as well as the traits common to all railway travel and our friends decided that this was not a very welldressed company and would contrast with the people on an expresstrain between boston and new york to no better advantage than these would show beside the average passengers between london and paris and it seems true that on a westering line the blacking fades gradually from the boots the hat softens and sinks the coat loses its rigor of cut and the whole person lounges into increasing informality of costume i speak of the undressful sex alone woman wherever she is appears in the last attainable effects of fashion which are now all but telegraphic and universal but most of the passengers here were men and they mere plainly of the freeand easy west rather than the dapper east they wore faces thoughtful with the problem of buying cheap and selling dear and they could be known by their silence from the loquacious acquaintancemaking waytravellers in these the mere coming aboard seemed to beget an aggressively confidential mood perhaps they clutched recklessly at any means of relieving their ennui or they felt that they might here indulge safely in the pleasures of autobiography so dear to all of us or else in view of the many possible catastrophes they desired to leave some little memory of themselves behind at any rate whenever the train stopped the weddingjourneyers caught fragments of the personal histories of their fellowpassengers which had been rehearsing to those that sat next the narrators it was no more than fair that these should somewhat magnify themselves and put the best complexion on their actions and the worst upon their sufferings that they should all appear the luckiest or the unluckiest the healthiest or the sickest people that ever were and should all have made or lost the most money there was a prevailing desire among them to make out that they came from or were going to same very large place and our friends fancied an actual mortification in the face of a modest gentleman who got out at penelope or some other insignificant classical station in the ancient greek and roman part of new york state after having listened to the life of a somewhat rusticlooking person who had described himself as belonging near new york city  basil also found diversion in the tender couples who publicly comported themselves as if in a sylvan solitude and as it had been on the bank of some umbrageous stream far from the ken of envious or unsympathetic eyes reclined upon each others shoulders and slept but isabel declared that this behavior was perfectly indecent she granted of course that they were foolish innocent people who meant no offense and did not feel guilty of an impropriety but she said that this sort of thing was a national reproach if it were merely rustic lovers she should not care so much but you saw people who ought to know better welldressed stylish people flaunting their devotion in the face of the world and going to sleep on each others shoulders on every railroad train it was outrageous it was scandalous it was really infamous before she would allow herself to do such a thing she wouldwell she hardly knew what she would not do she would have a divorce at any rate she wondered that basil could laugh at it and he would make her hate him if he kept on  from the seat behind their own they were now made listeners to the history of a ten weeks typhoid fever from the moment when the narrator noticed that he had not felt very well for a day or two back and all at once a kind of shiver took him till he lay fourteen days perfectly insensible and could eat nothing but a little pounded iceand his wifea small woman tooused to lift him back and forth between the bed and sofa like a feather and the neighbors did not know half the time whether he was dead or alive this history from which not the smallest particular or the least significant symptom of the case was omitted occupied an hour in recital and was told as it seemed for the entertainment of one who had been five minutes before it began a stranger to the historian  at last the train came to a stand and isabel wailed forth in accents of desperation the words o disgusting the monotony of the narrative in the seat behind fatally combining with the heat of the day had lulled her into slumbers from which she awoke at the stopping of the train to find her head resting tenderly upon her husbands shoulder  she confronted his merriment with eyes of mournful rebuke but as she could not find him or the harshest construction in the least to blame she was silent  never mind dear never mind he coaxed you were really not responsible it was fatigue destiny the spite of fortunewhatever you like in the case of the others whom you despise so justly i dare say it is sheer disgraceful affection but see that ravishing placard swinging from the roof this train stops twenty minutes for dinner at utica in a few minutes more we shall be at utica if they have anything edible there it shall never contract my powers i could dine at the albany station even  in a little while they found themselves in an airy comfortable diningroom eating a dinner which it seemed to them france in the flush of her prosperity need not have blushed to serve for if it wanted a little in the last graces of art it redeemed itself in abundance variety and wholesomeness at the elbow of every famishing passenger stood a beneficent coalblack glossy fairy in a white linen apron and jacket serving him with that alacrity and kindliness and grace which make the negro waiter the master not the slave of his calling which disenthrall it of servility and constitute him your eager host not your menial for the moment from table to table passed a calming influence in the person of the proprietor who as he took his richly earned money checked the rising fears of the guests by repeated proclamations that there was plenty of time and that he would give them due warning before the train started those who had flocked out of the cars to prey with beak and claw as the vulturelike fashion is upon everything in reach remained to eat like christians and even a poor scantilyenglished frenchman who wasted half his time in trying to ask how long the cars stopped and in looking at his watch made a good dinner in spite of himself  o basil basil cried isabel when the train was again in motion have we really dined once more it seems too good to be true cleanliness plenty wholesomeness civility yes as you say they cannot be civil where they are not just honesty and courtesy go together and wherever they give you outrageous things to eat they add indigestible insults basil dear dont be jealous i shall never meet him again but im in love with that black waiter at our table i never saw such perfect manners such a winning and affectionate politeness he made me feel that every mouthful i ate was a personal favor to him what a complete gentleman there ought never to be a white waiter none but negroes are able to render their service a pleasure and distinction to you  so they prattled on doing in their eagerness to be satisfied a homage perhaps beyond its desert to the good dinner and the decent service of it but here they erred in the right direction and i find nothing more admirable in their behavior throughout a wedding journey which certainly had its trials than their willingness to make the very heat of whatever would suffer itself to be made anything at all of they celebrated its pleasures with magnanimous excess they passed over its griefs with a wise forbearance that which they found the most difficult of management was the want of incident for the most part of the time and i who write their history might also sink under it but that i am supported by the fact that it is so typical in this respect i even imagine that ideal reader for whom one writes as yawning over these barren details with the lifelike weariness of an actual travelling companion of theirs their own silence often sufficed my wedded lovers or then when there was absolutely nothing to engage them they fell back upon the story of their love which they were never tired of hearing as they severally knew it let it not be a reproach to human nature or to me if i say that there was something in the comfort of having well dined which now touched the springs of sentiment with magical effect and that they had never so rejoiced in these tender reminiscences  they had planned to stop over at rochester till the morrow that they might arrive at niagara by daylight and at utica they had suddenly resolved to make the rest of the days journey in a drawingroom car the change gave them an added reason for content and they realized how much they had previously sacrificed to the idea of travelling in the most american manner without achieving it after all for this seemed a touch of americanism beyond the oldfashioned car they reclined in luxury upon the easycushioned revolving chairs they surveyed with infinite satisfaction the elegance of the flyingparlor in which they sat or turned their contented regard through the broad plateglass windows upon the landscape without they said that none but americans or enchanted princes in the arabian nights ever travelled in such state and when the stewards of the car came round successively with tropical fruits icecreams and claretpunches they felt a heightened assurance that they were either enchanted princesor americans there were more ladies and more fashion than in the other cars and prettily dressed children played about on the carpet but the general appearance of the passengers hardly suggested greater wealth than elsewhere and they were plainly in that car because they were of the american race which finds nothing too good for it that its money can buy     v the enchanted city and beyond  they knew none of the hotels in rochester and they had chosen a certain one in reliance upon their handbook when they named it there stepped forth a porter of an incredibly cordial and pleasant countenance who took their travellingbags and led them to the omnibus as they were his only passengers the porter got inside with them and seeing their interest in the streets through which they rode he descanted in a strain of cheerful pride upon the citys prosperity and character and gave the names of the people who lived in the finer houses just as if it had been an oldworld town and he some eager historian expecting reward for his comment upon it he cast quite a glamour over rochester so that in passing a body of water bordered by houses and overlooked by odd balconies and galleries and crossed in the distance by a bridge upon which other houses were built they boldly declared being at their wits end for a comparison and taken with the unhopedfor picturesqueness that it put them in mind of verona thus they reached their hotel in almost a spirit of foreign travel and very willing to verify the pleasant porters assurance that they would like it for everybody liked it and it was with a sudden sinking of the heart that basil beheld presiding over the register the conventional american hotel clerk he was young he had a neat mustache and wellbrushed hair jeweled studs sparkled in his shirtfront and rings on his white hands a gentle disdain of the travelling public breathed from his person in the mystical odors of ihlang ihlang he did not lift his haughty head to look at the wayfarer who meekly wrote his name in the register he did not answer him when he begged for a cool room he turned to the board on which the keys hung and plucking one from it slid it towards basil on the marble counter touched a bell for a callboy whistled a bar of offenbach and as he wrote the number of the room against basils name said to a friend lounging near him as if resuming a conversation well shes a mighty pooty gul any way chawley  when i reflect that this was a type of the hotel clerk throughout the united states that behind unnumbered registers at this moment he is snubbing travellers into the dust and that they are suffering and perpetuating him i am lost in wonder at the national meekness not that i am one to refuse the humble pie his jeweled fingers offer me abjectly i take my key and creep off up stairs after the callboy and try to give myself the genteel air of one who has not been stepped upon but i think homicidal things all the same and i rejoice that in the safety of print i can cry out against the despot whom i have not the presence to defy you vulgar and cruel little soul i say and i imagine myself breathing the words to his teeth why do you treat a weary stranger with this ignominy i am to pay well for what i get and i shall not complain of that but look at me and own my humanity confess by some civil action by some decent phrase that i have rights and that they shall be respected answer my proper questions respond to my fair demands do not slide my key at me do not deny me the poor politeness of a nod as you give it in my hand i am not your equal few men are but i shall not presume upon your clemency come i also am human  basil found that for his sin in asking for a cool room the clerk had given them a chamber into which the sun had been shining the whole afternoon but when his luggage had been put in it seemed useless to protest and like a true american like you like me he shrank from asserting himself when the sun went down it would be cool enough and they turned their thoughts to supper not venturing to hope that as it proved the handsome clerk was the sole blemish of the house  isabel viewed with innocent surprise the evidences of luxury afforded by all the appointments of a hotel so far west of boston and they both began to feel that natural ease and superiority which an inn always inspires in its guests and which our great hotels far from impairing enhance in flattering degree in fact the clerk once forgotten i protest for my own part i am never more conscious of my merits and riches in any other place one has there the romance of being a stranger and a mystery to every one else and lives in the alluring possibility of not being found out a most ordinary person  they were so late in coming to the supperroom that they found themselves alone in it at the door they had a bow from the headwaiter who ran before them and drew out chairs for them at a table and signaled waiters to serve them first laying before them with a gracious flourish the bill of fare  a force of servants flocked about them as if to contest the honor of ordering their supper one set upon the table a heaping vase of strawberries another flanked it with flagons of cream a third accompanied it with gates of varied flavor and device a fourth obsequiously smoothed the tablecloth a fifth the youngest of the five with folded arms stood by and admired the satisfaction the rest were giving when these had been dispatched for steak for broiled whitefish of the lakesnoblest and delicatest of the fish that swimfor broiled chicken for fried potatoes for mums for whatever the lawless fancy and ravening appetites of the wayfarers could suggest this fifth waiter remained to tempt them to further excess and vainly proposed some kind of eggsfried eggs poached eggs scrambled eggs boiled eggs or omelette  o youre sure dearest that this isnt a vision of fairyland which will vanish presently and leave us empty and forlorn plaintively murmured isabel as the menial train reappeared bearing the supper they had ordered and set it smoking down  suddenly a look of apprehension dawned upon her face and she let fall her knife and fork you dont think basil she faltered that they could have found out were a bridal party and that theyre serving us so magnificently becausebecauseo i shall be miserable every moment were here she concluded desperately  she looked indeed extremely wretched for a woman with so much broiled whitefish on her plate and such a banquet array about her and her husband made haste to reassure her youre still demoralized isabel by our sufferings at the albany depot and you exaggerate the blessings we enjoy though i should be sorry to undervalue them i suspect its the custom to use people well at this hotel or if we are singled out for uncommon favor i think i can explain the cause it has been discovered by the register that we are from boston and we are merely meeting the reverence affection and homage which the name everywhere commands  it s our fortune to represent for the time being the intellectual and moral virtue of boston this supper is not a tribute to you as a bride but as a bostonian  it was a cheap kind of raillery to be sure but it served it kindled the local pride of isabel to selfdefense and in the distraction of the effort she forgot her fears she returned with renewed appetite to the supper and in its excellence they both let fall their disputewhich ended of course in basils abject confession that boston was the best place in the world and nothing but banishment could make him live elsewhereand gave themselves up as usual to the delight of being just what and where they were at last the natural course brought them to the strawberries and when the fifth waiter approached from the corner of the table at which he stood to place the vase near them he did not retire at once but presently asked if they were from the west  isabel smiled and basil answered that they were from the east  he faltered at this as if doubtful of the result if he went further but took heart then and asked dont you think this is a pretty nice hotelhastily adding as a concession of the probable existence of much finer things at the eastfor a small hotel  they imagined this waiter as new to his station in life as perhaps just risen to it from some country tavern and unable to repress his exultation in what seemed their sympathetic presence they were charmed to have invited his guileless confidence to have evoked possibly all the simple poetry of his soul it was what might have happened in italy only there so much naivete would have meant money they looked at each other with rapture and basil answered warmly while the waiter flushed as at a personal compliment yes it s a nice hotel one of the best i ever saw east or west in europe or america  they rose and left the room and were bowed out by the headwaiter  how perfectly idyllic cried isabel is this rochester new york or is it some vale of arcady lets go out and see  they walked out into the moonlit city up and down streets that seemed very stately and fine amidst a glitter of shopwindow lights and then less of their own motion than of mere error they quitted the business quarter and found themselves in a quiet avenue of handsome residencesthe beacon street of rochester whatever it was called they said it was a night and a place for lovers for none but lovers for lovers newly plighted and they made believe to bemoan themselves that hold each other dear as they would the exaltation the thrill the glory of their younger love was gone some of the houses had gardened spaces about them from which stole like breaths of sweetest and saddest regret the perfume of midsummer flowersthe despair of the rose for the bud as they passed a certain house a song fluttered out of the open window and ceased the piano warbled at the final rush of fingers over its chords and they saw her with her fingers resting lightly on the keys and her graceful head lifted to look into his they saw him with his arm yet stretched across to the leaves of music he had been turning and his face lowered to meet her gaze  ah basil i wish it was we there  and if they knew that we on our wedding journey stood outside would not they wish it was they here  i suppose so dearest and yet onceuponatime was sweet pass on and let us see what charm we shall find next in this enchanted city  yes it is an enchanted city to us mused basil aloud as they wandered on and all strange cities are enchanted what is rochester to the rochesterese a place of a hundred thousand people as we read in our guide an immense flour interest a great railroad entrepot an unrivaled nursery trade a university two commercial colleges three collegiate institutes eight or ten newspapers and a free library i dare say any respectable resident would laugh at us sentimentalizing over his city but rochester is for us who dont know it at all a city of any time or country moonlit filled with lovers hovering over pianofortes of a palatial hotel with pastoral waiters and portera city of handsome streets wrapt in beautiful quiet and dreaming of the golden age the only definite association with it in our minds is the tragically romantic thought that here sam patch met his fate  and who in the world was sam patch  isabel your ignorance of all that an american woman should be proud of distresses me have you really then never heard of the man who invented the saying some things can be done as well as others and proved it by jumping over niagara falls twice spurred on by this belief he attempted the leap of the genesee falls the leap was easy enough but the coming up again was another matter he failed in that it was the one thing that could not be done as well as others  dreadful said isabel with the cheerfullest satisfaction but what has all that to do with rochester  now my dear you dont mean to say you didnt know that the genesee falls were at rochester upon my word im ashamed why were within ten minutes walk of them now  then walk to them at once cried isabel wholly unabashed and in fact unable to see what he had to be ashamed of actually i believe you would have allowed me to leave rochester without telling me the falls were here if you hadnt happened to think of sam patch  saying this she persuaded herself that a chief object of their journey had been to visit the scene of sam patchs fatal exploit and she drew basil with a nervous swiftness in the direction of the railroad station beyond which he said were the falls presently after threading their way among a multitude of locomotives with and without trains attached that backed and advanced or stood still hissing impatiently on every side they passed through the station to a broad planking above the river on the other side and thence after encounter of more locomotives they found by dint of much asking a street winding up the hillside to the left and leading to the german bierhaus that gives access to the best view of the cataract  the americans have characteristically bordered the river with manufactures making every drop work its passage to the brink while the germans have as characteristically made use of the beauty left over and have built a bierhaus where they may regale both soul and sense in the presence of the cataract our travellers might in another mood and place have thought it droll to arrive at that sublime spectacle through a bierhaus but in this enchanted city it seemed to have a peculiar fitness  a narrow corridor gave into a wide festival space occupied by many tables each of which was surrounded by a group of clamorous germans of either sex and every age with tall beakers of beaded lager before them and slim flasks of rhenish overhead flamed the gas in globes of varicolored glass the walls were painted like those of such haunts in the fatherland and the weddingjourneyers were fair to linger on their way to dwell upon that scene of honest enjoyment to inhale the mingling odors of beer and of pipes and of the pungent cheeses in which the children of the fatherland delight amidst the inspiriting clash of plates and glasses the rattle of knives and forks and the hoarse rush of gutturals they could catch the words franzosen kaiser konig and schlacht and they knew that festive company to be exulting in the first german triumphs of the war which were then the days news they saw fists shaken at noses in fierce exchange of joy arms tossed abroad in wild congratulation and healthpouring goblets of beer lifted in air then they stepped into the moonlight again and heard only the solemn organ stops of the cataract through gardenground they were led by the little maid their guide to a small pavilion that stood on the edge of the precipitous shore and commanded a perfect view of the falls as they entered this pavilion a youth and maiden clearly lovers passed out and they were left alone with that sublime presence something of definiteness was to be desired in the spectacle but there was ample compensation in the mystery with which the broad effulgence and the dense unluminous shadows of the moonshine invested it the light touched all the tops of the rapids that seemed to writhe sway from the brink of the cataract and then desperately breaking and perishing to fall the white disembodied ghosts of rapids down to the bottom of the vast and deep ravine through which the river rushed away now the waters seemed to mass themselves a hundred feet high in a wall of snowy compactness now to disperse into their multitudinous particles and hang like some vaporous cloud from the cliff every moment renewed the vision of beauty in some rare and fantastic shape and its loveliness isolated it in spite of the great town on the other shore the station with its bridge and its trains the mills that supplied their feeble little needs from the cataracts strength  at last basil pointed out the tablerock in the middle of the fall from which sam patch had made his fatal leap but isabel refused to admit that tragical figure to the honors of her emotions i dont care for him she said fiercely patch what a name to be linked in our thoughts with this superb cataract  well isabel i think you are very unjust its as good a name as leander to my thinking and it was immortalized in support of a great idea the feasibility of all things while leanders has come down to us as that of the weak victim of a passion we shall never have a poetry of our own till we get over this absurd reluctance from facts till we make the ideal embrace and include the real till we consent to face the music in our simple common names and put smith into a lyric and jones into a tragedy the germans are braver than we and in them you find facts and dreams continually blended and confronted here is a fortunate illustration the people we met coming out of this pavilion were lovers and they had been here sentimentalizing on this superb cataract as you call it with which my heroic patch is not worthy to be named no doubt they had been quoting uhland or some other of their romantic poets perhaps singing some of their tender german lovesongsthe tenderest unearthliest lovesongs in the world at the same time they did not disdain the matteroffact corporeity in which their sentiment was enshrined they fed it heartily and abundantly with the banquet whose relics we see here  on a table before them stood a pair of beerglasses in the bottoms of which lurked scarce the foam of the generous liquor lately brimming them some shreds of sausage some rinds of swiss cheese bits of cold ham crusts of bread and the ashes of a pipe  isabel shuddered at the spectacle but made no comment and basil went on do you suppose they scorned the idea of sam patch as they gazed upon the falls on the contrary ive no doubt that he recalled to her the ballad which a poet of their language made about him it used to go the rounds of the german newspapers and i translated it a long while ago when i thought that i too was in arkadien geboren         in the bierhauagarten i linger         by the falls of the geneses         from the tablerock in the middle         leaps a figure bold and free          aloof in the air it rises         oer the rush the plunge the death         on the thronging banks of the river         there is neither pulse nor breath          forever it hovers and poises         aloof in the moonlit air         as light as mist from the rapids         as heavy as nightmare          in anguish i cry to the people         the longsince vanished hosts         i see them stretch forth in answer         the helpless hands of ghosts  i once met the poet who wrote this he drank too much beer  i dont see that he got in the name of sam patch after all said isabel  o yes he did but i had to yield to our taste and where he said i springt der sam patsch kuhn and frei i made it leaps a figure bold and free  as they passed through the house on their way out they saw the youth and maiden they had met at the pavilion door they were seated at a table two glasses of beer towered before them on their plates were odorous crumbs of limburger cheese they both wore a pensive air  the next morning the illusion that had wrapt the whole earth was gone with the moonlight by nine oclock when the weddingjourneyers resumed their way toward niagara the heat had already set in with the effect of ordinary midsummers heat at high noon the car into which they got had come the past night from albany and had an air of almost conscious shabbiness griminess and overuse the seats were covered with cinders which also crackled under foot dust was on everything especially the persons of the crumpled and weary passengers of overnight those who came aboard at rochester failed to lighten the spiritual gloom and presently they sank into the common bodily wretchedness the train was somewhat belated and as it drew nearer buffalo they knew the conductor to have abandoned himself to that blackest of the arts making time the long irregular jolt of the ordinary progress was reduced to an incessant shudder and a quick lateral motion the air within the cars was deadly if a window was raised a storm of dust and cinders blew in and quick gusts caught away the breath so they sat with closed windows sweltering and stifling and all the faces on which a lively horror was not painted were dull and damp with apathetic misery  the incidents were in harmony with the abject physical tone of the company there was a quarrel between a thin shrillvoiced highly dressed muchbedizened jewess on the one side and a fat greedy old woman half asleep and a boy with large pink transparent ears that stood out from his head like the handles of a jar on the other side about a seat which the hebrew wanted and which the others had kept filled with packages on the pretense that it was engaged it was a loud and fierce quarrel enough but it won no sort of favor and when the jewess had given a final opinion that the greedy old woman was no lady and the boy who disputed in an ironical temper replied highly complimentary i must say there was no sign of relief or other acknowledgment in any of the spectators that there had been a quarrel  there was a little more interest taken in the misfortune of an old purblind german and his son who were found by the conductor to be a few hundred miles out of the direct course to their destination and were with some trouble and the aid of an americanized fellowcountryman made aware of the fact the old man then fell back in the prevailing apathy and the child naturally cared nothing by and by came the unsparing trainboy on his rounds bestrewing the passengers successively with papers magazines finecut tobacco and packages of candy he gave the old man a package of candy and passed on the german took it as the bounty of the american people oddly manifested in a situation where he could otherwise have had little proof of their care he opened it and was sharing it with his son when the trainboy came back and metallically like a part of the machinery demanded ten cents the german stared helplessly and the boy repeated ten cents ten cents with tiresome patience while the other passengers smiled when it had passed through the aliens head that he was to pay for this national gift and he took with his tremulous fingers from the recesses of his pocketbook a tencent note and handed it to his tormentor some of the people laughed among the rest basil and isabel laughed and then looked at each other with eyes of mutual reproach  well upon my word my dear he said i think weve fallen pretty low ive never felt such a poor shabby ruffian before good heavens to think of our immortal souls being moved to mirth by such a thing as thisso stupid so barren of all reason of laughter and then the cruelty of it what ferocious imbeciles we are whom have i married a woman with neither heart nor brain  o basil dear pay him back the moneydo  i cant thats the worst of it he s money enough and might justly take offense what breaks my heart is that we could have the depravity to smile at the mistake of a friendless stranger who supposed he had at last met with an act of pure kindness its a thing to weep over look at these grinning wretches what a fiendish effect their smiles have through their cinders and sweat o its the terrible weather the despotism of the dust and heat the wickedness of the infernal air what a squalid and loathsome company  at buffalo where they arrived late they found themselves with several hours time on their hands before the train started for niagara and in the first moments of tedium isabel forgot herself into saying dont you think wed have done better to go directly from rochester to the falls instead of coming this way  why certainly i didnt propose coming this way  i know it dear i was only asking said isabel meekly but i should think youd have generosity enough to take a little of the blame when i wanted to come out of a romantic feeling for you  this romantic feeling referred to the fact that many years before when basil made his first visit to niagara he had approached from the west by way of buffalo and isabel who tenderly begrudged his having existed before she knew him and longed to ally herself retrospectively with his past was resolved to draw near the great cataract by no other route  she fetched a little sigh which might mean the weather or his hardheartedness the sigh touched him and he suggested a carriageride through the city she assented with eagerness for it was what she had been thinking of she had never seen a lakeside city before and she was taken by surprise if ever we leave boston she said we will not live at rochester as i thought last night well come to buffalo she found that the place had all the picturesqueness of a seaport without the ugliness that attends the rising and falling tides a delicious freshness breathed from the lake which lying so smooth faded into the sky at last with no line between sharper than that which divides drowsing from dreaming but the color was the most charming thing that delicate blue of the lake without the depth of the seablue but infinitely softer and lovelier the nearer expanses rippled with dainty waves silver and lucent the further levels made with the sundimmed summer sky a vague horizon of turquoise and amethyst lit by the white sails of ships and stained by the smoke of steamers  take me away now said isabel when her eyes had feasted upon all this and dont let me see another thing till i get to niagara nothing less sublime is worthy the eyes that have beheld such beauty  however on the way to niagara she consented to glimpses of the river which carries the waters of the lake for their mighty plunge and which shows itself very nobly from time to time as you draw toward the cataract with wooded or cultivated islands and rich farms along its low shores and at last flashes upon the eye the shining white of the rapidsa hint no more of the splendor and awfulness to be revealed     vi niagara  as the train stopped isabels heart beat with a childlike exultation as i believe every ones heart must who is worthy to arrive at niagara she had been trying to fancy from time to time that she heard the roar of the cataract and now when she alighted from the car she was sure she should have heard it but for the vulgar little noises that attend the arrival of trains at niagara as well as everywhere else never mind dearest you shall be stunned with it before you leave promised her husband and not wholly disconsolate she rode through the quaint streets of the village where it remains a question whether the lowliness of the shops and private houses makes the hotels look so vast or the bigness of the hotels dwarfs all the other buildings the immense caravansaries swelling up from among the little bazaars where they sell feather fans and miniature bark canoes and jars and vases and bracelets and brooches carved out of the local rocks made our friends with their trunks very conscious of their disproportion to the accommodations of the smallest they were the sole occupants of the omnibus and they were embarrassed to be received at their hotel with a burst of minstrelsy from a whole band of music isabel felt that a single stringed instrument of some timid note would have been enough and basil was going to express his own modest preference for a jewsharp when the music ceased with a sudden clash of the cymbals but the next moment it burst out with fresh sweetness and in alighting they perceived that another omnibus had turned the corner and was drawing up to the pillared portico of the hotel a small family dismounted and the feet of the last had hardly touched the pavement when the music again ended as abruptly as those flourishes of trumpets that usher playerkings upon the stage isabel could not help laughing at this melodious parsimony i hope they dont let on the cataract and shut it off in this frugal style do they basil she asked and passed jesting through a pomp of unoccupied porters and tallboys apparently there were not many people stopping at this hotel or else they were all out looking at the falls or confined to their rooms however our travellers took in the almost weird emptiness of the place with their usual gratitude to fortune for all queerness in life and followed to the pleasant quarters assigned them there was time before supper for a glance at the cataract and after a brief toilet they sallied out again upon the holiday street with its parade of gay little shops and thence passed into the grove beside the falls enjoying at every instant their feeling of arrival at a sublime destination  in this sense niagara deserves almost to rank with rome the metropolis of history and religion with venice the chief city of sentiment and fantasy in either you are at once made at home by a perception of its greatness in which there is no quality of aggression as there always seems to be in minor places as well as in minor men and you gratefully accept its sublimity as a fact in no way contrasting with your own insignificance  our friends were beset of course by many carriagedrivers whom they repelled with the kindly firmness of experienced travel isabel even felt a compassion for these poor fellows who had seen niagara so much as to have forgotten that the first time one must see it alone or only with the next of friendship she was voluble in her pity of basil that it was not as new to him as to her till between the trees they saw a white cloud of spray shot through and through with sunset rising rising and she felt her voice softly and steadily beaten down by the diapason of the cataract  i am not sure but the first emotion on viewing niagara is that of familiarity ever after its strangeness increases but in that earliest moment when you stand by the side of the american fall and take in so much of the whole as your giants can compass an impression of having seen it often before is certainly very vivid this may be an effect of that grandeur which puts you at your ease in its presence but it also undoubtedly results in part from lifelong acquaintance with every variety of futile picture of the scene you have its outward form clearly in your memory the shores the rapids the islands the curve of the falls and the stout rainbow with one end resting on their top and the other lost in the mists that rise from the gulf beneath on the whole i do not account this sort of familiarity a misfortune the surprise is none the less a surprise because it is kept till the last and the marvel making itself finally felt in every nerve and not at once through a single sense all the more fully possesses you it is as if niagara reserved her magnificence and preferred to win your heart with her beauty and so isabel who was instinctively prepared for the reverse suffered a vague disappointment for a little instant as she looked along the verge from the water that caressed the shore at her feet before it flung itself down to the wooded point that divides the american from the canadian fall beyond which showed dimly through its veil of golden and silver mists the emerald wall of the great horseshoe how still it is she said amidst the roar that shook the ground under their feet and made the leaves tremble overhead and how lonesome amidst the people lounging and sauntering about in every direction among the trees in fact that prodigious presence does make a solitude and silence round every spirit worthy to perceive it and it gives a kind of dignity to all its belongings so that the rocks and pebbles in the waters edge and the weeds and grasses that nod above it have a value far beyond that of such common things elsewhere in all the aspects of niagara there seems a grave simplicity which is perhaps a reflection of the spectators soul for once utterly dismantled of affectation and convention in the vulgar reaction from this you are of course as trivial if you like at niagara as anywhere  slowly isabel became aware that the sacred grove beside the fall was profaned by some very common presences indeed that tossed bits of stone and sticks into the consecrated waters and struggled for handkerchiefs and fans and here and there put their arms about each others waists and made a show of laughing and joking they were a picnic party of rude silly folks of the neighborhood and she stood pondering them in sad wonder if anything could be worse when she heard a voice saying to basil take you next sir plenty of light yet and the winds down the river so the spray wont interfere make a capital picture of you falls in the background it was the local photographer urging them to succeed the young couple he had just posed at the brink the gentleman was sitting down with his legs crossed and his hands elegantly disposed the lady was standing at his side with one arm thrown lightly across his shoulder while with the other hand she thrust his cane into the ground you could see it was going to be a splendid photograph  basil thanked the artist and isabel said trusting as usual to his sympathy for perception of her train of thought well ill never try to be highstrung again but shouldnt you have thought dearest that i might expect to be highstrung with success at niagara if anywhere she passively followed him into the long queer downwardsloping edifice on the border of the grove unflinchingly mounted the car that stood ready and descended the incline emerging into the light again she found herself at the foot of the fall by whose top she had just stood at first she was glad there were other people down there as if she and basil were not enough to bear it alone and she could almost have spoken to the two hopelessly pretty brides with parasols and impertinent little boots whom their attendant husbands were helping over the sharp and slippery rocks so bare beyond the spray so green and mossy within the fall of mist but in another breath she forgot them as she looked on that dizzied sea hurling itself from the high summit in huge white knots and breaks and masses and plunging into the gulf beside her while it sent continually up a strong voice of lamentation and crawled away in vast eddies with somehow a look of human terror bewilderment and pain it was bathed in snowy vapor to its crest but now and then heavy currents of air drew this aside and they saw the outline of the falls almost as far as the canada side they remembered afterwards how they were able to make use of but one sense at a time and how when they strove to take in the forms of the descending flood they ceased to hear it but as soon as they released their eyes from this service every fibre in them vibrated to the sound and the spectacle dissolved away in it they were aware too of a strange capriciousness in their senses and of a tendency of each to palter with the things perceived the eye could no longer take truthful note of quality and now beheld the tumbling deluge as a gothic wall of careen marble white motionless and now as a fall of lightest snow with movement in all its atoms and scarce so much cohesion as would hold them together and again they could not discern if this course were from above or from beneath whether the water rose from the abyss or dropped from the height the ear could give the brain no assurance of the sound that felled it and whether it were great or little the prevailing softness of the cataracts tone seemed so much opposed to ideas of prodigious force or of prodigious volume it was only when the sight so idle in its own behalf came to the aid of the other sense and showed them the mute movement of each others lips that they dimly appreciated the depth of sound that involved them  i think you might have been highstrung there for a second or two said basil when ascending the incline he could make himself heard we will try the bridge next  over the river so still with its oily eddies and delicate wreaths of foam just below the falls they have in late years woven a web of wire high in air and hung a bridge from precipice to precipice of all the bridges made with hands it seems the lightest most ethereal it is ideally graceful and droops from its slight towers like a garland it is worthy to command as it does the whole grandeur of niagara and to show the traveller the vast spectacle from the beginning of the american fall to the farthest limit of the horseshoe with all the awful pomp of the rapids the solemn darkness of the wooded islands the mystery of the vaporous gulf the indomitable wildness of the shores as far as the eye can reach up or down the fatal stream  to this bridge our friends now repaired by a path that led through another of those groves which keep the village back from the shores of the river on the american side and greatly help the sightseers pleasure in the place the exquisite structure which sways so tremulously from its towers and seems to lay so slight a hold on earth where its cables sink into the ground is to other bridges what the blood horse is to the common breed of roadsters ant now they felt its sensitive nerves quiver under them and sympathetically through them as they advanced farther and farther toward the centre perhaps their sympathy with the bridges trepidation was too great for unalloyed delight and yet the thrill was a glorious one to be known only there and afterwards at least they would not have had their airy path seem more secure  the last hues of sunset lingered in the mists that sprung from the base of the falls with a mournful tremulous grace and a movement weird as the play of the northern lights they were touched with the most delicate purples and crimsons that darkened to deep red and then faded from them at a second look and they flew upward swiftly upward like troops of pale transparent ghosts while a perfectly clear radiance better than any other for local color dwelt upon the scene far under the bridge the river smoothly swam the undercurrents forever unfolding themselves upon the surface with a vast roselike evolution edged all round with faint lines of white where the air that filled the water freed itself in foam what had been clear green on the face of the cataract was here more like rich verdantique and had a look of firmness almost like that of the stone itself so it showed beneath the bridge and down the river till the curving shores hid it these springing abruptly prom the waters brink and shagged with pine and cedar displayed the tender verdure of grass and bushes intermingled with the dark evergreens that comb from ledge to ledge till they point their speary tops above the crest of bluffs in front where tumbled rocks and expanses of caked clay varied the gloomier and gayer green sprung those spectral mists and through them loomed out in its manifold majesty niagara with the seemingly immovable white gothic screen of the american fall and the green massive curve of the horseshoe solid and simple and calm as an egyptian wall while behind this with their white and black expanses broken by dark foliaged little isles the steep canadian rapids billowed down between their heavily wooded shores  the weddingjourneyers hung they knew not how long in rapture on the sight and then looking back from the shore to the spot where they had stood they felt relieved that unreality should possess itself of all and that the bridge should swing there in midair like a filmy web scarce more passable than the rainbow that flings its arch above the mists  on the portico of the hotel they found half a score of gentlemen smoking and creating together that collective silence which passes for sociality on our continent some carriages stood before the door and within around the base of a pillar sat a circle of idle callboys there were a few trunks heaped together in one place with a porter standing guard over them a solitary guest was buying a cigar at the newspaper stand in one corner another friendless creature was writing a letter in the readingroom the clerk in a seersucker coat and a lavish shirtbosom tried to give the whole an effect of wateringplace gayety and bustle as he provided a newly arrived guest with a room  our pair took in these traits of solitude and repose with indifference if the hotel had been thronged with brilliant company they would have been no more and no less pleased and when after supper they came into the grand parlor and found nothing there but a marbletopped centre table with a silverplated icepitcher and a small company of goblets they sat down perfectly content in a secluded windowseat they were not seen by the three people who entered soon after and halted in the centre of the room  why kitty said one of the two ladies who must be in any travellingparty of three this is more inappropriate to your gorgeous array than the supperroom even  she who was called kitty was armed as for social conquest in some kind of airy eveningdress and was looking round with bewilderment upon that forlorn waste of carpeting and upholstery she owned with a smile that she had not seen so much of the world yet as she had been promised but she liked niagara very much and perhaps they should find the world at breakfast  no said the other lady who was as unquiet as kitty was calm and who seemed resolved to make the most of the worst it isnt probable that the hotel will fill up overnight and i feel personally responsible for this state of things who would ever have supposed that niagara would be so empty i thought the place was thronged the whole summer long how do you account for it richard  the gentleman looked fatigued as from a longcontinued discussion elsewhere of the matter in hand and he said that he had not been trying to account for it  then you dont care for kittys pleasure at all and you dont want her to enjoy herself why dont you take some interest in the matter  why if i accounted for the emptiness of niagara in the most satisfactory way it wouldnt add a soul to the floating population under the circumstances i prefer to leave it unexplained  do you think its because its such a hot summer do you suppose its not exactly the season didnt you expect thered be more people perhaps niagara isnt as fashionable as it used to be  it looks something like that  well what under the sun do you think is the reason  i dont know  perhaps interposed kitty placidly most of the visitors go to the other hotel now  it s altogether likely said the other lady eagerly there are just such caprices  well said richard i wanted you to go there  but you said that you always heard this was the a most fashionable  i know it i didnt want to come here for that reason but fortune favors the brave  well its too bad here weve asked kitty to come to niagara with us just to give her a little peep into the world and youve brought us to a hotel where were  monarchs of all we survey suggested kitty  yes and start at the sound of our own added the other lady helplessly  come now fanny said the gentleman who was but too clearly the husband of the last speaker you know you insisted against all i could say or do upon coming to this house i implored you to go to the other and now you blame me for bringing you here  so i do if youd let me have my own way without opposition about coming here i dare my i should have gone to the other place but never mind kitty knows whom to blame i hope she s your cousin  kitty was sitting with her hands quiescently folded in her lap she now rose and said that she did not know anything about the other hotel and perhaps it was just as empty as this  it cant be there cant be two hotels so empty said fanny it dont stand to reason  if you wish kitty to see the world so much said the gentleman why dont you take her on to quebec with us  kitty had left her seat beside fanny and was moving with a listless content about the parlor  i wonder you ask richard when you know shes only come for the night and has nothing with her but a few cuffs and collars i certainly never heard of anything so absurd before  the absurdity of the idea then seemed to cast its charm upon her for after a silence i could lend her some things she said musingly but dont speak of it tonight please its too ridiculous kitty she called out and as the young lady drew near she continued how would you like to go to quebec with us  o fanny cried kitty with rapture and then with dismay how can i  why very well i think youve got this dress and your travellingsuit and i can lend you whatever you want come she added joyously lets go up to your room and talk it over  the two ladies vanished upon this impulse and the gentleman followed to their own relief the guiltless eavesdroppers who found no moment favorable for revealing themselves after the comedy began issued from their retiracy  what a remarkable little lady said basil eagerly turning to isabel for sympathy in his enjoyment of her inconsequence  yes poor thing returned his wife its no light matter to invite a young lady to take a journey with you and promise her all sorts of gayety and perhaps beaux and flirtations and then find her on your hands in a desolation like this its dreadful i think  basil stared o certainly he said but what an amusingly illogical little body  i dont understand what you mean basil it was the only thing that she could do to invite the young lady to go on with them i wonder her husband had the sense to think of it first of course shell have to lend her things  and you didnt observe anything peculiar in her way of reaching her conclusions  peculiar what do you mean  why her blaming her husband for letting her have her own way about the hotel and her telling him not to mention his proposal to kitty and then doing it herself justafter shed pronounced it absurd and impossible he spoke with heat at being forced to make what he thought a needless explanation  o said isabel after a moments reflection that did you think it so very odd  her husband looked at her with the gravity a man must feel when he begins to perceive that he has married the whole mystifying world of womankind in the woman of his choice and made no answer but to his own soul he said i supposed i had the pleasure of my wifes acquaintance it seems i have been flattering myself  the next morning they went out as they had planned for an exploration of goat island after an early breakfast as they sauntered through the villages contrasts of pigmy and colossal in architecture they praisefully took in the unalloyed holiday character of the place enjoying equally the lounging tourists at the hotel doors the drivers and their carriages to let and the little shops with nothing but mementos of niagara and indian beadwork and other trumpery to sell shops so useless they agreed could not be found outside the palms royale or the square of st mark or anywhere else in the world but here they felt themselves once more a part of the tide of mere sightseeing pleasuretravel on which they had drifted in other days and in an eddy of which their love itself had opened its white blossom and lilylike dreamed upon the wave  they were now also part of the great circle of newly wedded bliss which involving the whole land during the season of bridaltours may be said to show richest and fairest at niagara like the costly jewel of a precious ring the place is in fact almost abandoned to bridal couples and any one out of his honeymoon is in some degree an alien there and must discern a certain immodesty in him intrusion is it for his profane eyes to look upon all that blushing and trembling joy a man of any sensibility must desire to veil his face and bowing his excuses to the collective rapture take the first train for the wicked outside world to which he belongs everywhere he sees brides and brides three or four with the benediction still on them come down in the same car with him he hands her travellingshawl after one as she springs from the omnibus into her husbands arms there are two or three walking back and forth with their new lords upon the porch of the hotel at supper they are on every side of him and he feels himself suffused as it were by a roseate atmosphere of youth and love and hope at breakfast it is the same and then in his wanderings about the place he constantly meets them they are of all manners of beauty fair and dark slender and plump tall and short but they are all beautiful with the radiance of loving and being loved now if ever in their lives they are charmingly dressed and ravishing toilets take the willing eye from the objects of interest how high the heels of the pretty boots how small the tendertinted gloves how electrical the flutter of the snowy skirts what is niagara to these things  isabel was not willing to own her bridal sisterhood to these blessed souls but she secretly rejoiced in it even while she joined basil in noting their number and smiling at their innocent abandon she dropped his arm at encounter of the first couple and walked carelessly at his side she made a solemn vow never to take hold of his watchchain in speaking to him she trusted that she might be preserved from putting her face very close to his at dinner in studying the bill of fare getting out of carriages she forbade him ever to take her by the waist all ascetic resolutions are modified by experiment but if isabel did not rigorously keep these she is not the less to be praised for having formed them  just before they reached the bridge to goat island they passed a little group of the indians still lingering about niagara who make the barbaric wares in which the shops abound and like the woods and the wild faces of the cliffs and precipices help to keep the cataract remote and to invest it with the charm of primeval loneliness this group were women and they sat motionless on the ground smiling sphinxlike over their laps full of beadwork and turning their dark liquid eyes of invitation upon the passers they wore bright kirtles and red shawls fell from their heads over their plump brown cheeks and down their comfortable persons a little girl with them was attired in like gayety of color what is her name asked isabel paying for a bead pincushion daisy smith said her mother in distressingly good english but her indian name she has none answered the woman who told basil that her village numbered five hundred people and that they were protestants while they talked they were joined by an indian whom the women saluted musically in their native tongue this was somewhat consoling but he wore trousers and a waistcoat and it could have been wished that he had not a silk hat on  still said isabel as they turned away im glad he hasnt lislethread gloves like that chieftain we saw putting his forest queen on board the train at oneida but how shocking that they should be christians and protestants it would have been bad enough to have them catholics and that woman said that they were increasing they ought to be fading away  on the bridge they paused and looked up and down the rapids rushing down the slope in all their wild variety with the white crests of breaking surf the dark massiveness of heavyclimbing waves the fleet smooth sweep of currents over broad shelves of sunken rock the dizzy swirl and suck of whirlpools  spellbound the journeyers pored upon the deathful course beneath their feet gave a shudder to the horror of being cast upon it and then hurried over the bridge to the island in the shadow of whose wildness they sought refuge from the sight and sound  there had been rain in the night the air war full of forest fragrance and the low sweet voice of twittering birds presently they came to a bench set in a corner of the path and commanding a pleasant vista of sunlit foliage with a mere gleam of the foaming river beyond as they sat down here loverwise basil as in the early days of their courtship began to recite a poem it was one which had been haunting him since his first sight of the rapids one of many that he used to learn by heart in his youththe rhyme of some poor newspaper poet whom the third or fourth editor copying his verses consigned to oblivion by carelessly clipping his name from the bottom it had always lingered in basils memory rather from the interest of the awful fact it recorded than from any merit of its own and now he recalled it with a distinctness that surprised him                   avery                    i all night long they heard in the houses beside the shore heard or seemed to hear through the multitudinous roar out of the hell of the rapids as twere a lost souls cries heard and could not believe and the morning mocked their eyes showing where wildest and fiercest the waters leaped up and ran raving round him and past the visage of a man clinging or seeming to cling to the trunk of a tree that caught fast in the rocks below scarce out of the surges raught was it a life could it be to yon slender hope that clung shrill above all the tumult the answering terror rang                    ii under the weltering rapids a boat from the bridge is drowned over the rocks the lines of another are tangled and wound and the long fateful hours of the morning have wasted soon as it had been in some blessed trance and now it is noon hurry now with the raft but o build it strong and stanch and to the lines and the treacherous rocks look well as you launch over the foamy tops of the waves and their foamsprent sides over the hidden reefs and through the embattled tides onward rushes the raft with many a lurch and leaplord if it strike him loose from the hold he scarce can keep no through all peril unharmed it reaches him harmless at least and to its proven strength he lashes his weakness fast now for the shore but steady steady my men and slow taut now the quivering lines now slack and so let her go thronging the shores around stands the pitying multitude wan as his own are their looks and a nightmare seems to brood heavy upon them and heavy the silence hangs on all save for the rapids plunge and the thunder of the fall but on a sudden thrills from the people still and pale chorussing his unheard despair a desperate wail caught on a lurking point of rock it sways and swings sport of the pitiless waters the raft to which he clings                    iii all the long afternoon it idly swings and sways and on the shore the crowd lifts up its hands and prays lifts to heaven and wrings the hands so helpless to save prays for the mercy of god on him whom the rock and the ways battle for fettered betwixt them and who amidst their strife straggles to help his helpers and fights so hard for his life tugging at rope and at reef while men weep and women swoon priceless second by second so wastes the afternoon and it is sunset now and another boat and the last down to him from the bridge through the rapids has safely passed                    iv wild through the crowd comes flying a man that nothing can stay maddening against the gate that is locked athwart his way no we keep the bridge for them that can help him you tell us who are you his brother god help you both pass through wild with wide arms of imploring he calls aloud to him unto the face of his brother scarce seen in the distance dim but in the roar of the rapids his fluttering words are lost as in a wind of autumn the leaves of autumn are tossed and from the bridge he sees his brother sever the rope holding him to the raft and rise secure in his hope sees all as in a dream the terrible pageantry populous shores the woods the sky the birds flying free sees then the formthat spent with effort and fasting and fear flings itself feebly and fails of the boat that is lying so near caught in the longbaffled clutch of the rapids and rolled and hurled headlong on to the cataracts brink and out of the world   o basil said isabel with a long sigh breaking the hush that best praised the unknown poets skill it isnt true is it  every word almost even to the brothers coming at the last moment its a very wellknown incident he added and i am sure the reader whose memory runs back twenty years cannot have forgotten it  niagara indeed is an awful homicide nearly every point of interest about the place has killed its man and there might well be a deeper stain of crimson than it ever wears in that pretty bow overarching the falls its beauty is relieved against an historical background as gloomy as the lightesthearted tourist could desire the abominable savages revering the cataract as a kind of august devil and leading a life of demoniacal misery and wickedness whom the first jesuits found here two hundred years ago the ferocious iroquois bloodily driving out these squalid devilworshippers the french planting the fort that yet guards the mouth of the river and therewith the seeds of war that fruited afterwards in murderous strifes throughout the whole niagara country the struggle for the military posts on the river during the wars of france and england the awful scene in the conspiracy of pontiac where a detachment of english troops was driven by the indians over the precipice near the great whirlpool the sorrow and havoc visited upon the american settlements in the revolution by the savages who prepared their attacks in the shadow of fort niagara the battles of chippewa and of lundys lane that mixed the roar of their cannon with that of the fall the savage forays with tomahawk and scalpingknife and the blazing villages on either shore in the war of 1812these are the memories of the place the links in a chain of tragical interest scarcely broken before our time since the white man first beheld the mistveiled face of niagara the facts lost nothing of their due effect as basil in the ramble across goat island touched them with the reflected light of mr parkmans historiesthose precious books that make our meagre past wear something of the rich romance of old european days and illumine its savage solitudes with the splendor of mediaeval chivalry and the glory of mediaeval martyrdomand then lacking this light turned upon them the feeble glimmer of the guidebooks he and isabel enjoyed the lurid picture with all the zest of sentimentalists dwelling upon the troubles of other times from the shelter of the safe and peaceful present they were both poets in their quality of bridal couple and so long as their own nerves were unshaken they could transmute all facts to entertaining fables they pleasantly exercised their sympathies upon those who every year perish at niagara in the tradition of its awful power only they refused their cheap and selfish compassion to the hermit of goat island who dwelt so many years in its conspicuous seclusion and was finally carried over the cataract this public character they suspected of design in his death as in his life and they would not be moved by his memory though they gave a sigh to that dream half pathetic half ludicrous yet not ignoble of mordecai noah who thought to assemble all the jews of the world and all the indians as remnants of the lost tribes upon grand island there to rebuild jerusalem and who actually laid the cornerstone of the new temple there  goat island is marvelously wild for a place visited by so many thousands every year the shrubbery and undergrowth remain unravaged and form a deceitful privacy in which even at that early hour of the day they met many other pairs it seemed incredible that the village and the hotels should be so full and that the wilderness should also abound in them yet on every embowered seat and going to and from all points of interest and danger were these newwedded lovers with their interlacing arms and their fond attitudes in which each seemed to support and lean upon the other such a pair stood prominent before them when basil and isabel emerged at last from the cover of the woods at the head of the island and glanced up the broad swift stream to the point where it ran smooth before breaking into the rapids and as a soft pastoral feature in the foreground of that magnificent landscape they found them far from unpleasing some such pair is in the foreground of every famous american landscape and when i think of the amount of public lovemaking in the season of pleasuretravel from mount desert to the yosemite and from the parks of colorado to the keys of florida i feel that our continent is but a larger arcady that the middle of the nineteenth century is the golden age and that we want very little of being a nation of shepherds and shepherdesses  our friends returned by the shore of the canadian rapids having traversed the island by a path through the heart of the woods and now drew slowly near the falls again all parts of the prodigious pageant have an eternal novelty and they beheld the evervarying effect of that constant sublimity with the sense of discoverers or rather of people whose great fortune it is to see the marvel in its beginning and new from the creating hand the morning hour lent its sunny charm to this illusion while in the cavernous precipices of the shores dark with evergreens a mystery as of primeval night seemed to linger there was a wild fluttering of their nerves a rapture with an underconsciousness of pain the exaltation of peril and escape when they came to the three little isles that extend from goat island one beyond another far out into the furious channel three pretty suspensionbridges connect them now with the larger island and under each of these flounders a huge rapid and hurls itself away to mingle with the ruin of the fall the three sisters are mere fragments of wilderness clumps of vinetangled woods planted upon masses of rock but they are part of the fascination of niagara which no one resists nor could isabel have been persuaded from exploring them it wants no courage to do this but merely submission to the local sorcery and the adventurer has no other reward than the consciousness of having been where but a few years before no human being had perhaps set foot she grossed from bridge to bridge with a quaking heart and at last stood upon the outermost isle whence through the screen of vines and boughs she gave fearful glances at the heaving and tossing flood beyond from every wave of which at every instant she rescued herself with a desperate struggle the exertion told heavily upon her strength unawares and she suddenly made basil another revelation of character without the slightest warning she sank down at the root of a tree and said with serious composure that she could never go back on those bridges they were not safe he stared at her cowering form in blank amaze and put his hands in his pockets then it occurred to his dull masculine sense that it must be a joke and he said well ill have you taken off in a boat  o do basil do have me taken off in a boat implored isabel you see yourself the midges are not safe do get a boat  or a balloon he suggested humoring the pleasantry  isabel burst into tears and now he went on his knees at her side and took her hands in his isabel isabel are you crazy he cried as if he meant to go mad himself she moaned and shuddered in reply he said to mend matters that it was a jest about the boat and he was driven to despair when isabel repeated i never can go back by the bridges never  but what do you propose to do  i dont know i dont know  he would try sarcasm do you intend to set up a hermitage here and have your meals sent out from the hotel its a charming spot and visited pretty constantly but its small even for a hermitage  isabel moaned again with her hands still on her eyes and wondered that he was not ashamed to make fun of her  he would try kindness perhaps darling youll let me carry you ashore  no that will bring double the weight on the bridge at once  couldnt you shut your eyes and let me lead you  why it isnt the sight of the rapids she said looking up fiercely the bridges are not safe im not a child basil o what shall we do  i dont know said basil gloomily its an exigency for which i wasnt prepared then he silently gave himself to the evil one for having probably overwrought isabels nerves by repeating that poem about avery and by the ensuing talk about niagara which she had seemed to enjoy so much he asked her if that was it and she answered o no its nothing but the bridges he proved to her that the bridges upon all known principles were perfectly safe and that they could not give way she shook her head but made no answer and he lost his patience  isabel he cried im ashamed of you  dont say anything youll be sorry for afterwards basil she replied with the forbearance of those who have reason and justice on their side  the rapids beat and shouted round their little prisonisle each billow leaping as if possessed by a separate demon the absurd horror of the situation overwhelmed him he dared not attempt to carry her ashore for she might spring from his grasp into the flood he could not leave her to call for help and what if nobody came till she lost her mind from terror or what if somebody should come and find them in that ridiculous affliction  somebody was coming  isabel he shouted in her ear here come those people we saw in the parlor last night  isabel dashed her veil over her face clutched basils with her icy hand rose drew her arm convulsively through his and walked ashore without a word  in a sheltered nook they sat down and she quickly repaired her drooping head and tricked her beams again he could see her tearfully smiling through her veil my dear he said i dont ask an explanation of your fright for i dont suppose you could give it but should you mind telling me why those people were so sovereign against it  why dearest dont you understand that mrs richardwhoever she isis so much like me  she looked at him as if she had made the most satisfying statement and he thought he had better not ask further then but wait in hope that the meaning would come to him they walked on in silence till they came to the biddle stairs at the head of which is a notice that persons have been killed by pieces of rock from the precipice overhanging the shore below and warning people that they descend at their peril isabel declined to visit the cave of the winds to which these stairs lead but was willing to risk the ascent of terrapin tower thanks no said her husband you might find it unsafe to come back the way you went up we cant count certainly upon the appearance of the lady who is so much like you and ive no fancy for spending my life on terrapin tower so he found her a seat and went alone to the top of the audacious little structure standing on the verge of the cataract between the smooth curve of the horseshoe and the sculptured front of the central fall with the stormy sea of the rapids behind and the river dim seen through the mists crawling away between its lofty bluffs before he knew again the awful delight with which so long ago he had watched the changes in the beauty of the canadian fall as it hung a mass of translucent green from the brink and a pearly white seemed to crawl up from the abyss and penetrate all its substance to the very crest and then suddenly vanished from it and perpetually renewed the same effect the mystery of the rising vapors veiled the gulf into which the cataract swooped the sun shone and a rainbow dreamed upon them  near the foot of the tower some loose rocks extend quite to the verge and here basil saw an elderly gentleman skipping from one slippery stone to another and looking down from time to time into the abyss who when he had amused himself long enough in this way clambered up on the plank bridge basil who had descended by this time made bold to say that he thought the diversion an odd one and rather dangerous the gentleman took this in good part and owned it might seem so but added that a distinguished phrenologist had examined his head and told him he had equilibrium so large that he could go anywhere  on your bridal tour i presume he continued as they approached the bench where basil had left isabel she had now the company of a plain middleaged woman whose attire hesitatingly expressed some inward festivity and had a certain reluctant fashionableness well this is my third bridal tour to niagara and my wife s been here once before on the same business we see a good many changes i used to stand on table rock with the others now thats all gone well old lady shall we move on he asked and this bridal pair passed up the path attended haply by the guardian spirits of those who gave the place so many sad yet pleasing associations  at dinner mr richards party sat at the table next basils and they were all now talking cheerfully over the emptiness of the spacious dininghall  well kitty the married lady was saying you can tell the girls what you please about the gayeties of niagara when you get home theyll believe anything sooner than the truth  o yes indeed said kitty ive got a good deal of it made up already ill describe a grand hop at the hotel with fashionable people from all parts of the country and the gentlemen i danced with the most im going to have had quite a flirtation with the gentleman of the long blond mustache whom we met on the bridge this morning and hes got to do duty in accounting for my missing glove itll never do to tell the girls i dropped it from the top of terrapin tower then you know fanny i really can say something about dining with aristocratic southerners waited upon by their black servants  this referred to the sadfaced patrician whom basil and isabel had noted in the cars from buffalo as a southerner probably coming north for the first time since the war he had an air at once fierce and sad and a halfbarbaric homicidal gentility of manner fascinating enough in its way he sat with his wife at a table farther down the room and their child was served in part by a little tancolored nursemaid the fact did not quite answer to the young ladys description of it and get it certainly afforded her a groundwork basil fancied a sort of bewilderment in the southerner and explained it upon the theory that he used to come every year to niagara before the war and was now puzzled to find it so changed  yes he said i cant account for him except as the ghost of southern travel and i cant help feeling a little sorry for him i suppose that almost any evil commends itself by its ruin the wrecks of slavery are fast growing a fungus crop of sentiment and they may yet outflourish the remains of the feudal system in the kind of poetry they produce the impoverished slaveholder is a pathetic figure in spite of all justice and reason the beaten rebel does move us to compassion and it is of no use to think of andersonville in his presence this gentleman and others like him used to be the lords of our summer resorts they spent the money they did not earn like princes they held their heads high they trampled upon the abolitionist in his lair they received the homage of the doughface in his home they came up here from their riceswamps and cottonfields and bullied the whole busy civilization of the north everybody who had merchandise or principles to sell truckled to them and travel amongst us was a triumphal progress now theyre moneyless and subjugated as they call it theres none so poor to do them reverence and its left for me an abolitionist from the cradle to sigh over their fate after all they had noble traits and it was no great wonder they got to despise us seeing what most of us were it seems to me i should like to know our friend i cant help feeling towards him as towards a fallen prince heaven help my craven spirit i wonder how our colored waiter feels towards him i dare say he admires him immensely  there were not above a dozen other people in the room and basil contrasted the scene with that which the same place formerly presented in the old time he said every table was full and we dined to the music of a brass band i cant say i liked the band but i miss it i wonder if our southern friend misses it they gave us a very small allowance of brass band when we arrived isabel upon my word i wonder whats come over the place he said as the southern party rising from the table walked out of the diningroom attended by many treacherous echoes in spite of an ostentatious clatter of dishes that the waiters made  after dinner they drove on the canada shore up past the clifton house towards the burning spring which is not the least wonder of niagara as each bubble breaks upon the troubled surface and yields its flash of infernal flame and its whiff of sulphurous stench it seems hardly strange that the neutral nation should have revered the cataract as a demon and another subtle spell not to be broken even by the businesslike composure of the man who shows off the hellbroth is added to those successive sorceries by which niagara gradually changes from a thing of beauty to a thing of terror by all odds too the most tremendous view of the falls is afforded by the point on the drive whence you look down upon the horseshoe and behold its three massive walls of sea rounding and sweeping into the gulf together the color gone and the smooth brink showing black and ridgy  would they not go to the battlefield of lundys lane asked the driver at a certain point on their return but isabel did not care for battlefields and basil preferred to keep intact the reminiscence of his former visit they have a sort of tower of observation built on the battleground he said as they drove on down by the river and it was in charge of an old canadian militiaman who had helped his countrymen to be beaten in the fight this hero gave me a simple and unintelligible account of the battle asking me first if i had ever heard of general scott and adding without flinching that here he got his earliest laurels he seemed to go just so long to every listener and nothing could stop him short so i fell into a revery until he came to an end it was hard to remember that sweet summer morning when the sun shone and the birds sang and the music of a piano and a girls voice rose from a bowery cottage near that all the pure air had once been tainted with battlesmoke that the peaceful fields had been planted with cannon instead of potatoes and corn and that where the cows came down the farmers lane with tinkling bells the shock of armed men had befallen the blue and tranquil ontario gleamed far away and far away rolled the beautiful land with farmhouses fields and woods and at the foot of the tower lay the pretty village the battle of the past seemed only a vagary of mine yet how could i doubt the warrior at my elbowgrieved though i was to find that a habit of strong drink had the better of his utterance that morning my driver explained afterwards that persons visiting the field were commonly so much pleased with the captains eloquence that they kept the noble old soldier in a brandy andwater rapture throughout the season thereby greatly refreshing his memory and making the battle bloodier and bloodier as the season advanced and the number of visitors increased there my dear he suddenly broke off as they came in sight of a slender stream of water that escaped from the brow of a cliff on the american side below the falls and spun itself into a gauze of silvery mist thats the bridal veil and i suppose you think the stream which is making such a fine display yonder is some idle brooklet ending a long course of error and worthlessness by that spectacular plunge its nothing of the kind its an honest hydraulic canal of the most straightforward character a poor but respectable millrace which has devoted itself strictly to business and has turned millwheels instead of fooling round waterlilies it can afford that ultimate finery what you behold in the bridal veil my love is the apotheosis of industry  what i cant help thinking of said isabel who had not paid the smallest attention to the bridal veil or anything about it is the awfulness of stepping off these places in the nighttime she referred to the road which next the precipice is unguarded by any sort of parapet in europe a strong wall would secure it but we manage things differently on our continent and carriages go running over the brink from time to time  if your thoughts have that direction answered her husband we had better go back to the hotel and leave the whirlpool for tomorrow morning its late for it today at any rate he had treated isabel since the adventure on the three sisters with a superiority which he felt himself to be very odious but which he could not disuse  im not afraid she sighed but in the words of the retreating soldier iim awfully demoralized and added you know we must reserve some of the vital forces for shopping this evening  part of their business also was to buy the tickets for their return to boston by way of montreal and quebec and it was part of their pleasure to get these of the heartiest imaginable ticketagent he was a colonel or at least a major and he made a polite feint of calling basil by some military title he commended the trip they were about to make as the most magnificent and beautiful on the whole continent and he commended them for intending to make it he said that was mrs general bowdur of philadelphia who just went out did they know her somehow the titles affected basil as of older date than the late war and as belonging to the militia period and he imagined for the agent the romance of a life spent at a wateringplace in contact with rich moneyspending pleasuretaking people who formed his whole jovial world the colonel who included them in this world and thereby brevetted them rich and fashionable could not secure a stateroom for them on the boata perfectly splendid lake steamer which would take them down the rapids of the st lawrence and on to montreal without changebut he would give them a letter to the captain who was a very particular friend of his and would be happy to show them as his friends every attention and so he wrote a note ascribing peculiar merits to basil and in spite of all reason making him feel for the moment that he was privileged by a document which was no doubt part of every such transaction he spoke in a loud cheerful voice he laughed jollily at no apparent joke he bowed very low and said goodevening at parting and they went away as if he had blessed them  the rest of the evening they spent in wandering through the village charmed with its bizarre mixture of quaintness and commonplaceness in hanging about the shopwindows with their monotonous variety of feather fanseach with a violently red or yellow bird painfully sacrificed in its centremoccasins beadwrought workbags tobaccopouches bows and arrows and whatever else the savage art of the neighboring squaws can invent in sauntering through these gay booths pricing many things and in hanging long and undecidedly over cases full of feldspar crosses quartz bracelets and necklaces and every manner of vase inoperative pitcher and other vessel that can be fashioned out of the geological formations at niagara tormented meantime by the heat of the gaslights and the persistence of the mosquitoes there were very few people besides themselves in the shops and isabels purchases were not lavish her husband had made up his mind to get her some little keepsake and when he had taken her to the hotel he ran back to one of the shops and hastily bought her a feather fana magnificent thing of deep magenta dye shading into blue with a whole yellowbird transfixed in the centre when he triumphantly displayed it in their room whos that for basil demanded his wife the cook but seeing his ghastly look at this she fell upon his neck crying o you poor old tasteless darling youve got it for me and seemed about to die of laughter  didnt you start and throw up your hands he stammered when you came to that case of fans  yesin horror did you think i liked the cruel things with their dead birds and their hideous colors o basil dearest you are incorrigible cant you learn that magenta is the vilest of all the hues that the perverseness of man has invented in defiance of nature now my love just promise me one thing she said pathetically were going to do a little shopping in montreal you know and perhaps youll be wanting to surprise me with something there dont do it or if you must do tell me all about it beforehand and what the color of its to be and i can say whether to get it or not and then therell be some taste about it and i shall be truly surprised and pleased  she turned to put the fan into her trunk and he murmured something about exchanging it no she said well keep it as aamonument and she deposed him with another peal of laughter from the proud height to which he had climbed in pity of her nervous fears of the day so completely were their places changed that he doubted if it were not he who had made that scene on the third sister and when isabel said o why wont men use their reasoning faculties he could not for himself have claimed any and he could not urge the truth that he had bought the fan more for its barbaric brightness than for its beauty she would not let him get angry and he could say nothing against the halfironical petting with which she soothed his mortification  but all troubles passed with the night and the next morning they spent a charming hour about prospect point and in sauntering over goat island somewhat daintily tasting the flavors of the place on whose wonders they had so hungrily and indiscriminately feasted at first they had already the feeling of veteran visitors and they loftily marveled at the greed with which newercomers plunged at the sensations they could not conceive why people should want to descend the inclined railway to the foot of the american fall they smiled at the idea of going up terrapin tower they derided the vulgar daring of those who went out upon the three weird sisters for some whom they saw about to go down the biddle stairs to the cave of the winds they had no words to express their contempt  then they made their excursion to the whirlpool mistakenly going down on the american side for it is much better seen from the other though seen from any point it is the most impressive feature of the whole prodigious spectacle of niagara  here within the compass of a mile those inland seas of the north superior huron michigan erie and the multitude of smaller lakes all pour their floods where they swirl in dreadful vortices with resistless undercurrents boiling beneath the surface of that mighty eddy abruptly from this scene of secret power so different from the thunderous splendors of the cataract itself rise lofty cliffs on every side to a height of two hundred feet clothed from the waters edge almost to their create with dark cedars noiselessly so far as your senses perceive the lakes steal out of the whirlpool then drunk and wild with brawling rapids roar away to ontario through the narrow channel of the river awful as the scene is you stand so far above it that you do not know the half of its terribleness for those waters that look so smooth are great ridges and rings forced by the impulse of the currents twelve feet higher in the centre than at the margin nothing can live there and with what is caught in its hold the maelstrom plays for days and whirls and tosses round and round in its toils with a sad maniacal patience the guides tell ghastly stories which even their telling does not wholly rob of ghastliness about the bodies of drowned men carried into the whirlpool and made to enact upon its dizzy surges a travesty of life apparently floating there at their pleasure diving and frolicking amid the waves or frantically struggling to escape from the death that has long since befallen them  on the american side not far below the railway suspension bridge is an elevator more than a hundred and eighty feet high which is meant to let people down to the shore below and to give a view of the rapids on their own level from the cliff opposite it looks a terribly frail structure of pine sticks but is doubtless stronger than it looks and at any rate as it has never yet fallen to pieces it may be pronounced perfectly safe  in the waitingroom at the top basil and isabel found mr richard and his ladies again who got into the movable chamber with them and they all silently descended together it was not a time for talk of any kind either when they were slowly and not quite smoothly dropping through the lugubrious upper part of the structure where it was darkened by a rough weatherboarding or lower down where the unobstructed light showed the grim tearful face of the cliff bedrabbled with oozy springs and the audacious slightness of the elevator  an abiding distrust of the machinery overhead mingled in isabels heart with a doubt of the value of the scene below and she could not look forward to escape from her present perils by the conveyance which had brought her into them with any satisfaction she wanly smiled and shrank closer to basil while the other matron made nothing of seizing her husband violently by the arm and imploring him to stop it whenever they experienced a rougher jolt than usual  at the bottom of the cliff they were helped out of their prison by a humid young englishman with much clay on him whose face was red and bathed in perspiration for it was very hot down there in his little inclosure of baking pine boards and it was not much cooler out on the rocks upon which the party issued descending and descending by repeated and desultory flights of steps till at last they stood upon a huge fragment of stone right abreast of the rapids yet it was a magnificent sight and for a moment none of them were sorry to have come the surges did not look like the gigantic ripples on a rivers course as they were but like a procession of ocean billows they arose far aloft in vast bulks of clear green and broke heavily into foam at the crest great blocks and shapeless fragments of rock strewed the margin of the awful torrent gloomy walls of dark stone rose naked from these bearded here and there with cedar and everywhere frowning with shaggy brows of evergreen the place is inexpressibly lonely and dreadful and one feels like an alien presence there or as if he had intruded upon some mood or haunt of nature in which she had a right to be forever alone the slight impudent structure of the elevator rises through the solitude like a thing that merits ruin yet it is better than something more elaborate for it looks temporary and since there must be an elevator it is well to have it of the most transitory aspect some such quality of rude impermanence consoles you for the presence of most improvements by which you enjoy niagara the suspension bridges for their part being saved from offensiveness by their beauty and unreality  ascending none of the party spoke isabel and the other matron blanched in each others faces their husbands maintained a stolid resignation when they stepped out of their trap into the waiting room at the top what i like about these little adventures said mr richard to basil abruptly is getting safely out of them goodmorning sir he bowed slightly to isabel who returned his politeness and exchanged faint nods or glances with the ladies they got into their separate carriages and at that safe distance made each other more decided obeisances  well observed basil i suppose were introduced now we shall be meeting them from time to time throughout our journey you know how the same faces and the same trunks used to keep turning up in our travels on the other side once meet people in travelling and you cant get rid of them  yes said isabel as if continuing his train of thought im glad were going today  o dearest  truly when we first arrived i felt only the loveliness of the place it seemed more familiar too then but ever since its been growing stranger and dreadfuller somehow its begun to pervade me and possess me in a very uncomfortable way im tossed upon rapids and flung from cataract brinks and dizzied in whirlpools im no longer yours basil im most unhappily married to niagara fly with me save me from my awful lord  she lightly burlesqued the woes of a prima donna with clasped hands and uplifted eyes  thatll do very well basil commented and it implies a reality that cant be quite definitely spoken we come to niagara in the patronizing spirit in which we approach everything nowadays and for a few hours we have it our own way and pay our little tributes of admiration with as much complacency as we feel in acknowledging the existence of the supreme being but after a while we are aware of some potent influence undermining our selfsatisfaction we begin to conjecture that the great cataract does not exist by virtue of our approval and to feel that it will not cease when we go away the second day makes us its abject slaves and on the third we want to fly from it in terror i believe some people stay for weeks however and hordes of them have written odes to niagara  i cant understand it at all said isabel i dont wonder now that the town should be so empty this season but that it should ever be full i wish wed gone after our first look at the falls from the suspension bridge how beautiful that was i rejoice in everything that i havent done im so glad i havent been in the cave of the winds im so happy that table rock fell twenty years ago basil i couldnt stand another rainbow today im sorry we went out on the three weird sisters o i shall dream about it and the rush and the whirl and the dampness in ones face and the everlasting chirrrrr of everything  she dipped suddenly upon his shoulder for a moments oblivion and then rose radiant with a question why in the world if niagara is really what it seems to us now do so many bridal parties come here  perhaps theyre the only people whove the strength to bear up against it and are not easily dispersed and subjected by it  but were dispersed and subjected  ah my dear we married a little late who knows how it would be if you were nineteen instead of twentyseven and i twentyfive and not turned of thirty  basil youre very cruel  no no but dont you see how it is weve known too much of life to desire any gloomy background for our happiness were quite contented to have things gay and bright about us once we couldnt have made the circle dark enough well my dear thats the effect of age were superannuated  i used to think i was before we were married answered isabel simply but now she added triumphantly im rescued from all that i shall never be old again dearest never as long as you love me  they were about to enter the village and he could not make any open acknowledgment of her tenderness but her silken mantle or whatever slipped from her shoulder and he embracingly replaced it flattering himself that he had delicately seized this chance of an unavowed caress and not allowing o such is the blindness of our sex that the opportunity had been yet more subtly afforded him with the art which women never disuse in this world and which i hope they will not forget in the next  they had an early dinner and looked their last upon the nuptial gayety of the otherwise forlorn hotel three brides sat down with them in travellingdress two occupied the parlor as they passed out half a dozen happy pairs arrived to the music of the band in the omnibus that was to carry our friends back to the station they caught sight of several about the shop windows as that drove through the streets thus the place perpetually renews itself in the glow of love as long as the summer lasts the moon which is elsewhere so often of wormwood or of the ordinary green cheese at the best is of lucent honey there from the first of june to the last of october and this is a great charm in niagara i think with tenderness of all the lives that have opened so fairly there the hopes that have reigned in the glad young hearts the measureless tide of joy that ebbs and flows with the arriving and departing trains elsewhere there are carking cares of business and of fashion there are age and sorrow and heartbreak but here only youth faith rapture i kiss my hand to niagara for that reason and would i were a poet for a quarter of an hour  isabel departed in almost a forgiving mood towards the weak sisterhood of evident brides and both our friends felt a lurking fondness for niagara at the last moment i do not know how much of their content was due to the fact that they had suffered no sort of wrong there from those who are apt to prey upon travellers in the hotel a placard warned them to have nothing to do with the miscreant hackmen on the streets but always to order their carriage at the office on the street the hackmen whispered to them not to trust the exorbitant drivers in league with the landlords yet their actual experience was great reasonableness and facile contentment with the sum agreed upon  this may have been because the hackmen so far outnumbered the visitors that the latter could dictate terms but they chose to believe it a triumph of civilization and i will never be the cynic to sneer at their faith only at the station was the virtue of the niagarans put in doubt by the hotel porter who professed to find basils trunk enfeebled by travel and advised a strap for it which a friend of his would sell for a dollar and a half yet even he may have been a benevolent nature unjustly suspected     vii down the st lawrence  they were to take the canadian steamer at charlotte the port of rochester and they rattled uneventfully down from niagara by rail at the broad lowbanked rivermouth the steamer lay beside the railroad station and while isabel disposed of herself on board basil looked to the transfer of the baggage novelly comforted in the business by the respectfulness of the young canadian who took charge of the trunks for the boat he was slow and his system was not goodhe did not give checks for the pieces but marked them with the name of their destination and there was that indefinable something in his manner which hinted his hope that you would remember the porter but he was so civil that he did not snub the meekest and most vexatious of the passengers and basil mutely blessed his servile soul few white americans he said to himself would behave so decently in his place and he could not conceive of the american steamboat clerk who would use the politeness towards a waiting crowd that the canadian purser showed when they all wedged themselves in about his window to receive their stateroom keys he was somewhat awkward like the porter but he was patient and he did not lose his temper even when some of the crowd finding he would not bully them made bold to bully him he was three times as long in serving them as an american would have been but their time was of no value there and he served them well basil made a point of speaking him fair when his turn came and the purser did not trample on him for a base truckler as an american jackinoffice would have done  our tourists felt at home directly on this steamer which was very comfortable and in every way sufficient for its purpose with a visible captain who answered two or three questions very pleasantly and bore himself towards his passengers in some sort like a host  in the saloon isabel had found among the passengers her semiacquaintances of the hotel parlor and the rapidselevator and had glanced tentatively towards them whereupon the matron of the party had made advances that ended in their all sitting down together and wondering when the boat would start and what time they would get to montreal next evening with other matters that strangers going upon the same journey may properly marvel over in company the introduction having thus accomplished itself they exchanged addresses and it appeared that richard was colonel ellison of milwaukee and that fanny was his wife miss kitty ellison was of western new york not far from erie there was a diversion presently towards the different staterooms but the new acquaintances sat visavis at the table and after supper the ladies drew their chairs together on the promenade deck and enjoyed the fresh evening breeze the sun set magnificent upon the low western shore which they had now left an hour away and a broad stripe of color stretched behind the steamer a few thin luminous clouds darkened momently along the horizon and then mixed with the land the stars came out in a clear sky and a light wind softly buffeted the cheeks and breathed life into nerves that the days heat had wasted it scarcely wrinkled the tranquil expanse of the lake on which loomed far or near a fullsailed schooner and presently melted into the twilight and left the steamer solitary upon the waters the company was small and not remarkable enough in any way to take the thoughts of any one off his own comfort a deep sense of the coziness of the situation possessed them all which was if possible intensified by the spectacle of the captain seated on the upper deck and smoking a cigar that flashed and fainted like a stationary firefly in the gathering dusk how very distant in this mood were the most recent events niagara seemed a fable of antiquity the ride from rochester a myth of the middle ages in this pool happy world of quiet lake of starry skies of air that the soul itself seemed to breathe there was such consciousness of repose as if one were steeped in rest and soaked through and through with calm  the points of likeness between isabel and mrs ellison shortly made them mutually uninteresting and leaving her husband to the others isabel frankly sought the companionship of miss kitty in whom she found a charm of manner which puzzled at first but which she presently fancied must be perfect trust of others mingling with a peculiar selfreliance  cant you see basil what a very flattering way it is she asked of her husband when after parting with their friends for the night she tried to explain the character to him of course no art could equal such a natural gift for that kind of belief in your goodnature and sympathy makes you feel worthy of it dont you know and so you cant help being goodnatured and sympathetic this miss ellison why i can tell you i shouldnt be ashamed of her anywhere by anywhere isabel meant boston and she went on to praise the young ladys intelligence and refinement with those expressions of surprise at the existence of civilization in a westerner which westerners find it so hard to receive graciously happily miss ellison had not to hear them the reason she happened to come with only two dresses is she lives so near niagara that she could come for one day and go back the next the colonels her cousin and he and his wife go east every year and they asked her this time to see niagara with them she told me all over again what we eavesdropped so shamefully in the hotel parlorand i dont know whether she was better pleased with the prospect of whats before her or with the notion of making the journey in this original way she didnt force her confidence upon me any more than she tried to withhold it we got to talking in the most natural manner and she seemed to tell these things about herself because they amused her and she liked me i had been saying how my trunk got left behind once on the french side of mont cenis and i had to wear aunts things at turin till it could be sent for  well i dont see but miss ellison could describe you to her friends very much as youve described her to me said basil how did these mutual confidences begin whose trustfulness first flattered the others what else did you tell about yourself  i said we were on our wedding journey guiltily admitted isabel  o you did  why dearest i wanted to know for once you see whether we seemed honeymoonstruck  and do we  no came the answer somewhat ruefully perhaps basil she added weve been a little too successful in disguising our bridal character do you know she continued looking him anxiously in the face this miss ellison took me at first foryour sister  basil broke forth in outrageous laughter one more such victory he said and we are undone and he laughed again immoderately how sad is the fruition of human wishes there s nothing after all like a good thorough failure for making people happy  isabel did not listen to him safe in a dim corner of the deserted saloon she seized him in a vindictive embrace then as if it had been he who suggested the idea of such a loathsome relation hissed out the hated words your sister and released him with a disdainful repulse  a little after daybreak the steamer stopped at the canadian city of kingston a handsome place substantial to the waters edge and giving a sense of english solidity by the stone of which it is largely built there was an accession of many passengers here and they and the people on the wharf were as little like americans as possible they were english or irish or scotch with the healthful bloom of the old world still upon their faces or if canadians they looked not less hearty so that one must wonder if the line between the dominion and the united states did not also sharply separate good digestion and dyspepsia these provincials had not our regularity of features nor the best of them our careworn sensibility of expression but neither had they our complexions of adobe and even isabel was forced to allow that the men were on the whole better dressed than the same number of average americans would have been in a city of that size and remoteness the stevedores who were putting the freight aboard were men of leisure they joked in a kindly way with the orangewomen and the old women picking up chips on the pier and our land of hurry seemed beyond the ocean rather than beyond the lake  kingston has romantic memories of being fort frontenac two hundred years ago of count frontenacs splendid advent among the indians of the brave la salle who turned its wooden walls to stone of wars with the savages and then with the new york colonists whom the french and their allies harried from this point of the destruction of la salles fort in the old french war and of final surrender a few years later to the english it is as picturesque as it is historical all about the city the shores are beautifully wooded and there are many lovely islandsthe first indeed of those thousand islands with which the head of the st lawrence is filled and among which the steamer was presently threading her way they are still as charming and still almost as wild as when in 1673 frontenacs flotilla of canoes passed through their labyrinth and issued upon the lake save for a lighthouse upon one of them there is almost nothing to show that the foot of man has ever pressed the thin grass clinging to their rocky surfaces and keeping its green in the eternal shadow of their pines and cedars in the warm morning light they gathered or dispersed before the advancing vessel which some of them almost touched with the plumage of their evergreens and where none of them were large some were so small that it would not have been too bold to figure them as a vaster race of waterbirds assembling and separating in her course it is curiously affecting to find them so unclaimed yet from the solitude of the vanished wilderness and scarcely touched even by tradition but for the interest left them by the french these tiny islands have scarcely any associations and must be enjoyed for their beauty alone there is indeed about them a faint light of legend concerning the canadian rebellion of 1837 for several patriots are said to have taken refuge amidst their lovely multitude but this episode of modern history is difficult for the imagination to manage and somehow one does not take sentimentally even to that daughter of a lurking patriot who long baffled her fathers pursuers by rowing him from one island to another and supplying him with food by night  either the reluctance is from the natural desire that so recent a heroine should be founded on fact or it is mere perverseness perhaps i ought to say in justice to her that it was one of her own sex who refused to be interested in her and forbade basil to care for her when he had read of her exploit from the guidebook isabel asked him if he had noticed that handsome girl in the blue and white striped garibaldi and swiss hat who had come aboard at kingston she pointed her out and courageously made him admire her beauty which was of the most bewitching canadian type the young girl was redeemed by her new world birth from the english heaviness a more delicate bloom lighted her cheeks a softer grace dwelt in her movement yet she was round and full and she was in the perfect flower of youth she was not so ethereal in her loveliness as an american girl but she was not so nervous and had none of the painful fragility of the latter her expression was just a little vacant it must be owned but so far as she went she was faultless she looked like the most tractable of daughters and as if she would be the most obedient of wives she had a blameless taste in dress isabel declared her costume of blue and white striped garibaldi and swiss hat set upon heavy masses of dark brown hair being completed by a black silk skirt and you can see she added that its an old skirt made over and that shes dressed as cheaply as she is prettily this surprised basil who had imputed the young ladys personal sumptuousness to her dress and had thought it enormously rich when she got off with her chaperone at one of the poorestlooking country landings she left them in hopeless conjecture about her was she visiting there or was the interior of canada full of such stylish and exquisite creatures where did she get her taste her fashions her manners as she passed from sight towards the shadow of the woods they felt the poorer for her going yet they were glad to have seen her and on second thoughts they felt that they could not justly ask more of her than to have merely existed for a few hours in their presence they perceived that beauty was not only its own excuse for being but that it flattered and favored and profited the world by consenting to be  at prescott the boat on which they had come from charlotte and on which they had been promised a passage without change to montreal stopped and they were transferred to a smaller steamer with the uncomfortable name of banshee she was very old and very infirm and dirty and in every way bore out the character of a squalid irish goblin besides she was already heavily laden with passengers and with the addition of the other steamers people had now double her complement and our friends doubted if they were not to pass the rapids in as much danger as discomfort their fellowpassengers were in great variety however and thus partly atoned for their numbers among them of course there was a full force of brides from niagara and elsewhere and some curious forms of the prevailing infatuation appeared it is well enough if she likes and it may even be very noble for a passably goodlooking young lady to marry a gentleman of venerable age but to intensify the idea of selfdevotion by furtively caressing his wrinkled front seems too reproachful of the general public while on the other hand if the bride is very young and pretty it enlists in behalf of the whitehaired husband the unwilling sympathies of the spectator to see her the centre of a group of young people and him only acknowledged from time to time by a parthian snub nothing however could have been more satisfactory than the sisterly surrounding of this latter bride they were of a better class of irish people and if it had been any sacrifice for her to marry so old a man they were doing their best to give the affair at least the liveliness of a wake there were five or six of those great handsome girls with their generous curves and wholesome colors and they were every one attended by a goodlooking colonial lover with whom they joked in slightly brogued voices and laughed with careless celtic laughter one of the young fellows presently lost his hat overboard and had to wear the handkerchief of his lady about his head and this appeared to be really one of the best things in the world and led to endless banter they were well dressed and it could be imagined that the ancient bridegroom had come in for the support of the whole goodlooking healthy lighthearted family in some degree he looked it and wore but a rueful countenance for a bridegroom so that a very young newly married couple who sat next the jolly sisterandloverhood could not keep their pitying eyes off his downcast face what if he too were young at heart the kind little wifes regard seemed to say  for the sake of the slight air that was stirring and to have the best view of the rapids the banshees whole company was gathered upon the forward promenade and the throng was almost as dense as in a sixoclock horsecar out from boston the standing and sitting groups were closely packed together and the expanded parasols and umbrellas formed a nearly unbroken roof under this isabel chatted at intervals with the ellisons who sat near but it was not an atmosphere that provoked social feeling and she was secretly glad when after a while they shifted their position  it was deadly hot and most of the people saddened and silenced in the heat from time to time the clouds idling about overhead met and sprinkled down a cruel little shower of rain that seemed to make the air less breathable than before the lonely shores were yellow with drought the islands grew wilder and barrener the course of the river was for miles at a stretch through country which gave no signs of human life the st lawrence has none of the bold picturesqueness of the hudson and is far more like its faroff cousin the mississippi its banks are low like the mississippis its current swift its way through solitary lands the same sentiment of early adventure hangs about each both are haunted by visions of the jesuit in his priestly robe and the soldier in his mediaeval steel the same gay devout and dauntless race has touched them both with immortal romance if the water were of a dusky golden color instead of translucent green and the shores and islands were covered with cottonwoods and willows instead of dark cedars one could with no great effort believe ones self on the mississippi between cairo and st louis so much do the great rivers strike one as kindred in the chief features of their landscape only in tracing this resemblance you do not know just what to do with the purple mountains of vermont seen vague against the horizon from the st lawrence or with the quaint little french villages that begin to show themselves as you penetrate farther down into lower canada these look so peaceful with their dormerwindowed cottages clustering about their churchspires that it seems impossible they could once have been the homes of the savages and the cruel peasants who with firebrand and scalpingknife and tomahawk harassed the borders of new england for a hundred years but just after you descend the long sault you pass the hamlet of st regis in which was kindled the torch that wrapt deerfield in flames waking her people from their sleep to meet instant death or taste the bitterness of a captivity the bell which was sent out from france for the indian converts of the jesuits and was captured by an english ship and carried into salem and thence sold to deerfield where it called the puritans to prayer till at last it also summoned the priestled indians and habitans across hundreds of miles of winter and of wilderness to reclaim it from that desecrationthis fateful bell still hangs in the churchtower of st regis and has invited to matins and vespers for nearly two centuries the children of those who fought so pitilessly and dared and endured so much for it our friends would fair have heard it as they passed hoping for some mournful note of history in its sound but it hung silent over the silent hamlet which as it lay in the hot afternoon sun by the rivers side seemed as lifeless as the deerfield burnt long ago  they turned from it to look at a gentleman who had just appeared in a mustardcolored linen duster and basil asked shouldnt you like to know the origin personal history and secret feelings of a gentleman who goes about in a duster of that particular tint or that gentleman yonder with his eye tied up in a wet handkerchief do you suppose hes travelling for pleasure look at those young people from omaha they havent ceased flirting or cackling since we left kingston do you think everybody has such spirits out at omaha but behold a yet more surprising figure than any we have yet seen among this boatload of nondescripts  this was a tall handsome young man with a face of somewhat foreign cast and well dressed with a certain impressive difference from the rest in the cut of his clothes but what most drew the eye to him was a large cross set with brilliants and surmounted by a heavy doubleheaded eagle in gold this ornament dazzled from a conspicuous place on the left lappet of his coat on his hand shone a magnificent diamond ring and he bore a stately operaglass with which from time to time he imperiously as one may say surveyed the landscape as the imposing apparition grew upon isabel o here she thought is something truly distinguished of course dear she added aloud to basil hes some foreign nobleman travelling here and she ran over in her mind the newspaper announcements of patrician visitors from abroad and tried to identify him with some one of them the cross must be the decoration of a foreign order and basil suggested that he was perhaps a member of some legation at washington who had ran up there for his summer vacation the cross puzzled him but the doubleheaded eagle he said meant either austria or russia probably austria for the wearer looked a trifle too civilized for a russian  yes indeed what an air he has never tell me basil that theres nothing in blood cried isabel who was a bitter aristocrat at heart like all her sex though in principle she was democratic enough as she spoke the object of her regard looked about him on the different groups not with pride not with hauteur but with a glance of unconscious unmistakable superiority o that stare she added nothing but high birth and long descent can give it dearest hes becoming a great affliction to me i want to know who he is couldnt you invent some pretext for speaking to him  no i couldnt do it decently and no doubt hed snub me as i deserved if i intruded upon him lets wait for fortune to reveal him  well i suppose i must but its dreadful its really dreadful you can easily see thats distinction she continued as her hero moved about the promenade and gently but loftily made a way for himself among the other passengers and favored the scenery through his operaglass from one point and another he spoke to no one and she reasonably supposed that he did not know english  in the mean time it was drawing near the hour of dinner but no dinner appeared twelve one two came and went and then at last came the dinner which had been delayed it seemed till the cook could recruit his energies sufficiently to meet the wants of double the number he had expected to provide for it was observable of the officers and crew of the banshee that while they did not hold themselves aloof from the passengers in the disdainful american manner they were of feeble mind and not only did everything very slowly in the usual canadian fashion but with an inefficiency that among us would have justified them in being insolent the people sat down at several successive tables to the worst dinner that ever was cooked the ladies first and the gentlemen afterwards as they made conquest of places at the second table to basils great satisfaction he found a seat and on his right hand the distinguished foreigner  naturally i was somewhat abashed he said in the account he was presently called to give isabel of the interview but i remembered that i was an american citizen and tried to maintain a decent composure for several minutes we sat silent behind a dish of flabby cucumbers expecting the dinner and i was wondering whether i should address him in french or germanfor i knew youd never forgive me if i let slip such a chancewhen he turned and spoke himself  o what did he say dearest  he said pretty tejious waitin aint it in she best new york state accent  you dont mean it gasped isabel  but i do after that i took courage to ask what his cross and doubleheaded eagle meant he showed the condescension of a true nobleman o says he i m glad you like it and it s not the least offense to ask and he told me can you imagine what it is it s the emblem of the fiftyfourth degree in the secret society he belongs to  i dont believe it  well ask him yourself then returned basil he s a very good fellow o that stare nothing but high birth and long descent could give it he repeated abominably implying that he had himself had no share in their common error  what retort isabel might have made cannot now be known for she was arrested at this moment by a rumor amongst the passengers that they were coming to the long sault rapids looking forward she saw the tossing and flashing of surges that to the eye are certainly as threatening as the rapids above niagara the steamer had already passed the deplau and the galopes and they had thus had a foretaste of whatever pleasure or terror there is in the descent of these nine miles of stormy sea it is purely a matter of taste about shooting the rapids of the st lawrence the passengers like it better than the captain and the pilot to guesses by their looks and the women and children like it better than the men it is no doubt very thrilling and picturesque and wildly beautiful the children crow and laugh the women shout forth their delight as the boat enters the seething current great foaming waves strike her bows and brawl away to the stern while she dips and rolls and shoots onward light as a bird blown by the wind the wild shores and islands whirl out of sight you feel in every fibre the career of the vessel but the captain sits in front of the pilothouse smoking with a grave face the pilots tug hard at the wheel the hoarse roar of the waters fills the air beneath the smoother sweeps of the current you can see the brown rocks as you sink from ledge to ledge in the writhing and twisting steamer you have a vague sense that all this is perhaps an achievement rather than an enjoyment when descending the long sault you look back up hill and behold those billows leaping down the steep slope after you no doubt you confide to your soul it is magnificent but it is not pleasure you greet with silent satisfaction the level river stretching between the long sault and the coteau and you admire the delightful tranquillity of that beautiful lake st francis into which it expands then the boat shudders into the coteau rapids and down through the cedars and cascades on the rocks of the last lies the skeleton of a steamer wrecked upon them and gnawed at still by the whitetusked wolfish rapids no one they say was lost from her but how basil thought would it fare with all these people packed here upon her bow if the banshee should swing round upon a ledge as to isabel she looked upon the wrecked steamer with indifference as did all the women but then they could not swim and would not have to save themselves the la chines to come yet they exulted and that s the awfullest of all  they passed the lake st louis the la chin rapids flashed into sight the captain rose up from his seat took his pipe from his mouth and waved a silence with it ladies and gentlemen said he its very important in passing these rapids to keep the boat perfectly trim please to remain just as you are  it was twilight for the boat was late from the indian village on the shore they signaled to know if he wanted the local pilot the captain refused and then the steamer plunged into the leaping waves from rock to rock she swerved and sank on the last ledge she scraped with a deadly touch that went to the heart  then the danger was passed and the noble city of montreal was in full sight lying at the foot of her dark green mountain and lifting her many spires into the rosy twilight air massive and grand showed the sister towers of the french cathedral  basil had hoped to approach this famous city with just associations he had meant to conjure up for isabels sake some reflex however faint of that beautiful picture mr parkman has painted of maisonneuve founding and consecrating montreal he flushed with the recollection of the historians phrase but in that moment there came forth from the cabin a pretty young person who gave every token of being a pretty young actress even to the duennalike elderly female companion to be detected in the remote background of every young actress she had flirted audaciously during the day with some young englishmen and canadians of her acquaintance and after passing the la chine rapids she had taken the hearts of all the men by springing suddenly to her feet apostrophizing the tumult with a charming attitude and warbling a delicious bit of song now as they drew near the city the victoria bridge stretched its long tube athwart the river and looked so low because of its great length that it seemed to bar the steamers passage  i wonder said one of the actresss adorers a canadian whose face was exactly that of the beaver on the escutcheon of his native province and whose heavy gallantries she had constantly received with a gay impertinent nonchalancei wonder if we can be going right under that bridge  no sir answered the pretty young actress with shocking promptness were going right over it           three groans and a guggle           and an awful struggle           and over we go  at this witless sweet impudence the canadian looked very sheepishfor a beaver and all the other people laughed but the noble historical shades of basils thought vanished in wounded dignity beyond recall and left him feeling rather ashamedfor he had laughed too     viii the sentiment of montreal  the feeling of foreign travel for which our tourists had striven throughout their journey and which they had known in some degree at kingston and all the way down the river was intensified from the first moment in montreal and it was so welcome that they were almost glad to lose money on their greenbacks which the conductor of the omnibus would take only at a discount of twenty cents at breakfast next morning they could hardly tell on what country they had fallen the waiters had but a thin varnish of english speech upon their native french and they spoke their own tongue with each other but most of the meats were cooked to the english taste and the whole was a poor imitation of an american hotel during their stay the same commingling of usages and races bewildered them the shops were english and the clerks were commonly french the carriagedrivers were often irish and up and down the streets with their pious oldfashioned names tinkled american horsecars everywhere were churches and convents that recalled the ecclesiastical and feudal origin of the city the great tubular bridge the superb waterfront with its long array of docks only surpassed by those of liverpool the solid blocks of business houses and the substantial mansions on the quieter streets proclaimed the succession of protestant thrift and energy  our friends cared far less for the modern splendor of montreal than for the remnants of its past and for the features that identified it with another faith and another people than their own isabel would almost have confessed to any one of the blackrobed priests upon the street basil could easily have gone down upon his knees to the whitehooded palefaced nuns gliding among the crowd it was rapture to take a carriage and drive not to the cemetery not to the public library not to the rooms of the young mens christian association or the grain elevators or the new park just tricked out with rockwork and sprigs of evergreennot to any of the charming resorts of our own cities but as in europe to the churches the churches of a pitiless superstition the churches with their atrocious pictures and statues their lingering smell of the mornings incense their confessionals their feetaking sacristans their worshippers dropped here and there upon their knees about the aisles and saying their prayers with shut or wandering eyes according as they were old women or young i do not defend the feeble sentimentalitycall it wickedness if you likebut i understand it and i forgive it from my soul  they went first of course to the french cathedral pausing on their way to alight and walk through the bonsecours market where the habitans have all come in their carts with their various stores of poultry fruit and vegetables and where every cart is a study here is a simplefaced young peasantcouple with butter and eggs and chickens ravishingly displayed here is a smoothchecked blackeyed blackhaired young girl looking as if an infusion of indian blood had darkened the red of her cheeks presiding over a stock of onions potatoes beets and turnips there an old woman with a face carven like a walnut behind a flattering array of cherries and pears yonder a whole family trafficking in loaves of brownbread and maplesugar in many shapes of pious and grotesque device there are gay shows of bright scarfs and kerchiefs and varicolored yarns and sad shows of old clothes and secondhand merchandise of other sorts but above all prevails the abundance of orchard and garden while within the fine edifice are the stalls of the butchers and in the basement below a world of household utensils glassware hardware and woodenware as in other latin countries each peasant has given a personal interest to his wares but the bargains are not clamored over as in latin lands abroad whatever protest and concession and invocation of the saints attend the transacting of business at bonsecours market are in a subdued tone the fat hucksterwomen drowsing beside their wares scarce send their voices beyond the borders of their broadbrimmed straw hats as they softly haggle with purchasers or tranquilly gossip together  at the cathedral there are perhaps the worst paintings in the world and the massive pineboard pillars are unscrupulously smoked to look like marble but our tourists enjoyed it as if it had been st peters in fact it has something of the barnlike immensity and impressiveness of st peters they did not ask it to be beautiful or grand they desired it only to recall the beloved ugliness the fondly cherished hideousness and incongruity of the average catholic churches of their remembrance and it did this and more it added an effect of its own it offered the spectacle of a swarthy old indian kneeling before the high altar telling his beads and saying with many sighs and tears the prayers which it cost so much martyrdom and heroism to teach his race o it is only a savage man said the little french boy who was showing them the place impatient of their interest in a thing so unworthy as this groaning barbarian he ran swiftly about from object to object rapidly lecturing their inattention it is now time to go up into the tower said he and they gladly made that toilsome ascent though it is doubtful if the ascent of towers is not too much like the ascent of mountains ever to be compensatory from the top of notre dame is certainly to be had a prospect upon which but for his fluttered nerves and trembling muscles and troubled respiration the traveller might well look with delight and as it is must behold with wonder so far as the eye reaches it dwells only upon what is magnificent all the features of that landscape are grand below you spreads the city which has less that is merely mean in it than any other city of our continent and which is everywhere ennobled by stately civic edifices adorned by tasteful churches and skirted by full foliaged avenues of mansions and villas behind it rises the beautiful mountain green with woods and gardens to its crest and flanked on the east by an endless fertile plain and on the west by another expanse through which the ottawa rushes turbid and dark to its confluence with the st lawrence then these two mighty streams commingled flow past the city lighting up the vast champaign country to the south while upon the utmost southern verge as on the northern rise the cloudy summits of faroff mountains  as our travellers gazed upon all this grandeur their hearts were humbled to the tacit admission that the colonial metropolis was not only worthy of its seat but had traits of a solid prosperity not excelled by any of the abounding and boastful cities of the republic long before they quitted montreal they had rallied from this weakness but they delighted still to honor her superb beauty  the tower is naturally bescribbled to its top with the names of those who have climbed it and most of these are americans who flock in great numbers to canada in summer they modify its hotel life and the objects of interest thrive upon their bounty our friends met them at every turn and knew them at a glance from the native populations who are also easily distinguishable from each other the french canadians are nearly always of a peasantlike commonness or where they rise above this have a bourgeois commonness of face and manner and the english canadians are to be known from the many english sojourners by the effort to look much more english than the latter the social heart of the colony clings fast to the mothercountry that is plain whatever the political tendency may be and the public monuments and inscriptions celebrate this affectionate union  at the english cathedral the effect is deepened by the epitaphs of those whose lives were passed in the joint service of england and her loyal child and our travellers whatever their want of sympathy with the sentiment had to own to a certain beauty in that attitude of proud reverence here at least was a people not cut off from its past but holding unbroken in life and death the ties which exist for us only in history it gave a glamour of olden time to the new land it touched the prosaic democratic present with the waning poetic light of the aristocratic and monarchical tradition there was here and there a title on the tablets and there was everywhere the formal language of loyalty and of veneration for things we have tumbled into the dust it is a beautiful church of admirable english gothic if you are so happy you are rather curtly told you may enter by a burly english figure in some kind of sombre ecclesiastical drapery and within its quiet precincts you may feel yourself in england if you likewhich for my part i do not neither did our friends enjoy it so much as the church of the jesuits with its more than tolerable painting its coldly frescoed ceiling its architectural taste of subdued renaissance and its blackeyed peasantgirl telling her beads before a side altar just as in the enviably deplorable countries we all love nor so much even as the irish cathedral which they next visited that is a very gorgeous cathedral indeed painted and gilded a merveille and everywhere stuck about with big and little saints and crucifixes and pictures incredibly badbut for those in the french cathedral there is of course a series representing christs progress to calvary and there was a very tattered old manan old man whose voice had been long ago drowned in whiskey and who now spoke in a ghostly whisperwho when he saw basils eye fall upon the series made him go the round of them and tediously explained them  why did you let that old wretch bore you and then pay him for it isabel asked  o it reminded me so sweetly of the swindles of other lands and days that i couldnt help it he answered and straightway in the eyes of both that poor whiskeyfied irish tatterdemalion stood transfigured to the glorious likeness of an italian beggar  they were always doing something of this kind those absurdly sentimental people whom yet i cannot find it in my heart to blame for their folly though i could name ever so many reasons for rebuking it why in fact should we wish to find america like europe are the ruins and impostures and miseries and superstitions which beset the traveller abroad so precious that he should desire to imagine them at every step in his own hemisphere or have we then of our own no effective shapes of ignorance and want and incredibility that we must forever seek an alien contrast to our native intelligence and comfort some such questions this guilty couple put to each other and then drove off to visit the convent of the gray nuns with a joyful expectation which i suppose the prospect of the finest publicschool exhibition in boston could never have inspired but indeed since there must be gray nuns is it not well that there are sentimentalists to take a mournful pleasure in their sad pallid existence  the convent is at a good distance from the irish cathedral and in going to it the tourists made their driver carry them through one of the few old french streets which still remain in montreal fires and improvements had made havoc among the quaint horses since basils first visit but at last they came upon a narrow ancient rue saint antoineor whatever other saint it was called afterin which there was no english face or house to be seen the doors of the little onestory dwellings opened from the pavement and within you saw fat madame the mother moving about her domestic affairs and spare monsieur the elderly husband smoking beside the open window french babies crawled about the tidy floors french martyrs let us believe lalement or brebeuf who gave up their heroic lives for the conversion of canada sifted their eyes in highcolored lithographs on the wall among the flowerpots in the dormerwindow looking from every tin roof sat and sewed a smooth haired young girl i hopethe romance of each little mansion the antique and foreign character of the place was accented by the inscription upon a wall of sirop adoucissant de madame winslow  ever since 1692 the gray nuns have made refuge within the ample borders of their convent for infirm old people and for foundling children and it is now in the regular course of sightseeing for the traveller to visit their hospital at noonday when he beholds the sisters at their devotions in the chapel it is a bare whitewalled coldlooking chapel with the usual paraphernalia of pictures and crucifixes seated upon low benches on either side of the aisle were the curious or the devout the former in greater number and chiefly americans who were now and then whispered silent by an old pauper zealous for the sanctity of the place at the stroke of twelve the sisters entered two by two followed by the ladysuperior with a prayerbook in her hand she clapped the leaves of this together in signal for them to kneel to rise to kneel again and rise while they repeated in rather harsh voices their prayers and then clattered out of the chapel as they had clattered in with resounding shoes the two young girls at the head were very pretty and all the pale faces had a corpselike peace as basil looked at their pensive sameness it seemed to him that those prettiest girls might very well be the twain that he had seen here so many years ago stricken forever young in their joyless beauty the ungraceful gowns of coarse gray the blue checked aprons the black crape caps were the same they came and went with the same quick tread touching their brows with holy water and kneeling and rising now as then with the same constrained and ordered movements would it be too cruel if they were really the same persons or would it be yet more cruel if every year two girls so young and fair were selfdoomed to renew the likeness of that youthful death  the visitors went about the hospital and saw the old men and the little children to whom these good pure lives were given and they could only blame the system not the instruments or their work perhaps they did not judge wisely of the amount of selfsacrifice involved for they judged from hearts to which love was the whole of earth and heaven but nevertheless they pitied the gray nuns amidst the unhomelike comfort of their convent the unnatural care of those alien little ones poor soeurs grises in their narrow cells at the bedside of sickness and age and sorrow kneeling with clasped hands and yearning eyes before the bloody spectacle of the crossthe power of your church is shown far more subtly and mightily in such as you than in her grandest fanes or the sight of her most august ceremonies with praying priests swinging censers tapers and pictures and images under a gloomy heaven of cathedral arches there indeed the faithful have given their substance but here the nun has given up the most precious part of her womans nature and all the tenderness that clings about the thought of wife and mother  there are some things that always greatly afflict me in the idea of a new country said basil as they loitered slowly through the grounds of the convent toward the gate of course its absurd to think of men as other than men as having changed their natures with their skies but a new land always does seem at first thoughts like a new chance afforded the race for goodness and happiness for health and life so i grieve for the earliest dead at plymouth more than for the multitude that the plague swept away in london i shudder over the crime of the first guilty man the sin of the first wicked woman in a new country the trouble of the first youth or maiden crossed in love there is intolerable all should be hope and freedom and prosperous life upon that virgin soil it never was so since eden but none the less i feel it ought to be and i am oppressed by the thought that among the earliest walls which rose upon this broad meadow of montreal were those built to immure the innocence of such young girls as these and shut them from the life we find so fair wouldnt you like to know who was the first that took the veil in this wild new country who was she poor soul and what was her deep sorrow or lofty rapture you can fancy her some indian maiden lured to the renunciation by the splendor of symbols and promises seen vaguely through the lingering mists of her native superstitions or some weary soul sick from the vanities and vices the bloodshed and the tears of the old world and eager for a silence profounder than that of the wilderness into which she had fled well the church knows and god she was dust long ago  from time to time there had fallen little fitful showers during the morning now as the weddingjourneyers passed out of the convent gate the rain dropped soft and thin and the gray clouds that floated through the sky so swiftly were as farseen gray sisters in flight for heaven  we shall have time for the drive round the mountain before dinner said basil as they got into their carriage again and he was giving the order to the driver when isabel asked how far it was  nine miles  o then we cant think of going with one horse you know she added that we always intended to have two horses for going round the mountain  no said basil not yet used to having his decisions reached without his knowledge and i dont see why we should everybody goes with one you dont suppose were too heavy do you  i had a party from the states maam yesterday interposed the driver two ladies real heavy apes two gentlemen weighin two hundred apiece and a stout young man on the box with me youd a thought the horse was drawin an empty carriage the way she darted along  then his horse must be perfectly worn out today said isabel refusing to admit the pool fellow directly even to the honors of a defeat he had proved too much and was put out of court with no hope of repairing his error  why it seems a pity whispered basil dispassionately to turn this man adrift when he had a reasonable hope of being with us all day and has been so civil and obliging  o yes basil sentimentalize him do why dont you sentimentalize his helpless overworked horseall in a reek of perspiration  perspiration why my dear it s the rain  well rain or shine darling i dont want to go round the mountain with one horse and it s very unkind of you to insist now when youve tacitly promised me all along to take two  now this is a little too much isabel you know we never mentioned the matter till this moment  it s the same as a promise your not saying you wouldnt but i dont ask you to keep your word i dont want to go round the mountain id much rather go to the hotel im tired  very well then isabel ill leave you at the hotel  in a moment it had come the first serious dispute of their wedded life it had come as all such calamities come from nothing and it was on them in full disaster ere they knew such a very little while ago there in the convent garden their lives had been drawn closer in sympathy than ever before and now that blessed time seemed ages since and they were further asunder than those who have never been friends i thought bitterly mused isabel that he would have done anything for me who could have dreamed that a woman of her sense would be so unreasonable he wondered both had tempers as i know my dearest reader has if a lady and neither would yield and so presently they could hardly tell how for they were aghast at it all isabel was alone in her room amidst the ruins of her life and basil alone in the onehorse carriage trying to drive away from the wreck of his happiness all was over the dream was past the charm was broken the sweetness of their love was turned to gall whatever had pleased them in their loving moods was loathsome now and the things they had praised a moment before were hateful in that baleful light which seemed to dwell upon all they ever said or did in mutual enjoyment how poor and stupid and empty looked their weddingjourney basil spent five minutes in arraigning his wife and convicting her of every folly and fault his soul was in a whirl       for to be wroth with one we love      doth work like madness in the brain  in the midst of his bitter and furious upbraidings he found himself suddenly become her ardent advocate and ready to denounce her judge as a heartless monster on our wedding journey too good heavens what an incredible brute i am then he said what an ass i am and the pathos of the case having yielded to its absurdity he was helpless in five minutes more he was at isabels side the onehorse carriage driver dismissed with a handsome pourboire and a pair of lusty bays with a glittering barouche waiting at the door below he swiftly accounted for his presence which she seemed to find the most natural thing that could be and she met his surrender with the openness of a heart that forgives but does not forget if indeed the most gracious art is the only one unknown to the sex  she rose with a smile from the ruins of her life amidst which she had heartbrokenly sat down with all her things on i knew youd come back she said  so did i he answered i am much too good and noble to sacrifice my preference to my duty  i didnt care particularly for the two horses basil she said as they descended to the barouche it was your refusing them that hurt me  and i didnt want the onehorse carriage it was your insisting so that provoked me  do you think people ever quarreled before on a wedding journey asked isabel as they drove gayly out of the city  never i cant conceive of it i suppose if this were written down nobody would believe it  no nobody could said isabel musingly and she added after a pause i wish you would tell me just what you thought of me dearest did you feel as you did when our little affair was broken off long ago did you hate me  i did most cordially but not half so much as i despised myself the next moment as to its being like a lovers quarrel it wasnt it was more bitter so much more love than lovers ever give had to be taken back besides it had no dignity and a lovers quarrel always has a lovers quarrel always springs from a more serious cause and has an air of romantic tragedy this had no grace of the kind it was a poor shabby little squabble  o dont call it so basil i should like you to respect even a quarrel of ours more than that it was tragical enough with me for i didnt see how it could ever be made up i knew i couldnt make the advances i dont think it is quite feminine to be the first to forgive is it  im sure i cant say perhaps it would be rather unladylike  well you see dearest what i am trying to get at is this whether we shall love each other the more or the less for it i think we shall get on all the better for a while on account of it but i should have said it was totally out of character its something you might have expected of a very young bridal couple but after what weve been through it seems too improbable  very well said basil who having made all the concessions could not enjoy the quarrel as she did simply because it was theirs let s behave as if it had never been  o no we cant to me its as if we had just won each other  in fact it gave a wonderful zest and freshness to that ride round the mountain and shed a beneficent glow upon the rest of their journey the sun came out through the thin clouds and lighted up the vast plain that swept away north and east with the purple heights against the eastern sky the royal mountain lifted its graceful mass beside them and hid the city wholly from sight peasantvillages in the shade of beautiful elms dotted the plain in every direction and at intervals crept up to the side of the road along which they drove but these had been corrupted by a more ambitious architecture since basil saw them last and were no longer purely french in appearance then nearly every house was a tannery in a modest way and poetically published the fact by the display of a sheeps tail over the front door like a bush at a wineshop now if the tanneries still existed the poetry of the cheeps tails had vanished from the portals but our friends were consoled by meeting numbers of the peasants jolting home from market in the painted carts which are doubtless of the pattern of the carts first built there two hundred years ago they were grateful for the immortal old wooden crooked and brown with the labor of the fields who abounded in these vehicles when a huge girl jumped from the tail of her cart and showed the thick clumsy ankles of a true peasantmaid they could only sigh out their unspeakable satisfaction  gardens embowered and perfumed the low cottages through the open doors of which they could see the exquisite neatness of the life within one of the doors opened into a schoolhouse where they beheld with rapture the schoolmistress book in hand and with a quaint cap on her gray head and encircled by her flock of little boys and girls  by and by it began to rain again and now while their driver stopped to put up the top of the barouche they entered a country church which had taken their fancy and walked up the aisle with the steps that blend with silence rather than break it while they heard only the soft whisper of the shower without there was no one there but themselves the urn of holy water seemed not to have been troubled that day and no penitent knelt at the shrine before which twinkled so faintly one lighted lamp the white roof swelled into dim arches over their heads the pale day like a visible hush stole through the painted windows they heard themselves breathe as they crept from picture to picture  a narrow door opened at the side of the high altar and a slender young priest appeared in a long black robe and with shaven head he too as he moved with noiseless feet seemed a part of the silence and when he approached with dreamy black eyes fixed upon them and bowed courteously it seemed impossible he should speak but he spoke the pale young priest the darkrobed tradition the tonsured vision of an age and a church that are passing  do you understand french monsieur  a very little monsieur  a very little is more than my english he said yet he politely went the round of the pictures with them and gave them the names of the painters between his crossings at the different altars at the high altar there was a very fair crucifixion before this the priest bent one knee fine picture fine altar fine church he said in english at last they stopped next the poorbox as their coins clinked against those within he smiled serenely upon the good heretics then he bowed and as if he had relapsed into the past he vanished through the narrow door by which he had entered  basil and isabel stood speechless a moment on the church steps then she cried  o why didnt something happen  ah my dear what could have keen half so good as the nothing that did happen suppose we knew him to have taken orders because of a disappointment in love how common it would have made him everybody has been crossed in love once or twice he bade the driver take them back to the hotel this is the very bouquet of adventure why should we care for the grosser body i dare say if we knew all about yonder pale young priest we should not think him half so interesting as we do now  at dinner they spent the intervals of the courses in guessing the nationality of the different persons and in wondering if the canadians did not make it a matter of conscientious loyalty to outenglish the english even in the matter of paleale and sherry and in rotundity of person and freshness of face just as they emulated them in the cut of their clothes and whiskers must they found even their health upon the health of the mothercountry  our friends began to detect something servile in it all and but that they were such amiable persons the loyally perfect digestion of montreal would have gone far to impair their own  the loyalty which had already appeared to them in the cathedral suggested itself in many ways upon the street when they went out after dinner to do that little shopping which isabel had planned to do in montreal the booksellers windows were full of canadian editions of our authors and english copies of english works instead of our pirated editions the drygoods stores were gay with fabrics in the london taste and garments of the london shape here was the sign of a photographer to the queen there of a hatter to h r h the prince of wales a barber was under the patronage of h r h the prince of wales h e the duke of cambridge and the gentry of montreal ich dien was the motto of a restaurateur a hosier had gallantly labeled his stock in trade with honi soit qui mal y pense again they noted the english solidity of the civic edifices and already they had observed in the foreign population a difference from that at home they saw no german faces on the streets and the irish faces had not that truculence which they wear sometimes with us they had not lost their native simpleness and kindliness the irishmen who drove the public carriages were as civil as our own boston hackmen and behaved as respectfully under the shadow of england here as they world have done under it in ireland the problem which vexes us seems to have been solved pleasantly enough in canada is it because the celt cannot brook equality and where he has not an established and recognized caste above him longs to trample on those about him and if he cannot be lowest will at least be highest  however our friends did not suffer this or any other advantage of the colonial relation to divert them from the opinion to which their observation was gradually bringing themthat its overweening loyalty placed a great country like canada in s very silly attitude the attitude of an overgrown unmanly boy clinging to the maternal skirts and though spoilt and willful without any character of his own the constant reference of local hopes to that remote centre beyond seas the test of success by the criterions of a necessarily different civilization the social and intellectual dependence implied by traits that meet the most hurried glance in the dominion give an effect of meanness to the whole fabric doubtless it is a life of comfort of peace of irresponsibility they live there but it lacks the grandeur which no sum of material prosperity can give it is ignoble like all voluntarily subordinate things somehow one feels that it has no basis in the new world and that till it is shaken loose from england it cannot have  it would be a pity however if it should be parted from the parent country merely to be joined to an unsympathetic halfbrother like ourselves and nothing fortunately seems to be further from the canadian mind there are some experiments no longer possible to us which could still be tried there to the advantage of civilization and we were better two great nations side by side than a union of discordant traditions and ideas but none the less does the american traveller swelling with forgetfulness of the shabby despots who govern new york and the swindling railroad kings whose word is law to the whole land feel like saying to the hulling young giant beyond st lawrence and the lakes sever the apronstrings of allegiance and try to be yourself whatever you are  something of this sort basil said though of course not in apostrophic phrase nor with isabels entire concurrence when he explained to her that it was to the colonial dependence of canada she owed the ability to buy things so cheaply there  the fact is that the ladies parlor at the hotel had been after dinner no better than a den of smugglers in which the fair contrabandists had debated the best means of evading the laws of their country at heart every man is a smuggler and how much more every woman she would have no scruple in ruining the silk and woolen interest throughout the united states she is a freetrader by intuitive perception of right and is limited in practice by nothing but fear of the statute what could be taken into the states without detection was the subject before that wicked conclave and next what it would pay to buy in canada it seemed that silk umbrellas were most eligible wares and in the display of such purchases the parlor was given the appearance of a violent thunderstorm gloves it was not advisable to get they were better at home as were many kinds of fine woolen goods but laces which you could carry about you were excellent and so was any kind of silk could it be carried if simply cut and not made up there was a difference about this the friend of one lady had taken home half a trunkful of cut silks the friend of another had run up the breadths of one lone little silk skirt and then lost it by the rapacity of the customs officers it was pretty much luck and whether the officers happened to be in goodhumor or not you must not try to take in anything out of season however one had heard of a boston lady going home in july who had the furs taken off her back in that inclement month best get everything seasonable and put it on at once and then you know if they ask you you can say its been worn to this black wisdom came the combined knowledge of those miscreants basil could not repress a shudder at the innate depravity of the female heart here were virgins nurtured in the most spotless purity of life here were virtuous mothers of families here were venerable matrons patterns in society and the churchsmugglers to a woman and eager for any guilty subterfuge he glanced at isabel to see what effect the evil conversation had upon her her eyes sparkled her cheeks glowed all the woman was on fire for smuggling he sighed heavily and went out with her to do the little shopping  shall i follow them upon their excursion shopping in montreal is very much what it is in boston or new york i imagine except that the clerks have a more honeyed sweetness of manners towards the ladies of our nation and are surprisingly generous constructionists of our revenue laws isabel had profited by every word that she had heard in the ladies parlor and she would not venture upon unsafe ground but her tender eyes looked her unutterable longing to believe in the charming possibilities that the clerks suggested she bemoaned herself before the corded silks which there was no time to have made up the piecevelvets and the linens smote her to the heart but they also stimulated her invention and she bought and bought of the madeup wares in real or fancied needs till basil represented that neither their purses nor their trunks could stand any more o dont be troubled about the trunks dearest she cried with that gayety which nothing but shopping can kindle in a womans heart while he faltered on from counter to counter wondering at which he should finally swoon from fatigue at last after she had declared repeatedly there now i am done she briskly led the way back to the hotel to pack up her purchases  basil parted with her at the door he was a man of high principle himself and that scene in the smugglers den and his wifes preparation for transgression were revelations for which nothing could have consoled him but a paragon umbrella for five dollars and an excellent business suit of scotch goods for twenty  when some hours later he sat with isabel on the forward promenade of the steamboat for quebec and summed up the profits of their shopping they were both in the kindliest mood towards the poor canadians who had built the admirable city before them  for miles the water front of montreal is superbly faced with quays and locks of solid stone masonry and thus she is clean and beautiful to the very feet stately piles of architecture instead of the foul old tumbledown warehouses that dishonor the waterside in most cities rise from the broad wharves behind these spring the twin towers of notre dame and the steeples of the other churches above the city roofs  its noble yes its noble after the best that europe can show said isabel with enthusiasm and what a pleasant day weve had here doesnt even our quarrel show couleur de rose in this light  one side of it answered basil dreamily but all the rest is black  what do you mean my dear  why the nelson monument with the sunset on it at the head of the street there  the affect was so fine that isabel could not be angry with him for failing to heed what she had said and she mused a moment with him  it seems rather farfetched she said presently to erect a monument to nelson in montreal doesnt it but then its a very absurd monument when youre near it she added thoughtfully  basil did not answer at once for gazing on this nelson column in jacques cartier square his thoughts wandered away not to the hero of the nile but to the doughty old breton navigator the first white man who ever set foot upon that shore and who more than three hundred years ago explored the st lawrence as far as montreal and in the splendid autumn weather climbed to the top of her green height and named it the scene that jacques cartier then beheld like a mirage of the fast projected upon the present floated before him and he saw at the mountains foot the indian city of hochelaga with its vast and populous lodges of bark its encircling palisades and its wide outlying fields of yellow maize he heard with jacques cartiers sense the blare of his followers trumpets down in the open square of the barbarous city where the soldiers of many an oldworld fight with mustached lip and bearded chin with arquebuse and glittering halberd helmet and cuirass moved among the plumed and painted savages then he lifted jacques cartiers eyes and looked out upon the magnificent landscape east wept and north the mantling forest was over all and the broad blue ribbon of the great river glistened amid a realm of verdure beyond to the bounds of mexico stretched a leafy desert and the vast hive of industry the mighty battleground of late centuries lay sunk in savage torpor wrapped in illimitable woods  a vaguer picture of champlain who seeking a westward route to china and the east some three quarters of a century later had fixed the first tradingpost at montreal and camped upon the spot where the convent of the gray nuns now stands appeared before him and vanished with all its fleets of furtraders boats and hunters birch canoes and the watchfires of both and then in the sweet light of the spring morning he saw maisonneuve leaping ashore upon the green meadows that spread all gay with early flowers where hochelaga once stood and with the blackrobed jesuits the highborn delicately nurtured and devoted nuns and the steelclad soldiers of his train kneeling about the altar raised there in the wilderness and silent amidst the silence of nature at the lifted host  he painted a semblance of all this for isabel using the colors of the historian who has made these scenes the beautiful inheritance of all dream era and sketched the battles the miracles the sufferings and the penances through which the pious colony was preserved and prospered till they both grew impatient of modern montreal and would fain have had the ancient villemarie back in its place  think of maisonneuve dearest climbing in midwinter to the top of the mountain there under a heavy cross set with the bones of saints and planting it on the summit in fulfillment of a vow to do so if villemarie were saved from the freshet and then of madame de la peltrie romantically receiving the sacrament there while all villemarie fell down adoring ah that was a picturesque people when did ever a boston governor climb to the top of beacon hill in fulfillment of a vow to be sure we may yet see a new york governor doing something of the kindif he can find a hill but this ridiculous column to nelson who never had anything to do with montreal he continued it really seems to me the perfect expression of snobbish colonial dependence and sentimentality seeking always to identify itself with the mothercountry and ignoring the local past and its heroic figures a column to nelson in jacques cartier square on the ground that was trodden by champlain and won for its present masters by the death of wolfe  the boat departed on her trip to quebec during supper they were served by french waiters who without apparent english of their own miraculously understood that of the passengers except in the case of the furious gentleman who wanted english breakfast tea to so much english as that their inspiration did not reach and they forced him to compromise on coffee it was a french boat owned by a french company and seemed to be officered by frenchmen throughout certainly as our tourists in the joy of their good appetites affirmed the cook was of that culinarily delightful nation  the boat was almost as large as those of the hudson but it was not so lavishly splendid though it had everything that could minister to the comfort and selfrespect of the passengers these were of all nations but chiefly americans with some french canadians the former gathered on the forward promenade enjoying what little of the landscape the growing night left visible and the latter made society after their manner in the saloon they were plainlooking men and women mostly and provincial it was evident to their inmost hearts provincial in origin provincial by inheritance by all their circumstances social and political their relation with france was not a proud one but it was not like submersion by the slipslop of english colonial loyalty yet they seem to be troubled by no memories of their hundred years dominion of the land that they rescued from the wilderness and that was wrested from them by war it is a strange fate for any people thus to have been cut off from the parentcountry and abandoned to whatever destiny their conquerors chose to reserve for them and if each of the race wore the sadness and strangeness of that fate in his countenance it would not be wonderful perhaps it is wonderful that none of them shows anything of the kind in their desertion they have multiplied and prospered they may have a national grief but they hide it well and probably they have none  later one of them appeared to isabel in the person of the pale slender young ecclesiastic who had shown her and basil the pictures in the country church she was confessing to the priest and she was not at all surprised to find that he was basil in a suit of medieval armor he had an immense cross on his shoulder  to get this cross to the top of the mountain thought isabel we must have two horses basil she added aloud we must have two horses  ten if you like my dear answered his voice cheerfully though i think wed better ride up in the omnibus  she opened her eyes and saw him smiling  were in sight of quebec he said come out as soon as you cancome out into the seventeenth century     ix quebec  isabel hurried out upon the forward promenade where all the other passengers seemed to be assembled and beheld a vast bulk of gray and purple rock swelling two hundred feet up from the mists of the river and taking the early morning light warm upon its face and crown blackhulked redillumined liverpool steamers gay rivercraft and ships of every sail and flag filled the stream athwart which the ferries sped their swift trafficladen shuttles a lower town hung to the foot of the rock and crept populous and picturesque up its sides from the massive citadel on its crest flew the red banner of saint george and along its brow swept the gray wall of the famous heroic beautiful city overtopped by many a gleaming spire and antique roof  slowly out of our workday businesssuited modern world the vessel steamed up to this city of an olden time and another idealto her who was a lady from the first devout and proud and strong and who still after two hundred and fifty years keeps perfect the image and memory of the feudal past from which she sprung upon her height she sits unique and when you say quebec having once beheld her you invoke a sense of medieval strangeness and of beauty which the name of no other city could intensify  as they drew near the steamboat wharf they saw swarming over a broad square a market beside which the bonsecours market would have shown as common as the quincy and up the odd woodensidewalked street stretched an aisle of carriages and those high swung calashes which are to quebec what the gondolas are to venice but the hand of destiny was upon our tourists and they rode up town in an omnibus they were going to the dear old hotel musty in street wanting which quebec is not to be thought of without a pang it is now closed and prescott gate through which they drove into the upper town has been demolished since the summer of last year swiftly whirled along the steep winding road by those quebec horses which expect to gallop up hill whatever they do going down they turned a corner of the towering weedgrown rock and shot in under the low arch of the gate pierced with smaller doorways for the footpassengers the gloomy masonry dripped with damp the doors were thickly studded with heavy iron spikes old cannon thrust endwise into the ground at the sides of the gate protected it against passing wheels why did not some semiforbidding commissary of police struggling hard to overcome his native politeness appear and demand their passports the illusion was otherwise perfect and it needed but this touch how often in the adored old world which we so love and disapprove had they driven in through such gates at that morning hour on what perverse pretext then was it not some ancient town of normandy  put a few enterprising americans in here and theyd soon rattle this old wall down and let in a little fresh air said a patriotic voice at isabels elbow and continued to find fault with the narrow irregular streets the huddling gables the quaint roofs through which and under which they drove on to the hotel  as they dashed into a broad open square here is the french cathedral there is the upper town market yonder are the jesuit barracks cried basil and they had a passing glimpse of gray stone towers at one side of the square and a low massive yellow building at the other and between the two long ranks of carts and fruit and vegetable stands protected by canvas awnings and broad umbrellas then they dashed round the corner of a street and drew up before the hotel door the low ceilings the thick walls the clumsy woodwork the wandering corridors gave the hotel all the desired character of age and its slovenly state bestowed an additional charm in another place they might have demanded neatness but in quebec they would almost have resented it by a chance they had the best room in the house but they held it only till certain people who had engaged it by telegraph should arrive in the hourly expected steamer from liverpool and moreover the best room at hotel musty was consolingly bad the house was very full and the ellisons who had come on with them from montreal were bestowed in less state only on like conditions  the travellers all met at breakfast which was admirably cooked and well served with the attendance of those swarms of flies which infest quebec and especially infested the old musty house in summer it had of course the attraction of broiled salmon upon which the traveller breakfasts every day as long as he remains in lower canada and it represented the abundance of wild berries in the quebec market and it was otherwise a breakfast worthy of the appetites that honored it  there were not many other americans besides themselves at this hotel which seemed indeed to be kept open to oblige such travellers as had been there before and could not persuade themselves to try the new hotel st louis whither the vastly greater number resorted most of the faces our tourists saw were english or englishcanadian and the young people from omaha who had got here by some chance were scarcely in harmony with the place they appeared to be a bridal party but which of the two sisters in buff linen clad from head to foot was the bride never became known both were equally free with the husband and he was impartially fond of both it was quite a family affair  for a moment isabel harbored the desire to see the city in company with miss ellison but it was only a passing weakness she remembered directly the coolness between friends which she had seen caused by objects of interest in europe and she wisely deferred a more intimate acquaintance till it could have a purely social basis after all nothing is so tiresome as continual exchange of sympathy or so apt to end in mutual dislikeexcept gratitude so the ladies parted friends till dinner and drove off in separate carriages  as in other show cities there is a routine at quebec for travellers who come on saturday and go on monday and few depart from it our friends necessarily therefore drove first to the citadel it was raining one of those cold rains by which the scarcebanished winter reminds the canadian fields of his nearness even in midsummer though between the bitter showers the air was sultry and close and it was just the light in which to see the grim strength of the fortress next strongest to gibraltar in the world they passed a heavy iron gateway and up through a winding lane of masonry to the gate of the citadel where they were delivered into the care of private joseph drakes who was to show them such parts of the place as are open to curiosity but a citadel which has never stood a siege or been threatened by any danger more serious than fenianism soon becomes however strong but a dull piece of masonry to the civilian and our tourists more rejoiced in the crumbling fragment of the old french wall which the english destroyed than in all they had built and they valued the latter work chiefly for the glorious prospects of the st lawrence and its mighty valleys which it commanded advanced into the centre of an amphitheatre inconceivably vast that enormous beak of rock overlooks the narrow angle of the river and then in every direction immeasurable stretches of gardened vale and wooded upland till all melts into the purple of the encircling mountains far and near are lovely white villages nestling under elms in the heart of fields and meadows and everywhere the long narrow accurately divided farms stretch downward to the rivershores the best roads on the continent make this beauty and richness accessible each little village boasts some natural wonder in stream or lake or cataract and this landscape magnificent beyond any in eastern america is historical and interesting beyond all others hither came jacques cartier three hundred and fifty years ago and wintered on the low point there by the st charles here nearly a century after but still fourteen years before the landing at plymouth champlain founded the missionary city of quebec round this rocky beak came sailing the halfpiratical armament of the calvinist kirks in 1629 and seized quebec in the interest of the english holding it three years in the lower town yonder first landed the coldly welcomed jesuits who came with the returning french and made quebec forever eloquent of their zeal their guile their heroism at the foot of this rock lay the fleet of sir william phipps governor of massachusetts and vainly assailed it in 1698 in 1759 came wolfe and embattled all the region on river and land till at last the bravely defended city fell into his dying hand on the plains of abraham here montgomery laid down his life at the head of the boldest and most hopeless effort of our war of independence  private joseph drakes with the generosity of an enemy expecting drinkmoney pointed out the sign board on the face of the crag commemorating montgomerys death and then showed them the officers quarters and those of the common soldiers not far from which was a line of hangdog fellows drawn up to receive sentence for divers small misdemeanors from an officer whose blond whiskers drooped dundrearily from his fresh english cheeks there was that immense difference between him and the men in physical grandeur and beauty which is so notable in the aristocratically ordered military services of europe and which makes the rank seem of another race from the file private drakes saluted his superior and visibly deteriorated in his presence though his breast was covered with medals and he had fought englands battles in every part of the world it was a gross injustice the triumph of a thousand years of wrong and it was touching to have private drakes say that he expected in three months to begin life for himself after twenty years service of the queen and did they think he could get anything to do in the states he scarcely knew what he was fit for but he thoughtto so little in him came the victories he had helped to win in the crimea in china and in indiathat he coald take care of a gentlemans horse and work about his place he looked inquiringly at basil as if he might be a gentleman with a horse to be taken care of and a place to be worked about and made him regret that he was not a man of substance enough to provide for private drakes and mrs drakes and the brood of ducklings who had been shown to him stowed away in one of those cavernous rooms in the earthworks where the married soldiers have their quarters his regret enriched the reward of private drakes servicewhich perhaps answered one of private drakes purposes if not his chief aim he promised to come to the states upon the pressing advice of isabel who speaking from her own large experience declared that everybody got on thereand he bade our friends an affectionate farewell as they drove away to the plains of abraham  the fashionable suburban cottages and places of quebec are on the st louis road leading northward to the old battleground and beyond it but these face chiefly towards the rivers st lawrence and st charles and lofty hedges and shrubbery hide them in an english seclusion from the highway so that the visitor may uninterruptedly meditate whatever emotion he will for the scene of wolfes death as he rides along his loftiest emotion will want the noble height of that heroic soul who must always stand forth in history a figure of beautiful and singular distinction admirable alike for the sensibility and daring the poetic pensiveness and the martial ardor that mingled in him and taxed his feeble frame with tasks greater than it could bear the whole story of the capture of quebec is full of romantic splendor and pathos her fall was a triumph for all the englishspeaking race and to us americans long scourged by the cruel indian wars plotted within her walls or sustained by her strength such a blessing as was hailed with ringing bells and blazing bonfires throughout the colonies yet now we cannot think without pity of the hopes extinguished and the labors brought to naught in her overthrow that strange colony of priests and soldiers of martyrs and heroes of which she was the capital willing to perish for an allegiance to which the mothercountry was indifferent and fighting against the armies with which england was prepared to outnumber the whole canadian population is a magnificent spectacle and montcalm laying down his life to lose quebec is not less affecting than wolfe dying to win her the heart opens towards the soldier who recited on the eve of his costly victory the elegy in a country churchyard which he would rather have written than beat the french tomorrow but it aches for the defeated general who hurt to death answered when told how brief his time was so much the better then i shall not live to see the surrender of quebec  in the city for which they perished their fame has never been divided the english have shown themselves very generous victors perhaps nothing could be alleged against them but that they were victors a shaft common to wolfe and montcalm celebrates them both in the governors garden and in the chapel of the ursuline convent a tablet is placed where montcalm died by the same conquerors who raised to wolfes memory the column on the battlefield  a dismal prison covers the ground where the hero fell and the monument stands on the spot where wolfe breathed his last on ground lower than the rest of the field the friendly hollow that sheltered him from the fire of the french dwarfs his monument yet it is sufficient and the simple inscription here died wolfe victorious gives it a dignity which many cubits of added stature could not bestow another of those bitter showers which had interspersed the mornings sunshine drove suddenly across the open plain and our tourists comfortably sentimentalized the scene behind the closedrawn curtains of their carriage here a whole empire had been lost and won basil reminded isabel and she said only think of it and looked to a wandering fold of her skirt upon which the rain beat through a rent of the curtain  do i pitch the pipe too low we poor honest men are at a sad disadvantage and now and then i am minded to give a loose to fancy and attribute something really grand and fine to my people in order to make them worthier the readers respected acquaintance but again i forbid myself in a higher interest and i am afraid that even if i were less virtuous i could not exalt their mood upon a battlefield for of all things of the past a battle is the least conceivable i have heard men who fought in many battles say that the recollection was like a dream to them and what can the merely civilian imagination do on the plains of abraham with the fact that there more than a century ago certain thousands of frenchmen marched out on a bright september morning to kill and maim as many englishmen this ground so green and oft with grass beneath the feet was it once torn with shot and soaked with the blood of men did they lie here in ranks and heaps the miserable slain for whom tender hearts away yonder over the sea were to ache and break did the wretches that fell wounded stretch themselves here and writhe beneath the feet of friend and foe or crawl array for shelter into little hollows and behind gushes and fallen trees did he whose soul was so full of noble and sublime impulses die here shot through like some ravening beast the loathsome carnage the shrieks the hellish din of arms the cries of victoryi vainly strive to conjure up some image of it all now and god be thanked horrible spectre that fill the world with sorrow as thou wilt thou still remainest incredible in its moments of sanity and peace least credible art thou on the old battlefields where the mother of the race denies thee with breeze and sun and leaf and bird and every blade of grass the red stain in basils thought yielded to the rain sweeping across the pastureland from which it had long since faded and the words on the monument here died wolfe victorious did not proclaim his bloody triumph over the french but his selfconquest his victory over fear and pain and love of life alas when shall the poor blind stupid world honor those who renounce self in the joy of their kind equally with those who devote themselves through the anguish and loss of thousands so old a world and groping still  the tourists were better fitted for the next occasion of sentiment which was at the hotel dieu whither they went after returning from the battlefield it took all the maladdress of which travellers are masters to secure admittance and it was not till they had rung various wrong bells and misunderstood many soft nunvoices speaking french through grated doors and set divers sympathetic spectators doing ineffectual services that they at last found the proper entrance and were answered in english that the porter would ask if they might see the chapel they hoped to find there the skull of brebeuf one of those jesuit martyrs who perished long ago for the conversion of a race that has perished and whose relics they had come fresh from their reading of parkman with some vague and patronizing intention to revere an elderly sister with a pale kind face led them through a ward of the hospital into the chapel which they found in the expected taste and exquisitely neat and cool but lacking the martyrs skull they asked if it were not to be seen ah yes poor pere brebeuf sighed the gentle sister with the tone and manner of having lost him yesterday we had it down only last week showing it to some jesuit fathers but its in the convent now and isnt to be seen and there mingled apparently in her regret for pere brebeuf a confusing sense of his actual state as a portable piece of furniture she would not let them praise the chapel it was very clean yes but there was nothing to see in it she deprecated their compliments with many shrugs but she was pleased for when we renounce the pomps and vanities of this world we are pretty sure to find them in some otherif we are women she good and pure soul whose whole life was given to selfdenying toil had yet something angelically coquettish in her manner a spiritualworldliness which was the clarified likeness of thisworldliness o had they seen the hotel dieu at montreal then with a vivacious wave of the hands they would not care to look at this which by comparison was nothing yet she invited them to go through the wards if they would and was clearly proud to have them see the wonderful cleanness and comfort of the place there were not many patients but here and there a wan or fevered face looked at them from its pillow or a weak form drooped beside a bed or a group of convalescents softly talked together they came presently to the last hall at the end of which sat another nun beside a window that gave a view of the busy port and beyond it the landscape of villagelit plain and forestdarkened height on a table at her elbow stood a rosetree on which hung two only pale tearoses so fair so perfect that isabel cried out in wonder and praise ere she could prevent it the nun to whom there had been some sort of presentation gathered one of the roses and with a shy grace offered it to isabel who shrank back a little as from too costly a gift take it said the first nun with her pretty french accent while the other who spoke no english at all beamed a placid smile and isabel took it the flower lying light in her palm exhaled a delicate odor and a thrill of exquisite compassion for it trembled through her heart as if it had been the white cloistered life of the silent nun with its pallid loveliness it was as a flower that had taken the veil it could never have uttered the burning passion of a lover for his mistress the nightingale could have found no thorn on it to press his aching poets heart against but sick and weary eyes had dwelt gratefully upon it at most it might have expressed like a prayer the nuns stainless love of some favorite saint in paradise cold and pale and sweetwas it indeed only a flower this cloistered rose of the hotel dieu  breathe it said the gentle gray sister sometimes the air of the hospital offends not us no we are used but you come from the outside and she gave her rose for this humble use as lovingly as she devoted herself to her lowly taxes  it is very little to see she said at the end but if you are pleased i am very glad goodby goodby she stood with her arms folded and watched them out of sight with her kind coquettish little smile and then the mute blank life of the nun resumed her  from hotel dieu to hotel musty it was but a step both were in the same street but our friends fancied themselves to have come an immense distance when they sat down at an early dinner amidst the clash of crockery and cutlery and looked round upon all the profane travelling world assembled their regard presently fixed upon one company which monopolized a whole table and were defined from the other diners by peculiarities as marked as those of the soeurs grises themselves there were only two men among some eight or ten women one of the former had a bad amiable face with eyes full of a merry deviltry the other clean shaven and dark was demure and silent as a priest the ladies were of various types but of one effect with large rolling eyes and faces that somehow regarded the beholder as from a distance and with an impartial feeling for him as for an element of publicity one of them who caressed a lapdog with one hand while she served herself with the other was as she seemed to believe a blonde she had pale blue eyes and her hair was cut in front so as to cover her forehead with a straggling sandycolored fringe she had an english look and three or four others with dark complexion and black unsteady eyes and various abandon of backhair looked like cockney houris of jewish blood while two of the lovely company were clearly of our own nation as was the young man with the reckless laughing face the ladies were dressed and jeweled with a kind of broad effectiveness which was to the ordinary style of society what scenepainting is to painting and might have borne close inspection no better they seemed the besthumored people in the world and on the kindliest terms with each other the waiters shared their pleasant mood and served them affectionately and were now and then invited to join in the gay talk which babbled on over dislocated aspirates and filled the air with a sentiment of vagabond enjoyment of the romantic freedom of violated convention of something gil blaslike almost picaresque  if they had needed explanation it would have been given by the announcement in the office of the hotel that a troupe of british blondes was then appearing in quebec for one week only  after dinner they took possession of the parlor and while one strummed fitfully upon the ailing hotel piano the rest talked and talked shop of course as all of us do when several of a trade are got together  wat said the eldest of the darkfaced black haired british blondes of jewish racewat are we going to give at montrehal  were going to give pygmalion at montrehal answered the british blonde of american birth goodhumoredly burlesquing the erring h of her sister  but we cahnt you know said the lady with the fringed forehead hagnes is gone on to new york and theres nobody to do wenus  yes you know demanded the first speaker oos to do wenus  bellas to do wenus said a third  there was an outcry at this and ow ever would she get herself up for venus and wat a guy shell look and nonsense bellas too eavy for venus came from different lively critics and the debate threatened to become too intimate for the public ear when one of their gentlemen came in and said charley dont seem so well this afternoon on this the chorus changed its note and at the proposal poor charley let s go and cheer im hop a bit the whole goodtempered company trooped out of the parlor together  our tourists meant to give the rest of the afternoon to that sort of aimless wandering to and fro about the streets which seizes a foreign city unawares and best develops its charm of strangeness so they went out and took their fill of quebec with appetites keen through long fasting from the quaint and old and only sharpened by montreal and impartially rejoiced in the crooked upanddown hill streets the thoroughly french domestic architecture of a place that thus denied having been english for a hundred years the portecocheres beside every house the french names upon the doors and the oddity of the bellpulls the roughpaved rattling streets the shining roofs of tin and the universal dormerwindows the littleness of the private houses and the greatness of the highwalled and gardengirdled convents the breadths of weatherstained city wall and the shaggy cliff beneath the batteries with their guns peacefully staring through loopholes of masonry and the redcoated sergeants flirting with nurserymaids upon the carriages while the children tumbled about over the pyramids of shot and shell the sloping marketplace before the cathedral where yet some remnant of the mornings traffic lingered under canvas canopies and where isabel bought a bouquet of marigolds and asters of an old woman peasant enough to have sold it in any marketplace of europe the small dark shops beyond the quarter invaded by english retail trade the movement of all the strange figures of cleric and lay and military life the sound of a foreign speech prevailing over the english the encounter of other tourists the passage back and forth through the different city gates the public wooden stairways dropping flight after flight from the upper to the lower town the bustle of the port with its commerce and shipping and seafaring life huddled close in under the hill the many desolate streets of the lower town as black and ruinous as the last great fire left them and the marshy meadows beyond memorable of recollets and jesuits of cartier and montcalm  they went to the chapel of the seminary at laval university and admired the le brun and the other paintings of less merit but equal interest through their suggestion of a whole dim religious world of paintings and then they spent half an hour in the cathedral not so much in looking at the crucifixion by vandyck which is there as in reveling amid the familiar rococo splendors of the temple every swaggering statue of a saint every ropedancing angel every cherub of those that on the carven and gilded clouds above the high altar float       like little wanton boys that swim on bladders  was precious to them the sacristan dusting the sacred properties with a feather brush and giving each shrine a businesslike nod as he passed was as a longlost brother they had hearts of aggressive tenderness for the young girls and old women who stepped in for a halfhours devotion and for the men with bourgeois or peasant faces who stole a moment from affairs and crops and gave it to the saints there was nothing in the place that need remind them of america and its taste was exactly that of a thousand other churches of the eighteenth century they could easily have believed themselves in the farthest catholic south but for the two great porcelain stoves that stood on either side of the nave near the entrance and that too vividly reminded them of the possibility of cold  in fact quebec is a little painful in this and other confusions of the south and north and one never quite reconciles himself to them the frenchmen who expected to find there the climate of their native land and ripen her wines in as kindly a sun have perpetuated the image of home in so many things that it goes to the heart with a painful emotion to find the sad oblique light of the north upon them as you ponder some characteristic aspect of quebeca bit of street with heavy stone houses opening upon a stretch of the city wall with a lombardy poplar rising slim against ityou say to your satisfied soul yes it is the real thing and then all at once a sense of that northern sky strikes in upon you and makes the reality a mere picture the sky is blue the sun is often fiercely hot you could not perhaps prove that the pathetic radiance is not an efflux of your own consciousness that summer is but hanging over the land briefly poising on wings which flit at the first dash of rain and will soon vanish in long retreat before the snow but somehow from without or from within that light of the north is there  it lay saddest our travellers thought upon the little circular garden near durham terrace where every brightness of fall flowers aboundedmarigold coxcomb snapdragon dahlia hollyhock and sunflower it was a substantial and hardy efflorescence and they fancied that fainterhearted plants would have pined away in that garden where the little fountain leaping up into the joyless light fell back again with a musical shiver the consciousness of this latent cold of winter only held in abeyance by the bright sun was not deeper even in the once magnificent now neglected governors garden where there was actually a rawness in the late afternoon air and whither they were strolling for the view from its height and to pay their duty to the obelisk raised there to the common fame of wolfe and montcalm the sounding latin inscription celebrates the royal governorgeneral who erected it almost as much as the heroes to whom it was raised but these spectators did not begrudge the space given to his praise for so fine a thought merited praise it enforced again the idea of a kind posthumous friendship between wolfe and montcalm which gives their memory its rare distinction and unites them who fell in fight against each other as closely as if they had both died for the same cause  some lasting dignity seems to linger about the city that has once been a capital and this odor of fallen nobility belongs to quebec which was a capital in the european sense with all the advantages of a small viceregal court and its social and political intrigues in the french times under the english for a hundred years it was the centre of colonial civilization and refinement with a governorgenerals residence and a brilliant easy and delightful society to which the large garrison of former days gave gayety and romance the honors of a capital first shared with montreal and toronto now rest with halfsavage ottawa and the garrison has dwindled to a regiment of rifles whose presence would hardly be known but for the natty sergeants lounging stick in hand about the streets and courting the nursemaids but in the days of old there were scenes of carnival pleasure in the governors garden and there the garrison band still plays once a week when it is filled by the fashion and beauty of quebec and some semblance of the past is recalled it is otherwise a lonesome indifferently tended place and on this afternoon there was no one there but a few loafing young fellows of low degree french and english and children that played screaming from seat to seat and path to path and over the tooheavily shaded grass in spite of a conspicuous warning that any dog entering the garden would be destroyed the place was thronged with dogs unmolested and apparently in no danger of the threatened doom the seal of a disagreeable desolation was given in the legend rudely carved upon one of the benches success to the irish republic  the morning of the next day our tourists gave to hearing mass at the french cathedral which was not different to their heretical senses from any other mass except that the ceremony was performed with a very full clerical force and was attended by an uncommonly devout congregation with europe constantly in their minds they were bewildered to find the worshippers not chiefly old and young women but men also of all ages and of every degree from the neat peasant in his sabbathday best to the modish young quebecker who spread his handkerchief on the floor to save his pantaloons during supplication there was fashion and education in large degree among the men and there was in all a pious attention to the function in poetical keeping with the origin and history of a city which the zeal of the church had founded  a magnificent beadle clothed in a goldlaced coat aid bearing a silver staff bowed to them when they entered and leading them to a pew punched up a kneeling peasant who mutely resumed his prayers in the aisle outside while they took his place it appeared to isabel very unjust that their curiosity should displace his religion but she consoled herself by making basil give a shilling to the man who preceded by the shining beadle came round to take up a collection the peasant could have given nothing but copper and she felt that this restored the lost balance of righteousness in their favor there was a sermon very sweetly and gracefully delivered by a young priest of singular beauty even among clergy whose good looks are so notable as those of quebec and then they followed the orderly crowd of worshippers out and left the cathedral to the sacristan and the odor of incense  they thought the type of frenchcanadian better here than at montreal and they particularly noticed the greater number of pretty young girls all classes were well dressed for though the best dressed could not be called stylish according to the american standard as isabel decided and had only a provincial gentility the poorest wore garments that were clean and whole everybody too was going to have a hot sunday dinner if there was any truth in the odors that steamed out of every door and window and this dinner was to be abundantly garnished with onions for the dullest nose could not err concerning that savor  numbers of tourists of a nationality that showed itself superior to every distinction of race were strolling vaguely and not always quite happily about but they made no impression on the proper local character and the air throughout the morning was full of the sentiment of sunday in a catholic city there was the apparently meaningless jangling of bells with profound hushes between and then more jubilant jangling and then deeper silence there was the devout trooping of the crowds to the churches and there was the beginning of the long afternoons lounging and amusement with which the people of that faith reward their mornings devotion little stands for the sale of knotty apples and chokecherries and cakes and cider sprang magically into existence after service and people were already eating and drinking at them the carriagedrivers resumed their chase of the tourists and the unvoiceful stir of the new week had begun again quebec in fact is but a pantomimic reproduction of france it is as if two centuries in a new land amidst the primeval silences of nature and the long hush of the northern winters had stilled the tongues of the lively folk and made them taciturn as we of a graver race they have kept the ancestral vivacity of manner the elegance of the shrug is intact the talking hands take part in dialogue the agitated person will have its share of expression but the loud and eager tone is wanting and their dumb show mystifies the beholder almost as much as the southern architecture under the slanting northern sun it is not america if it is not france what is it  of the many beautiful things to see in the neighborhood of quebec our weddingjourneyers were in doubt on which to bestow their one precious afternoon should it be lorette with its cataract and its remnant of bleached and fading hurons or the isle of orleans with its fertile farms and its primitive peasant life or montmorenci with the unrivaled fall and the long drive through the beautiful village of beauport isabel chose the last because basil had been there before and it had to it the poetry of the wasted years in which she did not know him she had possessed herself of the journal of his early travels among the other portions and parcels recoverable from the dreadful past and from time to time on this journey she had read him passages out of it with mingled sentiment and irony and whether she was mocking or admiring equally to his confusion now as they smoothly bowled away from the city she made him listen to what he had written of the same excursion long ago  it was to be sure a sad farrago of sentiment about the village and the rural sights and especially a girl tossing hay in the field yet it had touches of nature and reality and basil could not utterly despise himself for having written it yes he said life was then a thing to be put into pretty periods now its something that has risks and averages and may be insured  there was regret fancied or expressed in his tone that made her sigh ah if id only had a little more money you might have devoted yourself to literature for she was a true bostonian in her honor of our poor craft  o youre not greatly to blame answered her husband and i forgive you the little wrong youve done me i was quits with the muse at any rate you know before we were married and im very well satisfied to be going back to my applications and policies tomorrow  tomorrow the word struck cold upon her then their wedding journey would begin to end tomorrow so it would she owned with another sigh and yet it seemed impossible  there maam said the driver rising from his seat and facing round while he pointed with his whip towards quebec thats what we call the silver city  they looked back with him at the city whose thousands of tinned roofs rising one above the other from the waters edge to the citadel were all a splendor of argent light in the afternoon sun it was indeed as if some magic had clothed that huge rock base and steepy flank and crest with a silver city they gazed upon the marvel with cries of joy that satisfied the drivers utmost pride in it and isabel said to live there there in that silver city in perpetual sojourn to be always going to go on a morrow that never came to be forever within one day of the end of a wedding journey that never ended  from far down the river by which they rode came the sound of a cannon breaking the sabbath repose of the air thats the gun of the liverpool steamer just coming in said the driver  o cried isabel im thankful were only to stay one night more for now we shall be turned out of our nice room by those people who telegraphed for it  there is a continuous village along the st lawrence from quebec almost to montmorenci and they met crowds of villagers coming from the church as they passed through beauport but basil was dismayed at the change that had befallen them they had their sundays best on and the women instead of wearing the peasant costume in which he had first seen them were now dressed as if out of harpers bazar of the year before he anxiously asked the driver if the broad straw hats and the bright sacks and kirtles were no more o youd see them on weekdays sir was the answer but theyre not so plenty any time as they used to be he opened his store of facts about the habitans whom he praised for every virtuefor thrift for sobriety for neatness for amiability and his words ought to have had the greater weight because he was of the irish race between which and the canadians there is no kindness lost but the looks of the passersby corroborated him and as for the little houses opendoored beside the way with the pleasant faces at window and portal they were miracles of picturesqueness and cleanliness from each the owners slim domain narrowing at every successive division among the abundant generations runs back to hill or river in welldefined lines and beside the cottage is a garden of potherbs bordered with a flame of bright autumn flowers somewhere in decent seclusion grunts the fattening pig which is to enrich all those peas and onions for the winters broth there is a cheerfulness of poultry about the barns i dare be sworn there is always a small girl driving a flock of decorous ducks down the middle of the street and of the priest with a book under his arm passing a wayside shrine what possible doubt the houses which are of one model are built by the peasants themselves with the stone which their land yields more abundantly than any other crop and are furnished with galleries and balconies to catch every ray of the fleeting summer and perhaps to remember the longlost ancestral summers of normandy at every moment in passing through this ideally neat and pretty village our tourists must think of the lovely poem of which all french canada seems but a reminiscence and illustration it was grand pre not beauport and they paid an eager homage to the beautiful genius which has touched those simple village aspects with an undying charm and which whatever the lands political allegiance is there perpetual seigneur  the village stretching along the broad interval of the st lawrence grows sparser as you draw near the falls of montmorenci and presently you drive past the grove shutting from the road the countryhouse in which the duke of kent spent some merry days of his jovial youth and come in sight of two lofty towers of stonemonuments and witnesses of the tragedy of montmorenci  once a suspensionbridge built sorely against the will of the neighboring habitans hung from these towers high over the long plunge of the cataract but one morning of the fatal spring after the first winters frost had tried the hold of the cable on the rocks an old peasant and his wife with their little grandson set out in their cart to pass the bridge as they drew near the middle the anchoring wires suddenly lost their grip upon the shore and whirled into the air the bridge crashed under the hapless passengers and they were launched from its height upon the verge of the fall and thence plunged two hundred and fifty feet into the ruin of the abyss  the habitans rebuilt their bridge of wood upon low stone piers so far up the river from the cataract that whoever fell from it would yet have many a chance for life and it would have been perilous to offer to replace the fallen structure which in the belief of faithful christians clearly belonged to the numerous bridges built by the devil in times when the devil did not call himself a civil engineer  the driver with just unction recounted the sad tale as he halted his horses on the bridge and as his passengers looked down the rockfretted brown torrent towards the fall isabel seized the occasion to shudder that ever she had set foot on that suspensionbridge below niagara and to prove to basils confusion that her doubt of the bridges between the three sisters was not a case of nerves but an instinctive wisdom concerning the unsafety of all bridges of that design  from the gate opening into the grounds about the fall two or three little french boys whom they had not the heart to forbid ran noisily before them with cries in their sole english this way sir and led toward a weatherbeaten summerhouse that tottered upon a projecting rock above the verge of the cataract but our tourists shook their heads and turned away for a more distant and less dizzy enjoyment of the spectacle though any commanding point was sufficiently chasmal and precipitous the lofty bluff was scooped inward from the st lawrence in a vast irregular semicircle with cavernous hollows one within another sinking far into its sides and naked from foot to crest or meagrely wooded here and there with evergreen from the central brink of these gloomy purple chasms the foamy cataract launched itself and like a cloud       along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem  i say a cloud because i find it already said to my hand as it were in a pretty verse and because i must needs liken montmorenci to something that is soft and light yet a cloud does not represent the glinting of the water in its downward swoop it is like some broad slope of sunsmitten snow but snow is coldly white and opaque and this has a creamy warmth in its luminous mass and so there hangs the cataract unsaid as before it is a mystery that anything so grand should be so lovely that anything so tenderly fair in whatever aspect should yet be so large that one glance fails to comprehend it all the rugged wildness of the cliffs and hollows about it is softened by its gracious beauty which half redeems the vulgarity of the timbermerchants uses in setting the river at work in his sawmills and choking its outlet into the st lawrence with rafts of lumber and rubbish of slabs and shingles nay rather it is alone amidst these things and the eye takes note of them by a separate effort  our tourists sank down upon the turf that crept with its white clover to the edge of the precipice and gazed dreamily upon the fall filling their vision with its exquisite color and form being wiser than i they did not try to utter its loveliness they were content to feel it and the perfection of the afternoon whose low sun slanting over the landscape gave under that pale greenishblue sky a pensive sentiment of autumn to the world the crickets cried amongst the grass the hesitating chirp of birds came from the tree overhead a shaggy colt left off grazing in the field and stalked up to stare at them their little guides having found that these people had no pleasure in the sight of small boys scuffling on the verge of a precipice threw themselves also down upon the grass and crooned a long long ballad in a mournful minor key about some maiden whose name was la belle adeline it was a moment of unmixed enjoyment for every sense and through all their being they were glad which considering they ceased to be so with a deep sigh as one reasoning that he dreams must presently awake they never could have an emotion without desiring to analyze it but perhaps their rapture would have ceased as swiftly even if they had not tried to make it a fact of consciousness  if there were not dinner after such experiences as these said isabel as they sat at table that evening i dont know what would become of one but dinner unites the idea of pleasure and duty and brings you gently back to earth you must eat dont you see and theres nothing disgraceful about what youre obliged to do and soits all right  isabel isabel cried her husband you have a wonderful mind and its workings always amaze me but be careful my dear be careful dont work it too hard the human brain you know delicate organ  well you understand what i mean and i think its one of the great charms of a husband that youre not forced to express yourself to him a husband continued isabel sententiously poising a bit of meringue between her thumb and fingerfor they had reached that point in the repast a husband is almost as good as another woman  in the parlor they found the ellisons and exchanged the history of the day with them  certainly said mrs ellison at the end its been a pleasant day enough but what of the night youve been turned out too by those people who came on the steamer and who might as well have stayed on board tonight have you got another room  not precisely said isabel we have a coop in the fifth story right under the roof  mrs ellison turned energetically upon her husband and cried in tones of reproach richard mrs march has a room  a coop she said retorted that amiable colonel and were too good for that the clerk is keeping us in suspense about a room because he means to surprise us with something palatial at the end it s his joking way  nonsense said mrs ellison have you seen him since dinner  i have made life a burden to him for the last halfhour returned the colonel with the kindliest smile  o richard cried his wife in despair of his amendment you wouldnt make life a burden to a mouse and having nothing else for it she laughed half in sorrow half in fondness  well fanny the colonel irrelevantly answered put on your hat and things and lets all go up to durham terrace for a promenade i know our friends want to go its something worth seeing and by the time we get back the clerk will have us a perfectly sumptuous apartment  nothing i think more enforces the illusion of southern europe in quebec than the sundaynight promenading on durham terrace this is the ample space on the brow of the cliff to the left of the citadel the noblest and most commanding position in the whole city which was formerly occupied by the old castle of saint louis where dwelt the brave count frontenac and his splendid successors of the french regime the castle went the way of quebec by fire some forty years ago and lord durham leveled the site and made it a public promenade a stately arcade of solid masonry supports it on the brink of the rock and an iron parapet incloses it there are a few seats to lounge upon and some idle old guns for the children to clamber over and play with a soft twilight had followed the day and there was just enough obscurity to hide from a willing eye the northern and new world facts of the scene and to bring into more romantic relief the citadel dark against the mellow evening and the people gossiping from window to window across the narrow streets of the lower town the terrace itself was densely thronged and there was a constant coming and going of the promenaders who each formally paced back and forth upon the planking for a certain time and then went quietly home giving place to the new arrivals they were nearly all french and they were not generally it seemed of the first fashion but rather of middling condition in life the english being represented only by a few young fellows and now and then a redfaced old gentleman with an indian scarf trailing from his hat there were some fair american costumes and faces in the crowd but it was essentially quebecian the young girls walking in pairs or with their lovers had the true touch of provincial unstylishness the young men the ineffectual excess of the secondrate latin dandy their elders the rich inelegance of a bourgeoisie in their best a few betterfigured avocats or notaires their profession was as unmistakable as if they had carried their wellpolished brass doorplates upon their breasts walked and gravely talked with each other the nonamerican character of the scene was not less vividly marked in the fact that each person dressed according to his own taste and frankly indulged private preferences in shapes and colors one of the promenaders was in white even to his canvas shoes another with yet bolder individuality appeared in perfect purple it had a strange almost portentous effect when these two startling figures met as friends and joined each other in the promenade with linked arms but the evening was already beginning to darken round them and presently the purple comrade was merely a sombre shadow beside the glimmering white  the valleys and the heights now vanished but the river defined itself by the varicolored lights of the ships and steamers that lay dark motionless bulks upon its broad breast the lights of point lewis swarmed upon the other shore the lower town two hundred feet below them stretched an alluring mystery of clustering roofs and lamplit windows and dark and shining streets around the mighty rock muralcrowned suddenly a spectacle peculiarly northern and characteristic of quebec revealed itself a long arch brightened over the northern horizon the tremulous flames of the aurora pallid violet or faintly tinged with crimson shot upward from it and played with a weird apparition and evanescence to the zenith while the strangers looked a gun boomed from the citadel and the wild sweet notes of the bugle sprang out upon the silence  then they all said how perfectly in keeping everything has been and sauntered back to the hotel  the colonel went into the office to give the clerk another turn on the rack and make him confess to a hidden apartment somewhere while isabel left her husband to mrs ellison in the parlor and invited miss kitty to look at her coop in the fifth story as they approached light and music and laughter stole out of an open door next hers and isabel distinguishing the voices of the theatrical party divined that this was the sickchamber and that they were again cheering up the afflicted member of the troupe some one was heard to say well ow do you feel now charley and a sound of subdued swearing responded followed by more laughter and the twanging of a guitar and a snatch of song and a stir of feet and dresses as for departure  the two listeners shrank together as women they could not enjoy these proofs of the jolly camaraderie existing among the people of the troupe they trembled as before the merriment of as many lighthearted careless goodnatured young men it was no harm but it was dismaying and dear cried isabel what shall we do  go back said miss ellison boldly and back they ran to the parlor where they found basil and the colonel and his wife in earnest conclave the colonel like a shrewd strategist was making show of a desperation more violent than his wifes who was thus naturally forced into the attitude of moderating his fury  well fanny thats all he can do for us and i do think it s the most outrageous thing in the world it s real mean  fanny perceived a bold parody of her own denunciatory manner but just then she was obliged to answer isabels eager inquiry whether they had got a room yet yes a room she said with two beds but what are we to do with one room that clerki dont know what to call himcall him a hotelclerk my dear you cant say anything worse interrupted her husbandseems to think the matter perfectly settled  you see mrs march added the colonel hes able to bully us in this way because he has the architecture on his side there isnt another room in the house  let me think a moment said isabel not thinking an instant she had taken a fancy to at least two of these people from the first and in the last hour they had all become very well acquainted now she said ill tell you there are two beds in our room also we ladies will take one room and you gentlemen the other  mrs march i bow to the superiority of the boston mind said the colonel while his females civilly protested and consented and i might almost hail you as our preserver if ever you come to milwaukeewhich is the centre of the world as boston isweishall be happy to have you call at my place of businessi didnt commit myself did i fannyi am sometimes hospitable to excess mrs march he said to explain his aside and now let us reconnoitre lead on madam and the gratitude of the houseless stranger will follow you  the whole party explored both rooms and the ladies decided to keep isabels the colonel was dispatched to see that the wraps and traps of his party were sent to this number and basil went with him the things came long before the gentlemen returned but the ladies happily employed the interval in talking over the excitements of the day and in saying from time to time so very kind of you mrs march and i dont know what we should have done and dont speak of it please and im sure it s a great pleasure to me  in the room adjoining theirs where the invalid actor lay and where lately there had been minstrelsy and apparently dancing for his solace there was now comparative silence two womens voices talked together and now and then a guitar was touched by a wandering hand isabel had just put up her handkerchief to conceal her first yawn when the gentlemen odorous of cigars returned to say goodnight  its the second door from this isnt it isabel asked her husband  yes the second door goodnight goodnight  the two men walked off together but in a minute afterwards they had returned and were knocking tremulously at the closed door  o what has happened chorused the ladies in woeful tune seeing a certain wildness in the face that confronted them  we dont know answered the others in as fearful a key and related how they had found the door of their room ajar and a bright light streaming into the corridor they did not stop to ponder this fact but with the heedlessness of their sex pushed the door wide open when they saw seated before the mirror a bewildering figure with disheveled locks wandering down the back and in dishabille expressive of being quite at home there which turned upon them a pair of pale blue eyes under a forehead remarkable for the straggling fringe of hair that covered it they professed to have remained transfixed at the sight and to have noted a like dismay on the visage before the glass ere they summoned strength to fly these facts colonel ellison gave at the command of his wife with many protests and insincere delays amidst which the curiosity of his hearers alone prevented them from rending him in pieces  and what do you suppose it was demanded his wife with forced calmness when he had at last made an end of the story and his abominable hypoocisies  well i think it was a mermaid  a mermaid said his wife scornfully how do you know  it had a comb in its hand for one thing and besides my dear i hope i know a mermaid when i see it  well said mrs ellison it was no mermaid it was a mistake and im going to see about it will you go with me richard  no money could induce me if its a mistake it isnt proper for me to go if its a mermaid its dangerous  o you coward said the intrepid little woman to a hero of all the fights on shermans march to the sea and presently they heard her attack the mysterious enemy with a ladylike courage claiming the invaded chamber the foe replied with like civility saying the clerk had given her that room with the understanding that another lady was to be put there with her and she had left the door unlocked to admit her the watchers with the sick man next door appeared and confirmed this speech a feeble voice from the bedclothes swore to it  of course added the invader if id known ow it really was i never would lave listened to such a thing never and there isnt another ole in the louse to lay me ead she concluded  then its the clerks fault said mrs ellison glad to retreat unharmed and she made her husband ring for the guilty wretch a pale quiet young frenchman whom the united party sallying into the corridor began to upbraid in one breath the lady in dishabille vanishing as often as she remembered it and reappearing whenever some strong point of argument or denunciation occurred to her  the clerk who was the benjamin of his wicked tribe threw himself upon their mercy and confessed everything the house was so crowded and he had been so crazed by the demands upon him that he had understood colonel ellisons application to be for a bed for the young lady in his party and he had done the very best he could if the lady thereshe vanished againwould give up the room to the two gentlemen he would find her a place with the housekeeper to this the lady consented without difficulty and the rest dispersing she kissed one of the sick mans watchers with isnt it a shame bella and flitted down the darkness of the corridor the rooms upon it seemed all save the two assigned our travellers to be occupied by ladies of the troupe their doors successively opened and she was heard explaining to each as she passed the momentary displeasure which she had shown at her banishment was over she detailed the facts with perfect goodnature and though the others appeared no more than herself to find any humorous cast in the affair they received her narration with the same amiability they uttered their sympathy seriously and each parted from her with some friendly word then all was still  richard said mrs ellison when in isabels room the travellers had briefly celebrated these events i should think youd hate to leave us alone up here  i do but you cant think how i hate to go off alone i wish youd come part of the way with us ladies i do indeed leave your door unlocked at any rate  this prayer uttered at parting outside the room was answered from within by a sound of turning keys and sliding bolts and a low thunder as of bureaus and washstands rolled against the door the ladies are fortifying their position said the colonel to basil and the two returned to their own chamber i dont wish any intrusions he said instantly shutting himself in my nerves are too much shaken now what an awfully mysterious old place this quebec is mr march ill tell you what its my opinion that this is an enchanted castle and if my ribs are not walked over by a muleteer in the course of the night its all i ask  in this and other discourse recalling the famous adventure of don quixote the colonel beguiled the labor of disrobing and had got as far as his boots when there came a startling knock at the door with one boot in his hand and the other on his foot the colonel limped forward i suppose its that clerk has sent to say hes made some other mistake and he flung wide the door and then stood motionless before it dumbly staring at a figure on the thresholda figure with the fringed forehead and pale blue eyes of her whom they had so lately turned out of that room  shrinking behind the side of the doorway excuse me gentlemen she said with a dignity that recalled their scattered senses but will you ave the goodness to look if my beads are on your tableo thanks thanks thanks she continued showing her face and one hand as basil blushingly advanced with a string of heavy black beads piously adorned with a large cross im sure im greatly obliged to you gentlemen and i hask a thousand pardons for troublin you she concluded in a somewhat severe tone that left them abashed and culpable and vanished as mysteriously as she had appeared  now see here said the colonel with a huge sigh as he closed the door again and this time locked it i should like to know how long this sort of thing is to be kept up because if its to be regularly repeated during the night im going to dress again nevertheless he finished undressing and got into bed where he remained for some time silent basil put out the light o im sorry you did that my dear fellow said the colonel but never mind it was an idle curiosity no doubt its my belief that in the landlords extremity of bedlinen ive been put to sleep between a pair of tablecloths and i thought id like to look it seems to me that i make out a checkered pattern on top and a flowered or arabesque pattern underneath i wish they had given me mates it s pretty hard having to sleep between odd tablecloths i shall complain to the landlord of this in the morning ive never had to sleep between odd tablecloths at any hotel before  the colonels voice seemed scarcely to have died away upon basils drowsy ear when suddenly the sounds of music and laughter from the invalids room startled him wide awake the sick mans watchers were coquetting with some one who stood in the little courtyard five stories below a certain breadth of repartee was naturally allowable at that distance the lover avowed his passion in ardent terms and the ladies mocked him with the same freedom now and then totally neglecting him while they sang a snatch of song to the twanging of the guitar or talked professional gossip and then returning to him with some tormenting expression of tenderness  all this abstractly speaking was nothing to basil yet he could recollect few things intended for his pleasure that had given him more satisfaction he thought as he glanced out into the moonlight on the highgabled silvery roofs around and on the gardens of the convents and the towers of the quaint city that the scene wanted nothing of the proper charm of spanish humor and romance and he was as grateful to those poor souls as if they had meant him a favor to us of the hither side of the footlights there is always something fascinating in the life of the strange beings who dwell beyond them and who are never so unreal as in their own characters in their shabby bestowal in those mean upper rooms their tawdry poverty their merry submission to the errors and caprices of destiny their mutual kindliness and careless friendship these unprofitable devotees of the twinklingfooted burlesque seemed to be playing rather than living the life of strolling players and their lovemaking was the last touch of a comedy that basil could hardly accept as reality it was so much more like something seen upon the stage he would not have detracted anything from the commonness and cheapness of the mise en scene for that he reflected drowsily and confusedly helped to give it an air of fact and make it like an episode of fiction but above all he was pleased with the natural eventlessness of the whole adventure which was in perfect agreement with his taste and just as his reveries began to lose shape in dreams he was aware of an absurd pride in the fact that all this could have happened to him in our commonplace time and hemisphere why he thought if i were a student in alcala what better could i have asked and as at last his soul swung out from its moorings and lapsed down the broad slowly circling tides out in the sea of sleep he was conscious of one subtle touch of compassion for those poor strollersa pity so delicate and fine and tender that it hardly seemed his own but rather a sense of the compassion that pities the whole world     x homeward and home  the travellers all met at breakfast and duly discussed the adventures of the night and for the rest the forenoon passed rapidly and slowly with basil and isabel as regret to leave quebec or the natural impatience of travellers to be off overcame them isabel spent part of it in shopping for she had found some small sums of money and certain odd corners in her trunks still unappropriated and the handsome stores on the rue fabrique were very tempting she said she would just go in and look and the wise reader imagines the result as she knelt over her boxes trying so to distribute her purchases as to make them look as if they were oldold things of hers which she had brought all the way round from boston with hera fleeting touch of conscience stayed her hand  basil she said perhaps wed better declare some of these things whats the duty on those she asked pointing to certain articles  i dont know about a hundred per cent ad valorem  cest a dire  as much as they cost  o then dearest responded isabel indignantly it cant be wrong to smuggle i wont declare a thread  thats very well for you whom they wont ask but what if they ask me whether theres anything to declare  isabel looked at her husband and hesitated then she replied in terms that i am proud to record in honor of american womanhood you mustnt fib aboutit basil heroically i couldnt respect you if you did tenderly but with decision you must slip out of it some way  the ladies of the ellison party to whom she put the case in the parlor agreed with her perfectly they also had done a little shopping in quebec and they meant to do more at montreal before they returned to the states mrs ellison was disposed to look upon isabels compunctions as a kind of treason to the sex to be forgiven only because so quickly repented  the ellisons were going up the saguenay before coming on to boston and urged our friends hard to go with them no that must be for another time said isabel mr march has to be home by a certain day and we shall just get back in season then she made them promise to spend a day with her in boston and the colonel coming to say that he had a carriage at the door for their excursion to lorette the two parties bade goodby with affection and many explicit hopes of meeting soon again  what do you think of them dearest demanded isabel as she sallied out with basil for a final look at quebec  the young lady is the nicest and the other is well enough too she is a good deal like you but with the sense of humor left out youve only enough to save you  well her husband is jolly enough for both of them hes funnier than you basil and he hasnt any of your little languid airs and affectations i dont know but im a bit disappointed in my choice darling but i dare say i shall work out of it in fact i dont know but the colonel is a little too jolly this drolling everything is rather fatiguing and having begun they did not stop till they had taken their friends to pieces dismayed then they hastily reconstructed them and said that they were among the pleasantest people they ever knew and they were really very sorry to part with them and they should do everything to make them have a good time in boston  they were sauntering towards durham terrace where they leaned long upon the iron parapet and blest themselves with the beauty of the prospect a tender haze hung upon the landscape and subdued it till the scene was as a dream before them as in a dream the river lay and dreamlike the shipping moved or rested on its deep broad bosom far off stretched the happy fields with their dim white villages farther still the mellow heights melted into the low hovering heaven the tinned roofs of the lower town twinkled in the morning sun around them on every hand on that monday forenoon when the states were stirring from ocean to ocean in feverish industry drowsed the gray city within her walls from the flagstaff of the citadel hung the red banner of saint george in sleep  their hearts were strangely and deeply moved it seemed to them that they looked upon the last stronghold of the past and that afar off to the southward they could hear the marching hosts of the invading present and as no young and loving soul can relinquish old things without a pang they sighed a long mute farewell to quebec  next summer they would come again yes but ah me every one knows what next summer is     part of the burlesque troupe rode down in the omnibus to the grand trunk  ferry with them and were goodnatured to the last having shaken hands all round with the waiters chambermaids and porters of the hotel the young fellow with the bad amiable face came in a calash and refused to overpay the driver with a gay decision that made him basils envy till he saw his tribulation in getting the troupes luggage checked there were forty pieces and it always remained a mystery considering the small amount of clothing necessary to those people on the stage what could have filled their trunks the young man and the two english blondes of american birth found places in the same car with our tourists and enlivened the journey with their frolics when the young man pretended to fall asleep they wrapped his golden curly head in a shawl and vexed him with many thumps and thrusts till he bought a brief truce with a handful of almonds and the ladies having no other way to eat them one of them saucily snatched off her shoe and cracked them hammerwise with the heel it was all so pleasant that it ought to have been all right and in their merry world of outlawry perhaps things are not so bad as we like to think them  the country into which the train plunges as soon as quebec is out of sight is very stupidly savage and our friends had little else to do but to watch the gambols of the players till they came to the river st francis whose wandering loveliness the road follows through an infinite series of soft and beautiful landscapes and finds everywhere glassing in its smooth current the elms and willows of its gentle shores at one place where its calm broke into foamy rapids there was a huge saw mill covering the stream with logs and refuse and the banks with whole cities of lumber which also they accepted as no mean elements of the picturesque they clung the most tenderly to traces of the peasant life they were leaving when some french boys came aboard with wild raspberries to sell in little birchbark canoes they thrilled with pleasure and bought them but sighed then and said what thing characteristic of the local life will they sell us in maine when we get there a section of pie poetically wrapt in a broad leaf of the squashvine or popcorn in its native tissuepaper and advertising the new dollar store in portland they saw the quaintness vanish from the farmhouses first the dormerwindows then the curve of the steep roof then the steep roof itself by and by they came to a store with a grecian portico and four square pine pillars they shuddered and looked no more  the guiltily dreaded examination of baggage at island pond took place at nine oclock without costing them a cent of duty or a pang of conscience at that charming station the trunks are piled higgledypiggledy into a room beside the track where a few inspectors with stifling lamps of smoky kerosene await the passengers there are no porters to arrange the baggage and each lady and gentleman digs out his box and opens it before the lordly inspector who stirs up its contents with an unpleasant hand and passes it he makes you feel that you are once more in the land of official insolence and that whatever you are collectively you are nothing personally isabel who had sent her husband upon this business with quaking meekness of heart experienced the bold indignation of virtue at his account of the way people were made their own baggagesmashers and would not be amused when he painted the vile terrors of each husband as he tremblingly unlocked his wifes store of contraband  the morning light showed them the broad elmy meadows of westernlooking maine and the grand trunk brought them of course an hour behind time into portland all breakfastless they hurried aboard the boston train on the eastern road and all along that line which is built to show how uninteresting the earth can be when she is ennuyee of both sea and land basils life became a struggle to construct a meal from the fragmentary opportunities of twenty different stations where they stopped five minutes for refreshments at one place he achieved two cups of shameless chickory at another three sardines at a third a dessert of elderly bananas       home again home again from a foreign shore  they softly sang as the successive courses of this feast were disposed of  the drouth and heat which they had briefly escaped during their sojourn in canada brooded sovereign upon the tiresome landscape the red granite rocks were as if redhot the banks of the deep cuts were like ash heaps over the fields danced the sultry atmosphere they fancied that they almost heard the grasshoppers sing above the rattle of the train when they reached boston at last they were dustier than most of us would like to be a hundred years hence the whole city was equally dusty and they found the trees in the square before their own door gray with dust the bit of virginiacreeper planted under the window hung shriveled upon its trellis  but isabels aunt met them with a refreshing shower of tears and kisses in the hall throwing a solid arm about each of them o you dears the good soul cried you dont know how anxious ive been about you so many accidents happening all the time ive never read the evening transcript till the next morning for fear i should find your names among the killed and wounded  o aunty youre too good always whimpered isabel and neither of the women took note of basil who said yes it s probably the only thing that preserved our lives  the little tinge of discontent which had colored their sentiment of return faded now in the kindly light of home their holiday was over to be sure but their bliss had but began they had entered upon that long life of holidays which is happy marriage by the time dinner was ended they were both enthusiastic at having got back and taking their aunt between them walked up and down the parlor with their arms round her massive waist and talked out the gladness of their souls  then basil said he really must run down to the office that afternoon and he issued all aglow upon the street he was so full of having been long away and of having just returned that he unconsciously tried to impart his mood to boston and the dusty composure of the street and houses as he strode along bewildered him he longed for some familiar face to welcome him and in the horsecar into which he stepped he was charmed to see an acquaintance this was a man for whom ordinarily he cared nothing and whom he would perhaps rather have gone out upon the platform to avoid than have spoken to but now he plunged at him with effusion and wrung his hand smiling from ear to ear  the other remained coldly unaffected after a first start of surprise at his cordiality and then reviled the dust and heat but im going to take a little run down to newport tomorrow for a week he said by the way you look as if you needed a little change arent you going anywhere this summer  so you see my dear observed basil when he had recounted the fact to isabel at tea our travels are incommunicably our own we had best say nothing about our little jaunt to other people and they wont know weve been gone even if we tried we couldnt make our weddingjourney theirs  she gave him a great kiss of recompense and consolation who wants it she demanded to be their wedding journey     xi niagara revisited twelve years after their wedding journey  life had not used them ill in this time and the fairish treatment they had received was not wholly unmerited the twelve years past had made them older as the years must in passing basil was now fortytwo and his moustache was well sprinkled with gray isabel was thirtynine and the parting of her hair had thinned and retreated but she managed to give it an effect of youthful abundance by combing it low down upon her forehead and roughing it there with a wet brush by gaslight she was still very pretty she believed that she looked more interesting and she thought basils gray moustache distinguished he had grown stouter he filled his doublebreasted frock coat compactly and from time to time he had the buttons set forward his hands were rounded up on the backs and he no longer wore his old number of gloves by two sizes no amount of powder or manipulation from the young lady in the shop would induce them to go on but this did not matter much now for he seldom wore gloves at all he was glad that the fashion suffered him to spare in that direction for he was obliged to look somewhat carefully after the outgoes the insurance business was not what it had been and though basil had comfortably established himself in it he had not made money he sometimes thought that he might have done quite as well if he had gone into literature but it was now too late they had not a very large family they had a boy of eleven who took after his father and a girl of nine who took after the boy but with the american feeling that their children must have the best of everything they made it an expensive family and they spent nearly all basil earned  the narrowness of their means as well as their household cares had kept them from taking many long journeys they passed their winters in boston and their summers on the south shore cheaper than the north shore and near enough for basil to go up and down every day for business but they promised themselves that some day they would revisit certain points on their wedding journey and perhaps somewhere find their lost secondyouth on the track it was not that they cared to be young but they wished the children to see them as they used to be when they thought themselves very old and one lovely afternoon in june they started for niagara  it had been very hot for several days but that morning the east wind came in and crisped the air till it seemed to rustle like tinsel and the sky was as sincerely and solidly blue as if it had been chromoed they felt that they were really looking up into the roof of the world when they glanced at it but when an old gentleman hastily kissed a young woman and commended her to the conductor as being one who was going all the way to san francisco alone and then risked his life by stepping off the moving train the vastness of the great american fact began to affect isabel disagreeably is nt it too big basil she pleaded peering timidly out of the little municipal consciousness in which she had been so long housedin that seclusion she had suffered certain original tendencies to increase upon her her nerves were more sensitive and electrical her apprehensions had multiplied quite beyond the ratio of the dangers that beset her and basil had counted upon a tonic effect of the change the journey would make in their daily lives she looked ruefully out of the window at the familiar suburbs whisking out of sight and the continental immensity that advanced devouringly upon her but they had the best section in the very centre of the sleepingcarshe drew what consolation she could from the factand the childrens premature demand for lunch helped her to forget her anxieties they began to be hungry as soon as the train started she found that she had not put up sandwiches enough and when she told basil that he would have to get out somewhere and buy some cold chicken he asked her what in the world had become of that whole ham she had had boiled it seemed to him he said that there was enough of it to subsist them to niagara and back and he went on as some men do while somerville vanished and even tufts college which assails the bostonian vision from every point of the compass was shut out by the curve at the foot of the belmont hills  they had chosen the hoosac tunnel route to niagara because as basil said their experience of travel had never yet included a very long tunnel and it would be a signal fact by which the children would always remember the journey if nothing else remarkable happened to impress it upon them indeed they were so much concerned in it that they began to ask when they should come to this tunnel even before they began to ask for lunch and the long time before they reached it was not perceptibly shortened by toms quarterhourly consultations of his fathers watch  it scarcely seemed to basil and isabel that their fellowpassengers were so interesting as their fellow passengers used to be in their former days of travel they were soberly dressed and were all of a middleaged sobriety of deportment from which nothing salient offered itself for conjecture or speculation and there was little within the car to take their minds from the brilliant young world that flashed and sang by them outside the belated spring had ripened with its frequent rains into the perfection of early summer the grass was thicker and the foliage denser than they had ever seen it before and when they had run out into the hills beyond fitchburg they saw the laurel in bloom it was everywhere in the woods lurking like drifts among the underbrush and overflowing the tops and stealing down the hollows of the railroad embankments a snow of blossom flushed with a mist of pink its shy wild beauty ceased whenever the train stopped but the orioles made up for its absence with their singing in the village trees about the stations and though fitchburg and ayers junction and athol are not names that invoke historical or romantic associations the hearts of basil and isabel began to stir with the joy of travel before they had passed these points at the first basil got out to buy the cold chicken which had been commanded and he recognized in the keeper of the railroad restaurant their former conductor who had been warned by the spirits never to travel without a flower of some sort carried between his lips and who had preserved his own life and the lives of his passengers for many years by this simple device his presence lent the sponge cake and rhubarb pie and baked beans a supernatural interest and reconciled basil to the toughness of the athletic bird which the mystical expartner of fate had sold him he justly reflected that if he had heard the story of the restaurateurs superstition in a foreign land or another time he would have found in it a certain poetry it was this willingness to find poetry in things around them that kept his life and isabels fresh and they taught their children the secret of their elixir to be sure it was only a genre poetry but it was such as has always inspired english art and song and now the whole family enjoyed as if it had been a passage from goldsmith or wordsworth the flying sentiment of the railroad side there was a simple interior at one placea small shanty showing through the open door a cook stove surmounted by the evening coffeepot with a lazy cat outstretched upon the floor in the middle distance and an old woman standing just outside the threshold to see the train go bywhich had an unrivaled value till they came to a superannuated car on a siding in the woods in which the railroad workmen boardedsome were lounging on the platform and at the open windows while others were washing up for supper and the whole scene was full of holiday ease and sylvan comradery that went to the hearts of the sympathetic spectators basil had lately been reading aloud the delightful history of rudder grange and the children who had made their secret vows never to live in anything but an old canalboat when they grew up owned that there were fascinating possibilities in a wornout railroad car  the lovely deerfield valley began to open on either hand with smooth stretches of the quiet river and breadths of grassy intervale and tableland the elms grouped themselves like the trees of a park here and there the nearer hills broke away and revealed long deep chasmed hollows full of golden light and delicious shadow there were people rowing on the water and every pretty town had some touch of picturesqueness or pastoral charm to offer at greenfield there were children playing in the newmown hay along the railroad embankment at shelburne falls there was a game of cricket going on among the english operatives of the cutlery works as basil boldly asserted they looked down from their carwindow on a young lady swinging in a hammock in her dooryard and on an old gentleman hoeing his potatoes a group of girls waved their handkerchiefs to the passing train and a boy paused in weeding a gardenbedand probably denied that he had paused later in the mean time the golden haze along the mountain side changed to a clear pearly lustre and the quiet evening possessed the quiet landscape they confessed to each other that it was all as sweet and beautiful as it used to be and in fact they had seen palaces in other days which did not give them the pleasure they found in a woodcutters shanty losing itself among the shadows in a solitude of the hills the tunnel after this was a gross and material sensation but they joined the children in trying to hold and keep it and basil let the boy time it by his watch now said tom when five minutes were gone we are under the very centre of the mountain but the tunnel was like all accomplished facts all hopes fulfilled valueless to the soul and scarcely appreciable to the sense and the children emerged at north adams with but a mean opinion of that great feat of engineering basil drew a pretty moral from their experience if you rode upon a comet you would be disappointed take my advice and never ride upon a comet i shouldnt object to your riding on a little meteoryou would nt expect much of that but i warn you against comets they are as bad as tunnels  the children thought this moral was a joke at their expense and as they were a little sleepy they permitted themselves the luxury of feeling trifled with but they woke refreshed and encouraged from slumbers that had evidently been unbroken though they both protested that they had not slept a wink the whole night and gave themselves up to wonder at the interminable levels of western new york over which the train was running the longing to come to an edge somewhere that the new england traveler experiences on this plain was inarticulate with the children but it breathed in the sigh with which isabel welcomed even the architectural inequalities of a city into which they drew in the early morning this city showed to their weary eyes a noble stretch of river from the waters of which lofty piles of buildings rose abruptly and isabel being left to guess where they were could think of no other place so picturesque as rochester  yes said her husband it is our own enchanted city i wonder if that unstinted hospitality is still dispensed by the good head waiter at the hotel where we stopped to bridal parties who have passed the ordeal of the haughty hotel clerk i wonder what has become of that hotel clerk has he fallen through pride to some lower level or has he bowed his arrogant spirit to the demands of advancing civilization and realized that he is the servant and not the master of the public i think ive noticed since his time a growing kindness in hotel clerks or perhaps i have become of a more impressive presence they certainly unbend to me a little more i should like to go up to our hotel and try myself on our old enemy if he is still there i can fancy how his shirt front has expanded in these twelve years past he has grown a little bald after the fashion of middleaged hotel clerks but he parts his hair very much on one side and brushes it squarely across his forehead to hide his loss the forefinger that he touches that little snapbell with when he doesnt look at you must be very pudgy now come let us get out and breakfast at rochester they will give us broiled whitefish and we can show the children where sam patch jumped over genesee falls and  no no basil cried his wife it would be sacrilege all that is sacred to those dear young days of ours and i wouldnt think of trying to repeat it our own ghosts would rise up in that diningroom to reproach us for our intrusion oh perhaps we have done a wicked thing in coming this journey we ought to have left the past alone we shall only mar our memories of all these beautiful places do you suppose buffalo can be as poetical as it was then buffalo the name does nt invite the muse very much perhaps it never was very poetical oh basil dear im afraid we have only come to find out that we were mistaken about everything lets leave rochester alone at any rate  im not troubled we wont disturb our dream of rochester but i dont despair of buffalo im sure that buffalo will be all that our fancy ever painted it i believe in buffalo  well well murmured isabel i hope youre right and she put some things together for leaving their car at buffalo while they were still two hours away  when they reached a place where the land mated its level with the level of the lake they ran into a wilderness of railroad cars in a world where life seemed to be operated solely by locomotives and their helpless minions the bellowing and bleating trains were arriving in every direction not only along the ground floor of the plain but stately stretches of trestlework which curved and extended across the plain carried them to and fro overhead the travelers owned that this railroad suburb had its own impressiveness and they said that the trestlework was as noble in effect as the lines of aqueduct that stalk across the roman campagna perhaps this was because they had not seen the campagna or its aqueducts for a great while but they were so glad to find themselves in the spirit of their former journey again that they were amiable to everything when the children first caught sight of the lakes delicious blue and cried out that it was lovelier than the sea they felt quite a local pride in their preference it was what isabel had said twelve years before on first beholding the lake  but they did not really see the lake till they had taken the train for niagara falls after breakfasting in the depot where the children used to the severe native or the patronizing irish ministrations of boston restaurants and hotels reveled for the first time in the affectionate devotion of a black waiter there was already a ridiculous abundance and variety on the table but this waiter brought them strawberries and again strawberries and repeated plates of griddle cakes with maple syrup and he hung over the back of first one chair and then another with an unselfish joy in the appetites of the breakfasters which gave basil renewed hopes of his race such rapture in serving argues a largeness of nature which will be recognized hereafter he said feeling about in his waistcoat pocket for a quarter it seemed a pity to render the waiters zeal retroactively interested but in view of the fact that he possibly expected the quarter there was nothing else to do and by a mysterious stroke of gratitude the waiter delivered them into the hands of a friend who took another quarter from them for carrying their bags and wraps to the train this second retainer approved their admiration of the aesthetic forms and colors of the depot colonnade and being asked if that were the depot whose roof had fallen in some years before proudly replied that it was  there were a great many killed were nt there asked basil with sympathetic satisfaction in the disaster the porter seemed humiliated he confessed the mortifying truth that the loss of life was small but he recovered a just selfrespect in adding if the roof had fallen in five minutes sooner it would have killed about three hundred people  basil had promised the children a sight of the rapids before they reached the falls and they held him rigidly accountable from the moment they entered the train and began to run out of the city between the river and the canal he attempted a diversion with the canal boats and tried to bring forward the subject of rudder grange in that connection they said that the canal boats were splendid but they were looking for the rapids now and they declined to be interested in a window in one of the boats which basil said was just like the window that the rudder granger and the boarder had popped pomona out of when they took her for a burglar  you spoil those children basil said his wife as they clambered over him and clamored for the rapids  at present im giving them an objectlesson in patience and selfdenial they are experiencing the fact that they cant have the rapids till they get to them and probably theyll be disappointed in them when they arrive  in fact they valued the rapids very little more than the hoosac tunnel when they came in sight of them at last and basil had some question in his own mind whether the rapids had not dwindled since his former visit he did not breathe this doubt to isabel however and she arrived at the falls with unabated expectations they were going to spend only half a day there and they turned into the station away from the phalanx of omnibuses when they dismounted from their train they seemed as before to be the only passengers who had arrived and they found an abundant choice of carriages waiting in the street outside the station the niagara hackman may once have been a predatory and very rampant animal but public opinion long expressed through the public prints has reduced him to silence and meekness apparently he may not so much as beckon with his whip to the arriving wayfarer it is certain that he cannot cross the pavement to the station door and basil inviting one of them to negotiation was himself required by the attendant policeman to step out to the curbstone and complete his transaction there it was an impressive illustration of the power of a free press but upon the whole basil found the effect melancholy it had the saddening quality which inheres in every sort of perfection the hackman reduced to entire order appealed to his compassion and he had not the heart to beat him down from his moderate first demand as perhaps he ought to have done they drove directly to the cataract and found themselves in the pretty grove beside the american fall and in the air whose dampness was as familiar as if they had breathed it all their childhood it was full now of the fragrance of some sort of wild blossom and again they had that old entrancing sense of the mingled awfulness and loveliness of the great spectacle this sylvan perfume the gayety of the sunshine the mildness of the breeze that stirred the leaves overhead and the birdsinging that made itself heard amid the roar of the rapids and the solemn incessant plunge of the cataract moved their hearts and made them children with the boy and girl who stood rapt for a moment and then broke into joyful wonder they could sympathize with the ardor with which tom longed to tempt fate at the brink of the river and over the tops of the parapets which have been built along the edge of the precipice and they equally entered into the terror with which bella screamed at his suicidal zeal they joined her in restraining him they reduced him to a beggarly account of half a dozen stones flung into the rapids at not less than ten paces from the brink and they would not let him toss the smallest pebble over the parapet though he laughed to scorn the notion that anybody should be hurt by them below  it seemed to them that the triviality of man in the surroundings of the falls had increased with the lapse of time there were more booths and bazaars and more colored feather fans with whole birds spitted in the centres and there was an offensive array of blue and green and yellow glasses on the shore through which you were expected to look at the falls gratis they missed the simple dignity of the blanching indian maids who used to squat about on the grass with their laps full of moccasins and pincushions but as of old the photographer came out of his saloon and invited them to pose for a family group representing that the light and the spray were singularly propitious and that everything in nature invited them to be taken basil put him off gently for the sake of the time when he had refused to be photographed in a bridal group and took refuge from him in the long low building from which you descend to the foot of the cataract  the grove beside the american fall has been inclosed and named prospect park by a company which exacts half a dollar for admittance and then makes you free of all its wonders and conveniences for which you once had to pay severally this is well enough but formerly you could refuse to go down the inclined tramway and now you cannot without feeling that you have failed to get your moneys worth it was in this illogical spirit of economy that basil invited his family to the descent but isabel shook her head no you go with the children she said and i will stay here till you get back her agonized countenance added and pray for you and basil took his children on either side of him and rumbled down the terrible descent with much of the excitement that attends travel in an open horsecar when he stepped out of the car he felt that increase of courage which comes to every man after safely passing through danger he resolved to brave the mists and slipperystones at the foot of the fall and he would have plunged at once into this fresh peril if he had not been prevented by the prospect park company this ingenious association has built a large tunnellike shed quite to the waters edge so that you cannot view the cataract as you once could at a reasonable remoteness but must emerge from the building into a storm of spray the roof of the tunnel is painted with a lively effect in partycolored stripes and is lettered the shadow of the rock so that you take it at first to be an appeal to your aesthetic sense but the real object of the company is not apparent till you put your head out into the tempest when you agree with the nearest guideand one is always very nearthat you had better have an oilskin dress as basil did he told the guide that he did not wish to go under the fall and the guide confidentially admitted that there was no fun in that any way and in the mean time he equipped him and his children for their foray into the mist when they issued forth under their friends leadership basil felt that with his children clinging to each hand he looked like some sort of animal with its young and though not unsocial by nature he was glad to be among strangers for the time they climbed hither and thither over the rocks and lifted their streaming faces for the views which the guide pointed out and in a rift of the spray they really caught one glorious glimpse of the whole sweep of the fall the next instant the spray swirled back and they were glad to turn for a sight of the rainbow lying in a circle on the rocks as quietly and naturally as if that had been the habit of rainbows ever since the flood this was all there was to be done and they streamed back into the tunnel where they disrobed in the face of a menacing placard which announced that the hire of a guide and a dress for going under the fall was one dollar  will they make you pay a dollar for each of us papa asked tom fearfully  oh pooh no returned basil we have nt been under the fall but he sought out the proprietor with a trembling heart the proprietor was a man of severely logical mind he said that the charge would be three dollars for they had had the use of the dresses and the guide just the same as if they had gone under the fall and he refused to recognize anything misleading in the dressingroom placard in fine he left basil without a leg to stand upon it was not so much the three dollars as the sense of having been swindled that vexed him and he instantly resolved not to share his annoyance with isabel why indeed should he put that burden upon her if she were none the wiser she would be none the poorer and he ought to be willing to deny himself her sympathy for the sake of sparing her needless pain  he met her at the top of the inclined tramway with a face of exemplary unconsciousness and he listened with her to the tale their coachman told as they sat in a pretty arbor looking out on the rapids of a frenchman and his wife this frenchman had returned one morning from a stroll on goat island and reported with much apparent concern that his wife had fallen into the water and been carried over the fall it was so natural for a man to grieve for the loss of his wife under the peculiar circumstances that every one condoled with the widower but when a few days later her body was found and the distracted husband refused to come back from new york to her funeral there was a general regret that he had not been arrested a flash of conviction illumed the whole fact to basils guilty consciousness this unhappy frenchman had paid a dollar for the use of an oilskin suit at the foot of the fall and had been ashamed to confess the swindle to his wife till in a moment of remorse and madness he shouted the fact into her ear and then basil looked at the mother of his children and registered a vow that if he got away from niagara without being forced to a similar excess he would confess his guilt to isabel at the very first act of spendthrift profusion she committed the guide pointed out the rock in the rapids to which avery had clung for twentyfour hours before he was carried over the falls and to the morbid fancy of the deceitful husband isabels bonnet ribbons seemed to flutter from the pointed reef he could endure the pretty arbor no longer come children he cried with a wild unnatural gayety let us go to goat island and see the bridge to the three sisters that your mother was afraid to walk back on after she had crossed it  for shame basil retorted isabel you know it was you who were afraid of that bridge  the children who knew the story by heart laughed with their father at the monstrous pretension and his simulated hilarity only increased upon paying a toll of two dollars at the goat island bridge  what extortion cried isabel with an indignation that secretly unnerved him he trembled upon the verge of confession but he had finally the moral force to resist he suffered her to compute the cost of their stay at niagara without allowing those three dollars to enter into her calculation he even began to think what justificative extravagance he could tempt her to he suggested the purchase of local bricabrac he asked her if she would not like to dine at the international for old times sake but she answered with disheartening virtue that they must not think of such a thing after what they had spent already nothing perhaps marked the confirmed husband in basil more than these hidden fears and reluctances  in the mean time isabel ignorantly abandoned herself to the charm of the place which she found unimpaired in spite of the reported ravages of improvement about niagara goat island was still the sylvan solitude of twelve years ago haunted by even fewer nymphs and dryads than of old the air was full of the perfume that scented it at prospect park the leaves showered them with shade and sun as they drove along if it were not for the children here she said i should think that our first drive on goat island had never ended  she sighed a little and basil leaned forward and took her hand in his it never has ended its the same drive only we are younger now and enjoy it more it always touched him when isabel was sentimental about the past for the years had tended to make her rather more seriously maternal towards him than towards the other children and he recognized that these fond reminiscences were the expression of the girlhood still lurking deep within her heart  she shook her head no but im willing the children should be young in our place its only fair they should have their turn  she remained in the carriage while basil visited the various points of view on luna island with the boy and girl a boy is probably of considerable interest to himself and a man looks back at his own boyhood with some pathos but in his actuality a boy has very little to commend him to the toleration of other human beings tom was very well as boys go but now his contribution to the common enjoyment was to venture as near as possible to all perilous edges to throw stones into the water and to make as if to throw them over precipices on the people below to pepper his father with questions and to collect cumbrous mementos of the vegetable and mineral kingdoms he kept the carriage waiting a good five minutes while he could cut his initials on a bandrail you can come back and see em on your bridal tower said the driver isabel gave a little start as if she had almost thought of something she was trying to think of  they occasionally met ladies driving and sometimes they encountered a couple making a tour of the island on foot but none of these people were young and basil reported that the three sisters were inhabited only by persons of like maturity even a group of people who were eating lunch to the music of the shouting rapids on the outer edge of the last sister were no younger apparently  isabel did not get out of the carriage to verify his report she preferred to refute his story of her former panic on those islands by remaining serenely seated while he visited them she thus lost a superb novelty which nature has lately added to the wonders of this fall in that place at the edge of the great horse shoe where the rock has fallen and left a peculiarly shaped chasm through this the spray leaps up from below and flashes a hundred feet into the air in rocketlike jets and points and then breaks and dissolves away in the pyrotechnic curves of a perpetual fourth of july basil said something like this in celebrating the display with the purpose of rendering her loss more poignant but she replied with tranquil piety that she would rather keep her niagara unchanged and she declared that as she understood him there must be something rather cheap and conscious in the new feature she approved however of the change that had removed that foolish little terrapin tower from the brink on which it stood and she confessed that she could have enjoyed a little variety in the stories the driver told them of the indian burialground on the island they were exactly the stories she and basil had heard twelve years before and the illstarred goats from which the island took its name perished once more in his narrative  under the influence of his romances our travelers began to find the whole scene hackneyed and they were glad to part from him a little sooner than they had bargained to do they strolled about the anomalous village on foot and once more marveled at the paucity of travel and the enormity of the local preparation surely the hotels are nowhere else in the world so large could there ever have been visitors enough at niagara to fill them they were built so big for some good reason no doubt but it is no more apparent than why all these magnificent equipages are waiting about the empty streets for the people who never come to hire them  it seems to me that i dont see so many strangers here as i used basil had suggested to their driver  oh they have nt commenced coming yet he replied with hardy cheerfulness and pretended that they were plenty enough in july and august  they went to dine at the modest restaurant of a colored man who advertised a table dhote dinner on a board at his door and they put their misgivings to him which seemed to grieve him and he contended that niagara was as prosperous and as much resorted to as ever in fact they observed that their regret for the supposed decline of the falls as a summer resort was nowhere popular in the village and they desisted in their offers of sympathy after their rebuff from the restaurateur  basil got his family away to the station after dinner and left them there while he walked down the village street for a closer inspection of the hotels at the door of the largest a pair of children sported in the solitude as fearlessly as the birds on selkirks island looking into the hotel he saw a few porters and callboys seated in statuesque repose against the wall while the clerk pined in dreamless inactivity behind the register some deserted ladies flitted through the door of the parlor at the side he recalled the evening of his former visit when he and isabel had met the ellisons in that parlor and it seemed in the retrospect a scene of the wildest gayety he turned for consolation into the barbers shop where he found himself the only customer and no busy sound of next greeted his ear but the barber like all the rest said that niagara was not unusually empty and he came out feeling bewildered and defrauded surely the agent of the boats which descend the rapids of the st lawrence must be frank if basil went to him and pretended that he was going to buy a ticket but a glance at the agents sign showed basil that the agent with his brave jollity of manner and his impressive goodmorning had passed away from the deceits of travel and that he was now inherited by his widow who in turn was absent and temporarily represented by their son the boy in supplying basil with an advertisement of the line made a specious show of haste as if there were a long queue of tourists waiting behind him to be served with tickets perhaps there was indeed a spectral line there but basil was the only tourist present in the flesh and he shivered in his isolation and fled with the advertisement in his hand isabel met him at the door of the station with a frightened face  basil she cried i have found out what the trouble is where are the brides  he took her outstretched hands in his and passing one of them through his arm walked with her apart from the children who were examining at the newsmans booth the moccasins and the birchbark bricabrac of the irish aborigines and the cups and vases of niagara spar imported from devonshire  my dear he said there are no brides everybody was married twelve years ago and the brides are middleaged mothers of families now and dont come to niagara if they are wise  yes she desolately asserted that is so something has been hanging over me ever since we came and suddenly i realized that it was the absence of the brides butbutdown at the hotelsdidnt you see anything bridal there when the omnibuses arrived was there no burst of minstrelsy was there  she could not go on but sank nervelessly into the nearest seat  perhaps said basil dreamily regarding the contest of tom and bella for a newlypurchased paper of sour cherries and helplessly forecasting in his remoter mind the probable consequences there were both brides and minstrelsy at the hotel if i had only had the eyes to see and the ears to hear in this world my dear we are always of our own time and we live amid contemporary things i daresay there were middleaged people at niagara when we were here before but we did not meet them nor they us i daresay that the place is now swarming with bridal couples and it is because they are invisible and inaudible to us that it seems such a howling wilderness but the hotel clerks and the restaurateurs and the hackmen know them and that is the reason why they receive with surprise and even offense our sympathy for their loneliness do you suppose isabel that if you were to lay your head on my shoulder in a bridal manner it would do anything to bring us en rapport with that lost bridal world again  isabel caught away her hand basil she cried it would be disgusting i wouldnt do it for the worldnot even for that world i saw one middleaged couple on goat island while you were down at the cave of the winds or somewhere with the children they were sitting on some steps he a step below her and he seemed to want to put his head on her knee but i gazed at him sternly and he didnt dare we should look like them if we yielded to any outburst of affection dont you think we should look like them  i dont know said basil you are certainly a little wrinkled my dear  and you are very fat basil  they glanced at each other with a flash of resentment and then they both laughed we couldnt look young if we quarreled a week he said we had better content ourselves with feeling young as i hope we shall do if we live to be ninety it will be the loss of others if they dont see our bloom upon us shall i get you a paper of cherries isabel the children seem to be enjoying them  isabel sprang upon her offspring with a cry of despair oh what shall i do now we shall not have a wink of sleep with them tonight where is that nux she hunted for the medicine in her bag and the children submitted for they had eaten all the cherries and they took their medicine without a murmur i wonder at your letting them eat the sour things basil said their mother when the children bad run off to the newsstand again  i wonder that you left me to see what they were doing promptly retorted their father  it was your nonsense about the brides said isabel and i think this has been a lesson to us dont let them get anything else to eat dearest  they are safe they have no more money they are frugally confining themselves to the admiration of the japanese bows and arrows yonder why have our indians taken to making japanese bows and arrows  isabel despised the small pleasantry then you saw nobody at the hotel she asked  not even the ellisons said basil  ah yes said isabel that was where we met them how long ago it seems and poor little kitty i wonder what has become of them but im glad theyre not here thats what makes you realize your age meeting the same people in the same place a great while after and seeing how oldtheyve grown i dont think i could bear to see kitty ellison again im glad she did nt come to visit us in boston though after what happened she could nt poor thing i wonder if she s ever regretted her breaking with him in the way she did its a very painful thing to think ofsuch an inconclusive conclusion it always seemed as if they ought to meet again somewhere  i dont believe she ever wished it  a man cant tell what a woman wishes  well neither can a woman returned basil lightly  his wife remained serious it was a very fine pointa very little thing to reject a man for i felt that when i first read her letter about it  basil yawned i dont believe i ever knew just what the point was  oh yes you did but you forget everything you know that they met two boston ladies just after they were engaged and she believed that he did nt introduce her because he was ashamed of her countrified appearance before them  it was a pretty fine point said basil and he laughed provokingly  he might not have meant to ignore her answered isabel thoughtfully he might have chosen not to introduce her because he felt too proud of her to subject her to any possible misappreciation from them you might have looked at it in that way  why didnt you look at it in that way you advised her against giving him another chance why did you  why repeated isabel absently oh a woman does nt judge a man by what he does but by what he is i knew that if she dismissed him it was because she never really had trusted or could trust his love and i thought she had better not make another trial  well very possibly you were right at any rate you have the consolation of knowing that its too late to help it now  yes its too late said isabel and her thoughts went back to her meeting with the young girl whom she had liked so much and whose after history had interested her so painfully it seemed to her a hard world that could come to nothing better than that for the girl whom she had seen in her first glimpse of it that night where was she now what had become of her if she had married that man would she have been any happier marriage was not the poetic dream of perfect union that a girl imagines it she herself had found that out it was a state of trial of probation it was an ordeal not an ecstasy if she and basil had broken each others hearts and parted would not the fragments of their lives have been on a much finer much higher plane had not the commonplace everyday experiences of marriage vulgarized them both to be sure there were the children but if they had never had the children she would never have missed them and if basil had for example died just before they were marriedshe started from this wicked reverie and ran towards her husband whose broad honest back with no visible neck or shirtcollar was turned towards her as he stood with his head thrown up studying a timetable on the wall she passed her arm convulsively through his and pulled him away  its time to be getting our bags out to the train basil come bella tom were going  the children reluctantly turned from the newsmans trumpery and they all went out to the track and took seats on the benches under the colonnade while they waited the train for buffalo drew in and they remained watching it till it started in the last car that passed them when it was fairly under way a face looked full at isabel from one of the windows in that moment of astonishment she forgot to observe whether it was sad or glad she only saw or believed she saw the light of recognition dawn into its eyes and then it was gone  basil she cried stop the train that was kitty ellison  oh no it wasnt said basil easily it looked like her but it looked at least ten years older  why of course it was were all ten years older returned his wife in such indignation at his stupidity that she neglected to insist upon his stopping the train which was rapidly diminishing in the perspective  he declared it was only a fancied resemblance she contended that this was in the neighborhood of eriecreek and it must be kitty and thus one of their most inveterate disagreements began  their own train drew into the depot and they disputed upon the fact in question till they entered on the passage of the suspension bridge then basil rose and called the children to his side on the left hand far up the river the great fall shows with its mists at its foot and its rainbow on its brow as silent and still as if it were vastly painted there and below the bridge on the right leap the rapids in the narrow gorge like seas on a rocky shore look on both sides now he said to the children isabel you must see this  isabel had been preparing for the passage of this bridge ever since she left boston never she exclaimed she instantly closed her eyes and hid her face in her handkerchief thanks to this precaution of hers the train crossed the bridge in perfect safety   pg editors bookmarks      all luckiest or the unluckiest the healthiest or the

bibliographical  the following story was the first fruit of my new york life when i began to live it after my quarter of a century in cambridge and boston ending in 1889 and i used my own transition to the commercial metropolis in framing the experience which was wholly that of my supposititious literary adventurer he was a character whom with his wife i have employed in some six or eight other stories and whom i made as much the hero and heroine of their wedding journey as the slight fable would bear in venturing out of my adoptive new england where i had found myself at home with many imaginary friends i found it natural to ask the company of these familiar acquaintances but their company was not to be had at once for the asking when i began speaking of them as basil and isabel in the fashion of their wedding journey they would not respond with the effect of early middle age which i desired in them they remained wilfully not to say woodenly the young bridal pair of that romance without the promise of novel functioning it was not till i tried addressing them as march and mrs march that they stirred under my hand with fresh impulse and set about the work assigned them as people in something more than their second youth  the scene into which i had invited them to figure filled the largest canvas i had yet allowed myself and though a hazard of new fortunes was not the first story i had written with the printer at my heels it was the first which took its own time to prescribe its own dimensions i had the general design well in mind when i began to write it but as it advanced it compelled into its course incidents interests individualities which i had not known lay near and it specialized and amplified at points which i had not always meant to touch though i should not like to intimate anything mystical in the fact it became to my thinking the most vital of my fictions through my quickened interest in the life about me at a moment of great psychological import we had passed through a period of strong emotioning in the direction of the humaner economics if i may phrase it so the rich seemed not so much to despise the poor the poor did not so hopelessly repine the solution of the riddle of the painful earth through the dreams of henry george through the dreams of edward bellamy through the dreams of all the generous visionaries of the past seemed not impossibly far off that shedding of blood which is for the remission of sins had been symbolized by the bombs and scaffolds of chicago and the hearts of those who felt the wrongs bound up with our rights the slavery implicated in our liberty were thrilling with griefs and hopes hitherto strange to the average american breast opportunely for me there was a great streetcar strike in new york and the story began to find its way to issues nobler and larger than those of the loveaffairs common to fiction i was in my fiftysecond year when i took it up and in the prime such as it was of my powers the scene which i had chosen appealed prodigiously to me and the action passed as nearly without my conscious agency as i ever allow myself to think such things happen  the opening chapters were written in a fine old fashioned apartment house which had once been a family house and in an uppermost room of which i could look from my work across the trees of the little park in stuyvesant square to the towers of st georges church then later in the spring of 1889 the unfinished novel was carried to a country house on the belmont border of cambridge there i must have written very rapidly to have pressed it to conclusion before the summer ended it came indeed so easily from the pen that i had the misgiving which i always have of things which do not cost me great trouble  there is nothing in the book with which i amused myself more than the househunting of the marches when they were placing themselves in new york and if the contemporary reader should turn for instruction to the pages in which their experience is detailed i assure him that he may trust their fidelity and accuracy in the article of new york housing as it was early in the last decade of the last century i mean the housing of people of such moderate means as the marches in my zeal for truth i did not distinguish between reality and actuality in this or other mattersthat is one was as precious to me as the other but the types here portrayed are as true as ever they were though the world in which they were finding their habitat is wonderfully almost incredibly different yet it is not wholly different for a young literary pair now adventuring in new york might easily parallel the experience of the marches with their own if not for so little money many phases of new york housing are better but all are dearer other aspects of the material city have undergone a transformation much more wonderful i find that in my book its population is once modestly spoken of as two millions but now in twenty years it is twice as great and the grandeur as well as grandiosity of its forms is doubly apparent the transitional public that then moped about in mildly tinkling horsecars is now hurried back and forth in clanging trolleys in honking and whirring motors the elevated road which was the last word of speed is undermined by the subway shooting its swift shuttles through the subterranean woof of the citys haste from these feet let the witness infer our whole massive hercules a bulk that sprawls and stretches beyond the rivers through the tunnels piercing their beds and that towers into the skies with innumerable topsa hercules blent of briareus and cerberus but not so bad a monster as it seemed then to threaten becoming  certain hopes of truer and better conditions on which my heart was fixed twenty years ago are not less dear and they are by no means touched with despair though they have not yet found the fulfilment which i would then have prophesied for them events have not wholly played them false events have not halted though they have marched with a slowness that might affect a younger observer as marking time they who were then mindful of the poor have not forgotten them and what is better the poor have not often forgotten themselves in violences such as offered me the material of tragedy and pathos in my story in my quality of artist i could not regret these and i gratefully realize that they offered me the opportunity of a more strenuous action a more impressive catastrophe than i could have achieved without them they tended to give the whole fable dignity and doubtless made for its success as a book as a serial it had crept a sluggish course before a public apparently so unmindful of it that no rumor of its acceptance or rejection reached the writer during the half year of its publication but it rose in book form from that failure and stood upon its feet and went its way to greater favor than any book of his had yet enjoyed i hope that my recognition of the fact will not seem like boasting but that the reader will regard it as a special confidence from the author and will let it go no farther  kittery point maine july 1909     part first     i  now you think this thing over march and let me know the last of next week said fulkerson he got up from the chair which he had been sitting astride with his face to its back and tilting toward march on its hindlegs and came and rapped upon his table with his thin bamboo stick what you want to do is to get out of the insurance business anyway you acknowledge that yourself you never liked it and now it makes you sick in other words its killing you you aint an insurance man by nature youre a naturalborn literary man and youve been going against the grain now i offer you a chance to go with the grain i dont say youre going to make your everlasting fortune but ill give you a living salary and if the thing succeeds youll share in its success well all share in its success thats the beauty of it i tell you march this is the greatest idea that has been struck sincefulkerson stopped and searched his mind for a fit imagesince the creation of man  he put his leg up over the corner of marchs table and gave himself a sharp cut on the thigh and leaned forward to get the full effect of his words upon his listener  march had his hands clasped together behind his head and he took one of them down long enough to put his inkstand and mucilagebottle out of fulkersons way after many years experiment of a mustache and whiskers he now wore his grizzled beard full but cropped close it gave him a certain grimness corrected by the gentleness of his eyes  some people dont think much of the creation of man nowadays why stop at that why not say since the morning stars sang together  no sir no sir i dont want to claim too much and i draw the line at the creation of man im satisfied with that but if you want to ring the morning stars into the prospectus all right i wont go back on you  but i dont understand why youve set your mind on me march said i havent had any magazine experience you know that and i havent seriously attempted to do anything in literature since i was married i gave up smoking and the muse together i suppose i could still manage a cigar but i dont believe i could  muse worth a cent fulkerson took the thought out of his mouth and put it into his own words i know well i dont want you to i dont care if you never write a line for the thing though you neednt reject anything of yours if it happens to be good on that account and i dont want much experience in my editor rather not have it you told me didnt you that you used to do some newspaper work before you settled down  yes i thought my lines were permanently cast in those places once it was more an accident than anything else that i got into the insurance business i suppose i secretly hoped that if i made my living by something utterly different i could come more freshly to literature proper in my leisure  i see and you found the insurance business too many for you well anyway youve always had a hankering for the inkpots and the fact that you first gave me the idea of this thing shows that youve done more or less thinking about magazines  yesless  well all right now dont you be troubled i know what i want generally speaking and in this particular instance i want you i might get a man of more experience but i should probably get a man of more prejudice and selfconceit along with him and a man with a following of the literary hangerson that are sure to get round an editor sooner or later i want to start fair and ive found out in the syndicate business all the men that are worth having but they know me and they dont know you and thats where we shall have the pull on them they wont be able to work the thing dont you be anxious about the experience ive got experience enough of my own to run a dozen editors what i want is an editor who has taste and youve got it and conscience and youve got it and horse sense and youve got that and i like you because youre a western man and im another i do cotton to a western man when i find him off east here holding his own with the best of em and showing em that hes just as much civilized as they are we both know what it is to have our bright home in the setting sun heigh  i think we western men whove come east are apt to take ourselves a little too objectively and to feel ourselves rather more representative than we need march remarked  fulkerson was delighted youve hit it we do we are  and as for holding my own im not very proud of what ive done in that way its been very little to hold but i know what you mean fulkerson and ive felt the same thing myself it warmed me toward you when we first met i cant help suffusing a little to any man when i hear that he was born on the other side of the alleghanies its perfectly stupid i despise the same thing when i see it in boston people  fulkerson pulled first one of his blond whiskers and then the other and twisted the end of each into a point which he left to untwine itself he fixed march with his little eyes which had a curious innocence in their cunning and tapped the desk immediately in front of him what i like about you is that youre broad in your sympathies the first time i saw you that night on the quebec boat i said to myself theres a man i want to know theres a human being i was a little afraid of mrs march and the children but i felt at home with youthoroughly domesticatedbefore i passed a word with you and when you spoke first and opened up with a joke over that fellows tableful of light literature and indian moccasins and birchbark toy canoes and stereoscopic views i knew that we were brothersspiritual twins i recognized the western style of fun and i thought when you said you were from boston that it was some of the same but i see now that its being a cold fact as far as the last fifteen or twenty years count is just so much gain you know both sections and you can make this thing go from ocean to ocean  we might ring that into the prospectus too march suggested with a smile you might call the thing from sea to sea bytheway what are you going to call it  i havent decided yet thats one of the things i wanted to talk with you about i had thought of the syndicate but it sounds kind of dry and doesnt seem to cover the ground exactly i should like something that would express the cooperative character of the thing but i dont know as i can get it  might call it the mutual  theyd think it was an insurance paper no that wont do but mutual comes pretty near the idea if we could get something like that it would pique curiosity and then if we could get paragraphs afloat explaining that the contributors were to be paid according to the sales it would be a firstrate ad  he bent a wide anxious inquiring smile upon march who suggested lazily you might call it the roundrobin that would express the central idea of irresponsibility as i understand everybody is to share the profits and be exempt from the losses or if im wrong and the reverse is true you might call it the army of martyrs come that sounds attractive fulkerson or what do you think of the fifth wheel that would forestall the criticism that there are too many literary periodicals already or if you want to put forward the idea of complete independence you could call it the free lance or  or the hog on iceeither stand up or fall down you know fulkerson broke in coarsely but well leave the name of the magazine till we get the editor i see the poisons beginning to work in you march and if i had time id leave the result to time but i havent ive got to know inside of the next week to come down to business with you march i shant start this thing unless i can get you to take hold of it  he seemed to expect some acknowledgment and march said well thats very nice of you fulkerson  no sir no sir ive always liked you and wanted you ever since we met that first night i had this thing inchoately in my mind then when i was telling you about the newspaper syndicate businessbeautiful vision of a lot of literary fellows breaking loose from the bondage of publishers and playing it alone  you might call it the lone hand that would be attractive march interrupted the whole west would know what you meant  fulkerson was talking seriously and march was listening seriously but they both broke off and laughed fulkerson got down off the table and made some turns about the room it was growing late the october sun had left the top of the tall windows it was still clear day but it would soon be twilight they had been talking a long time fulkerson came and stood with his little feet wide apart and bent his little lean square face on march see here how much do you get out of this thing here anyway  the insurance business march hesitated a moment and then said with a certain effort of reserve at present about three thousand he looked up at fulkerson with a glance as if he had a mind to enlarge upon the fact and then dropped his eyes without saying more  whether fulkerson had not thought it so much or not he said well ill give you thirtyfive hundred come and your chances in the success  we wont count the chances in the success and i dont believe thirtyfive hundred would go any further in new york than three thousand in boston  but you dont live on three thousand here  no my wife has a little property  well she wont lose the income if you go to new york i suppose you pay ten or twelve hundred a year for your house here you can get plenty of flats in new york for the same money and i understand you can get all sorts of provisions for less than you pay nowthree or four cents on the pound come  this was by no means the first talk they had had about the matter every three or four months during the past two years the syndicate man had dropped in upon march to air the scheme and to get his impressions of it this had happened so often that it had come to be a sort of joke between them but now fulkerson clearly meant business and march had a struggle to maintain himself in a firm poise of refusal  i dare say it wouldntor it needntcost so very much more but i dont want to go to new york or my wife doesnt its the same thing  a good deal samer fulkerson admitted  march did not quite like his candor and he went on with dignity its very natural she shouldnt she has always lived in boston shes attached to the place now if you were going to start the fifth wheel in boston  fulkerson slowly and sadly shook his head but decidedly wouldnt do you might as well say st louis or cincinnati theres only one city that belongs to the whole country and thats new york  yes i know sighed march and boston belongs to the bostonians but they like you to make yourself at home while youre visiting  if youll agree to make phrases like that right along and get them into the roundrobin somehow ill say four thousand said fulkerson you think it over now march you talk it over with mrs march i know you will anyway and i might as well make a virtue of advising you to do it tell her i advised you to do it and you let me know before next saturday what youve decided  march shut down the rolling top of his desk in the corner of the room and walked fulkerson out before him it was so late that the last of the chorewomen who washed down the marble halls and stairs of the great building had wrung out her floorcloth and departed leaving spotless stone and a clean damp smell in the darkening corridors behind her  couldnt offer you such swell quarters in new york march fulkerson said as he went tacktacking down the steps with his small bootheels but ive got my eye on a little house round in west eleventh street that im going to fit up for my bachelors hall in the third story and adapt for the lone hand in the first and second if this thing goes through and i guess well be pretty comfortable its right on the sand stripno malaria of any kind  i dont know that im going to share its salubrity with you yet march sighed in an obvious travail which gave fulkerson hopes  oh yes you are he coaxed now you talk it over with your wife you give her a fair unprejudiced chance at the thing on its merits and im very much mistaken in mrs march if she doesnt tell you to go in and win were bound to win  they stood on the outside steps of the vast edifice beetling like a granite crag above them with the stone groups of an allegory of lifeinsurance foreshortened in the basrelief overhead march absently lifted his eyes to it it was suddenly strange after so many years familiarity and so was the wellknown street in its saturdayevening solitude he asked himself with prophetic homesickness if it were an omen of what was to be but he only said musingly a fortnightly you know that didnt work in england the fortnightly is published once a month now  it works in france fulkerson retorted the revue des deux mondes is still published twice a month i guess we can make it work in americawith illustrations  going to have illustrations  my dear boy what are you giving me do i look like the sort of lunatic who would start a thing in the twilight of the nineteenth century without illustrations come off  ah that complicates it i dont know anything about art marchs look of discouragement confessed the hold the scheme had taken upon him  i dont want you to fulkerson retorted dont you suppose i shall have an art man  and will theythe artistswork at a reduced rate too like the writers with the hopes of a share in the success  of course they will and if i want any particular man for a card ill pay him big money besides but i can get plenty of firstrate sketches on my own terms youll see theyll pour in  look here fulkerson said march youd better call this fortnightly of yours the madness o f the halfmoon or bedlam broke loose wouldnt be bad why do you throw away all your hard earnings on such a crazy venture dont do it the kindness which march had always felt in spite of his wifes first misgivings and reservations for the merry hopeful slangy energetic little creature trembled in his voice they had both formed a friendship for fulkerson during the week they were together in quebec when he was not working the newspapers there he went about with them over the familiar ground they were showing their children and was simply grateful for the chance as well as very entertaining about it all the children liked him too when they got the clew to his intention and found that he was not quite serious in many of the things he said they thought he was great fun they were always glad when their father brought him home on the occasion of fulkersons visits to boston and mrs march though of a charier hospitality welcomed fulkerson with a grateful sense of his admiration for her husband he had a way of treating march with deference as an older and abler man and of qualifying the freedom he used toward every one with an implication that march tolerated it voluntarily which she thought very sweet and even refined  ah now youre talking like a man and a brother said fulkerson why march old man do you suppose id come on here and try to talk you into this thing if i wasnt morally if i wasnt perfectly sure of success there isnt any if or and about it i know my ground every inch and i dont stand alone on it he added with a significance which did not escape march when youve made up your mind i can give you the proof but im not at liberty now to say anything more i tell you its going to be a triumphal march from the word go with coffee and lemonade for the procession along the whole line all youve got to do is to fall in he stretched out his hand to march you let me know as soon as you can  march deferred taking his hand till he could ask where are you going  parker house take the eleven for new york tonight  i thought i might walk your way march looked at his watch but i shouldnt have time goodbye  he now let fulkerson have his hand and they exchanged a cordial pressure fulkerson started away at a quick light pace half a block off he stopped turned round and seeing march still standing where he had left him he called back joyously ive got the name  what  every other week  it isnt bad  tata     ii  all the way up to the south end march mentally prolonged his talk with fulkerson and at his door in nankeen square he closed the parley with a plump refusal to go to new york on any terms his daughter bella was lying in wait for him in the hall and she threw her arms round his neck with the exuberance of her fourteen years and with something of the histrionic intention of her sex he pressed on with her clinging about him to the library and in the glow of his decision against fulkerson kissed his wife where she sat by the study lamp reading the transcript through her first pair of eyeglasses it was agreed in the family that she looked distinguished in them or at any rate cultivated she took them off to give him a glance of question and their son tom looked up from his book for a moment he was in his last year at the high school and was preparing for harvard  i didnt get away from the office till halfpast five march explained to his wifes glance and then i walked i suppose dinners waiting im sorry but i wont do it any more  at table he tried to be gay with bella who babbled at him with a voluble pertness which her brother had often advised her parents to check in her unless they wanted her to be universally despised  papa she shouted at last youre not listening as soon as possible his wife told the children they might be excused then she asked what is it basil  what is what he retorted with a specious brightness that did not avail  what is on your mind  how do you know theres anything  your kissing me so when you came in for one thing  dont i always kiss you when i come in  not now i suppose it isnt necessary any more cela va sans baiser  yes i guess its so we get along without the symbolism now he stopped but she knew that he had not finished  is it about your business have they done anything more  no im still in the dark i dont know whether they mean to supplant me or whether they ever did but i wasnt thinking about that fulkerson has been to see me again  fulkerson she brightened at the name and march smiled too why didnt you bring him to dinner  i wanted to talk with you then you do like him  what has that got to do with it basil  nothing nothing that is he was boring away about that scheme of his again hes got it into definite shape at last  what shape  march outlined it for her and his wife seized its main features with the intuitive sense of affairs which makes women such good businessmen when they will let it  it sounds perfectly crazy she said finally but it maynt be the only thing i didnt like about mr fulkerson was his always wanting to chance things but what have you got to do with it  what have i got to do with it march toyed with the delay the question gave him then he said with a sort of deprecatory laugh it seems that fulkerson has had his eye on me ever since we met that night on the quebec boat i opened up pretty freely to him as you do to a man you never expect to see again and when i found he was in that newspaper syndicate business i told him about my early literary ambitions  you cant say that i ever discouraged them basil his wife put in i should have been willing any time to give up everything for them  well he says that i first suggested this brilliant idea to him perhaps i did i dont remember when he told me about his supplying literature to newspapers for simultaneous publication he says i asked why not apply the principle of cooperation to a magazine and run it in the interest of the contributors and that set him to thinking and he thought out his plan of a periodical which should pay authors and artists a low price outright for their work and give them a chance of the profits in the way of a percentage after all it isnt so very different from the chances an author takes when he publishes a book and fulkerson thinks that the novelty of the thing would pique public curiosity if it didnt arouse public sympathy and the long and short of it is isabel that he wants me to help edit it  to edit it his wife caught her breath and she took a little time to realize the fact while she stared hard at her husband to make sure he was not joking  yes he says he owes it all to me that i invented the ideathe germthe microbe  his wife had now realized the fact at least in a degree that excluded trifling with it that is very honorable of mr fulkerson and if he owes it to you it was the least he could do having recognized her husbands claim to the honor done him she began to kindle with a sense of the honor itself and the value of the opportunity its a very high compliment to you basila very high compliment and you could give up this wretched insurance business that youve always hated so and thats making you so unhappy now that you think theyre going to take it from you give it up and take mr fulkersons offer its a perfect interposition coming just at this time why do it mercy she suddenly arrested herself he wouldnt expect you to get along on the possible profits her face expressed the awfulness of the notion  march smiled reassuringly and waited to give himself the pleasure of the sensation he meant to give her if ill make striking phrases for it and edit it too hell give me four thousand dollars  he leaned back in his chair and stuck his hands deep into his pockets and watched his wifes face luminous with the emotions that flashed through her minddoubt joy anxiety  basil you dont mean it why take it take it instantly oh what a thing to happen oh what luck but you deserve it if you first suggested it what an escape what a triumph over all those hateful insurance people oh basil im afraid hell change his mind you ought to have accepted on the spot you might have known i would approve and you could so easily have taken it back if i didnt telegraph him now run right out with the despatchor we can send tom  in these imperatives of mrs marchs there was always much of the conditional she meant that he should do what she said if it were entirely right and she never meant to be considered as having urged him  and suppose his enterprise went wrong her husband suggested  it wont go wrong hasnt he made a success of his syndicate  he says soyes  very well then it stands to reason that hell succeed in this too he wouldnt undertake it if he didnt know it would succeed he must have capital  it will take a great deal to get such a thing going and even if hes got an angel behind him  she caught at the wordan angel  its what the theatrical people call a financial backer he dropped a hint of something of that kind  of course hes got an angel said his wife promptly adopting the word and even if he hadnt still basil i should be willing to have you risk it the risk isnt so great is it we shouldnt be ruined if it failed altogether with our stocks we have two thousand a year anyway and we could pinch through on that till you got into some other business afterward especially if wed saved something out of your salary while it lasted basil i want you to try it i know it will give you a new lease of life to have a congenial occupation march laughed but his wife persisted im all for your trying it basil indeed i am if its an experiment you can give it up  it can give me up too  oh nonsense i guess theres not much fear of that now i want you to telegraph mr fulkerson so that hell find the despatch waiting for him when he gets to new york ill take the whole responsibility basil and ill risk all the consequences     iii  marchs face had sobered more and more as she followed one hopeful burst with another and now it expressed a positive pain but he forced a smile and said theres a little condition attached where did you suppose it was to be published  why in boston of course where else should it be published  she looked at him for the intention of his question so searchingly that he quite gave up the attempt to be gay about it no he said gravely its to be published in new york  she fell back in her chair in new york she leaned forward over the table toward him as if to make sure that she heard aright and said with all the keen reproach that he could have expected in new york basil oh how could you have let me go on  he had a sufficiently rueful face in owning i oughtnt to have done it but i got started wrong i couldnt help putting the best foot forward at firstor as long as the whole thing was in the air i didnt know that you would take so much to the general enterprise or else i should have mentioned the new york condition at once but of course that puts an end to it  oh of course she assented sadly we couldnt go to new york  no i know that he said and with this a perverse desire to tempt her to the impossibility awoke in him though he was really quite cold about the affair himself now fulkerson thought we could get a nice flat in new york for about what the interest and taxes came to here and provisions are cheaper but i should rather not experiment at my time of life if i could have been caught younger i might have been inured to new york but i dont believe i could stand it now  how i hate to have you talk that way basil you are young enough to try anythinganywhere but you know i dont like new york i dont approve of it its so big and so hideous of course i shouldnt mind that but ive always lived in boston and the children were born and have all their friendships and associations here she added with the helplessness that discredited her good sense and did her injustice i have just got them both into the friday afternoon class at papantis and you know how difficult that is  march could not fail to take advantage of an occasion like this well that alone ought to settle it under the circumstances it would be flying in the face of providence to leave boston the mere fact of a brilliant opening like that offered me on the microbe and the halcyon future which fulkerson promises if well come to new york is as dust in the balance against the advantages of the friday afternoon class  basil she appealed solemnly have i ever interfered with your career  i never had any for you to interfere with my dear  basil havent i always had faith in you and dont you suppose that if i thought it would really be for your advancement i would go to new york or anywhere with you  no my dear i dont he teased if it would be for my salvation yes perhaps but not short of that and i should have to prove by a cloud of witnesses that it would i dont blame you i wasnt born in boston but i understand how you feel and really my dear he added without irony i never seriously thought of asking you to go to new york i was dazzled by fulkersons offer ill own that but his choice of me as editor sapped my confidence in him  i dont like to hear you say that basil she entreated  well of course there were mitigating circumstances i could see that fulkerson meant to keep the whiphand himself and that was reassuring and besides if the reciprocity life should happen not to want my services any longer it wouldnt be quite like giving up a certainty though as a matter of business i let fulkerson get that impression i felt rather sneaking to do it but if the worst comes to the worst i can look about for something to do in boston and anyhow people dont starve on two thousand a year though its convenient to have five the fact is im too old to change so radically if you dont like my saying that then you are isabel and so are the children ive no right to take them from the home weve made and to change the whole course of their lives unless i can assure them of something and i cant assure them of anything boston is big enough for us and its certainly prettier than new york i always feel a little proud of hailing from boston my pleasure in the place mounts the farther i get away from it but i do appreciate it my dear ive no more desire to leave it than you have you may be sure that if you dont want to take the children out of the friday afternoon class i dont want to leave my library here and all the ways ive got set in well keep on very likely the company wont supplant me and if it does and watkins gets the place hell give me a subordinate position of some sort cheer up isabel i have put satan and his angel fulkerson behind me and its all right lets go in to the children  he came round the table to isabel where she sat in a growing distraction and lifted her by the waist from her chair  she sighed deeply shall we tell the children about it  no whats the use now  there wouldnt be any she assented when they entered the family room where the boy and girl sat on either side of the lamp working out the lessons for monday which they had left over from the day before she asked children how would you like to live in new york  bella made haste to get in her word first and give up the friday afternoon class she wailed  tom growled from his book without lifting his eyes i shouldnt want to go to columbia they havent got any dormitories and you have to board round anywhere are you going to new york he now deigned to look up at his father  no tom you and bella have decided me against it your perspective shows the affair in its true proportions i had an offer to go to new york but ive refused it     iv  marchs irony fell harmless from the childrens preoccupation with their own affairs but he knew that his wife felt it and this added to the bitterness which prompted it he blamed her for letting her provincial narrowness prevent his accepting fulkersons offer quite as much as if he had otherwise entirely wished to accept it his world like most worlds had been superficially a disappointment he was no richer than at the beginning though in marrying he had given up some tastes some preferences some aspirations in the hope of indulging them later with larger means and larger leisure his wife had not urged him to do it in fact her pride as she said was in his fitness for the life he had renounced but she had acquiesced and they had been very happy together that is to say they made up their quarrels or ignored them  they often accused each other of being selfish and indifferent but she knew that he would always sacrifice himself for her and the children and he on his part with many gibes and mockeries wholly trusted in her they had grown practically tolerant of each others disagreeable traits and the danger that really threatened them was that they should grow too well satisfied with themselves if not with each other they were not sentimental they were rather matteroffact in their motives but they had both a sort of humorous fondness for sentimentality they liked to play with the romantic from the safe vantageground of their real practicality and to divine the poetry of the commonplace their peculiar point of view separated them from most other people with whom their means of selfcomparison were not so good since their marriage as before then they had travelled and seen much of the world and they had formed tastes which they had not always been able to indulge but of which they felt that the possession reflected distinction on them it enabled them to look down upon those who were without such tastes but they were not illnatured and so they did not look down so much with contempt as with amusement in their unfashionable neighborhood they had the fame of being not exclusive precisely but very much wrapped up in themselves and their children  mrs march was reputed to be very cultivated and mr march even more so among the simpler folk around them their house had some good pictures which her aunt had brought home from europe in more affluent days and it abounded in books on which he spent more than he ought they had beautified it in every way and had unconsciously taken credit to them selves for it they felt with a glow almost of virtue how perfectly it fitted their lives and their childrens and they believed that somehow it expressed their charactersthat it was like them they went out very little she remained shut up in its refinement working the good of her own and he went to his business and hurried back to forget it and dream his dream of intellectual achievement in the flattering atmosphere of her sympathy he could not conceal from himself that his divided life was somewhat like charles lambs and there were times when as he had expressed to fulkerson he believed that its division was favorable to the freshness of his interest in literature it certainly kept it a high privilege a sacred refuge now and then he wrote something and got it printed after long delays and when they met on the st lawrence fulkerson had some of marchs verses in his pocketbook which he had cut out of astray newspaper and carried about for years because they pleased his fancy so much they formed an immediate bond of union between the men when their authorship was traced and owned and this gave a pretty color of romance to their acquaintance but for the most part march was satisfied to read he was proud of reading critically and he kept in the current of literary interests and controversies it all seemed to him and to his wife at secondhand very meritorious he could not help contrasting his life and its inner elegance with that of other men who had no such resources he thought that he was not arrogant about it because he did full justice to the good qualities of those other people he congratulated himself upon the democratic instincts which enabled him to do this and neither he nor his wife supposed that they were selfish persons on the contrary they were very sympathetic there was no good cause that they did not wish well they had a generous scorn of all kinds of narrowheartedness if it had ever come into their way to sacrifice themselves for others they thought they would have done so but they never asked why it had not come in their way they were very gentle and kind even when most elusive and they taught their children to loathe all manner of social cruelty march was of so watchful a conscience in some respects that he denied himself the pensive pleasure of lapsing into the melancholy of unfulfilled aspirations but he did not see that if he had abandoned them it had been for what he held dearer generally he felt as if he had turned from them with a high altruistic aim the practical expression of his life was that it was enough to provide well for his family to have cultivated tastes and to gratify them to the extent of his means to be rather distinguished even in the simplification of his desires he believed and his wife believed that if the time ever came when he really wished to make a sacrifice to the fulfilment of the aspirations so long postponed she would be ready to join with heart and hand  when he went to her room from his library where she left him the whole evening with the children he found her before the glass thoughtfully removing the first dismantling pin from her back hair  i cant help feeling she grieved into the mirror that its i who keep you from accepting that offer i know it is i could go west with you or into a new countryanywhere but new york terrifies me i dont like new york i never did it disheartens and distracts me i cant find myself in it i shouldnt know how to shop i know im foolish and narrow and provincial she went on but i could never have any inner quiet in new york i couldnt live in the spirit there i suppose people do it cant be that all these millions  oh not so bad as that march interposed laughing there arent quite two  i thought there were four or five well no matter you see what i am basil im terribly limited i couldnt make my sympathies go round two million people i should be wretched i suppose im standing in the way of your highest interest but i cant help it we took each other for better or worse and you must try to bear with me she broke off and began to cry  stop it shouted march i tell you i never cared anything for fulkersons scheme or entertained it seriously and i shouldnt if hed proposed to carry it out in boston this was not quite true but in the retrospect it seemed sufficiently so for the purposes of argument dont say another word about it the things over now and i dont want to think of it any more we couldnt change its nature if we talked all night but i want you to understand that it isnt your limitations that are in the way its mine i shouldnt have the courage to take such a place i dont think im fit for it and thats the long and short of it  oh you dont know how it hurts me to have you say that basil  the next morning as they sat together at breakfast without the children whom they let lie late on sunday mrs march said to her husband silent over his fishballs and baked beans we will go to new york ive decided it  well it takes two to decide that march retorted we are not going to new york  yes we are ive thought it out now listen  oh im willing to listen he consented airily  youve always wanted to get out of the insurance business and now with that fear of being turned out which you have you mustnt neglect this offer i suppose it has its risks but its a risk keeping on as we are and perhaps you will make a great success of it i do want you to try basil if i could once feel that you had fairly seen what you could do in literature i should die happy  not immediately after i hope he suggested taking the second cup of coffee she had been pouring out for him and boston  we neednt make a complete break we can keep this place for the present anyway we could let it for the winter and come back in the summer next year it would be change enough from new york  fulkerson and i hadnt got as far as to talk of a vacation  no matter the children and i could come and if you didnt like new york or the enterprise failed you could get into something in boston again and we have enough to live on till you did yes basil im going  i can see by the way your chin trembles that nothing could stop you you may go to new york if you wish isabel but i shall stay here  be serious basil im in earnest  serious if i were any more serious i should shed tears come my dear i know what you mean and if i had my heart set on this thingfulkerson always calls it this thing i would cheerfully accept any sacrifice you could make to it but id rather not offer you up on a shrine i dont feel any particular faith in im very comfortable where i am that is i know just where the pinch comes and if it comes harder why ive got used to bearing that kind of pinch im too old to change pinches  now that does decide me  it decides me too  i will take all the responsibility basil she pleaded  oh yes but youll hand it back to me as soon as youve carried your point with it theres nothing mean about you isabel where responsibility is concerned no if i do this thingfulkerson again i cant get away from this thing its ominousi must do it because i want to do it and not because you wish that you wanted me to do it i understand your position isabel and that youre really acting from a generous impulse but theres nothing so precarious at our time of life as a generous impulse when we were younger we could stand it we could give way to it and take the consequences but now we cant bear it we must act from cold reason even in the ardor of selfsacrifice  oh as if you did that his wife retorted  is that any cause why you shouldnt she could not say that it was and he went on triumphantly  no i wont take you away from the only safe place on the planet and plunge you into the most perilous and then have you say in your revulsion of feeling that you were all against it from the first and you gave way because you saw i had my heart set on it he supposed he was treating the matter humorously but in this sort of banter between husband and wife there is always much more than the joking march had seen some pretty feminine inconsistencies and trepidations which once charmed him in his wife hardening into traits of middleage which were very like those of less interesting older women the sight moved him with a kind of pathos but he felt the result hindering and vexatious  she now retorted that if he did not choose to take her at her word be need not but that whatever he did she should have nothing to reproach herself with and at least he could not say that she had trapped him into anything  what do you mean by trapping he demanded  i dont know what you call it she answered but when you get me to commit myself to a thing by leaving out the most essential point i call it trapping  i wonder you stop at trapping if you think i got you to favor fulkersons scheme and then sprung new york on you i dont suppose you do though but i guess we wont talk about it any more  he went out for a long walk and she went to her room they lunched silently together in the presence of their children who knew that they had been quarrelling but were easily indifferent to the fact as children get to be in such cases nature defends their youth and the unhappiness which they behold does not infect them in the evening after the boy and girl had gone to bed the father and mother resumed their talk he would have liked to take it up at the point from which it wandered into hostilities for he felt it lamentable that a matter which so seriously concerned them should be confused in the fumes of senseless anger and he was willing to make a tacit acknowledgment of his own error by recurring to the question but she would not be content with this and he had to concede explicitly to her weakness that she really meant it when she had asked him to accept fulkersons offer he said he knew that and he began soberly to talk over their prospects in the event of their going to new york  oh i see you are going she twitted  im going to stay he answered and let them turn me out of my agency here and in this bitterness their talk ended     v  his wife made no attempt to renew their talk before march went to his business in the morning and they parted in dry offence their experience was that these things always came right of themselves at last and they usually let them he knew that she had really tried to consent to a thing that was repugnant to her and in his heart he gave her more credit for the effort than he had allowed her openly she knew that she had made it with the reservation he accused her of and that he had a right to feel sore at what she could not help but he left her to brood over his ingratitude and she suffered him to go heavy and unfriended to meet the chances of the day he said to himself that if she had assented cordially to the conditions of fulkersons offer he would have had the courage to take all the other risks himself and would have had the satisfaction of resigning his place as it was he must wait till he was removed and he figured with bitter pleasure the pain she would feel when he came home some day and told her he had been supplanted after it was too late to close with fulkerson  he found a letter on his desk from the secretary dictated in typewriting which briefly informed him that mr hubbell the inspector of agencies would be in boston on wednesday and would call at his office during the forenoon the letter was not different in tone from many that he had formerly received but the visit announced was out of the usual order and march believed he read his fate in it during the eighteen years of his connection with itfirst as a subordinate in the boston office and finally as its general agent therehe had seen a good many changes in the reciprocity presidents vicepresidents actuaries and general agents had come and gone but there had always seemed to be a recognition of his efficiency or at least sufficiency and there had never been any manner of trouble no question of accounts no apparent dissatisfaction with his management until latterly when there had begun to come from headquarters some suggestions of enterprise in certain ways which gave him his first suspicions of his clerk watkinss willingness to succeed him they embodied some of watkinss ideas the things proposed seemed to march undignified and even vulgar he had never thought himself wanting in energy though probably he had left the business to take its own course in the old lines more than he realized things had always gone so smoothly that he had sometimes fancied a peculiar regard for him in the management which he had the weakness to attribute to an appreciation of what he occasionally did in literature though in saner moments he felt how impossible this was beyond a reference from mr hubbell to some piece of marchs which had happened to meet his eye no one in the management ever gave a sign of consciousness that their service was adorned by an obscure literary man and mr hubbell himself had the effect of regarding the excursions of marchs pen as a sort of joke and of winking at them as he might have winked if once in a way he had found him a little the gayer for dining  march wore through the day gloomily but he had it on his conscience not to show any resentment toward watkins whom he suspected of wishing to supplant him and even of working to do so through this selfdenial he reached a better mind concerning his wife he determined not to make her suffer needlessly if the worst came to the worst she would suffer enough at the best and till the worst came he would spare her and not say anything about the letter he had got  but when they met her first glance divined that something had happened and her first question frustrated his generous intention he had to tell her about the letter she would not allow that it had any significance but she wished him to make an end of his anxieties and forestall whatever it might portend by resigning his place at once she said she was quite ready to go to new york she had been thinking it all over and now she really wanted to go he answered soberly that he had thought it over too and he did not wish to leave boston where he had lived so long or try a new way of life if he could help it he insisted that he was quite selfish in this in their concessions their quarrel vanished they agreed that whatever happened would be for the best and the next day he went to his office fortified for any event  his destiny if tragical presented itself with an aspect which he might have found comic if it had been anothers destiny mr hubbell brought marchs removal softened in the guise of a promotion the management at new york it appeared had acted upon a suggestion of mr hubbells and now authorized him to offer march the editorship of the monthly paper published in the interest of the company his office would include the authorship of circulars and leaflets in behalf of lifeinsurance and would give play to the literary talent which mr hubbell had brought to the attention of the management his salary would be nearly as much as at present but the work would not take his whole time and in a place like new york he could get a great deal of outside writing which they would not object to his doing  mr hubbell seemed so sure of his acceptance of a place in every way congenial to a man of literary tastes that march was afterward sorry he dismissed the proposition with obvious irony and had needlessly hurt hubbells feelings but mrs march had no such regrets she was only afraid that he had not made his rejection contemptuous enough and now she said telegraph mr fulkerson and we will go at once  i suppose i could still get watkinss former place march suggested  never she retorted telegraph instantly  they were only afraid now that fulkerson might have changed his mind and they had a wretched day in which they heard nothing from him it ended with his answering marchs telegram in person they were so glad of his coming and so touched by his satisfaction with his bargain that they laid all the facts of the case before him he entered fully into marchs sense of the joke latent in mr hubbells proposition and he tried to make mrs march believe that he shared her resentment of the indignity offered her husband  march made a show of willingness to release him in view of the changed situation saying that he held him to nothing fulkerson laughed and asked him how soon he thought he could come on to new york he refused to reopen the question of marchs fitness with him he said they had gone into that thoroughly but he recurred to it with mrs march and confirmed her belief in his good sense on all points she had been from the first moment defiantly confident of her husbands ability but till she had talked the matter over with fulkerson she was secretly not sure of it or at least she was not sure that march was not right in distrusting himself when she clearly understood now what fulkerson intended she had no longer a doubt he explained how the enterprise differed from others and how he needed for its direction a man who combined general business experience and business ideas with a love for the thing and a natural aptness for it he did not want a young man and yet he wanted youthits freshness its zestsuch as march would feel in a thing he could put his whole heart into he would not run in ruts like an old fellow who had got hackneyed he would not have any hobbies he would not have any friends or any enemies besides he would have to meet people and march was a man that people took to she knew that herself he had a kind of charm the editorial management was going to be kept in the background as far as the public was concerned the public was to suppose that the thing ran itself fulkerson did not care for a great literary reputation in his editorhe implied that march had a very pretty little one at the same time the relations between the contributors and the management were to be much more intimate than usual fulkerson felt his personal disqualification for working the thing socially and he counted upon mr march for that that was to say he counted upon mrs march  she protested he must not count upon her but it by no means disabled fulkersons judgment in her view that march really seemed more than anything else a fancy of his he had been a fancy of hers and the sort of affectionate respect with which fulkerson spoke of him laid forever some doubt she had of the fineness of fulkersons manners and reconciled her to the graphic slanginess of his speech  the affair was now irretrievable but she gave her approval to it as superbly as if it were submitted in its inception only mr fulkerson must not suppose she should ever like new york she would not deceive him on that point she never should like it she did not conceal either that she did not like taking the children out of the friday afternoon class and she did not believe that tom would ever be reconciled to going to columbia she took courage from fulkersons suggestion that it was possible for tom to come to harvard even from new york and she heaped him with questions concerning the domiciliation of the family in that city he tried to know something about the matter and he succeeded in seeming interested in points necessarily indifferent to him     vi  in the uprooting and transplanting of their home that followed mrs march often trembled before distant problems and possible contingencies but she was never troubled by present difficulties she kept up with tireless energy and in the moments of dejection and misgiving which harassed her husband she remained dauntless and put heart into him when he had lost it altogether  she arranged to leave the children in the house with the servants while she went on with march to look up a dwelling of some sort in new york it made him sick to think of it and when it came to the point he would rather have given up the whole enterprise she had to nerve him to it to represent more than once that now they had no choice but to make this experiment every detail of parting was anguish to him he got consolation out of the notion of letting the house furnished for the winter that implied their return to it but it cost him pangs of the keenest misery to advertise it and when a tenant was actually found it was all he could do to give him the lease he tried his wifes love and patience as a man must to whom the future is easy in the mass but terrible as it translates itself piecemeal into the present he experienced remorse in the presence of inanimate things he was going to leave as if they had sensibly reproached him and an anticipative homesickness that seemed to stop his heart again and again his wife had to make him reflect that his depression was not prophetic she convinced him of what he already knew and persuaded him against his knowledge that he could be keeping an eye out for something to take hold of in boston if they could not stand new york she ended by telling him that it was too bad to make her comfort him in a trial that was really so much more a trial to her she had to support him in a last access of despair on their way to the albany depot the morning they started to new york but when the final details had been dealt with the tickets bought the trunks checked and the handbags hung up in their car and the future had massed itself again at a safe distance and was seven hours and two hundred miles away his spirits began to rise and hers to sink he would have been willing to celebrate the taste the domestic refinement of the ladies waitingroom in the depot where they had spent a quarter of an hour before the train started he said he did not believe there was another station in the world where mahogany rockingchairs were provided that the dullred warmth of the walls was as cozy as an evening lamp and that he always hoped to see a fire kindled on that vast hearth and under that aesthetic mantel but he supposed now he never should he said it was all very different from that tunnel the old albany depot where they had waited the morning they went to new york when they were starting on their wedding journey  the morning basil cried his wife we went at night and we were going to take the boat but it stormed so she gave him a glance of such reproach that he could not answer anything and now she asked him whether he supposed their cook and second girl would be contented with one of those dark holes where they put girls to sleep in new york flats and what she should do if margaret especially left her he ventured to suggest that margaret would probably like the city but if she left there were plenty of other girls to be had in new york she replied that there were none she could trust and that she knew margaret would not stay he asked her why she took her thenwhy she did not give her up at once and she answered that it would be inhuman to give her up just in the edge of the winter she had promised to keep her and margaret was pleased with the notion of going to new york where she had a cousin  then perhaps shell be pleased with the notion of staying he said  oh much you know about it she retorted and in view of the hypothetical difficulty and his want of sympathy she fell into a gloom from which she roused herself at last by declaring that if there was nothing else in the flat they took there should be a light kitchen and a bright sunny bedroom for margaret he expressed the belief that they could easily find such a flat as that and she denounced his fatal optimism which buoyed him up in the absence of an undertaking and let him drop into the depths of despair in its presence  he owned this defect of temperament but he said that it compensated the opposite in her character i suppose thats one of the chief uses of marriage people supplement one another and form a pretty fair sort of human being together the only drawback to the theory is that unmarried people seem each as complete and whole as a married pair  she refused to be amused she turned her face to the window and put her handkerchief up under her veil  it was not till the diningcar was attached to their train that they were both able to escape for an hour into the carefree mood of their earlier travels when they were so easily taken out of themselves the time had been when they could have found enough in the conjectural fortunes and characters of their fellowpassengers to occupy them this phase of their youth had lasted long and the world was still full of novelty and interest for them but it required all the charm of the diningcar now to lay the anxieties that beset them it was so potent for the moment however that they could take an objective view at their sitting cozily down there together as if they had only themselves in the world they wondered what the children were doing the children who possessed them so intensely when present and now by a fantastic operation of absence seemed almost nonexistents they tried to be homesick for them but failed they recognized with comfortable selfabhorrence that this was terrible but owned a fascination in being alone at the same time they could not imagine how people felt who never had any children they contrasted the luxury of dining that way with every advantage except a band of music and the old way of rushing out to snatch a fearful joy at the lunchcounters of the worcesier and springfield and new haven stations they had not gone often to new york since their wedding journey but they had gone often enough to have noted the change from the lunchcounter to the lunchbasket brought in the train from which you could subsist with more ease and dignity but seemed destined to a superabundance of pickles whatever you ordered  they thought well of themselves now that they could be both critical and tolerant of flavors not very sharply distinguished from one another in their dinner and they lingered over their coffee and watched the autumn landscape through the windows  not quite so loud a pattern of calico this year he said with patronizing forbearance toward the painted woodlands whirling by do you see how the foreground next the train rushes from us and the background keeps ahead of us while the middle distance seems stationary i dont think i ever noticed that effect before there ought to be something literary in it retreating past and advancing future and deceitfully permanent presentsomething like that  his wife brushed some crumbs from her lap before rising yes you mustnt waste any of these ideas now  oh no it would be money out of fulkersons pocket     vii  they went to a quiet hotel far downtown and took a small apartment which they thought they could easily afford for the day or two they need spend in looking up a furnished flat they were used to staying at this hotel when they came on for a little outing in new york after some rigid winter in boston at the time of the spring exhibitions they were remembered there from year to year the colored callboys who never seemed to get any older smiled upon them and the clerk called march by name even before he registered he asked if mrs march were with him and said then he supposed they would want their usual quarters and in a moment they were domesticated in a far interior that seemed to have been waiting for them in a clean quiet patient disoccupation ever since they left it two years before the little parlor with its gilt paper and ebonized furniture was the lightest of the rooms but it was not very light at noonday without the gas which the bellboy now flared up for them the uproar of the city came to it in a soothing murmur and they took possession of its peace and comfort with open celebration after all they agreed there was no place in the world so delightful as a hotel apartment like that the boasted charms of home were nothing to it and then the magic of its being always there ready for any one every one just as if it were for some one alone it was like the experience of an arabian nights hero come true for all the race  oh why cant we always stay here just we two mrs march sighed to her husband as he came out of his room rubbing his face red with the towel while she studied a new arrangement of her bonnet and handbag on the mantel  and ignore the past im willing ive no doubt that the children could get on perfectly well without us and could find some lot in the scheme of providence that would really be just as well for them  yes or could contrive somehow never to have existed i should insist upon that if they are dont you see that we couldnt wish them not to be  oh yes i see your point its simply incontrovertible  she laughed and said well at any rate if we cant find a flat to suit us we can all crowd into these three rooms somehow for the winter and then browse about for meals by the week we could get them much cheaper and we could save on the eating as they do in europe or on something else  something else probably said march but we wont take this apartment till the ideal furnished flat winks out altogether we shall not have any trouble we can easily find some one who is going south for the winter and will be glad to give up their flat to the right party at a nominal rent thats my notion thats what the evanses did one winter when they came on here in february all but the nominality of the rent  yes and we could pay a very good rent and still save something on letting our house you can settle yourselves in a hundred different ways in new york that is one merit of the place but if everything else fails we can come back to this i want you to take the refusal of it basil and well commence looking this very evening as soon as weve had dinner i cut a lot of things out of the herald as we came on see here  she took a long strip of paper out of her handbag with minute advertisements pinned transversely upon it and forming the effect of some glittering nondescript vertebrate  looks something like the seaserpent said march drying his hands on the towel while he glanced up and down the list but we shant have any trouble ive no doubt there are half a dozen things there that will do you havent gone uptown because we must be near the every other week office  no but i wish mr fulkerson hadnt called it that it always makes one think of jam yesterday and jam tomorrow but never jam today in through the lookingglass theyre all in this region  they were still at their table beside a low window where some sort of neverblooming shrub symmetrically balanced itself in a large pot with a leaf to the right and a leaf to the left and a spear up the middle when fulkerson came stepping squarefootedly over the thick diningroom carpet he wagged in the air a gay hand of salutation at sight of them and of repression when they offered to rise to meet him then with an apparent simultaneity of action he gave a hand to each pulled up a chair from the next table put his hat and stick on the floor beside it and seated himself  well youve burned your ships behind you sure enough he said beaming his satisfaction upon them from eyes and teeth  the ships are burned said march though im not sure we alone did it but here we are looking for shelter and a little anxious about the disposition of the natives  oh theyre an awful peaceable lot said fulkerson ive been round among the caciques a little and i think ive got two or three places that will just suit you mrs march how did you leave the children  oh how kind of you very well and very proud to be left in charge of the smoking wrecks  fulkerson naturally paid no attention to what she said being but secondarily interested in the children at the best here are some things right in this neighborhood within gunshot of the office and if you want you can go and look at them tonight the agents gave me houses where the people would be in  we will go and look at them instantly said mrs march or as soon as youve had coffee with us  never do fulkerson replied he gathered up his hat and stick just rushed in to say hello and got to run right away again i tell you march things are humming im after those fellows with a sharp stick all the while to keep them from loafing on my house and at the same time im just bubbling over with ideas about the lone handwish we could call it thatthat i want to talk up with you  well come to breakfast said mrs march cordially  no the ideas will keep till youve secured your lodge in this vast wilderness goodbye  youre as nice as you can be mr fulkerson she said to keep us in mind when you have so much to occupy you  i wouldnt have anything to occupy me if i hadnt kept you in mind mrs march said fulkerson going off upon as good a speech as he could apparently hope to make  why basil said mrs march when he was gone hes charming but now we mustnt lose an instant lets see where the places are she ran over the halfdozen agents permits capitalfirstratethe very thingevery one well i consider ourselves settled we can go back to the children tomorrow if we like though i rather think i should like to stay over another day and get a little rested for the final pulling up thats got to come but this simplifies everything enormously and mr fulkerson is as thoughtful and as sweet as he can be i know you will get on well with him he has such a good heart and his attitude toward you basil is beautiful alwaysso respectful or not that so much as appreciative yes appreciativethats the word i must always keep that in mind  its quite important to do so said march  yes she assented seriously and we must not forget just what kind of flat we are going to look for the sine qua nons are an elevator and steam heat not above the third floor to begin with then we must each have a room and you must have your study and i must have my parlor and the two girls must each have a room with the kitchen and dining room how many does that make  ten  i thought eight well no matter you can work in the parlor and run into your bedroom when anybody comes and i can sit in mine and the girls must put up with one if its large and sunny though ive always given them two at home and the kitchen must be sunny so they can sit in it and the rooms must all have outside light and the rent must not be over eight hundred for the winter we only get a thousand for our whole house and we must save something out of that so as to cover the expenses of moving now do you think you can remember all that  not the half of it said march but you can or if you forget a third of it i can come in with my partial half and more than make it up  she had brought her bonnet and sacque downstairs with her and was transferring them from the hatrack to her person while she talked the friendly doorboy let them into the street and the clear october evening air brightened her so that as she tucked her hand under her husbands arm and began to pull him along she said if we find something right awayand were just as likely to get the right flat soon as late its all a lotterywell go to the theatre somewhere  she had a moments panic about having left the agents permits on the table and after remembering that she had put them into her little shoppingbag where she kept her money each note crushed into a round wad and had heft it on the hatrack where it would certainly be stolen she found it on her wrist she did not think that very funny but after a first impulse to inculpate her husband she let him laugh while they stopped under a lamp and she held the permits half a yard away to read the numbers on them  where are your glasses isabel  on the mantel in our room of course  then you ought to have brought a pair of tongs  i wouldnt get off secondhand jokes basil she said and why here she cried whirling round to the door before which they had halted this is the very number well i do believe its a sign  one of those colored men who soften the trade of janitor in many of the smaller apartmenthouses in new york by the sweetness of their race let the marches in or rather welcomed them to the possession of the premises by the bow with which he acknowledged their permit it was a large old mansion cut up into five or six dwellings but it had kept some traits of its former dignity which pleased people of their sympathetic tastes the darkmahogany trim of sufficiently ugly design gave a rich gloom to the hallway which was wide and paved with marble the carpeted stairs curved aloft through a generous space  there is no elevator mrs march asked of the janitor  he answered no maam only two flights up so winningly that she said  oh in courteous apology and whispered to her husband as she followed lightly up well take it basil if its like the rest  if its like him you mean  i dont wonder they wanted to own them she hurriedly philosophized if i had such a creature nothing but death should part us and i should no more think of giving him his freedom  no we couldnt afford it returned her husband  the apartment which the janitor unlocked for them and lit up from those chandeliers and brackets of gilt brass in the form of vine bunches leaves and tendrils in which the early gasfitter realized most of his conceptions of beauty had rather more of the ugliness than the dignity of the hall but the rooms were large and they grouped themselves in a reminiscence of the time when they were part of a dwelling that had its charm its pathos its impressiveness where they were cut up into smaller spaces it had been done with the frankness with which a proud old family of fallen fortunes practises its economies the rough pinefloors showed a black border of tackheads where carpets had been lifted and put down for generations the white paint was yellow with age the apartment had light at the front and at the back and two or three rooms had glimpses of the day through small windows let into their corners another one seemed lifting an appealing eye to heaven through a glass circle in its ceiling the rest must darkle in perpetual twilight yet something pleased in it all and mrs march had gone far to adapt the different rooms to the members of her family when she suddenly thought and for her to think was to say why but theres no steam heat  no maam the janitor admitted but deres grates in most o de rooms and deres furnace heat in de halls  thats true she admitted and having placed her family in the apartments it was hard to get them out again could we manage she referred to her husband  why i shouldnt care for the steam heat ifwhat is the rent he broke off to ask the janitor  nine hundred sir  march concluded to his wife if it were furnished  why of course what could i have been thinking of were looking for a furnished flat she explained to the janitor and this was so pleasant and homelike that i never thought whether it was furnished or not  she smiled upon the janitor and he entered into the joke and chuckled so amiably at her flattering oversight on the way downstairs that she said as she pinched her husbands arm now if you dont give him a quarter ill never speak to you again basil  i would have given half a dollar willingly to get you beyond his glamour said march when they were safely on the pavement outside if it hadnt been for my strength of character youd have taken an unfurnished flat without heat and with no elevator at nine hundred a year when you had just sworn me to steam heat an elevator furniture and eight hundred  yes how could i have lost my head so completely she said with a lenient amusement in her aberration which she was not always able to feel in her husbands  the next time a colored janitor opens the door to us ill tell him the apartment doesnt suit at the threshold its the only way to manage you isabel  its true i am in love with the whole race i never saw one of them that didnt have perfectly angelic manners i think we shall all be black in heaventhat is blacksouled  that isnt the usual theory said march  well perhaps not she assented where are we going now oh yes to the xenophon  she pulled him gayly along again and after they had walked a block down and half a block over they stood before the apartmenthouse of that name which was cut on the gaslamps on either side of the heavily spiked aesthetichinged black door the titter of an electricbell brought a large fat buttons with a stage effect of being dressed to look small who said he would call the janitor and they waited in the dimly splendid coppercolored interior admiring the whorls and waves into which the wallpaint was combed till the janitor came in his goldbanded cap like a continental porker when they said they would like to see mrs grosvenor greens apartment he owned his inability to cope with the affair and said he must send for the superintendent he was either in the herodotus or the thucydides and would be there in a minute the buttons brought hima yankee of browbeating presence in plain clothesalmost before they had time to exchange a frightened whisper in recognition of the fact that there could be no doubt of the steam heat and elevator in this case half stifled in the one they mounted in the other eight stories while they tried to keep their selfrespect under the gaze of the superintendent which they felt was classing and assessing them with unfriendly accuracy they could not and they faltered abashed at the threshold of mrs grosvenor greens apartment while the superintendent lit the gas in the gangway that he called a private hall and in the drawingroom and the succession of chambers stretching rearward to the kitchen everything had been done by the architect to save space and everything to waste it by mrs grosvenor green she had conformed to a law for the necessity of turning round in each room and had foldingbeds in the chambers but there her subordination had ended and wherever you might have turned round she had put a gimcrack so that you would knock it over if you did turn the place was rather pretty and even imposing at first glance and it took several joint ballots for march and his wife to make sure that with the kitchen there were only six rooms at every door hung a portiere from large rings on a brass rod every shelf and dressingcase and mantel was littered with gimcracks and the corners of the tiny rooms were curtained off and behind these portieres swarmed more gimcracks the front of the upright piano had what march called a shortskirted portiere on it and the top was covered with vases with dragon candlesticks and with jap fans which also expanded themselves bat wise on the walls between the etchings and the water colors the floors were covered with filling and then rugs and then skins the easychairs all had tidies armenian and turkish and persian the lounges and sofas had embroidered cushions hidden under tidies  the radiator was concealed by a jap screen and over the top of this some arab scarfs were flung there was a superabundance of clocks china pugs guarded the hearth a brass sunflower smiled from the top of either andiron and a brass peacock spread its tail before them inside a high filigree fender on one side was a coalhod in repousse brass and on the other a wrought iron woodbasket some red japanese birdkites were stuck about in the necks of spelter vases a crimson jap umbrella hung opened beneath the chandelier and each globe had a shade of yellow silk  march when he had recovered his selfcommand a little in the presence of the agglomeration comforted himself by calling the bricabrac jamescracks as if this was their full name  the disrespect he was able to show the whole apartment by means of this joke strengthened him to say boldly to the superintendent that it was altogether too small then he asked carelessly what the rent was  two hundred and fifty  the marches gave a start and looked at each other  dont you think we could make it do she asked him and he could see that she had mentally saved five hundred dollars as the difference between the rent of their house and that of this flat it has some very pretty features and we could manage to squeeze in couldnt we  you wont find another furnished flat like it for no twofifty a month in the whole city the superintendent put in  they exchanged glances again and march said carelessly its too small  theres a vacant flat in the herodotus for eighteen hundred a year and one in the thucydides for fifteen the superintendent suggested clicking his keys together as they sank down in the elevator seven rooms and bath  thank you said march were looking for a furnished flat  they felt that the superintendent parted from them with repressed sarcasm  oh basil do you think we really made him think it was the smallness and not the dearness  no but we saved our selfrespect in the attempt and thats a great deal  of course i wouldnt have taken it anyway with only six rooms and so high up but what prices now we must be very circumspect about the next place  it was a janitress large fat with her arms wound up in her apron who received them there mrs march gave her a succinct but perfect statement of their needs she failed to grasp the nature of them or feigned to do so she shook her head and said that her son would show them the flat there was a radiator visible in the narrow hall and isabel tacitly compromised on steam heat without an elevator as the flat was only one flight up when the son appeared from below with a small kerosene handlamp it appeared that the flat was unfurnished but there was no stopping him till he had shown it in all its impossibility when they got safely away from it and into the street march said well have you had enough for tonight isabel shall we go to the theatre now  not on any account i want to see the whole list of flats that mr fulkerson thought would be the very thing for us she laughed but with a certain bitterness  youll be calling him my mr fulkerson next isabel  oh no  the fourth address was a furnished flat without a kitchen in a house with a general restaurant the fifth was a furnished house at the sixth a pathetic widow and her pretty daughter wanted to take a family to board and would give them a private table at a rate which the marches would have thought low in boston  mrs march came away tingling with compassion for their evident anxiety and this pity naturally soured into a sense of injury well i must say i have completely lost confidence in mr fulkersons judgment anything more utterly different from what i told him we wanted i couldnt imagine if he doesnt manage any better about his business than he has done about this it will be a perfect failure  well well lets hope hell be more circumspect about that her husband returned with ironical propitiation but i dont think its fulkersons fault altogether perhaps its the houseagents theyre a very illusory generation there seems to be something in the human habitation that corrupts the natures of those who deal in it to buy or sell it to hire or let it you go to an agent and tell him what kind of a house you want he has no such house and he sends you to look at something altogether different upon the wellascertained principle that if you cant get what you want you will take what you can get you dont suppose the party that took our house in boston was looking for any such house he was looking for a totally different kind of house in another part of the town  i dont believe that his wife broke in  well no matter but see what a scandalous rent you asked for it  we didnt get much more than half and besides the agent told me to ask fourteen hundred  oh im not blaming you isabel im only analyzing the houseagent and exonerating fulkerson  well i dont believe he told them just what we wanted and at any rate im done with agents tomorrow im going entirely by advertisements     viii  mrs march took the vertebrate with her to the vienna coffeehouse where they went to breakfast next morning she made march buy her the herald and the world and she added to its spiny convolutions from them she read the new advertisements aloud with ardor and with faith to believe that the apartments described in them were every one truthfully represented and that any one of them was richly responsive to their needs elegant light large single and outside flats were offered with all improvementsbath icebox etcfor twentyfive to thirty dollars a month the cheapness was amazing the wagram the esmeralda the jacinth advertised them for forty dollars and sixty dollars with steam heat and elevator rent free till november others attractive from their air of conscientious scruple announced firstclass flats good order reasonable rents the helena asked the reader if she had seen the cabinet finish hardwood floors and frescoed ceilings of its fiftydollar flats the asteroid affirmed that such apartments with six light rooms and bath porcelain washtubs electric bells and hallboy as it offered for seventyfive dollars were unapproached by competition there was a sameness in the jargon which tended to confusion mrs march got several flats on her list which promised neither steam heat nor elevators she forgot herself so far as to include two or three as remote from the downtown region of her choice as harlem but after she had rejected these the nondescript vertebrate was still voluminous enough to sustain her buoyant hopes  the waiter who remembered them from year to year had put them at a window giving a pretty good section of broadway and before they set out on their search they had a moment of reminiscence they recalled the broadway of five of ten of twenty years ago swelling and roaring with a tide of gayly painted omnibuses and of picturesque traffic that the horsecars have now banished from it the grind of their wheels and the clash of their harsh bells imperfectly fill the silence that the omnibuses have left and the eye misses the tumultuous perspective of former times  they went out and stood for a moment before grace church and looked down the stately thoroughfare and found it no longer impressive no longer characteristic it is still broadway in name but now it is like any other street you do not now take your life in your hand when you attempt to cross it the broadway policeman who supported the elbow of timorous beauty in the hollow of his cottongloved palm and guided its little fearful boots over the crossing while he arrested the billowy omnibuses on either side with an imperious glance is gone and all that certain processional barbaric gayety of the place is gone  palmyra baalbec timour of the desert said march voicing their common feeling of the change  they turned and went into the beautiful church and found themselves in time for the matin service rapt far from new york if not from earth in the dim richness of the painted light the hallowed music took them with solemn ecstasy the aerial aspiring gothic forms seemed to lift them heavenward they came out reluctant into the dazzle and bustle of the street with a feeling that they were too good for it which they confessed to each other with whimsical consciousness  but no matter how consecrated we feel now he said we mustnt forget that we went into the church for precisely the same reason that we went to the vienna cafe for breakfastto gratify an aesthetic sense to renew the faded pleasure of travel for a moment to get back into the europe of our youth it was a purely pagan impulse isabel and wed better own it  i dont know she returned i think we reduce ourselves to the bare bones too much i wish we didnt always recognize the facts as we do sometimes i should like to blink them i should like to think i was devouter than i am and younger and prettier  better not you couldnt keep it up honesty is the best policy even in such things  no i dont like it basil i should rather wait till the last day for some of my motives to come to the top i know theyre always mixed but do let me give them the benefit of a doubt sometimes  well well have it your own way my dear but i prefer not to lay up so many disagreeable surprises for myself at that time  she would not consent i know i am a good deal younger than i was i feel quite in the mood of that morning when we walked down broadway on our wedding journey dont you  oh yes but i know im not younger im only prettier  she laughed for pleasure in his joke and also for unconscious joy in the gay new york weather in which there was no arriere pensee of the east wind they had crossed broadway and were walking over to washington square in the region of which they now hoped to place themselves the primo tenore statue of garibaldi had already taken possession of the place in the name of latin progress and they met italian faces french faces spanish faces as they strolled over the asphalt walks under the thinning shadows of the autumnstricken sycamores they met the familiar picturesque raggedness of southern europe with the old kindly illusion that somehow it existed for their appreciation and that it found adequate compensation for poverty in this march thought he sufficiently expressed his tacit sympathy in sitting down on one of the iron benches with his wife and letting a little neapolitan put a superfluous shine on his boots while their desultory comment wandered with equal esteem to the oldfashioned american respectability which keeps the north side of the square in vast mansions of red brick and the international shabbiness which has invaded the southern border and broken it up into lodginghouses shops beergardens and studios  they noticed the sign of an apartment to let on the north side and as soon as the little bootblack could be bought off they went over to look at it the janitor met them at the door and examined them then he said as if still in doubt it has ten rooms and the rent is twentyeight hundred dollars  it wouldnt do then march replied and left him to divide the responsibility between the paucity of the rooms and the enormity of the rent as he best might but their selflove had received a wound and they questioned each other what it was in their appearance made him doubt their ability to pay so much  of course we dont look like newyorkers sighed mrs march and weve walked through the square that might be as if we had walked along the park street mall in the common before we came out on beacon do you suppose he could have seen you getting your boots blacked in that way  its useless to ask said march but i never can recover from this blow  oh pshaw you know you hate such things as badly as i do it was very impertinent of him  let us go back and ecraser linfame by paying him a years rent in advance and taking immediate possession nothing else can soothe my wounded feelings you were not having your boots blacked why shouldnt he have supposed you were a newyorker and i a country cousin  they always know dont you remember mrs williamss going to a fifth avenue milliner in a worth dress and the womans asking her instantly what hotel she should send her hat to  yes these things drive one to despair i dont wonder the bodies of so many genteel strangers are found in the waters around new york shall we try the south side my dear or had we better go back to our rooms and rest awhile  mrs march had out the vertebrate and was consulting one of its glittering ribs and glancing up from it at a house before which they stood yes its the number but do they call this being ready october first the little area in front of the basement was heaped with a mixture of mortar bricks laths and shavings from the interior the brownstone steps to the front door were similarly bestrewn the doorway showed the halfopen rough pine carpenters sketch of an unfinished house the sashless windows of every story showed the activity of workmen within the clatter of hammers and the hiss of saws came out to them from every opening  they may call it october first said march because its too late to contradict them but theyd better not call it december first in my presence ill let them say january first at a pinch  we will go in and look at it anyway said his wife and he admired how when she was once within she began provisionally to settle the family in each of the several floors with the female instinct for domiciliation which never failed her she had the help of the landlord who was present to urge forward the workmen apparently he lent a hopeful fancy to the solution of all her questions to get her from under his influence march had to represent that the place was damp from undried plastering and that if she stayed she would probably be down with that new york pneumonia which visiting bostonians are always dying of once safely on the pavement outside she realized that the apartment was not only unfinished but unfurnished and had neither steam heat nor elevator but i thought we had better look at everything she explained  yes but not take everything if i hadnt pulled you away from there by main force youd have not only died of new york pneumonia on the spot but youd have had us all settled there before we knew what we were about  well thats what i cant help basil its the only way i can realize whether it will do for us i have to dramatize the whole thing  she got a deal of pleasure as well as excitement out of this and he had to own that the process of setting up housekeeping in so many different places was not only entertaining but tended through association with their first beginnings in housekeeping to restore the image of their early married days and to make them young again  it went on all day and continued far into the night until it was too late to go to the theatre too late to do anything but tumble into bed and simultaneously fall asleep they groaned over their reiterated disappointments but they could not deny that the interest was unfailing and that they got a great deal of fun out of it all nothing could abate mrs marchs faith in her advertisements one of them sent her to a flat of ten rooms which promised to be the solution of all their difficulties it proved to be over a liverystable a liquor store and a milliners shop none of the first fashion another led them far into old greenwich village to an apartmenthouse which she refused to enter behind a small girl with a loaf of bread under one arm and a quart can of milk under the other  in their search they were obliged as march complained to the acquisition of useless information in a degree unequalled in their experience they came to excel in the sad knowledge of the line at which respectability distinguishes itself from shabbiness flattering advertisements took them to numbers of huge apartmenthouses chiefly distinguishable from tenementhouses by the absence of fireescapes on their facades till mrs march refused to stop at any door where there were more than six bellratchets and speakingtubes on either hand before the middle of the afternoon she decided against ratchets altogether and confined herself to knobs neatly set in the doortrim her husband was still sunk in the superstition that you can live anywhere you like in new york and he would have paused at some places where her quicker eye caught the fatal sign of modes in the groundfloor windows she found that there was an east and west line beyond which they could not go if they wished to keep their selfrespect and that within the region to which they had restricted themselves there was a choice of streets at first all the new york streets looked to them illpaved dirty and repulsive the general infamy imparted itself in their casual impression to streets in no wise guilty but they began to notice that some streets were quiet and clean and though never so quiet and clean as boston streets that they wore an air of encouraging reform and suggested a future of greater and greater domesticity whole blocks of these downtown crossstreets seemed to have been redeemed from decay and even in the midst of squalor a dwelling here and there had been seized painted a dull red as to its brickwork and a glossy black as to its woodwork and with a bright brass bellpull and doorknob and a large brass plate for its keyhole escutcheon had been endowed with an effect of purity and pride which removed its shabby neighborhood far from it some of these houses were quite small and imaginably within their means but as march said some body seemed always to be living there himself and the fact that none of them was to rent kept mrs march true to her ideal of a fiat nothing prevented its realization so much as its difference from the new york ideal of a flat which was inflexibly seven rooms and a bath one or two rooms might be at the front the rest crooked and cornered backward through in creasing and then decreasing darkness till they reached a light bedroom or kitchen at the rear it might be the one or the other but it was always the seventh room with the bath or if as sometimes happened it was the eighth it was so after having counted the bath as one in this case the janitor said you always counted the bath as one if the flats were advertised as having all light rooms he explained that any room with a window giving into the open air of a court or shaft was counted a light room  the marches tried to make out why it was that these flats were go much more repulsive than the apartments which everyone lived in abroad but they could only do so upon the supposition that in their european days they were too young too happy too full of the future to notice whether rooms were inside or outside light or dark big or little high or low now were imprisoned in the present he said and we have to make the worst of it  in their despair he had an inspiration which she declared worthy of him it was to take two small flats of four or five rooms and a bath and live in both they tried this in a great many places but they never could get two flats of the kind on the same floor where there was steam heat and an elevator at one place they almost did it they had resigned themselves to the humility of the neighborhood to the prevalence of modistes and liverystablemen they seem to consort much in new york to the garbage in the gutters and the litter of paper in the streets to the faltering slats in the surrounding windowshutters and the crumbled brownstone steps and sills when it turned out that one of the apartments had been taken between two visits they made then the only combination left open to them was of a groundfloor flat to the right and a thirdfloor flat to the left  still they kept this inspiration in reserve for use at the first opportunity in the mean time there were several flats which they thought they could almost make do notably one where they could get an extra servants room in the basement four flights down and another where they could get it in the roof five flights up at the first the janitor was respectful and enthusiastic at the second he had an effect of ironical pessimism when they trembled on the verge of taking his apartment he pointed out a spot in the kalsomining of the parlor ceiling and gratuitously said now such a thing as that he should not agree to put in shape unless they took the apartment for a term of years the apartment was unfurnished and they recurred to the fact that they wanted a furnished apartment and made their escape this saved them in several other extremities but short of extremity they could not keep their different requirements in mind and were always about to decide without regard to some one of them  they went to several places twice without intending once to that oldfashioned house with the pleasant colored janitor and wandered all over the apartment again with a haunting sense of familiarity and then recognized the janitor and laughed and to that house with the pathetic widow and the pretty daughter who wished to take them to board they stayed to excuse their blunder and easily came by the fact that the mother had taken the house that the girl might have a home while she was in new york studying art and they hoped to pay their way by taking boarders her daughter was at her class now the mother concluded and they encouraged her to believe that it could only be a few days till the rest of her scheme was realized  i dare say we could be perfectly comfortable there march suggested when they had got away now if we were truly humane we would modify our desires to meet their needs and end this sickening search wouldnt we  yes but were not truly humane his wife answered or at least not in that sense you know you hate boarding and if we went there i should have them on my sympathies the whole time  i see and then you would take it out of me  then i should take it out of you and if you are going to be so weak basil and let every little thing work upon you in that way youd better not come to new york youll see enough misery here  well dont take that superior tone with me as if i were a child that had its mind set on an undesirable toy isabel  ah dont you suppose its because you are such a child in some respects that i like you dear she demanded without relenting  but i dont find so much misery in new york i dont suppose theres any more suffering here to the population than there is in the country and theyre so gay about it all i think the outward aspect of the place and the hilarity of the sky and air must get into the peoples blood the weather is simply unapproachable and i dont care if it is the ugliest place in the world as you say i suppose it is it shrieks and yells with ugliness here and there but it never loses its spirits that widow is from the country when shes been a year in new york shell be as gayas gay as an l road he celebrated a satisfaction they both had in the l roads they kill the streets and avenues but at least they partially hide them and that is some comfort and they do triumph over their prostrate forms with a savage exultation that is intoxicating those bends in the l that you get in the corner of washington square or just below the cooper institutetheyre the gayest things in the world perfectly atrocious of course but incomparably picturesque and the whole city is so said march or else the l would never have got built here new york may be splendidly gay or squalidly gay but prince or pauper its gay always  yes gay is the word she admitted with a sigh but frantic i cant get used to it they forget death basil they forget death in new york  well i dont know that ive ever found much advantage in remembering it  dont say such a thing dearest  he could see that she had got to the end of her nervous strength for the present and he proposed that they should take the elevated road as far as it would carry them into the country and shake off their nightmare of flathunting for an hour or two but her conscience would not let her she convicted him of levity equal to that of the newyorkers in proposing such a thing and they dragged through the day she was too tired to care for dinner and in the night she had a dream from which she woke herself with a cry that roused him too it was something about the children at first whom they had talked of wistfully before falling asleep and then it was of a hideous thing with two square eyes and a series of sections growing darker and then lighter till the tail of the monstrous articulate was quite luminous again she shuddered at the vague description she was able to give but he asked did it offer to bite you  no that was the most frightful thing about it it had no mouth  march laughed why my dear it was nothing but a harmless new york flatseven rooms and a bath  i really believe it was she consented recognizing an architectural resemblance and she fell asleep again and woke renewed for the work before them     ix  their househunting no longer had novelty but it still had interest and they varied their day by taking a coupe by renouncing advertisements and by reverting to agents some of these induced them to consider the idea of furnished houses and mrs march learned tolerance for fulkerson by accepting permits to visit flats and houses which had none of the qualifications she desired in either and were as far beyond her means as they were out of the region to which she had geographically restricted herself they looked at threethousand and fourthousand dollar apartments and rejected them for one reason or another which had nothing to do with the rent the higher the rent was the more critical they were of the slippery inlaid floors and the arrangement of the richly decorated rooms they never knew whether they had deceived the janitor or not as they came in a coupe they hoped they had  they drove accidentally through one street that seemed gayer in the perspective than an l road the fireescapes with their light iron balconies and ladders of iron decorated the lofty house fronts the roadway and sidewalks and doorsteps swarmed with children womens heads seemed to show at every window in the basements over which flights of high stone steps led to the tenements were greengrocers shops abounding in cabbages and provision stores running chiefly to bacon and sausages and cobblers and tinners shops and the like in proportion to the small needs of a poor neighborhood ash barrels lined the sidewalks and garbage heaps filled the gutters teams of all trades stood idly about a peddler of cheap fruit urged his cart through the street and mixed his cry with the joyous screams and shouts of the children and the scolding and gossiping voices of the women the burly blue bulk of a policeman defined itself at the corner a drunkard zigzagged down the sidewalk toward him it was not the abode of the extremest poverty but of a poverty as hopeless as any in the world transmitting itself from generation to generation and establishing conditions of permanency to which human life adjusts itself as it does to those of some incurable disease like leprosy  the time had been when the marches would have taken a purely aesthetic view of the facts as they glimpsed them in this street of tenementhouses when they would have contented themselves with saying that it was as picturesque as a street in naples or florence and with wondering why nobody came to paint it they would have thought they were sufficiently serious about it in blaming the artists for their failure to appreciate it and going abroad for the picturesque when they had it here under their noses it was to the nose that the street made one of its strongest appeals and mrs march pulled up her window of the coupe why does he take us through such a disgusting street she demanded with an exasperation of which her husband divined the origin  this driver may be a philanthropist in disguise he answered with dreamy irony and may want us to think about the people who are not merely carried through this street in a coupe but have to spend their whole lives in it winter and summer with no hopes of driving out of it except in a hearse i must say they dont seem to mind it i havent seen a jollier crowd anywhere in new york they seem to have forgotten death a little more completely than any of their fellowcitizens isabel and i wonder what they think of us making this gorgeous progress through their midst i suppose they think were rich and hate usif they hate rich people they dont look as if they hated anybody should we be as patient as they are with their discomfort i dont believe theres steam heat or an elevator in the whole block seven rooms and a bath would be more than the largest and genteelest family would know what to do with they wouldnt know what to do with the bath anyway  his monologue seemed to interest his wife apart from the satirical point it had for themselves you ought to get mr fulkerson to let you work some of these new york sights up for every other week basil you could do them very nicely  yes ive thought of that but dont lets leave the personal ground doesnt it make you feel rather small and otherwise unworthy when you see the kind of street these fellowbeings of yours live in and then think how particular you are about locality and the number of bellpulls i dont see even ratchets and speakingtubes at these doors he craned his neck out of the window for a better look and the children of discomfort cheered him out of sheer good feeling and high spirits i didnt know i was so popular perhaps its a recognition of my humane sentiments  oh its very easy to have humane sentiments and to satirize ourselves for wanting eight rooms and a bath in a good neighborhood when we see how these wretched creatures live said his wife but if we shared all we have with them and then settled down among them what good would it do  not the least in the world it might help us for the moment but it wouldnt keep the wolf from their doors for a week and then they would go on just as before only they wouldnt be on such good terms with the wolf the only way for them is to keep up an unbroken intimacy with the wolf then they can manage him somehow i dont know how and im afraid i dont want to wouldnt you like to have this fellow drive us round among the halls of pride somewhere for a little while fifth avenue or madison uptown  no weve no time to waste ive got a place near third avenue on a nice cross street and i want him to take us there it proved that she had several addresses near together and it seemed best to dismiss their coupe and do the rest of their afternoons work on foot it came to nothing she was not humbled in the least by what she had seen in the tenementhouse street she yielded no point in her ideal of a flat and the flats persistently refused to lend themselves to it she lost all patience with them  oh i dont say the flats are in the right of it said her husband when she denounced their stupid inadequacy to the purposes of a christian home but im not so sure that we are either ive been thinking about that home business ever since my sensibilities were draggedin a coupethrough that tenementhouse street of course no child born and brought up in such a place as that could have any conception of home but thats because those poor people cant give character to their habitations they have to take what they can get but people like usthat is of our meansdo give character to the average flat its made to meet their tastes or their supposed tastes and so its made for social show not for family life at all think of a baby in a flat its a contradiction in terms the flat is the negation of motherhood the flat means society life that is the pretence of social life its made to give artificial people a society basis on a little moneytoo much money of course for what they get so the cost of the building is put into marble halls and idiotic decoration of all kinds i dont object to the conveniences but none of these flats has a livingroom they have drawingrooms to foster social pretence and they have diningrooms and bedrooms but they have no room where the family can all come together and feel the sweetness of being a family the bedrooms are blackholes mostly with a sinful waste of space in each if it were not for the marble halls and the decorations and the foolishly expensive finish the houses could be built round a court and the flats could be shaped something like a pompeiian house with small sleepingclosetsonly lit from the outsideand the rest of the floor thrown into two or three large cheerful halls where all the family life could go on and society could be transacted unpretentiously why those tenements are better and humaner than those flats there the whole family lives in the kitchen and has its consciousness of being but the flat abolishes the family consciousness its confinement without coziness its cluttered without being snug you couldnt keep a selfrespecting cat in a flat you couldnt go down cellar to get cider no the anglosaxon home as we know it in the anglosaxon house is simply impossible in the francoamerican flat not because its humble but because its false  well then said mrs march lets look at houses  he had been denouncing the flat in the abstract and he had not expected this concrete result but he said we will look at houses then     x  nothing mystifies a man more than a womans aberrations from some point at which he supposes her fixed as a star in these unfurnished houses without steam or elevator march followed his wife about with patient wonder she rather liked the worst of them best but she made him go down into the cellars and look at the furnaces she exacted from him a rigid inquest of the plumbing she followed him into one of the cellars by the fitful glare of successively lighted matches and they enjoyed a moment in which the anomaly of their presence there on that errand so remote from all the facts of their longestablished life in boston realized itself for them  think how easily we might have been murdered and nobody been any the wiser she said when they were comfortably outdoors again  yes or made way with ourselves in an access of emotional insanity supposed to have been induced by unavailing flathunting he suggested she fell in with the notion im beginning to feel crazy but i dont want you to lose your head basil and i dont want you to sentimentalize any of the things you see in new york i think you were disposed to do it in that street we drove through i dont believe theres any real sufferingnot real sufferingamong those people that is it would be suffering from our point of view but theyve been used to it all their lives and they dont feel their discomfort so much  of course i understand that and i dont propose to sentimentalize them i think when people get used to a bad state of things they had better stick to it in fact they dont usually like a better state so well and i shall keep that firmly in mind  she laughed with him and they walked along the l bestridden avenue exhilarated by their escape from murder and suicide in that cellar toward the nearest cross town track which they meant to take home to their hotel now tonight we will go to the theatre she said and get this whole house business out of our minds and be perfectly fresh for a new start in the morning suddenly she clutched his arm why did you see that man and she signed with her head toward a decently dressed person who walked beside them next the gutter stooping over as if to examine it and half halting at times  no what  why i saw him pick up a dirty bit of cracker from the pavement and cram it into his mouth and eat it down as if he were famished and look hes actually hunting for more in those garbage heaps  this was what the decentlooking man with the hard hands and broken nails of a workman was doinglike a hungry dog they kept up with him in the fascination of the sight to the next corner where he turned down the side street still searching the gutter  they walked on a few paces then march said i must go after him and left his wife standing  are you in wanthungry he asked the man  the man said he could not speak english monsieur  march asked his question in french  the man shrugged a pitiful desperate shrug mais monsieur  march put a coin in his hand and then suddenly the mans face twisted up he caught the hand of this almsgiver in both of his and clung to it monsieur monsieur he gasped and the tears rained down his face  his benefactor pulled himself away shocked and ashamed as one is by such a chance and got back to his wife and the man lapsed back into the mystery of misery out of which he had emerged  march felt it laid upon him to console his wife for what had happened of course we might live here for years and not see another case like that and of course there are twenty places where he could have gone for help if he had known where to find them  ah but its the possibility of his needing the help so badly as that she answered thats what i cant bear and i shall not come to a place where such things are possible and we may as well stop our househunting here at once  yes and what part of christendom will you live in such things are possible everywhere in our conditions  then we must change the conditions  oh no we must go to the theatre and forget them we can stop at brentanos for our tickets as we pass through union square  i am not going to the theatre basil i am going home to boston tonight you can stay and find a flat  he convinced her of the absurdity of her position and even of its selfishness but she said that her mind was quite made up irrespective of what had happened that she had been away from the children long enough that she ought to be at home to finish up the work of leaving it the word brought a sigh ah i dont know why we should see nothing but sad and ugly things now when we were young  younger he put in were still young  thats what we pretend but we know better but i was thinking how pretty and pleasant things used to be turning up all the time on our travels in the old days why when we were in new york here on our wedding journey the place didnt seem half so dirty as it does now and none of these dismal things happened  it was a good deal dirtier he answered and i fancy worse in every wayhungrier raggeder more wretchedly housed but that wasnt the period of life for us to notice it dont you remember when we started to niagara the last time how everybody seemed middleaged and commonplace and when we got there there were no evident brides nothing but elderly married people  at least they werent starving she rebelled  no you dont starve in parlorcars and firstclass hotels but if you step out of them you run your chance of seeing those who do if youre getting on pretty well in the forties if its the unhappy who see unhappiness think what misery must be revealed to people who pass their lives in the really squalid tenementhouse streetsi dont mean picturesque avenues like that we passed through  but we are not unhappy she protested bringing the talk back to the personal base again as women must to get any good out of talk were really no unhappier than we were when we were young  were more serious  well i hate it and i wish you wouldnt be so serious if thats what it brings us to  i will be trivial from this on said march shall we go to the hole in the ground tonight  i am going to boston  its much the same thing how do you like that for triviality its a little blasphemous ill allow  its very silly she said  at the hotel they found a letter from the agent who had sent them the permit to see mrs grosvenor greens apartment he wrote that she had heard they were pleased with her apartment and that she thought she could make the terms to suit she had taken her passage for europe and was very anxious to let the flat before she sailed she would call that evening at seven  mrs grosvenor green said mrs march which of the ten thousand flats is it basil  the gimcrackery he answered in the xenophon you know  well she may save herself the trouble i shall not see her or yesi must i couldnt go away without seeing what sort of creature could have planned that flyaway flat she must be a perfect  parachute march suggested  no anybody so light as that couldnt come down  well toy balloon  toy balloon will do for the present mrs march admitted but i feel that naught but herself can be her parallel for volatility  when mrs grosvenorgreens card came up they both descended to the hotel parlor which march said looked like the saloon of a moorish dayboat not that he knew of any such craft but the decorations were so saracenic and the architecture so hudson riverish they found there on the grand central divan a large lady whose vast smoothness placidity and plumpness set at defiance all their preconceptions of mrs grosvenor green so that mrs march distinctly paused with her card in her hand before venturing even tentatively to address her then she was astonished at the low calm voice in which mrs green acknowledged herself and slowly proceeded to apologize for calling it was not quite true that she had taken her passage for europe but she hoped soon to do so and she confessed that in the mean time she was anxious to let her flat she was a little worn out with the care of housekeepingmrs march breathed oh yes in the sigh with which ladies recognize one anothers martyrdomand mrs green had business abroad and she was going to pursue her art studies in paris she drew in mr ilcombs class now but the instruction was so much better in paris and as the superintendent seemed to think the price was the only objection she had ventured to call  then we didnt deceive him in the least thought mrs march while she answered sweetly no we were only afraid that it would be too small for our family we require a good many rooms she could not forego the opportunity of saying my husband is coming to new york to take charge of a literary periodical and he will have to have a room to write in which made mrs green bow to march and made march look sheepish but we did think the apartment very charming it was architecturally charming she protested to her conscience and we should have been so glad if we could have got into it she followed this with some account of their househunting amid soft murmurs of sympathy from mrs green who said that she had been through all that and that if she could have shown her apartment to them she felt sure that she could have explained it so that they would have seen its capabilities better mrs march assented to this and mrs green added that if they found nothing exactly suitable she would be glad to have them look at it again and then mrs march said that she was going back to boston herself but she was leaving mr march to continue the search and she had no doubt he would be only too glad to see the apartment by daylight but if you take it basil she warned him when they were alone i shall simply renounce you i wouldnt live in that junkshop if you gave it to me but who would have thought she was that kind of looking person though of course i might have known if i had stopped to think once its because the place doesnt express her at all that its so unlike her it couldnt be like anybody or anything that flies in the air or creeps upon the earth or swims in the waters under the earth i wonder where in the world shes from shes no newyorker even we can see that and shes not quite a country person either she seems like a person from some large town where shes been an aesthetic authority and she cant find good enough art instruction in new york and has to go to paris for it well its pathetic after all basil i cant help feeling sorry for a person who mistakes herself to that extent  i cant help feeling sorry for the husband of a person who mistakes herself to that extent what is mr grosvenor green going to do in paris while shes working her way into the salon  well you keep away from her apartment basil thats all ive got to say to you and yet i do like some things about her  i like everything about her but her apartment said march  i like her going to be out of the country said his wife we shouldnt be overlooked and the place was prettily shaped you cant deny it and there was an elevator and steam heat and the location is very convenient and there was a hallboy to bring up cards the halls and stairs were kept very clean and nice but it wouldnt do i could put you a folding bed in the room where you wrote and we could even have one in the parlor  behind a portiere i couldnt stand any more portieres  and we could squeeze the two girls into one room or perhaps only bring margaret and put out the whole of the wash basil she almost shrieked it isnt to be thought of  he retorted im not thinking of it my dear  fulkerson came in just before they started for mrs marchs train to find out what had become of them he said and to see whether they had got anything to live in yet  not a thing she said and im just going back to boston and leaving mr march here to do anything he pleases about it he has carte blanche  but freedom brings responsibility you know fulkerson and its the same as if id no choice im staying behind because im left not because i expect to do anything  is that so asked fulkerson well we must see what can be done i supposed you would be all settled by this time or i should have humped myself to find you something none of those places i gave you amounts to anything  as much as forty thousand others weve looked at said mrs march yes one of them does amount to something it comes so near being what we want that ive given mr march particular instructions not to go near it  she told him about mrs grosvenor green and her flats and at the end he said  well well we must look out for that ill keep an eye on him mrs march and see that he doesnt do anything rash and i wont leave him till hes found just the right thing it exists of course it must in a city of eighteen hundred thousand people and the only question is where to find it you leave him to me mrs march ill watch out for him  fulkerson showed some signs of going to the station when he found they were not driving but she bade him a peremptory goodbye at the hotel door  hes very nice basil and his way with you is perfectly charming its very sweet to see how really fond of you he is but i didnt want him stringing along with us up to fortysecond street and spoiling our last moments together  at third avenue they took the elevated for which she confessed an infatuation she declared it the most ideal way of getting about in the world and was not ashamed when he reminded her of how she used to say that nothing under the sun could induce her to travel on it she now said that the night transit was even more interesting than the day and that the fleeing intimacy you formed with people in second and third floor interiors while all the usual street life went on underneath had a domestic intensity mixed with a perfect repose that was the last effect of good society with all its security and exclusiveness he said it was better than the theatre of which it reminded him to see those people through their windows a family party of workfolk at a late tea some of the men in their shirtsleeves a woman sewing by a lamp a mother laying her child in its cradle a man with his head fallen on his hands upon a table a girl and her lover leaning over the windowsill together what suggestion what drama what infinite interest at the fortysecond street station they stopped a minute on the bridge that crosses the track to the branch road for the central depot and looked up and down the long stretch of the elevated to north and south the track that found and lost itself a thousand times in the flare and tremor of the innumerable lights the moony sheen of the electrics mixing with the reddish points and blots of gas far and near the architectural shapes of houses and churches and towers rescued by the obscurity from all that was ignoble in them and the coming and going of the trains marking the stations with vivider or fainter plumes of flameshot steamformed an incomparable perspective they often talked afterward of the superb spectacle which in a city full of painters nightly works its unrecorded miracles and they were just to the arachne roof spun in iron over the cross street on which they ran to the depot but for the present they were mostly inarticulate before it they had another moment of rich silence when they paused in the gallery that leads from the elevated station to the waitingrooms in the central depot and looked down upon the great night trains lying on the tracks dim under the rain of gaslights that starred without dispersing the vast darkness of the place what forces what fates slept in these bulks which would soon be hurling themselves north and south and west through the night now they waited there like fabled monsters of arab story ready for the magicians touch tractable reckless willlessorganized lifelessness full of a strange semblance of life  the marches admired the impressive sight with a thrill of patriotic pride in the fact that the whole world perhaps could not afford just the like then they hurried down to the ticketoffices and he got her a lower berth in the boston sleeper and went with her to the car they made the most of the fact that her berth was in the very middle of the car and she promised to write as soon as she reached home she promised also that having seen the limitations of new york in respect to flats she would not be hard on him if he took something not quite ideal only he must remember that it was not to be above twentieth street nor below washington square it must not be higher than the third floor it must have an elevator steam heat hailboys and a pleasant janitor these were essentials if he could not get them then they must do without but he must get them     xi  mrs march was one of those wives who exact a more rigid adherence to their ideals from their husbands than from themselves early in their married life she had taken charge of him in all matters which she considered practical she did not include the business of breadwinning in these that was an affair that might safely be left to his absentminded dreamy inefficiency and she did not interfere with him there but in such things as rehanging the pictures deciding on a summer boardingplace taking a seaside cottage repapering rooms choosing seats at the theatre seeing what the children ate when she was not at table shutting the cat out at night keeping run of calls and invitations and seeing if the furnace was dampered he had failed her so often that she felt she could not leave him the slightest discretion in regard to a flat her total distrust of his judgment in the matters cited and others like them consisted with the greatest admiration of his mind and respect for his character she often said that if he would only bring these to bear in such exigencies he would be simply perfect but she had long given up his ever doing so she subjected him therefore to an iron code but after proclaiming it she was apt to abandon him to the native lawlessness of his temperament she expected him in this event to do as he pleased and she resigned herself to it with considerable comfort in holding him accountable he learned to expect this and after suffering keenly from her disappointment with whatever he did he waited patiently till she forgot her grievance and began to extract what consolation lurks in the irreparable she would almost admit at moments that what he had done was a very good thing but she reserved the right to return in full force to her original condemnation of it and she accumulated each act of independent volition in witness and warning against him their mass oppressed but never deterred him he expected to do the wrong thing when left to his own devices and he did it without any apparent recollection of his former misdeeds and their consequences there was a good deal of comedy in it all and some tragedy  he now experienced a certain expansion such as husbands of his kind will imagine on going back to his hotel alone it was perhaps a revulsion from the pain of parting and he toyed with the idea of mrs grosvenor greens apartment which in its preposterous unsuitability had a strange attraction he felt that he could take it with less risk than anything else they had seen but he said he would look at all the other places in town first he really spent the greater part of the next day in hunting up the owner of an apartment that had neither steam heat nor an elevator but was otherwise perfect and trying to get him to take less than the agent asked by a curious psychical operation he was able in the transaction to work himself into quite a passionate desire for the apartment while he held the grosvenor green apartment in the background of his mind as something that he could return to as altogether more suitable he conducted some simultaneous negotiation for a furnished house which enhanced still more the desirability of the grosvenor green apartment toward evening he went off at a tangent far uptown so as to be able to tell his wife how utterly preposterous the best there would be as compared even with this ridiculous grosvenor green gimcrackery it is hard to report the processes of his sophistication perhaps this again may best be left to the marital imagination  he rang at the last of these uptown apartments as it was falling dusk and it was long before the janitor appeared then the man was very surly and said if he looked at the flat now he would say it was too dark like all the rest his reluctance irritated march in proportion to his insincerity in proposing to look at it at all he knew he did not mean to take it under any circumstances that he was going to use his inspection of it in dishonest justification of his disobedience to his wife but he put on an air of offended dignity if you dont wish to show the apartment he said i dont care to see it  the man groaned for he was heavy and no doubt dreaded the stairs he scratched a match on his thigh and led the way up march was sorry for him and he put his fingers on a quarter in his waistcoatpocket to give him at parting at the same time he had to trump up an objection to the flat this was easy for it was advertised as containing ten rooms and he found the number eked out with the bathroom and two large closets its light enough said march but i dont see how you make out ten rooms  theres ten rooms said the man deigning no proof  march took his fingers off the quarter and went downstairs and out of the door without another word it would be wrong it would be impossible to give the man anything after such insolence he reflected with shame that it was also cheaper to punish than forgive him  he returned to his hotel prepared for any desperate measure and convinced now that the grosvenor green apartment was not merely the only thing left for him but was on its own merits the best thing in new york  fulkerson was waiting for him in the readingroom and it gave march the curious thrill with which a man closes with temptation when he said look here why dont you take that womans flat in the xenophon shes been at the agents again and theyve been at me she likes your lookor mrs marchsand i guess you can have it at a pretty heavy discount from the original price im authorized to say you can have it for one seventyfive a month and i dont believe it would be safe for you to offer one fifty  march shook his head and dropped a mask of virtuous rejection over his corrupt acquiescence its too small for uswe couldnt squeeze into it  why look here fulkerson persisted how many rooms do you people want  ive got to have a place to work  of course and youve got to have it at the fifth wheel office  i hadnt thought of that march began i suppose i could do my work at the office as theres not much writing  why of course you cant do your work at home you just come round with me now and look at that again  no i cant do it  why  iive got to dine  all right said fulkerson dine with me i want to take you round to a little italian place that i know  one may trace the successive steps of marchs descent in this simple matter with the same edification that would attend the study of the selfdelusions and obfuscations of a man tempted to crime the process is probably not at all different and to the philosophical mind the kind of result is unimportant the process is everything  fulkerson led him down one block and half across another to the steps of a small dwellinghouse transformed like many others into a restaurant of the latin ideal with little or no structural change from the pattern of the lower middleclass new york home there were the corroded brownstone steps the mean little front door and the cramped entry with its narrow stairs by which ladies could go up to a diningroom appointed for them on the second floor the parlors on the first were set about with tables where men smoked cigarettes between the courses and a single waiter ran swiftly to and fro with plates and dishes and exchanged unintelligible outcries with a cook beyond a slide in the back parlor he rushed at the newcomers brushed the soiled tablecloth before them with a towel on his arm covered its worst stains with a napkin and brought them in their order the vermicelli soup the fried fish the cheesestrewn spaghetti the veal cutlets the tepid roast fowl and salad and the wizened pear and coffee which form the dinner at such places  ah this is nice said fulkerson after the laying of the charitable napkin and he began to recognize acquaintances some of whom he described to march as young literary men and artists with whom they should probably have to do others were simply frequenters of the place and were of all nationalities and religions apparentlyat least several were hebrews and cubans you get a pretty good slice of new york here he said all except the frosting on top that you wont find much at maronis though you will occasionally i dont mean the ladies ever of course the ladies present seemed harmless and reputablelooking people enough but certainly they were not of the first fashion and except in a few instances not americans its like cutting straight down through a fruitcake fulkerson went on or a mincepie when you dont know who made the pie you get a little of everything he ordered a small flask of chianti with the dinner and it came in its pretty wicker jacket march smiled upon it with tender reminiscence and fulkerson laughed lights you up a little i brought old dryfoos here one day and he thought it was sweetoil thats the kind of bottle they used to have it in at the country drugstores  yes i remember now but id totally forgotten it said march how far back that goes whos dryfoos  dryfoos fulkerson still smiling tore off a piece of the halfyard of french loaf which had been supplied them with two pale thin disks of butter and fed it into himself old dryfoos well of course i call him old but he aint so very about fifty or along there  no said march that isnt very oldor not so old as it used to be  well i suppose youve got to know about him anyway said fulkerson thoughtfully and ive been wondering just how i should tell you cant always make out exactly how much of a bostonian you really are ever been out in the naturalgas country  no said march ive had a good deal of curiosity about it but ive never been able to get away except in summer and then we always preferred to go over the old ground out to niagara and back through canada the route we took on our wedding journey the children like it as much as we do  yes yes said fulkerson well the naturalgas country is worth seeing i dont mean the pittsburg gasfields but out in northern ohio and indiana around moffittthats the place in the heart of the gas region that theyve been booming so yes you ought to see that country if you havent been west for a good many years you havent got any idea how old the country looks you remember how the fields used to be all full of stumps  i should think so  well you wont see any stumps now all that country out around moffitt is just as smooth as a checkerboard and looks as old as england you know how we used to burn the stumps out and then somebody invented a stumpextractor and we pulled them out with a yoke of oxen now they just touch em off with a little dynamite and theyve got a cellar dug and filled up with kindling ready for housekeeping whenever you want it only they havent got any use for kindling in that countryall gas i rode along on the cars through those level black fields at cornplanting time and every once in a while id come to a place with a piece of ragged old stovepipe stickin up out of the ground and blazing away like forty and a fellow ploughing all round it and not minding it any more than if it was spring violets horses didnt notice it either well theyve always known about the gas out there they say there are places in the woods where its been burning ever since the country was settled  but when you come in sight of moffittmy oh my well you come in smell of it about as soon that gas out there aint odorless like the pittsburg gas and so its perfectly safe but the smell isnt badabout as bad as the finest kind of benzine well the first thing that strikes you when you come to moffitt is the notion that there has been a good warm growing rain and the towns come up overnight thats in the suburbs the annexes and additions but it aint shabbyno shantyfarm business nice brick and frame houses some of em queen anne style and all of em looking as if they had come to stay and when you drive up from the depot you think everybodys moving everything seems to be piled into the street old houses made over and new ones going up everywhere you know the kind of street main street always used to be in our sectionhalf plankroad and turnpike and the rest mudhole and a lot of stores and doggeries strung along with false fronts a story higher than the back and here and there a decent building with the gable end to the public and a courthouse and jail and two taverns and three or four churches well theyre all there in moffitt yet but architecture has struck it hard and theyve got a lot of new buildings that neednt be ashamed of themselves anywhere the new courthouse is as big as st peters and the grand operahouse is in the highest style of the art you cant buy a lot on that street for much less than you can buy a lot in new yorkor you couldnt when the boom was on i saw the place just when the boom was in its prime i went out there to work the newspapers in the syndicate business and i got one of their men to write me a real bright snappy account of the gas and they just took me in their arms and showed me everything well it was wonderful and it was beautiful too to see a whole community stirred up like that wasjust like a big boy all hope and high spirits and no discount on the remotest future nothing but perpetual boom to the end of timei tell you it warmed your blood why there were some things about it that made you think what a nice kind of world this would be if people ever took hold together instead of each fellow fighting it out on his own hook and devil take the hindmost they made up their minds at moffitt that if they wanted their town to grow theyd got to keep their gas public property so they extended their corporation line so as to take in pretty much the whole gas region round there and then the city took possession of every well that was put down and held it for the common good anybody thats a mind to come to moffitt and start any kind of manufacture can have all the gas he wants free and for fifteen dollars a year you can have all the gas you want to heat and light your private house the people hold on to it for themselves and as i say its a grand sight to see a whole community hanging together and working for the good of all instead of splitting up into as many different cutthroats as there are ablebodied citizens see that fellow fulkerson broke off and indicated with a twirl of his head a short dark foreignlooking man going out of the door they say that fellows a socialist i think its a shame theyre allowed to come here if they dont like the way we manage our affairs let em stay at home fulkerson continued they do a lot of mischief shooting off their mouths round here i believe in free speech and all that but id like to see these fellows shut up in jail and left to jaw one another to death we dont want any of their poison  march did not notice the vanishing socialist he was watching with a teasing sense of familiarity a tall shabbily dressed elderly man who had just come in he had the aquiline profile uncommon among germans and yet march recognized him at once as german his long soft beard and mustache had once been fair and they kept some tone of their yellow in the gray to which they had turned his eyes were full and his lips and chin shaped the beard to the noble outline which shows in the beards the italian masters liked to paint for their last suppers his carriage was erect and soldierly and march presently saw that he had lost his left hand he took his place at a table where the overworked waiter found time to cut up his meat and put everything in easy reach of his right hand  well fulkerson resumed they took me round everywhere in moffitt and showed me their big wellslit em up for a private view and let me hear them purr with the soft accents of a massmeeting of locomotives why when they let one of these wells loose in a meadow that theyd piped it into temporarily it drove the flame away forty feet from the mouth of the pipe and blew it over half an acre of ground they say when they let one of their big wells burn away all winter before they had learned how to control it that well kept up a little summer all around it the grass stayed green and the flowers bloomed all through the winter i dont know whether its so or not but i can believe anything of natural gas my but it was beautiful when they turned on the full force of that well and shot a roman candle into the gasthats the way they light itand a plume of fire about twenty feet wide and seventyfive feet high all red and yellow and violet jumped into the sky and that big roar shook the ground under your feet you felt like saying  dont trouble yourself im perfectly convinced i believe in moffitt weeell drawled fulkerson with a long breath thats where i met old dryfoos  oh yesdryfoos said march he observed that the waiter had brought the old onehanded german a towering glass of beer  yes fulkerson laughed weve got round to dryfoos again i thought i could cut a long story short but i seem to be cutting a short story long if youre not in a hurry though  not in the least go on as long as you like  i met him there in the office of a realestate manspeculator of course everybody was in moffitt but a firstrate fellow and publicspirited as all getout and when dryfoos left he told me about him dryfoos was an old pennsylvania dutch farmer about three or four miles out of moffitt and hed lived there pretty much all his life father was one of the first settlers everybody knew he had the right stuff in him but he was slower than molasses in january like those pennsylvania dutch hed got together the largest and handsomest farm anywhere around there and he was making money on it just like he was in some business somewhere he was a very intelligent man he took the papers and kept himself posted but he was awfully oldfashioned in his ideas he hung on to the doctrines as well as the dollars of the dads it was a real thing with him well when the boom began to come he hated it awfully and he fought it he used to write communications to the weekly newspaper in moffitttheyve got three dailies there nowand throw cold water on the boom he couldnt catch on no way it made him sick to hear the clack that went on about the gas the whole while and that stirred up the neighborhood and got into his family whenever hed hear of a man that had been offered a big price for his land and was going to sell out and move into town hed go and labor with him and try to talk him out of it and tell him how long his fifteen or twenty thousand would last him to live on and shake the standard oil company before him and try to make him believe it wouldnt be five years before the standard owned the whole region  of course he couldnt do anything with them when a mans offered a big price for his farm he dont care whether its by a secret emissary from the standard oil or not hes going to sell and get the better of the other fellow if he can dryfoos couldnt keep the boom out of has own family even his wife was with him she thought whatever he said and did was just as right as if it had been thundered down from sinai but the young folks were sceptical especially the girls that had been away to school the boy that had been kept at home because he couldnt be spared from helping his father manage the farm was more like him but they contrived to stir the boy upwith the hot end of the boom too so when a fellow came along one day and offered old dryfoos a cool hundred thousand for his farm it was all up with dryfoos hed a liked to a kept the offer to himself and not done anything about it but his vanity wouldnt let him do that and when he let it out in his family the girls outvoted him they just made him sell  he wouldnt sell all he kept about eighty acres that was off in some piece by itself but the three hundred that had the old brick house on it and the big barnthat went and dryfoos bought him a place in moffitt and moved into town to live on the interest of his money just what he had scolded and ridiculed everybody else for doing well they say that at first he seemed like he would go crazy he hadnt anything to do he took a fancy to that landagent and he used to go and set in his office and ask him what he should do i haint got any horses i haint got any cows i haint got any pigs i haint got any chickens i haint got anything to do from sunup to sundown the fellow said the tears used to run down the old fellows cheeks and if he hadnt been so busy himself he believed he should a cried too but most o people thought old dryfoos was down in the mouth because he hadnt asked more for his farm when he wanted to buy it back and found they held it at a hundred and fifty thousand people couldnt believe he was just homesick and heartsick for the old place well perhaps he was sorry he hadnt asked more thats human nature too  after a while something happened that landagent used to tell dryfoos to get out to europe with his money and see life a little or go and live in washington where he could be somebody but dryfoos wouldnt and he kept listening to the talk there and all of a sudden he caught on he came into that fellows one day with a plan for cutting up the eighty acres hed kept into town lots and hed got it all plotted out sowell and had so many practical ideas about it that the fellow was astonished he went right in with him as far as dryfoos would let him and glad of the chance and they were working the thing for all it was worth when i struck moffitt old dryfoos wanted me to go out and see the dryfoos  hendry additionguess he thought maybe id write it up and he drove me out there himself well it was funny to see a town made streets driven through two rows of shadetrees hard and soft planted cellars dug and houses put upregular queen anne style too with stained glassall at once dryfoos apologized for the streets because they were handmade said they expected their streetmaking machine tuesday and then they intended to push things  fulkerson enjoyed the effect of his picture on march for a moment and then went on he was mighty intelligent too and he questioned me up about my business as sharp as i ever was questioned seemed to kind of strike his fancy i guess he wanted to find out if there was any money in it he was making money hand over hand then and he never stopped speculating and improving till hed scraped together three or four hundred thousand dollars they said a million but they like round numbers at moffitt and i guess half a million would lay over it comfortably and leave a few thousands to spare probably then he came on to new york  fulkerson struck a match against the ribbed side of the porcelain cup that held the matches in the centre of the table and lit a cigarette which he began to smoke throwing his head back with a leisurely effect as if he had got to the end of at least as much of his story as he meant to tell without prompting  march asked him the desired question what in the world for  fulkerson took out his cigarette and said with a smile to spend his money and get his daughters into the old knickerbocker society maybe he thought they were all the same kind of dutch  and has he succeeded  well theyre not social leaders yet but its only a question of timegeneration or twoespecially if times money and if every other week is the success its bound to be  you dont mean to say fulkerson said march with a halfdoubting halfdaunted laugh that hes your angel  thats what i mean to say returned fulkerson i ran onto him in broadway one day last summer if you ever saw anybody in your life youre sure to meet him in broadway again sooner or later thats the philosophy of the bunco business country people from the same neighborhood are sure to run up against each other the first time they come to new york i put out my hand and i said isnt this mr dryfoos from moffitt he didnt seem to have any use for my hand he let me keep it and he squared those old lips of his till his imperial stuck straight out ever see bernhardt in letrangere well the american husband is old dryfoos all over no mustache and haycolored chinwhiskers cut slanting froze the corners of his mouth he cocked his little gray eyes at me and says he yes young man my name is dryfoos and im from moffitt but i dont want no present of longfellows works illustrated and i dont want to taste no fine teas but i know a policeman that does and if youre the son of my old friend squire strohfeldt youd better get out well then said i how would you like to go into the newspaper syndicate business he gave another look at me and then he burst out laughing and he grabbed my hand and he just froze to it i never saw anybody so glad  well the long and the short of it was that i asked him round here to maronis to dinner and before we broke up for the night we had settled the financial side of the plan thats brought you to new york  i can see said fulkerson who had kept his eyes fast on marchs face that you dont more than half like the idea of dryfoos it ought to give you more confidence in the thing than you ever had you neednt be afraid he added with some feeling that i talked dryfoos into the thing for my own advantage  oh my dear fulkerson march protested all the more fervently because he was really a little guilty  well of course not i didnt mean you were but i just happened to tell him what i wanted to go into when i could see my way to it and he caught on of his own accord the fact is said fulkerson i guess id better make a clean breast of it now im at it dryfoos wanted to get something for that boy of his to do hes in railroads himself and hes in mines and other things and he keeps busy and he cant bear to have his boy hanging round the house doing nothing like as if he was a girl i told him that the great object of a rich man was to get his son into just that fix but he couldnt seem to see it and the boy hated it himself hes got a good head and he wanted to study for the ministry when they were all living together out on the farm but his father had the oldfashioned ideas about that you know they used to think that any sort of stuff was good enough to make a preacher out of but they wanted the good timber for business and so the old man wouldnt let him youll see the fellow youll like him hes no fool i can tell you and hes going to be our publisher nominally at first and actually when ive taught him the ropes a little     xii  fulkerson stopped and looked at march whom he saw lapsing into a serious silence doubtless he divined his uneasiness with the facts that had been given him to digest he pulled out his watch and glanced at it see here how would you like to go up to fortysixth street with me and drop in on old dryfoos nows your chance hes going west tomorrow and wont be back for a month or so theyll all be glad to see you and youll understand things better when youve seen him and his family i cant explain  march reflected a moment then he said with a wisdom that surprised him for he would have liked to yield to the impulse of his curiosity perhaps wed better wait till mrs march comes down and let things take the usual course the dryfoos ladies will want to call on her as the lastcomer and if i treated myself en garcon now and paid the first visit it might complicate matters  well perhaps youre right said fulkerson i dont know much about these things and i dont believe ma dryfoos does either he was on his legs lighting another cigarette i suppose the girls are getting themselves up in etiquette though well then lets have a look at the every other week building and then if you like your quarters there you can go round and close for mrs greens flat  marchs dormant allegiance to his wifes wishes had been roused by his decision in favor of good social usage i dont think i shall take the flat he said  well dont reject it without giving it another look anyway come on  he helped march on with his light overcoat and the little stir they made for their departure caught the notice of the old german he looked up from his beer at them march was more than ever impressed with something familiar in his face in compensation for his prudence in regard to the dryfooses he now indulged an impulse he stepped across to where the old man sat with his bald head shining like ivory under the gasjet and his fine patriarchal length of bearded mask taking picturesque lights and shadows and put out his hand to him  lindau isnt this mr lindau  the old man lifted himself slowly to his feet with mechanical politeness and cautiously took marchs hand yes my name is lindau he said slowly while he scanned marchs face then he broke into a long cry ahhhhh my dear poy my gong friendt mymyidt is passil marge not zo ah ha ha ha how gladt i am to zee you why i am gladt and you rememberdt me you remember schiller and goethe and uhland and indianapolis you still lif in indianapolis it sheers my hardt to zee you but you are lidtle oldt too tventyfive years makes a difference ah i am gladt dell me idt is passil marge not zo  he looked anxiously into marchs face with a gentle smile of mixed hope and doubt and march said as sure as its berthold lindau and i guess its you and you remember the old times you were as much of a boy as i was lindau are you living in new york do you recollect how you tried to teach me to fence i dont know how to this day lindau how good you were and how patient do you remember how we used to sit up in the little parlor back of your printingoffice and read die rauber and die theilung der erde and die glocke and mrs lindau is she with  deadtdeadt long ago right after i got home from the wartventy years ago but tell me you are married children yes goodt and how oldt are you now  it makes me seventeen to see you lindau but ive got a son nearly as old  ah ha ha goodt and where do you lif  well im just coming to live in new york march said looking over at fulkerson who had been watching his interview with the perfunctory smile of sympathy that people put on at the meeting of old friends i want to introduce you to my friend mr fulkerson he and i are going into a literary enterprise here  ah zo said the old man with polite interest he took fulkersons proffered hand and they all stood talking a few moments together  then fulkerson said with another look at his watch well march were keeping mr lindau from his dinner  dinner cried the old man idts better than breadt and meadt to see mr marge  i must be going anyway said march but i must see you again soon lindau where do you live i want a long talk  and i you will find me here at dinnertime said the old man it is the best place and march fancied him reluctant to give another address  to cover his consciousness he answered gayly then its auf wiedersehen with us well  also the old man took his hand and made a mechanical movement with his mutilated arm as if he would have taken it in a double clasp he laughed at himself i wanted to gif you the other handt too but i gafe it to your gountry a goodt while ago  to my country asked march with a sense of pain and yet lightly as if it were a joke of the old mans your country too lindau  the old man turned very grave and said almost coldly what gountry hass a poor man got mr marge  well you ought to have a share in the one you helped to save for us rich men lindau march returned still humoring the joke  the old man smiled sadly but made no answer as he sat down again  seems to be a little soured said fulkerson as they went down the steps he was one of those americans whose habitual conception of life is unalloyed prosperity when any experience or observation of his went counter to it he sufferedsomething like physical pain he eagerly shrugged away the impression left upon his buoyancy by lindau and added to marchs continued silence what did i tell you about meeting every man in new york that you ever knew before  i never expected to meat lindau in the world again said march more to himself than to fulkerson i had an impression that he had been killed in the war i almost wish he had been  oh hello now cried fulkerson  march laughed but went on soberly he was a man predestined to adversity though when i first knew him out in indianapolis he was starving along with a sick wife and a sick newspaper it was before the germans had come over to the republicans generally but lindau was fighting the antislavery battle just as naturally at indianapolis in 1858 as he fought behind the barricades at berlin in 1848 and yet he was always such a gentle soul and so generous he taught me german for the love of it he wouldnt spoil his pleasure by taking a cent from me he seemed to get enough out of my being young and enthusiastic and out of prophesying great things for me i wonder what the poor old fellow is doing here with that one hand of his  not amassing a very handsome pittance i guess as artemus ward would say said fulkerson getting back some of his lightness there are lots of twohanded fellows in new york that are not doing much better i guess maybe he gets some writing on the german papers  i hope so hes one of the most accomplished men he used to be a splendid musicianpianistand knows eight or ten languages  well its astonishing said fulkerson how much lumber those germans can carry around in their heads all their lives and never work it up into anything its a pity they couldnt do the acquiring and let out the use of their learning to a few bright americans we could make things hum if we could arrange em that way  he talked on unheeded by march who went along halfconsciously tormented by his lightness in the pensive memories the meeting with lindau had called up was this all that sweet unselfish nature could come to what a homeless old age at that meagre italian table dhote with that tall glass of beer for a halfhours oblivion that shabby dress that pathetic mutilation he must have a pension twelve dollars a month or eighteen from a grateful country but what else did he eke out with  well here we are said fulkerson cheerily he ran up the steps before march and opened the carpenters temporary valve in the door frame and led the way into a darkness smelling sweetly of unpainted woodwork and newly dried plaster their feat slipped on shavings and grated on sand he scratched a match and found a candle and then walked about up and down stairs and lectured on the advantages of the place he had fitted up bachelor apartments for himself in the house and said that he was going to have a flat to let on the top floor i didnt offer it to you because i supposed youd be too proud to live over your shop and its too small anyway only five rooms  yes thats too small said march shirking the other point  well then heres the room i intend for your office said fulkerson showing him into a large back parlor one flight up youll have it quiet from the street noises here and you can be at home or not as you please therell be a boy on the stairs to find out now you see this makes the grosvenor green flat practicable if you want it  march felt the forces of fate closing about him and pushing him to a decision he feebly fought them off till he could have another look at the flat then baked and subdued still more by the unexpected presence of mrs grosvenor green herself who was occupying it so as to be able to show it effectively he took it he was aware more than ever of its absurdities he knew that his wife would never cease to hate it but he had suffered one of those eclipses of the imagination to which men of his temperament are subject and into which he could see no future for his desires he felt a comfort in irretrievably committing himself and exchanging the burden of indecision for the burden of responsibility  i dont know said fulkerson as they walked back to his hotel together but you might fix it up with that lone widow and her pretty daughter to take part of their house here he seemed to be reminded of it by the fact of passing the house and march looked up at its dark front he could not have told exactly why he felt a pang of remorse at the sight and doubtless it was more regret for having taken the grosvenor green flat than for not having taken the widows rooms still he could not forget her wistfulness when his wife and he were looking at them and her disappointment when they decided against them he had toyed in his aftertalk to mrs march with a sort of hypothetical obligation they had to modify their plans so as to meet the widows want of just such a family as theirs they had both said what a blessing it would be to her and what a pity they could not do it but they had decided very distinctly that they could not now it seemed to him that they might and he asked himself whether he had not actually departed as much from their ideal as if he had taken board with the widow suddenly it seemed to him that his wife asked him this too  i reckon said fulkerson that she could have arranged to give you your meals in your rooms and it would have come to about the same thing as housekeeping  no sort of boarding can be the same as housekeeping said march i want my little girl to have the run of a kitchen and i want the whole family to have the moral effect of housekeeping its demoralizing to board in every way it isnt a home if anybody else takes the care of it off your hands  well i suppose so fulkerson assented but marchs words had a hollow ring to himself and in his own mind he began to retaliate his dissatisfaction upon fulkerson  he parted from him on the usual terms outwardly but he felt obscurely abused by fulkerson in regard to the dryfooses father and son he did not know but fulkerson had taken an advantage of him in allowing him to commit himself to their enterprise with out fully and frankly telling him who and what his backer was he perceived that with young dryfoos as the publisher and fulkerson as the general director of the paper there might be very little play for his own ideas of its conduct perhaps it was the hurt to his vanity involved by the recognition of this fact that made him forget how little choice he really had in the matter and how since he had not accepted the offer to edit the insurance paper nothing remained for him but to close with fulkerson in this moment of suspicion and resentment he accused fulkerson of hastening his decision in regard to the grosvenor green apartment he now refused to consider it a decision and said to himself that if he felt disposed to do so he would send mrs green a note reversing it in the morning but he put it all off till morning with his clothes when he went to bed he put off even thinking what his wife would say he cast fulkerson and his constructive treachery out of his mind too and invited into it some pensive reveries of the past when he still stood at the parting of the ways and could take this path or that in his middle life this was not possible he must follow the path chosen long ago wherever it led he was not master of himself as he once seemed but the servant of those he loved if he could do what he liked perhaps he might renounce this whole new york enterprise and go off somewhere out of the reach of care but he could not do what he liked that was very clear in the pathos of this conviction he dwelt compassionately upon the thought of poor old lindau he resolved to make him accept a handsome sum of moneymore than he could spare something that he would feel the loss ofin payment of the lessons in german and fencing given so long ago at the usual rate for such lessons his debt with interest for twentyodd years would run very far into the hundreds too far he perceived for his wifes joyous approval he determined not to add the interest or he believed that lindau would refuse the interest he put a fine speech in his mouth making him do so and after that he got lindau employment on every other week and took care of him till he died  through all his melancholy and munificence he was aware of sordid anxieties for having taken the grosvenor green apartment these began to assume visible tangible shapes as he drowsed and to became personal entities from which he woke with little starts to a realization of their true nature and then suddenly fell fast asleep  in the accomplishment of the events which his reverie played with there was much that retroactively stamped it with prophecy but much also that was better than he forboded he found that with regard to the grosvenor green apartment he had not allowed for his wifes willingness to get any sort of roof over her head again after the removal from their old home or for the alleviations that grow up through mere custom the practical workings of the apartment were not so bad it had its good points and after the first sensation of oppression in it they began to feel the convenience of its arrangement they were at that time of life when people first turn to their childrens opinion with deference and in the loss of keenness in their own likes and dislikes consult the young preferences which are still so sensitive it went far to reconcile mrs march to the apartment that her children were pleased with its novelty when this wore off for them she had herself begun to find it much more easily manageable than a house after she had put away several barrels of gimcracks and folded up screens and rugs and skins and carried them all off to the little dark storeroom which the flat developed she perceived at once a roominess and coziness in it unsuspected before then when people began to call she had a pleasure a superiority in saying that it was a furnished apartment and in disclaiming all responsibility for the upholstery and decoration if march was by she always explained that it was mr marchs fancy and amiably laughed it off with her callers as a mannish eccentricity nobody really seemed to think it otherwise than pretty and this again was a triumph for mrs march because it showed how inferior the new york taste was to the boston taste in such matters  march submitted silently to his punishment and laughed with her before company at his own eccentricity she had been so preoccupied with the adjustment of the family to its new quarters and circumstances that the time passed for laying his misgivings if they were misgivings about fulkerson before her and when an occasion came for expressing them they had themselves passed in the anxieties of getting forward the first number of every other week he kept these from her too and the business that brought them to new york had apparently dropped into abeyance before the questions of domestic economy that presented and absented themselves march knew his wife to be a woman of good mind and in perfect sympathy with him but he understood the limitations of her perspective and if he was not too wise he was too experienced to intrude upon it any affairs of his till her own were reduced to the right order and proportion it would have been folly to talk to her of fulkersons conjecturable uncandor while she was in doubt whether her cook would like the kitchen or her two servants would consent to room together and till it was decided what school tom should go to and whether bella should have lessons at home or not the relation which march was to bear to the dryfooses as owner and publisher was not to be discussed with his wife he might drag it in but he was aware that with her mind distracted by more immediate interests he could not get from her that judgment that reasoned divination which he relied upon so much she would try she would do her best but the result would be a view clouded and discolored by the effort she must make  he put the whole matter by and gave himself to the details of the work before him in this he found not only escape but reassurance for it became more and more apparent that whatever was nominally the structure of the business a man of his qualifications and his instincts could not have an insignificant place in it he had also the consolation of liking his work and of getting an instant grasp of it that grew constantly firmer and closer the joy of knowing that he had not made a mistake was great in giving rein to ambitions long forborne he seemed to get back to the youth when he had indulged them first and after half a lifetime passed in pursuits alien to his nature he was feeling the serene happiness of being mated through his work to his early love from the outside the spectacle might have had its pathos and it is not easy to justify such an experiment as he had made at his time of life except upon the ground where he rested from its considerationthe ground of necessity  his work was more in his thoughts than himself however and as the time for the publication of the first number of his periodical came nearer his cares all centred upon it without fixing any date fulkerson had announced it and pushed his announcements with the shameless vigor of a born advertiser he worked his interest with the press to the utmost and paragraphs of a variety that did credit to his ingenuity were afloat everywhere some of them were speciously unfavorable in tone they criticised and even ridiculed the principles on which the new departure in literary journalism was based others defended it others yet denied that this rumored principle was really the principle all contributed to make talk all proceeded from the same fertile invention  march observed with a degree of mortification that the talk was very little of it in the new york press there the references to the novel enterprise were slight and cold but fulkerson said dont mind that old man its the whole country that makes or breaks a thing like this new york has very little to do with it now if it were a play it would be different new york does make or break a play but it doesnt make or break a book it doesnt make or break a magazine the great mass of the readers are outside of new york and the rural districts are what we have got to go for they dont read much in new york they write and talk about what theyve written dont you worry  the rumor of fulkersons connection with the enterprise accompanied many of the paragraphs and he was able to stay marchs thirst for employment by turning over to him from day to day heaps of the manuscripts which began to pour in from his old syndicate writers as well as from adventurous volunteers all over the country with these in hand march began practically to plan the first number and to concrete a general scheme from the material and the experience they furnished they had intended to issue the first number with the new year and if it had been an affair of literature alone it would have been very easy but it was the art leg they limped on as fulkerson phrased it they had not merely to deal with the question of specific illustrations for this article or that but to decide the whole character of their illustrations and first of all to get a design for a cover which should both ensnare the heedless and captivate the fastidious these things did not come properly within marchs provincethat had been clearly understoodand for a while fulkerson tried to run the art leg himself the phrase was again his but it was simpler to make the phrase than to run the leg the difficult generation at once stiffbacked and slippery with which he had to do in this endeavor reduced even so buoyant an optimist to despair and after wasting some valuable weeks in trying to work the artists himself he determined to get an artist to work them but what artist it could not be a man with fixed reputation and a following he would be too costly and would have too many enemies among his brethren even if he would consent to undertake the job fulkerson had a man in mind an artist too who would have been the very thing if he had been the thing at all he had talent enough and his sort of talent would reach round the whole situation but as fulkerson said he was as many kinds of an ass as he was kinds of an artist   pg editors bookmarks      anticipative homesickness     any sort of stuff was good enough to make a preacher out of     appearance made him doubt their ability to pay so much     as much of his story as he meant to tell without prompting     considerable comfort in holding him accountable     extract what consolation lurks in the irreparable     flavors not very sharply distinguished from one another     handsome pittance     he expected to do the wrong thing when left to his own devices     hypothetical difficulty     neverblooming shrub     poverty as hopeless as any in the world     seeming interested in points necessarily indifferent to him     servant of those he loved     sigh with which ladies recognize one anothers martyrdom     sorry he hadnt asked more thats human nature     that isnt very oldor not so old as it used to be     tried to be homesick for them but failed     turn to their childrens opinion with deference     wish we didnt always recognize the facts as we do     part second     i  the evening when march closed with mrs greens reduced offer and decided to take her apartment the widow whose lodgings he had rejected sat with her daughter in an upper room at the back of her house in the shaded glow of the droplight she was sewing and the girl was drawing at the same table from time to time as they talked the girl lifted her head and tilted it a little on one side so as to get some desired effect of her work  its a mercy the cold weather holds off said the mother we should have to light the furnace unless we wanted to scare everybody away with a cold house and i dont know who would take care of it or what would become of us every way  they seem to have been scared away from a house that wasnt cold said the girl perhaps they might like a cold one but its too early for cold yet its only just in the beginning of november  the messenger says theyve had a sprinkling of snow  oh yes at st barnaby i dont know when they dont have sprinklings of snow there im awfully glad we havent got that winter before us  the widow sighed as mothers do who feel the contrast their experience opposes to the hopeful recklessness of such talk as this we may have a worse winter here she said darkly  then i couldnt stand it said the girl and i should go in for lighting out to florida doublequick  and how would you get to florida demanded her mother severely  oh by the usual conveyance pullman vestibuled train i suppose what makes you so blue mamma the girl was all the time sketching away rubbing out lifting her head for the effect and then bending it over her work again without looking at her mother  i am not blue alma but i cannot endure thisthis hopefulness of yours  why what harm does it do  harm echoed the mother  pending the effort she must make in saying the girl cut in yes harm youve kept your despair dusted off and ready for use at an instants notice ever since we came and what good has it done im going to keep on hoping to the bitter end thats what papa did  it was what the rev archibald leighton had done with all the consumptives buoyancy the morning he died he told them that now he had turned the point and was really going to get well the cheerfulness was not only in his disease but in his temperament its excess was always a little against him in his church work and mrs leighton was right enough in feeling that if it had not been for the ballast of her instinctive despondency he would have made shipwreck of such small chances of prosperity as befell him in life it was not from him that his daughter got her talent though he had left her his temperament intact of his widows legal thirds he was one of those men of whom the country people say when he is gone that the woman gets along better without him mrs leighton had long eked out their income by taking a summer boarder or two as a great favor into her family and when the greater need came she frankly gave up her house to the summerfolks as they call them in the country and managed it for their comfort from the small quarter of it in which she shut herself up with her daughter  the notion of shutting up is an exigency of the rounded period the fact is of course that alma leighton was not shut up in any sense whatever she was the pervading light if not force of the house she was a good cook and she managed the kitchen with the help of an irish girl while her mother looked after the rest of the housekeeping but she was not systematic she had inspiration but not discipline and her mother mourned more over the days when alma left the whole dinner to the irish girl than she rejoiced in those when one of almas great thoughts took form in a chickenpie of incomparable savor or in a matchless pudding the offdays came when her artistic nature was expressing itself in charcoal for she drew to the admiration of all among the lady boarders who could not draw the others had their reserves they readily conceded that alma had genius but they were sure she needed instruction on the other hand they were not so radical as to agree with the old painter who came every summer to paint the elms of the st barnaby meadows he contended that she needed to be a man in order to amount to anything but in this theory he was opposed by an authority of his own sex whom the lady sketchers believed to speak with more impartiality in a matter concerning them as much as alma leighton he said that instruction would do and he was not only younger and handsomer but he was fresher from the schools than old harrington who even the lady sketchers could see painted in an obsolescent manner his name was beatonangus beaton but he was not scotch or not more scotch than mary queen of scots was his father was a scotchman but beaton was born in syracuse new york and it had taken only three years in paris to obliterate many traces of native and ancestral manner in him he wore his black beard cut shorter than his mustache and a little pointed he stood with his shoulders well thrown back and with a lateral curve of his person when he talked about art which would alone have carried conviction even if he had not had a thick dark bang coming almost to the brows of his mobile gray eyes and had not spoken english with quick staccato impulses so as to give it the effect of epigrammatic and sententious french one of the ladies said that you always thought of him as having spoken french after it was over and accused herself of wrong in not being able to feel afraid of him none of the ladies was afraid of him though they could not believe that he was really so deferential to their work as he seemed and they knew when he would not criticise mr harringtons work that he was just acting from principle  they may or may not have known the deference with which he treated almas work but the girl herself felt that his abrupt impersonal comment recognized her as a real sister in art he told her she ought to come to new york and draw in the league or get into some painters private class and it was the sense of duty thus appealed to which finally resulted in the hazardous experiment she and her mother were now making there were no logical breaks in the chain of their reasoning from past success with boarders in st barnaby to future success with boarders in new york of course the outlay was much greater the rent of the furnished house they had taken was such that if they failed their experiment would be little less than ruinous  but they were not going to fail that was what alma contended with a hardy courage that her mother sometimes felt almost invited failure if it did not deserve it she was one of those people who believe that if you dread harm enough it is less likely to happen she acted on this superstition as if it were a religion  if it had not been for my despair as you call it alma she answered i dont know where we should have been now  i suppose we should have been in st barnaby said the girl and if its worse to be in new york you see what your despairs done mamma but whats the use you meant well and i dont blame you you cant expect even despair to come out always just the way you want it perhaps youve used too much of it the girl laughed and mrs leighton laughed too like every one else she was not merely a prevailing mood as people are apt to be in books but was an irregularly spheroidal character with surfaces that caught the different lights of circumstance and reflected them alma got up and took a pose before the mirror which she then transferred to her sketch the room was pinned about with other sketches which showed with fantastic indistinctness in the shaded gaslight alma held up the drawing how do you like it  mrs leighton bent forward over her sewing to look at it youve got the mans face rather weak  yes thats so either i see all the hidden weakness thats in mens natures and bring it to the surface in their figures or else i put my own weakness into them either way its a drawback to their presenting a truly manly appearance as long as i have one of the miserable objects before me i can draw him but as soon as his backs turned i get to putting ladies into mens clothes i should think youd be scandalized mamma if you were a really feminine person it must be your despair that helps you to bear up but whats the matter with the young lady in young ladys clothes any dust on her  what expressions said mrs leighton really alma for a refined girl you are the most unrefined  go onabout the girl in the picture said alma slightly knocking her mother on the shoulder as she stood over her  i dont see anything to her whats she doing  oh just being made love to i suppose  shes perfectly insipid  youre awfully articulate mamma now if mr wetmore were to criticise that picture hed draw a circle round it in the air and look at it through that and tilt his head first on one side and then on the other and then look at you as if you were a figure in it and then collapse awhile and moan a little and gasp isnt your young lady a little tootoo and then hed try to get the word out of you and groan and suffer some more and youd say she is rather and that would give him courage and hed say i dont mean that shes so very of course not you understand perfectly i see it myself now well thenand hed take your pencil and begin to drawi should give her a little moreah yes i see the differenceyou see the difference and hed go off to some one else and youd know that youd been doing the wishywashiest thing in the world though he hadnt spoken a word of criticism and couldnt but he wouldnt have noticed the expression at all hed have shown you where your drawing was bad he doesnt care for what he calls the literature of a thing he says that will take care of itself if the drawings good he doesnt like my doing these chic things but im going to keep it up for i think its the nearest way to illustrating  she took her sketch and pinned it up on the door  and has mr beaton been about yet asked her mother  no said the girl with her back still turned and she added i believe hes in new york mr wetmores seen him  its a little strange he doesnt call  it would be if he were not an artist but artists never do anything like other people he was on his good behavior while he was with us and hes a great deal more conventional than most of them but even he cant keep it up thats what makes me really think that women can never amount to anything in art they keep all their appointments and fulfil all their duties just as if they didnt know anything about art well most of them dont weve got that new model today  what new model  the one mr wetmore was telling us about the old german hes splendid hes got the most beautiful head just like the old masters things he used to be humphrey williamss model for his biblicalpieces but since hes dead the old man hardly gets anything to do mr wetmore says there isnt anybody in the bible that williams didnt paint him as hes the law and the prophets in all his old testament pictures and hes joseph peter judas iscariot and the scribes and pharisees in the new  its a good thing people dont know how artists work or some of the most sacred pictures would have no influence said mrs leighton  why of course not cried the girl and the influence is the last thing a painter thinks ofor supposes he thinks of what he knows hes anxious about is the drawing and the color but people will never understand how simple artists are when i reflect what a complex and sophisticated being i am im afraid i can never come to anything in art or i should be if i hadnt genius  do you think mr beaton is very simple asked mrs leighton  mr wetmore doesnt think hes very much of an artist he thinks he talks too well they believe that if a man can express himself clearly he cant paint  and what do you believe  oh i can express myself too  the mother seemed to be satisfied with this evasion after a while she said i presume he will call when he gets settled  the girl made no answer to this one of the girls says that old model is an educated man he was in the war and lost a hand doesnt it seem a pity for such a man to have to sit to a class of affected geese like us as a model i declare it makes me sick and we shall keep him a week and pay him six or seven dollars for the use of his grand old head and then what will he do the last time he was regularly employed was when mr mace was working at his damascus massacre then he wanted so many arab sheiks and christian elders that he kept old mr lindau steadily employed for six months now he has to pick up odd jobs where he can  i suppose he has his pension said mrs leighton  no one of the girlsthat was the way alma always described her fellowstudentssays he has no pension he didnt apply for it for a long time and then there was a hitch about it and it was somethingedvetoed i believe she said  who vetoed it asked mrs leighton with some curiosity about the process which she held in reserve  i dont knowwhoever vetoes things i wonder what mr wetmore does think of ushis class we must seem perfectly crazy there isnt one of us really knows what shes doing it for or what she expects to happen when shes done it i suppose every one thinks she has genius i know the nebraska widow does for she says that unless you have genius it isnt the least use everybodys puzzled to know what she does with her baby when shes at workwhether she gives it soothing syrup i wonder how mr wetmore can keep from laughing in our faces i know he does behind our backs  mrs leightons mind wandered back to another point then if he says mr beaton cant paint i presume he doesnt respect him very much  oh he never said he couldnt paint but i know he thinks so he says hes an excellent critic  alma her mother said with the effect of breaking off what do you suppose is the reason he hasnt been near us  why i dont know mamma except that it would have been natural for another person to come and hes an artist at least artist enough for that  that doesnt account for it altogether he was very nice at st barnaby and seemed so interested in youyour work  plenty of people were nice at st barnaby that rich mrs horn couldnt contain her joy when she heard we were coming to new york but she hasnt poured in upon us a great deal since we got here  but thats different shes very fashionable and shes taken up with her own set but mr beatons one of our kind  thank you papa wasnt quite a tombstonecutter mamma  that makes it all the harder to bear he cant be ashamed of us perhaps he doesnt know where we are  do you wish to send him your card mamma the girl flushed and towered in scorn of the idea  why no alma returned her mother  well then said alma  but mrs leighton was not so easily quelled she had got her mind on mr beaton and she could not detach it at once besides she was one of those women they are commoner than the same sort of men whom it does not pain to take out their most intimate thoughts and examine them in the light of other peoples opinions but i dont see how he can behave so he must know that  that what mamma demanded the girl  that he influenced us a great deal in coming  he didnt if he dared to presume to think such a thing  now alma said her mother with the clinging persistence of such natures you know he did and its no use for you to pretend that we didnt count upon him inin every way you may not have noticed his attentions and i dont say you did but others certainly did and i must say that i didnt expect he would drop us so  drop us cried alma in a fury oh  yes drop us alma he must know where we are of course mr wetmores spoken to him about you and its a shame that he hasnt been near us i should have thought common gratitude common decency would have brought him afterafter all we did for him  we did nothing for himnothing he paid his board and that ended it  no it didnt alma you know what he used to sayabout its being like home and all that and i must say that after his attentions to you and all the things you told me he said i expected something very dif  a sharp peal of the doorbell thrilled through the house and as if the pull of the bellwire had twitched her to her feet mrs leighton sprang up and grappled with her daughter in their common terror  they both glared at the clock and made sure that it was five minutes after nine then they abandoned themselves some moments to the unrestricted play of their apprehensions     ii  why alma whispered the mother who in the world can it be at this time of night you dont suppose he  well im not going to the door anyhow mother i dont care who it is and of course he wouldnt be such a goose as to come at this hour she put on a look of miserable trepidation and shrank back from the door while the hum of the bell died away in the hall  what shall we do asked mrs leighton helplessly  let him go awaywhoever they are said alma  another and more peremptory ring forbade them refuge in this simple expedient  oh dear what shall we do perhaps its a despatch  the conjecture moved alma to no more than a rigid stare i shall not go she said a third ring more insistent than the others followed and she said you go ahead mamma and ill come behind to scream if its anybody we can look through the sidelights at the door first  mrs leighton fearfully led the way from the back chamber where they bad been sitting and slowly descended the stairs alma came behind and turned up the hall gasjet with a sudden flash that made them both jump a little the gas inside rendered it more difficult to tell who was on the threshold but mrs leighton decided from a timorous peep through the scrims that it was a lady and gentleman something in this distribution of sex emboldened her she took her life in her hand and opened the door  the lady spoke does mrs leighton live heah she said in a rich throaty voice and she feigned a reference to the agents permit she held in her hand  yes said mrs leighton she mechanically occupied the doorway while alma already quivered behind her with impatience of her impoliteness  oh said the lady who began to appear more and more a young lady ah didnt know but ah had mistaken the hoase ah suppose its rather late to see the apawtments and ah most ask you to pawdon us she put this tentatively with a delicately growing recognition of mrs leighton as the lady of the house and a humorous intelligence of the situation in the glance she threw alma over her mothers shoulder ahm afraid we most have frightened you  oh not at all said alma and at the same time her mother said will you walk in please  the gentleman promptly removed his hat and made the leightons an inclusive bow you awe very kind madam and i am sorry for the trouble we awe giving you he was tall and severelooking with a gray trooperish mustache and irongray hair and as alma decided irongray eyes his daughter was short plump and freshcolored with an effect of liveliness that did not all express itself in her broadvowelled rather formal speech with its odd valuations of some of the auxiliary verbs and its total elision of the canine letter  we awe from the soath she said and we arrived this mawning but we got this cyahd from the brokah just befo dinnah and so we awe rathah late  not at all its only nine oclock said mrs leighton she looked up from the card the young lady had given her and explained we havent got in our servants yet and we had to answer the bell ourselves and  you were frightened of coase said the young lady caressingly  the gentleman said they ought not to have come so late and he offered some formal apologies  we should have been just as much scared any time after five oclock alma said to the sympathetic intelligence in the girls face  she laughed out of coase ah would have my hawt in my moath all day long too if ah was living in a big hoase alone  a moment of stiffness followed mrs leighton would have liked to withdraw from the intimacy of the situation but she did not know how it was very well for these people to assume to be what they pretended but she reflected too late she had no proof of it except the agents permit they were all standing in the hall together and she prolonged the awkward pause while she examined the permit you are mr woodburn she asked in a way that alma felt implied he might not be  yes madam from charlottesboag virginia he answered with the slight umbrage a man shows when the strange cashier turns his check over and questions him before cashing it  alma writhed internally but outwardly remained subordinate she examined the other girls dress and decided in a superficial consciousness that she had made her own bonnet  i shall be glad to show you my rooms said mrs leighton with an irrelevant sigh you must excuse their being not just as i should wish them were hardly settled yet  dont speak of it madam said the gentleman if you can overlook the trouble we awe giving you at such an unseasonable houah  ahm a hoasekeepah mahself miss woodburn joined in and ah know ho to accyoant fo everything  mrs leighton led the way upstairs and the young lady decided upon the large front room and small side room on the third story she said she could take the small one and the other was so large that her father could both sleep and work in it she seemed not ashamed to ask if mrs leightons price was inflexible but gave way laughing when her father refused to have any bargaining with a haughty selfrespect which he softened to deference for mrs leighton his impulsiveness opened the way for some confidence from her and before the affair was arranged she was enjoying in her quality of clerical widow the balm of the virginians reverent sympathy they said they were church people themselves  ah dont know what yo mothah means by yo hoase not being in oddah the young lady said to alma as they went downstairs together ahm a great hoasekeepah mahself and ah mean what ah say  they had all turned mechanically into the room where the leightons were sitting when the woodburns rang mr woodburn consented to sit down and he remained listening to mrs leighton while his daughter bustled up to the sketches pinned round the room and questioned alma about them  ah suppose you awe going to be a great awtust she said in friendly banter when alma owned to having done the things ahve a great notion to take a few lessons mahself whos yo teachah  alma said she was drawing in mr wetmores class and miss woodburn said well its just beautiful miss leighton its grand ah suppose its raght expensive now mah goodness we have to cyoant the coast so much nowadays it seems to me we do nothing but cyoant it ahd like to hah something once without askin the price  well if you didnt ask it said alma i dont believe mr wetmore would ever know what the price of his lessons was he has to think when you ask him  why he most be chomming said miss woodburn perhaps ah maght get the lessons for nothing from him well ah believe in my soul ahll trah now ho did you begin and ho do you expect to get anything oat of it she turned on alma eyes brimming with a shrewd mixture of fun and earnest and alma made note of the fact that she had an early nineteenthcentury face round arch a little coquettish but extremely sensible and unspoiledlooking such as used to be painted a good deal in miniature at that period a tendency of her brown hair to twine and twist at the temples helped the effect a high comb would have completed it alma felt if she had her bonnet off it was almost a yankee countrygirl type but perhaps it appeared so to alma because it was like that pure anglosaxon alma herself with her dull dark skin slender in figure slow in speech with aristocratic forms in her long hands and the oval of her fine face pointed to a long chin felt herself much more southern in style than this blooming bubbling bustling virginian  i dont know she answered slowly  going to take potraits suggested miss woodburn or just paint the ahdeal a demure burlesque lurked in her tone  i suppose i dont expect to paint at all said alma im going to illustrate booksif anybody will let me  ah should think theyd just joamp at you said miss woodburn ahll tell you what lets do miss leighton you make some pictures and ahll wrahte a book fo them ahve got to do something ali maght as well wrahte a book you know we southerners have all had to go to woak but ah dont mand it i tell papa i shouldnt ca fo the disgrace of bein poo if it wasnt fo the inconvenience  yes its inconvenient said alma but you forget it when youre at work dont you think  mah yes perhaps thats one reason why poo people have to woak so hawdto keep their wands off their poverty  the girls both tittered and turned from talking in a low tone with their backs toward their elders and faced them  well madison said mr woodburn it is time we should go i bid you goodnight madam he bowed to mrs leighton goodnight he bowed again to alma  his daughter took leave of them in formal phrase but with a jolly cordiality of manner that deformalized it we shall be roand raght soon in the mawning then she threatened at the door  we shall be all ready for you alma called after her down the steps  well alma her mother asked when the door closed upon them  she doesnt know any more about art said alma thannothing at all but shes jolly and goodhearted she praised everything that was bad in my sketches and said she was going to take lessons herself when a person talks about taking lessons as if they could learn it you know where they belong artistically  mrs leighton shook her head with a sigh i wish i knew where they belonged financially we shall have to get in two girls at once i shall have to go out the first thing in the morning and then our troubles will begin  well didnt you want them to begin i will stay home and help you get ready our prosperity couldnt begin without the troubles if you mean boarders and boarders mean servants i shall be very glad to be afflicted with a cook for a while myself  yes but we dont know anything about these people or whether they will be able to pay us did she talk as if they were well off  she talked as if they were poor poo she called it  yes how queerly she pronounced said mrs leighton well i ought to have told them that i required the first week in advance  mamma if thats the way youre going to act  oh of course i couldnt after he wouldnt let her bargain for the rooms i didnt like that  i did and you can see that they were perfect ladies or at least one of them alma laughed at herself but her mother did not notice  their being ladies wont help if theyve got no money it ll make it all the worse  very well then we have no money either were a match for them any day there we can show them that two can play at that game     iii  arnus beatons studio looked at first glance like many other painters studios a gray wall quadrangularly vaulted to a large north light casts of feet hands faces hung to nails about prints sketches in oil and watercolor stuck here and there lower down a rickety table with paint and palettes and bottles of varnish and siccative tossed comfortlessly on it an easel with a strip of some faded mediaeval silk trailing from it a lay figure simpering in incomplete nakedness with its head on one side and a stocking on one leg and a japanese dress dropped before it dusty rugs and skins kicking over the varnished floor canvases faced to the mopboard an open trunk overflowing with costumes these features one might notice anywhere but besides there was a bookcase with an unusual number of books in it and there was an open colonial writingdesk clawfooted brasshandled and scutcheoned with foreign periodicalsfrench and englishlittering its leaf and some pages of manuscript scattered among them above all there was a sculptors revolving stand supporting a bust which beaton was modelling with an eye fixed as simultaneously as possible on the clay and on the head of the old man who sat on the platform beside it  few men have been able to get through the world with several gifts to advantage in all and most men seem handicapped for the race if they have more than one but they are apparently immensely interested as well as distracted by them when beaton was writing he would have agreed up to a certain point with any one who said literature was his proper expression but then when he was painting up to a certain point he would have maintained against the world that he was a colorist and supremely a colorist at the certain point in either art he was apt to break away in a frenzy of disgust and wreak himself upon some other in these moods he sometimes designed elevations of buildings very striking very original very chic very everything but habitable it was in this way that he had tried his hand on sculpture which he had at first approached rather slightingly as a mere decorative accessory of architecture but it had grown in his respect till he maintained that the accessory business ought to be all the other way that temples should be raised to enshrine statues not statues made to ornament temples that was putting the cart before the horse with a vengeance this was when he had carried a plastic study so far that the sculptors who saw it said that beaton might have been an architect but would certainly never be a sculptor at the same time he did some hurried nervous things that had a popular charm and that sold in plaster reproductions to the profit of another beaton justly despised the popular charm in these as well as in the paintings he sold from time to time he said it was flat burglary to have taken money for them and he would have been living almost wholly upon the bounty of the old tombstonecutter in syracuse if it had not been for the syndicate letters which he supplied to fulkerson for ten dollars a week  they were very well done but he hated doing them after the first two or three and had to be punched up for them by fulkerson who did not cease to prize them and who never failed to punch him up beaton being what he was fulkerson was his creditor as well as patron and fulkerson being what he was had an enthusiastic patience with the elusive facile adaptable unpractical nature of beaton he was very proud of his artletters as he called them but then fulkerson was proud of everything he secured for his syndicate the fact that he had secured it gave it value he felt as if he had written it himself  one art trod upon anothers heels with beaton the day before he had rushed upon canvas the conception of a picture which he said to himself was glorious and to others at the table dhote of maroni was not bad he had worked at it in a fury till the light failed him and he execrated the dying day but he lit his lamp and transferred the process of his thinking from the canvas to the opening of the syndicate letter which he knew fulkerson would be coming for in the morning he remained talking so long after dinner in the same strain as he had painted and written in that he could not finish his letter that night the next morning while he was making his tea for breakfast the postman brought him a letter from his father enclosing a little check and begging him with tender almost deferential urgence to come as lightly upon him as possible for just now his expenses were very heavy it brought tears of shame into beatons eyesthe fine smouldering floating eyes that many ladies admired under the thick bangand he said to himself that if he were half a man he would go home and go to work cutting gravestones in his fathers shop but he would wait at least to finish his picture and as a sop to his conscience to stay its immediate ravening he resolved to finish that syndicate letter first and borrow enough money from fulkerson to be able to send his fathers check back or if not that then to return the sum of it partly in fulkersons check while he still teemed with both of these good intentions the old man from whom he was modelling his head of judas came and beaton saw that he must get through with him before he finished either the picture or the letter he would have to pay him for the time anyway he utilized the remorse with which he was tingling to give his judas an expression which he found novel in the treatment of that charactera look of such touching appealing selfabhorrence that beatons artistic joy in it amounted to rapture between the breathless moments when he worked in dead silence for an effect that was trying to escape him he sang and whistled fragments of comic opera  in one of the hushes there came a blow on the outside of the door that made beaton jump and swear with a modified profanity that merged itself in apostrophic prayer he knew it must be fulkerson and after roaring come in he said to the model that ll do this morning lindau  fulkerson squared his feet in front of the bust and compared it by fleeting glances with the old man as he got stiffly up and suffered beaton to help him on with his thin shabby overcoat  can you come tomorrow lindau  no not tomorrow mr peaton i haf to zit for the young ladties  oh said beaton wetmores class is miss leighton doing you  i dont know their namess lindau began when fulkerson said  hope you havent forgotten mine mr lindau i met you with mr march at maronis one night fulkerson offered him a universally shakable hand  oh yes i am gladt to zee you again mr vulkerson and mr margehe dont zeem to gome any more  up to his eyes in work been moving on from boston and getting settled and starting in on our enterprise beaton here hasnt got a very flattering likeness of you hey well goodmorning he said for lindau appeared not to have heard him and was escaping with a bow through the door  beaton lit a cigarette which he pinched nervously between his lips before he spoke youve come for that letter i suppose fulkerson it isnt done  fulkerson turned from staring at the bust to which he had mounted what you fretting about that letter for i dont want your letter  beaton stopped biting his cigarette and looked at him dont want my letter oh very good he bristled up he took his cigarette from his lips and blew the smoke through his nostrils and then looked at fulkerson  no i dont want your letter i want you  beacon disdained to ask an explanation but he internally lowered his crest while he continued to look at fulkerson without changing his defiant countenance this suited fulkerson well enough and he went on with relish im going out of the syndicate business old man and im on a new thing he put his leg over the back of a chair and rested his foot on its seat and with one hand in his pocket he laid the scheme of every other week before beaton with the help of the other the artist went about the room meanwhile with an effect of indifference which by no means offended fulkerson he took some water into his mouth from a tumbler which he blew in a fine mist over the head of judas before swathing it in a dirty cotton cloth he washed his brushes and set his palette he put up on his easel the picture he had blocked on the day before and stared at it with a gloomy face then he gathered the sheets of his unfinished letter together and slid them into a drawer of his writingdesk by the time he had finished and turned again to fulkerson fulkerson was saying i did think we could have the first number out by newyears but it will take longer than thata month longer but im not sorry for the holidays kill everything and by february or the middle of february people will get their breath again and begin to look round and ask whats new then well reply in the language of shakespeare and milton every other week and dont you forget it he took down his leg and asked got a pipe of baccy anywhere  beaton nodded at a clay stem sticking out of a japanese vase of bronze on his mantel theres yours he said and fulkerson said thanks and filled the pipe and sat down and began to smoke tranquilly  beaton saw that he would have to speak now and what do you want with me  you oh yes fulkerson humorously dramatized a return to himself from a pensive absence want you for the art department  beaton shook his head im not your man fulkerson he said compassionately you want a more practical hand one thats in touch with whats going im getting further and further away from this century and its claptrap i dont believe in your enterprise i dont respect it and i wont have anything to do with it it wouldchoke me that kind of thing  thats all right said fulkerson he esteemed a man who was not going to let himself go cheap or if it isnt we can make it you and march will pull together firstrate i dont care how much ideal you put into the thing the more the better i can look after the other end of the schooner myself  you dont understand me said beaton im not trying to get a rise out of you im in earnest what you want is some man who can have patience with mediocrity putting on the style of genius and with genius turning mediocrity on his hands i havent any luck with men i dont get on with them im not popular beaton recognized the fact with the satisfaction which it somehow always brings to human pride  so much the better fulkerson was ready for him at this point i dont want you to work the oldestablished racket the reputations when i want them ill go to them with a pocketful of rocksknockdown argument but my idea is to deal with the volunteer material look at the way the periodicals are carried on now names names names in a country thats just boiling over with literary and artistic ability of every kind the new fellows have no chance the editors all engage their material i dont believe there are fifty volunteer contributions printed in a year in all the new york magazines its all wrong its suicidal every other week is going back to the good old anonymous system the only fair system its worked well in literature and it will work well in art  it wont work well in art said beaton there you have a totally different set of conditions what youll get by inviting volunteer illustrations will be a lot of amateur trash and how are you going to submit your literature for illustration it cant be done at any rate i wont undertake to do it  well get up a school of illustration said fulkerson with cynical security you can read the things and explain em and your pupils can make their sketches under your eye they wouldnt be much further out than most illustrations are if they never knew what they were illustrating you might select from what comes in and make up a sort of pictorial variations to the literature without any particular reference to it well i understand you to accept  no you dont  that is to consent to help us with your advice and criticism thats all i want it wont commit you to anything and you can be as anonymous as anybody at the door fulkerson added bytheway the new manthe fellow thats taken my old syndicate businesswill want you to keep on but i guess hes going to try to beat you down on the price of the letters hes going in for retrenchment i brought along a check for this one im to pay for that he offered beaton an envelope  i cant take it fulkerson the letters paid for already fulkerson stepped forward and laid the envelope on the table among the tubes of paint  it isnt the letter merely i thought you wouldnt object to a little advance on your every other week work till you kind of got started  beaton remained inflexible it cant be done fulkerson dont i tell you i cant sell myself out to a thing i dont believe in cant you understand that  oh yes i can understand that firstrate i dont want to buy you i want to borrow you its all right see come round when you can id like to introduce you to old march thats going to be our address he put a card on the table beside the envelope and beaton allowed him to go without making him take the check back he had remembered his fathers plea that unnerved him and he promised himself again to return his fathers poor little check and to work on that picture and give it to fulkerson for the check he had left and for his back debts he resolved to go to work on the picture at once he had set his palette for it but first he looked at fulkersons check it was for only fifty dollars and the canny scotch blood in beaton rebelled he could not let this picture go for any such money he felt a little like a man whose generosity has been trifled with the conflict of emotions broke him up and he could not work     iv  the day wasted away in beatons hands at halfpast four oclock he went out to tea at the house of a lady who was at home that afternoon from four till seven by this time beaton was in possession of one of those other selves of which we each have several about us and was again the laconic staccato rather worldlified young artist whose moments of a controlled utterance and a certain distinction of manner had commended him to mrs horns fancy in the summer at st barnaby  mrs horns rooms were large and they never seemed very full though this perhaps was because people were always so quiet the ladies who outnumbered the men ten to one as they always do at a new york tea were dressed in sympathy with the low tone every one spoke in and with the subdued light which gave a crepuscular uncertainty to the few objects the dim pictures the unexcited upholstery of the rooms one breathed free of bricabrac there and the newcomer breathed softly as one does on going into church after service has begun this might be a suggestion from the voiceless behavior of the manservant who let you in but it was also because mrs horns at home was a ceremony a decorum and not festival at far greater houses there was more gayety at richer houses there was more freedom the suppression at mrs horns was a personal not a social effect it was an efflux of her character demure silentious vague but very correct  beaton easily found his way to her around the grouped skirts and among the detached figures and received a pressure of welcome from the hand which she momentarily relaxed from the teapot she sat behind a table put crosswise of a remote corner and offered tea to people whom a niece of hers received provisionally or sped finally in the outer room they did not usually take tea and when they did they did not usually drink it but beaton was feverishly glad of his cup he took rum and lemon in it and stood talking at mrs horns side till the next arrival should displace him he talked in his french manner  i have been hoping to see you she said i wanted to ask you about the leightons did they really come  i believe so they are in townyes i havent seen them  then you dont know how theyre getting onthat pretty creature with her cleverness and poor mrs leighton i was afraid they were venturing on a rash experiment do you know where they are  in west eleventh street somewhere miss leighton is in mr wetmores class  i must look them up do you know their number  not at the moment i can find out  do said mrs horn what courage they must have to plunge into new york as theyve done i really didnt think they would i wonder if theyve succeeded in getting anybody into their house yet  i dont know said beaton  i discouraged their coming all i could she sighed and i suppose you did too but its quite useless trying to make people in a place like st barnaby understand how it is in town  yes said beaton he stirred his tea while inwardly he tried to believe that he had really discouraged the leightons from coming to new york perhaps the vexation of his failure made him call mrs horn in his heart a fraud  yes she went on it is very very hard and when they wont understand and rush on their doom you feel that they are going to hold you respons  mrs horns eyes wandered from beaton her voice faltered in the faded interest of her remark and then rose with renewed vigor in greeting a lady who came up and stretched her glove across the teacups  beaton got himself away and out of the house with a much briefer adieu to the niece than he had meant to make the patronizing compassion of mrs horn for the leightons filled him with indignation toward her toward himself there was no reason why he should not have ignored them as he had done but there was a feeling it was his nature to be careless and he had been spoiled into recklessness he neglected everybody and only remembered them when it suited his whim or his convenience but he fiercely resented the inattentions of others toward himself he had no scruple about breaking an engagement or failing to keep an appointment he made promises without thinking of their fulfilment and not because he was a faithless person but because he was imaginative and expected at the time to do what he said but was fickle and so did not as most of his shortcomings were of a society sort no great harm was done to anybody else he had contracted somewhat the circle of his acquaintance by what some people called his rudeness but most people treated it as his oddity and were patient with it one lady said she valued his coming when he said he would come because it had the charm of the unexpected only it shows that it isnt always the unexpected that happens she explained  it did not occur to him that his behavior was immoral he did not realize that it was creating a reputation if not a character for him while we are still young we do not realize that our actions have this effect it seems to us that people will judge us from what we think and feel later we find out that this is impossible perhaps we find it out too late some of us never find it out at all  in spite of his shame about the leightons beaton had no present intention of looking them up or sending mrs horn their address as a matter of fact he never did send it but he happened to meet mr wetmore and his wife at the restaurant where he dined and he got it of the painter for himself he did not ask him how miss leighton was getting on but wetmore launched out with alma for a tacit text on the futility of women generally going in for art even when they have talent theyve got too much against them where a girl doesnt seem very strong like miss leighton no amount of chic is going to help  his wife disputed him on behalf of her sex as women always do  no dolly he persisted shed better be home milking the cows and leading the horse to water  do you think shed better be up till two in the morning at balls and going all day to receptions and luncheons  oh guess it isnt a question of that even if she werent drawing you knew them at home he said to beaton  yes  i remember her mother said you suggested me well the girl has some notion of it theres no doubt about that butshes a woman the trouble with these talented girls is that theyre all woman if they werent there wouldnt be much chance for the men beaton but weve got providence on our own side from the start im able to watch all their inspirations with perfect composure i know just how soon its going to end in nervous breakdown somebody ought to marry them all and put them out of their misery  and what will you do with your students who are married already his wife said she felt that she had let him go on long enough  oh they ought to get divorced  you ought to be ashamed to take their money if thats what you think of them  my dear i have a wife to support  beaton intervened with a question do you mean that miss leighton isnt standing it very well  how do i know she isnt the kind that bends shes the kind that breaks  after a little silence mrs wetmore asked wont you come home with us mr beaton  thank you no i have an engagement  i dont see why that should prevent you said wetmore but you always were a punctilious cuss well  beaton lingered over his cigar but no one else whom he knew came in and he yielded to the threefold impulse of conscience of curiosity of inclination in going to call at the leightons he asked for the ladies and the maid showed him into the parlor where he found mrs leighton and miss woodburn  the widow met him with a welcome neatly marked by resentment she meant him to feel that his not coming sooner had been noticed miss woodburn bubbled and gurgled on and did what she could to mitigate his punishment but she did not feel authorized to stay it till mrs leighton by studied avoidance of her daughters name obliged beaton to ask for her then miss woodburn caught up her work and said ahll go and tell her mrs leighton at the top of the stairs she found alma and alma tried to make it seem as if she had not been standing there mah goodness chald theres the handsomest young man asking for you down there you evah saw alh told you mothah ah would come up fo you  whatwho is it  dont you know but bo could you hes got the most beautiful eyes and he weas his hai in a bang and he talks english like it was something else and his names mr beaton  did heask for me said alma with a dreamy tone she put her hand on the stairs rail and a little shiver ran over her  didnt i tell you of coase he did and you ought to go raght down if you want to save the poo fellahs lahfe you mothahs just freezin him to death     v  she is cried alma tchk she flew downstairs and flitted swiftly into the room and fluttered up to beaton and gave him a crushing handshake  how very kind of you to come and see us mr beaton when did you come to new york dont you find it warm here weve only just lighted the furnace but with this mild weather it seems too early mamma does keep it so hot she rushed about opening doors and shutting registers and then came back and sat facing him from the sofa with a mask of radiant cordiality how have you been since we saw you  very well said beaton i hope youre well miss leighton  oh perfectly i think new york agrees with us both wonderfully i never knew such air and to think of our not having snow yet i should think everybody would want to come here why dont you come mr beaton  beaton lifted his eyes and looked at her ii live in new york he faltered  in new york city she exclaimed  surely alma said her mother you remember mr beatons telling us he lived in new york  but i thought you came from rochester or was it syracuse i always get those places mixed up  probably i told you my father lived at syracuse ive been in new york ever since i came home from paris said beaton with the confusion of a man who feels himself played upon by a woman  from paris alma echoed leaning forward with her smiling mask tight on wasnt it munich where you studied  i was at munich too i met wetmore there  oh do you know mr wetmore  why alma her mother interposed again it was mr beaton who told you of mr wetmore  was it why yes to be sure it was mrs horn who suggested mr ilcomb i remember now i cant thank you enough for having sent me to mr wetmore mr beaton isnt he delightful oh yes im a perfect wetmorian i can assure you the whole class is the same way  i just met him and mrs wetmore at dinner said beaton attempting the recovery of something that he had lost through the girls shining ease and steely sprightliness she seemed to him so smooth and hard with a repellent elasticity from which he was flung off i hope youre not working too hard miss leighton  oh no i enjoy every minute of it and grow stronger on it do i look very much wasted away she looked him full in the face brilliantly smiling and intentionally beautiful  no he said with a slow sadness i never saw you looking better  poor mr beaton she said in recognition of his doleful tune it seems to be quite a blow  oh no  i remember all the good advice you used to give me about not working too hard and probably its that thats saved my lifethat and the househunting has mamma told you of our adventures in getting settled  some time we must it was such fun and didnt you think we were fortunate to get such a pretty house you must see both our parlors she jumped up and her mother followed her with a bewildered look as she ran into the back parlor and flashed up the gas  come in here mr beaton i want to show you the great feature of the house she opened the low windows that gave upon a glazed veranda stretching across the end of the room just think of this in new york you cant see it very well at night but when the southern sun pours in here all the afternoon  yes i can imagine it he said he glanced up at the birdcage hanging from the roof i suppose gypsy enjoys it  you remember gypsy she said and she made a cooing kissing little noise up at the bird who responded drowsily poor old gypsum well he shant be disturbed yes its gyps delight and colonel woodburn likes to write here in the morning think of us having a real live author in the house and miss woodburn im so glad youve seen her theyre southern people  yes that was obvious in her case  from her accent isnt it fascinating i didnt believe i could ever endure southerners but were like one family with the woodburns i should think youd want to paint miss woodburn dont you think her coloring is delicious and such a quaint kind of eighteenthcentury type of beauty but shes perfectly lovely every way and everything she says is so funny the southerners seem to be such great talkers better than we are dont you think  i dont know said beaton in pensive discouragement he was sensible of being manipulated operated but he was helpless to escape from the performer or to fathom her motives his pensiveness passed into gloom and was degenerating into sulky resentment when he went away after several failures to get back to the old ground he had held in relation to alma he retrieved something of it with mrs leighton but alma glittered upon him to the last with a keen impenetrable candor a childlike singleness of glance covering unfathomable reserve  well alma said her mother when the door had closed upon him  well mother then after a moment she said with a rush did you think i was going to let him suppose we were piqued at his not coming did you suppose i was going to let him patronize us or think that we were in the least dependent on his favor or friendship  her mother did not attempt to answer her she merely said i shouldnt think he would come any more  well we have got on so far without him perhaps we can live through the rest of the winter  i couldnt help feeling sorry for him he was quite stupefied i could see that he didnt know what to make of you  hes not required to make anything of me said alma  do you think he really believed you had forgotten all those things  impossible to say mamma  well i dont think it was quite right alma  ill leave him to you the next time miss woodburn said you were freezing him to death when i came down  that was quite different but there wont be any next time im afraid sighed mrs leighton  beaton went home feeling sure there would not he tried to read when he got to his room but almas looks tones gestures whirred through and through the woof of the story like shuttles he could not keep them out and he fell asleep at last not because he forgot them but because he forgave them he was able to say to himself that he had been justly cut off from kindness which he knew how to value in losing it he did not expect ever to right himself in almas esteem but he hoped some day to let her know that he had understood it seemed to him that it would be a good thing if she should find it out after his death he imagined her being touched by it under those circumstances     vi  in the morning it seemed to beaton that he had done himself injustice when he uncovered his judas and looked at it he could not believe that the man who was capable of such work deserved the punishment miss leighton had inflicted upon him he still forgave her but in the presence of a thing like that he could not help respecting himself he believed that if she could see it she would be sorry that she had cut herself off from his acquaintance he carried this strain of conviction all through his syndicate letter which he now took out of his desk and finished with an increasing security of his opinions and a mounting severity in his judgments he retaliated upon the general condition of art among us the pangs of wounded vanity which alma had made him feel and he folded up his manuscript and put it in his pocket almost healed of his humiliation he had been able to escape from its sting so entirely while he was writing that the notion of making his life more and more literary commended itself to him as it was now evident that the future was to be one of renunciation of selfforgetting an oblivion tinged with bitterness he formlessly reasoned in favor of reconsidering his resolution against fulkersons offer one must call it reasoning but it was rather that swift internal dramatization which constantly goes on in persons of excitable sensibilities and which now seemed to sweep beaton physically along toward the every other week office and carried his mind with lightning celerity on to a time when he should have given that journal such quality and authority in matters of art as had never been enjoyed by any in america before with the prosperity which he made attend his work he changed the character of the enterprise and with fulkersons enthusiastic support he gave the public an art journal of as high grade as les lettres et les arts and very much that sort of thing all this involved now the unavailing regret of alma leighton and now his reconciliation with her they were married in grace church because beaton had once seen a marriage there and had intended to paint a picture of it some time  nothing in these fervid fantasies prevented his responding with due dryness to fulkersons cheery hello old man when he found himself in the building fitted up for the every other week office fulkersons room was back of the smaller one occupied by the bookkeeper they had been respectively the receptionroom and diningroom of the little place in its dwellinghouse days and they had been simply and tastefully treated in their transformation into business purposes the narrow old trim of the doors and windows had been kept and the quaintly ugly marble mantels the architect had said better let them stay they expressed epoch if not character  well have you come round to go to work just hang up your coat on the floor anywhere fulkerson went on  ive come to bring you that letter said beaton all the more haughtily because he found that fulkerson was not alone when he welcomed him in these free and easy terms there was a quietlooking man rather stout and a little above the middle height with a full closecropped irongray beard seated beyond the table where fulkerson tilted himself back with his knees set against it and leaning against the mantel there was a young man with a singularly gentle face in which the look of goodness qualified and transfigured a certain simplicity his large blue eyes were somewhat prominent and his rather narrow face was drawn forward in a nose a little too long perhaps if it had not been for the full chin deeply cut below the lip and jutting firmly forward  introduce you to mr march our editor mr beaton fulkerson said rolling his head in the direction of the elder man and then nodding it toward the younger he said mr dryfoos mr beaton beaton shook hands with march and then with mr dryfoos and fulkerson went on gayly we were just talking of you beatonwell you know the old saying mr march as i told you is our editor and mr dryfoos has charge of the publishing departmenthes the countingroom incarnate the source of power the fountain of corruption the element that prevents journalism being the high and holy thing that it would be if there were no money in it mr dryfoos turned his large mild eyes upon beaton and laughed with the uneasy concession which people make to a character when they do not quite approve of the characters language what mr march and i are trying to do is to carry on this thing so that there wont be any money in itor very little and were planning to give the public a better article for the price than its ever had before now heres a dummy weve had made up for every other week and as weve decided to adopt it we would naturally like your opinion of it sos to know what opinion to have of you he reached forward and pushed toward beaton a volume a little above the size of the ordinary duodecimo book its ivorywhite pebbled paper cover was prettily illustrated with a watercolored design irregularly washed over the greater part of its surface quite across the page at top and narrowing from right to left as it descended in the triangular space left blank the title of the periodical and the publishers imprint were tastefully lettered so as to be partly covered by the background of color  its like some of those tartarin books of daudets said beacon looking at it with more interest than he suffered to be seen but its a book not a magazine he opened its pages of thick mellow white paper with uncut leaves the first few pages experimentally printed in the type intended to be used and illustrated with some sketches drawn into and over the text for the sake of the effect  a daniela daniel come to judgment sit down danel and take it easy fulkerson pushed a chair toward beaton who dropped into it youre right danel its a book to all practical intents and purposes and what we propose to do with the american public is to give it twentyfour books like this a yeara complete libraryfor the absurd sum of six dollars we dont intend to sell emits no name for the transactionbut to give em and what we want to get out of youbeg borrow buy or steal from you is an opinion whether we shall make the american public this princely present in paper covers like this or in some sort of flexible boards so they can set them on the shelf and say no more about it now danel come to judgment as our respected friend shylock remarked  beacon had got done looking at the dummy and he dropped it on the table before fulkerson who pushed it away apparently to free himself from partiality i dont know anything about the business side and i cant tell about the effect of either style on the sales but youll spoil the whole character of the cover if you use anything thicker than that thickish paper  all right very good firstrate the ayes have it paper it is i dont mind telling you that we had decided for that paper before you came in mr march wanted it because he felt in his bones just the way you do about it and mr dryfoos wanted it because hes the countingroom incarnate and its cheaper and i wanted it because i always like to go with the majority now what do you think of that little design itself  the sketch beaton pulled the book toward him again and looked at it again rather decorative drawings not remarkable graceful rather nice he pushed the book away again and fulkerson pulled it to his aide of the table  well thats a piece of that amateur trash you despise so much i went to a painter i knowbytheway he was guilty of suggesting you for this thing but i told him i was ahead of himand i got him to submit my idea to one of his class and thats the result well now there aint anything in this world that sells a book like a pretty cover and were going to have a pretty cover for every other week every time weve cut loose from the old traditional quarto literary newspaper size and weve cut loose from the old twocolumn big page magazine size were going to have a duodecimo page clear black print and paper that ll make your mouth water and were going to have a fresh illustration for the cover of each number and we aint agoing to give the public any rest at all sometimes were going to have a delicate little landscape like this and sometimes were going to have an indelicate little figure or as much so as the law will allow  the young man leaning against the mantelpiece blushed a sort of protest  march smiled and said dryly those are the numbers that mr fulkerson is going to edit himself  exactly and mr beaton here is going to supply the floating females gracefully airing themselves against a sunset or something of that kind beaton frowned in embarrassment while fulkerson went on philosophically its astonishing how you fellows can keep it up at this stage of the proceedings you can paint things that your harshest critic would be ashamed to describe accurately youre as free as the theatre but thats neither here nor there what im after is the fact that were going to have variety in our titlepages and we are going to have novelty in the illustrations of the body of the book march here if he had his own way wouldnt have any illustrations at all  not because i dont like them mr beacon march interposed but because i like them too much i find that i look at the pictures in an illustrated article but i dont read the article very much and i fancy thats the case with most other people youve got to doing them so prettily that you take our eyes off the literature if you dont take our minds off  like the society beauties on the stage people go in for the beauty so much that they dont know what the play is but the boxoffice gets there all the same and thats what mr dryfoos wants fulkerson looked up gayly at mr dryfoos who smiled deprecatingly  it was different march went on when the illustrations used to be bad then the text had some chance  old legitimate drama days when ugliness and genius combined to storm the galleries said fulkerson  we can still make them bad enough said beaton ignoring fulkerson in his remark to march  fulkerson took the reply upon himself well you neednt make em so bad as the oldstyle cuts but you can make them unobtrusive modestly retiring weve got hold of a process something like that those french fellows gave daudet thirtyfive thousand dollars to write a novel to use with kind of thing that begins at one side or one corner and spreads in a sort of dim religious style over the print till you cant tell which is which then weve got a notion that where the pictures dont behave quite so sociably they can be dropped into the text like a little casual remark dont you know or a comment that has some connection or maybe none at all with whats going on in the story something like this fulkerson took away one knee from the table long enough to open the drawer and pull from it a book that he shoved toward beacon thats a spanish book i happened to see at brentanos and i froze to it on account of the pictures i guess theyre pretty good  do you expect to get such drawings in this country asked beaton after a glance at the book such charactersuch drama you wont  well im not so sure said fulkerson come to get our amateurs warmed up to the work but what i want is to get the physical effect so to speakget that sized picture into our page and set the fashion of it i shouldnt care if the illustration was sometimes confined to an initial letter and a tailpiece  couldnt be done here we havent the touch were good in some things but this isnt in our way said beaton stubbornly i cant think of a man who could do it that is among those that would  well think of some woman then said fulkerson easily ive got a notion that the women could help us out on this thing come to get em interested there aint anything so popular as female fiction why not try female art  the females themselves have been supposed to have been trying it for a good while march suggested and mr dryfoos laughed nervously beaton remained solemnly silent  yes i know fulkerson assented but i dont mean that kind exactly what we want to do is to work the ewig weibliche in this concern we want to make a magazine that will go for the womens fancy every time i dont mean with recipes for cooking and fashions and personal gossip about authors and society but real hightone literature that will show women triumphing in all the stories or else suffering tremendously weve got to recognize that women form threefourths of the reading public in this country and go for their tastes and their sensibilities and their sexpiety along the whole line they do like to think that women can do things better than men and if we can let it leak out and get around in the papers that the managers of every other week couldnt stir a peg in the line of the illustrations they wanted till they got a lot of godgifted girls to help them it ll make the fortune of the thing see  he looked sunnily round at the other men and march said you ought to be in charge of a siamese white elephant fulkerson its a disgrace to be connected with you  it seems to me said becton that youd better get a godgifted girl for your art editor  fulkerson leaned alertly forward and touched him on the shoulder with a compassionate smile my dear boy they havent got the genius of organization it takes a very masculine man for thata man who combines the most subtle and refined sympathies with the most forceful purposes and the most ferruginous willpower which his name is angus beaton and here he sets  the others laughed with fulkerson at his gross burlesque of flattery and becton frowned sheepishly i suppose you understand this mans style he growled toward march  he does my son said fulkerson he knows that i cannot tell a lie he pulled out his watch and then got suddenly upon his feet  its quarter of twelve and ive got an appointment beaton rose too and fulkerson put the two books in his lax hands take these along michelangelo da vinci my friend and put your multitudinous mind on them for about an hour and let us hear from you tomorrow we hang upon your decision  theres no deciding to be done said beaton you cant combine the two styles theyd kill each other  a danel a danel come to judgment i knew you could help us out take em along and tell us which will go the furthest with the ewig weibliche dryfoos i want a word with you he led the way into the front room flirting an airy farewell to beaton with his hand as he went     vii  march and beaton remained alone together for a moment and march said i hope you will think it worth while to take hold with us mr beaton mr fulkerson puts it in his own way of course but we really want to make a nice thing of the magazine he had that timidity of the elder in the presence of the younger man which the younger preoccupied with his own timidity in the presence of the elder cannot imagine besides march was aware of the gulf that divided him as a literary man from beaton as an artist and he only ventured to feel his way toward sympathy with him we want to make it good we want to make it high fulkerson is right about aiming to please the women but of course he caricatures the way of going about it  for answer beaton flung out i cant go in for a thing i dont understand the plan of  march took it for granted that he had wounded some exposed sensibility of beatons he continued still more deferentially mr fulkersons notioni must say the notion is his evolved from his syndicate experienceis that we shall do best in fiction to confine our selves to short stories and make each number complete in itself he found that the most successful things he could furnish his newspapers were short stories we americans are supposed to excel in writing them and most people begin with them in fiction and its mr fulkersons idea to work unknown talent as he says and so he thinks he can not only get them easily but can gradually form a school of shortstory writers i cant say i follow him altogether but i respect his experience we shall not despise translations of short stories but otherwise the matter will all be original and of course it wont all be short stories we shall use sketches of travel and essays and little dramatic studies and bits of biography and history but all very light and always short enough to be completed in a single number mr fulkerson believes in pictures and most of the things would be capable of illustration  i see said beaton  i dont know but this is the whole affair said march beginning to stiffen a little at the young mans reticence  i understand thank you for taking the trouble to explain goodmorning beaton bowed himself off without offering to shake hands  fulkerson came in after a while from the outer office and mr dryfoos followed him well what do you think of our art editor  is he our art editor asked march i wasnt quite certain when he left  did he take the books  yes he took the books  i guess hes all right then fulkerson added in concession to the umbrage he detected in march  beaton has his times of being the greatest ass in the solar system but he usually takes it out in personal conduct when it comes to work hes a regular horse  he appears to have compromised for the present by being a perfect mule said march  well hes in a transition state fulkerson allowed hes the man for us he really understands what we want youll see hell catch on that lurid glare of his will wear off in the course of time hes really a good fellow when you take him off his guard and hes full of ideas hes spread out over a good deal of ground at present and so hes pretty thin but come to gather him up into a lump theres a good deal of substance to him yes there is hes a firstrate critic and hes a nice fellow with the other artists they laugh at his universality but they all like him hes the best kind of a teacher when he condescends to it and hes just the man to deal with our volunteer work yes sir hes a prize well i must go now  fulkerson went out of the street door and then came quickly back bythebye march i saw that old dynamiter of yours round at beatons room yesterday  what old dynamiter of mine  that old onehanded dutchmanfriend of your youththe one we saw at maronis  ohlindau said march with a vague pang of self reproach for having thought of lindau so little after the first flood of his tender feeling toward him was past  yes our versatile friend was modelling him as judas iscariot lindau makes a firstrate judas and beaton has got a big thing in that head if he works the religious people right but what i was thinking of was thisit struck me just as i was going out of the door didnt you tell me lindau knew forty or fifty different languages  four or five yes  well we wont quarrel about the number the question is why not work him in the field of foreign literature you cant go over all their reviews and magazines and he could do the smelling for you if you could trust his nose would he know a good thing  i think he would said march on whom the scope of fulkersons suggestion gradually opened he used to have good taste and he must know the ground why its a capital idea fulkerson lindau wrote very fair english and he could translate with a little revision  and he would probably work cheap well hadnt you better see him about it i guess it ll be quite a windfall for him  yes it will ill look him up thank you for the suggestion fulkerson  oh dont mention it i dont mind doing every other week a good turn now and then when it comes in my way fulkerson went out again and this time march was finally left with mr dryfoos  mrs march was very sorry not to be at home when your sisters called the other day she wished me to ask if they had any afternoon in particular there was none on your mothers card  no sir said the young man with a flush of embarrassment that seemed habitual with him she has no day shes at home almost every day she hardly ever goes out  might we come some evening march asked we should be very glad to do that if she would excuse the informality then i could come with mrs march  mother isnt very formal said the young man she would be very glad to see you  then well come some night this week if you will let us when do you expect your father back  not much before christmas hes trying to settle up some things at moffitt  and what do you think of our art editor asked march with a smile for the change of subject  oh i dont know much about such things said the young man with another of his embarrassed flushes mr fulkerson seems to feel sure that he is the one for us  mr fulkerson seemed to think that i was the one for you too said march and he laughed thats what makes me doubt his infallibility but he couldnt do worse with mr beaton  mr dryfoos reddened and looked down as if unable or unwilling to cope with the difficulty of making a polite protest against marchs selfdepreciation he said after a moment its new business to all of us except mr fulkerson but i think it will succeed i think we can do some good in it  march asked rather absently some good then he added oh yes i think we can what do you mean by good improve the public taste elevate the standard of literature give young authors and artists a chance  this was the only good that had ever been in marchs mind except the good that was to come in a material way from his success to himself and to his family  i dont know said the young man and he looked down in a shamefaced fashion he lifted his head and looked into marchs face i suppose i was thinking that some time we might help along if we were to have those sketches of yours about life in every part of new york  marchs authorial vanity was tickled fulkerson has been talking to you about them he seemed to think they would be a card he believes that theres no subject so fascinating to the general average of people throughout the country as life in new york city and he liked my notion of doing these things march hoped that dryfoos would answer that fulkerson was perfectly enthusiastic about his notion but he did not need this stimulus and at any rate he went on without it the fact is its something that struck my fancy the moment i came here i found myself intensely interested in the place and i began to make notes consciously and unconsciously at once yes i believe i can get something quite attractive out of it i dont in the least know what it will be yet except that it will be very desultory and i couldnt at all say when i can get at it if we postpone the first number till february i might get a little paper into that yes i think it might be a good thing for us march said with modest selfappreciation  if you can make the comfortable people understand how the uncomfortable people live it will be a very good thing mr march sometimes it seems to me that the only trouble is that we dont know one another well enough and that the first thing is to do this the young fellow spoke with the seriousness in which the beauty of his face resided whenever he laughed his face looked weak even silly it seemed to be a sense of this that made him hang his head or turn it away at such times  thats true said march from the surface only and then those phases of low life are immensely picturesque of course we must try to get the contrasts of luxury for the sake of the full effect that wont be so easy you cant penetrate to the dinnerparty of a millionaire under the wing of a detective as you could to a carouse in mulberry street or to his childrens nursery with a philanthropist as you can to a streetboys lodginghouse march laughed and again the young man turned his head away still something can be done in that way by tact and patience     vii  that evening march went with his wife to return the call of the dryfoos ladies on their way uptown in the elevated he told her of his talk with young dryfoos i confess i was a little ashamed before him afterward for having looked at the matter so entirely from the aesthetic point of view but of course you know if i went to work at those things with an ethical intention explicitly in mind i should spoil them  of course said his wife she had always heard him say something of this kind about such things  he went on but i suppose thats just the point that such a nature as young dryfooss cant get hold of or keep hold of were a queer lot down there isabelperfect menagerie if it hadnt been that fulkerson got us together and really seems to know what he did it for i should say he was the oddest stick among us but when i think of myself and my own crankiness for the literary department and young dryfoos who ought really to be in the pulpit or a monastery or something for publisher and that young beaton who probably hasnt a moral fibre in his composition for the art man i dont know but we could give fulkerson odds and still beat him in oddity  his wife heaved a deep sigh of apprehension of renunciation of monition well im glad you can feel so light about it basil  light i feel gay with fulkerson at the helm i tell you the rocks and the lee shore had better keep out of the way he laughed with pleasure in his metaphor just when you think fulkerson has taken leave of his senses he says or does something that shows he is on the most intimate and inalienable terms with them all the time you know how ive been worrying over those foreign periodicals and trying to get some translations from them for the first number well fulkerson has brought his centipedal mind to bear on the subject and hes suggested that old german friend of mine i was telling you ofthe one i met in the restaurantthe friend of my youth  do you think he could do it asked mrs march sceptically  hes a perfect babel of strange tongues and hes the very man for the work and i was ashamed i hadnt thought of him myself for i suspect he needs the work  well be careful how you get mixed up with him then basil said his wife who had the natural misgiving concerning the friends of her husbands youth that all wives have you know the germans are so unscrupulously dependent you dont know anything about him now  im not afraid of lindau said march he was the best and kindest man i ever saw the most highminded the most generous he lost a hand in the war that helped to save us and keep us possible and that stump of his is character enough for me  oh you dont think i could have meant anything against him said mrs march with the tender fervor that every woman who lived in the time of the war must feel for those who suffered in it all that i meant was that i hoped you would not get mixed up with him too much youre so apt to be carried away by your impulses  they didnt carry me very far away in the direction of poor old lindau im ashamed to think said march i meant all sorts of fine things by him after i met him and then i forgot him and i had to be reminded of him by fulkerson  she did not answer him and he fell into a remorseful reverie in which he rehabilitated lindau anew and provided handsomely for his old age he got him buried with military honors and had a shaft raised over him with a medallion likeness by beaton and an epitaph by himself by the time they reached fortysecond street there was no time to write lindaus life however briefly before the train stopped  they had to walk up four blocks and then half a block across before they came to the indistinctive brownstone house where the dryfooses lived it was larger than some in the same block but the next neighborhood of a huge apartmenthouse dwarfed it again march thought he recognized the very flat in which he had disciplined the surly janitor but he did not tell his wife he made her notice the transition character of the street which had been mostly built up in apartmenthouses with here and there a single dwelling dropped far down beneath and beside them to that jagtoothed effect on the skyline so often observable in such new york streets i dont know exactly what the old gentleman bought here for he said as they waited on the steps after ringing unless he expects to turn it into flats byandby otherwise i dont believe hell get his money back  an irish servingman with a certain surprise that delayed him said the ladies were at home and let the marches in and then carried their cards upstairs the drawingroom where he said they could sit down while he went on this errand was delicately decorated in white and gold and furnished with a sort of extravagant good taste there was nothing to object to in the satin furniture the pale soft rich carpet the pictures and the bronze and china bricabrac except that their costliness was too evident everything in the room meant money too plainly and too much of it the marches recognized this in the hoarse whispers which people cannot get their voices above when they try to talk away the interval of waiting in such circumstances they conjectured from what they had heard of the dryfooses that this tasteful luxury in no wise expressed their civilization though when you come to that said march i dont know that mrs greens gimcrackery expresses ours  well basil i didnt take the gimcrackery that was your  the rustle of skirts on the stairs without arrested mrs march in the wellmerited punishment which she never failed to inflict upon her husband when the question of the gimcrackerythey always called it thatcame up she rose at the entrance of a brightlooking prettylooking mature youngish lady in black silk of a neutral implication who put out her hand to her and said with a very cheery very ladylike accent mrs march and then added to both of them while she shook hands with march and before they could get the name out of their months no not miss dryfoos neither of them nor mrs dryfoos mrs mandel the ladies will be down in a moment wont you throw off your sacque mrs march im afraid its rather warm here coming from the outside  i will throw it back if youll allow me said mrs march with a sort of provisionality as if pending some uncertainty as to mrs mandels quality and authority she did not feel herself justified in going further  but if she did not know about mrs mandel mrs mandel seemed to know about her oh well do she said with a sort of recognition of the propriety of her caution i hope you are feeling a little at home in new york we heard so much of your trouble in getting a flat from mr fulkerson  well a true bostonian doesnt give up quite so soon said mrs march  but i will say new york doesnt seem so far away now were here  im sure youll like it every one does mrs mandel added to march its very sharp out isnt it  rather sharp but after our boston winters i dont know but i ought to repudiate the word  ah wait till you have been here through march said mrs mandel she began with him but skillfully transferred the close of her remark and the little smile of menace that went with it to his wife  yes said mrs march or april either talk about our east winds  oh im sure they cant be worse than our winds mrs mandel returned caressingly  if we escape new york pneumonia march laughed it will only be to fall a prey to new york malaria as soon as the frost is out of the ground  oh but you know said mrs mandel i think our malaria has really been slandered a little its more a matter of drainageof plumbing i dont believe it would be possible for malaria to get into this house weve had it gone over so thoroughly  mrs march said while she tried to divine mrs mandels position from this statement its certainly the first duty  if mrs march could have had her way we should have had the drainage of our whole ward put in order said her husband before we ventured to take a furnished apartment for the winter  mrs mandel looked discreetly at mrs march for permission to laugh at this but at the same moment both ladies became preoccupied with a second rustling on the stairs  two tall welldressed young girls came in and mrs mandel introduced miss dryfoos mrs march and miss mela dryfoos mr march she added and the girls shook hands in their several ways with the marches  miss dryfoos had keen black eyes and her hair was intensely black her face but for the slight inward curve of the nose was regular and the smallness of her nose and of her mouth did not weaken her face but gave it a curious effect of fierceness of challenge she had a large black fan in her hand which she waved in talking with a slow watchful nervousness her sister was blonde and had a profile like her brothers but her chin was not so salient and the weak look of the mouth was not corrected by the spirituality or the fervor of his eyes though hers were of the same mottled blue she dropped into the low seat beside mrs mandel and intertwined her fingers with those of the hand which mrs mandel let her have she smiled upon the marches while miss dryfoos watched them intensely with her eyes first on one and then on the other as if she did not mean to let any expression of theirs escape her  my mother will be down in a minute she said to mrs march  i hope were not disturbing her it is so good of you to let us come in the evening mrs march replied  oh not at all said the girl we receive in the evening  when we do receive miss mela put in we dont always get the chance to she began a laugh which she checked at a smile from mrs mandel which no one could have seen to be reproving  miss dryfoos looked down at her fan and looked up defiantly at mrs march i suppose you have hardly got settled we were afraid we would disturb you when we called  oh no we were very sorry to miss your visit we are quite settled in our new quarters of course its all very different from boston  i hope its more of a sociable place there miss mela broke in again i never saw such an unsociable place as new york weve been in this house three months and i dont believe that if we stayed three years any of the neighbors would call  i fancy proximity doesnt count for much in new york march suggested  mrs mandel said thats what i tell miss mela but she is a very social nature and cant reconcile herself to the fact  no i cant the girl pouted i think it was twice as much fun in moffitt i wish i was there now  yes said march i think theres a great deal more enjoyment in those smaller places theres not so much going on in the way of public amusements and so people make more of one another there are not so many concerts theatres operas  oh theyve got a splendid operahouse in moffitt its just grand said miss mela  have you been to the opera here this winter mrs march asked of the elder girl  she was glaring with a frown at her sister and detached her eyes from her with an effort what did you say she demanded with an absent bluntness oh yes yes we went once father took a box at the metropolitan  then you got a good dose of wagner i suppose said march  what asked the girl  i dont think miss dryfoos is very fond of wagners music mrs mandel said i believe you are all great wagnerites in boston  im a very bad bostonian mrs mandel i suspect myself of preferring verdi march answered  miss dryfoos looked down at her fan again and said i like trovatore the best  its an opera i never get tired of said march and mrs march and mrs mandel exchanged a smile of compassion for his simplicity he detected it and added but i dare say i shall come down with the wagner fever in time ive been exposed to some malignant cases of it  that night we were there said miss mela they had to turn the gas down all through one part of it and the papers said the ladies were awful mad because they couldnt show their diamonds i dont wonder if they all had to pay as much for their boxes as we did we had to pay sixty dollars she looked at the marches for their sensation at this expense  march said well i think i shall take my box by the month then it must come cheaper wholesale  oh no it dont said the girl glad to inform him the people that own their boxes and that had to give fifteen or twenty thousand dollars apiece for them have to pay sixty dollars a night whenever theres a performance whether they go or not  then i should go every night march said  most of the ladies were low neck  march interposed well i shouldnt go lowneck  the girl broke into a fondly approving laugh at his drolling oh i guess you love to train us girls wanted to go low neck too but father said we shouldnt and mother said if we did she wouldnt come to the front of the box once well she didnt anyway we might just as well a gone low neck she stayed back the whole time and when they had that dancethe ballet you knowshe just shut her eyes well conrad didnt like that part much either but us girls and mrs mandel we brazened it out right in the front of the box we were about the only ones there that went high neck conrad had to wear a swallowtail but father hadnt any and he had to patch out with a white cravat you couldnt see what he had on in the back o the box anyway  mrs march looked at miss dryfoos who was waving her fan more and more slowly up and down and who when she felt herself looked at returned mrs marchs smile which she meant to be ingratiating and perhaps sympathetic with a flash that made her start and then ran her fierce eyes over marchs face here comes mother she said with a sort of breathlessness as if speaking her thought aloud and through the open door the marches could see the old lady on the stairs  she paused halfway down and turning called up coonrod coonrod you bring my shawl down with you  her daughter mela called out to her now mother christine ll give it to you for not sending mike  well i dont know where he is mely child the mother answered back he aint never around when hes wanted and when he aint it seems like a body couldnt git shet of him nohow  well you ought to ring for him cried miss mela enjoying the joke  her mother came in with a slow step her head shook slightly as she looked about the room perhaps from nervousness perhaps from a touch of palsy in either case the fact had a pathos which mrs march confessed in the affection with which she took her hard dry large old hand when she was introduced to her and in the sincerity which she put into the hope that she was well  im just middlin mrs dryfoos replied i aint never so well nowadays i tell fawther i dont believe it agrees with me very well here but he says ill git used to it hes away now out at moffitt she said to march and wavered on foot a moment before she sank into a chair she was a tall woman who had been a beautiful girl and her gray hair had a memory of blondeness in it like lindaus march noticed she wore a simple silk gown of a quakerly gray and she held a handkerchief folded square as it had come from the laundress something like the sabbath quiet of a little wooden meetinghouse in thick western woods expressed itself to him from her presence  laws mother said miss mela what you got that old thing on for if id a known youd a come down in that  coonrod said it was all right mely said her mother  miss mela explained to the marches mother was raised among the dunkards and she thinks its wicked to wear anything but a gray silk even for dressup  you haint never heared o the dunkards i reckon the old woman said to mrs march some folks calls em the beardy men because they dont never shave and they wash feet like they do in the testament my uncle was one he raised me  i guess pretty much everybodys a beardy man nowadays if he aint a dunkard  miss mela looked round for applause of her sally but march was saying to his wife its a pennsylvania german sect i believesomething like the quakers i used to see them when i was a boy  arent they something like the mennists asked mrs mandel  theyre good people said the old woman and the world d be a heap better off if there was more like em  her son came in and laid a soft shawl over her shoulders before he shook hands with the visitors i am glad you found your way here he said to them  christine who had been bending forward over her fan now lifted herself up with a sigh and leaned back in her chair  im sorry my father isnt here said the young man to mrs march hes never met you yet  no and i should like to see him we hear a great deal about your father you know from mr fulkerson  oh i hope you dont believe everything mr fulkerson says about people mela cried hes the greatest person for carrying on when he gets going i ever saw it makes christine just as mad when him and mother gets to talking about religion she says she knows he dont care anything more about it than the man in the moon i reckon he dont try it on much with father  your fawther aint ever been a perfessor her mother interposed but hes always been a good churchgoin man  not since we come to new york retorted the girl  hes been all broke up since he come to new york said the old woman with an aggrieved look  mrs mandel attempted a diversion have you heard any of our great new york preachers yet mrs march  no i havent mrs march admitted and she tried to imply by her candid tone that she intended to begin hearing them the very next sunday  there are a great many things here said conrad to take your thoughts off the preaching that you hear in most of the churches i think the city itself is preaching the best sermon all the time  i dont know that i understand you said march  mela answered for him oh conrad has got a lot of notions that nobody can understand you ought to see the church he goes to when he does go id about as lief go to a catholic church myself i dont see a bit o difference hes the greatest crony with one of their preachers he dresses just like a priest and he says he is a priest she laughed for enjoyment of the fact and her brother cast down his eyes  mrs march in her turn tried to take from it the personal tone which the talk was always assuming have you been to the fall exhibition she asked christine and the girl drew herself up out of the abstraction she seemed sunk in  the exhibition she looked at mrs mandel  the pictures of the academy you know mrs mandel explained where i wanted you to go the day you had your dress tried on  no we havent been yet is it good she had turned to mrs march again  i believe the fall exhibitions are never so good as the spring ones but there are some good pictures  i dont believe i care much about pictures said christine i dont understand them  ah thats no excuse for not caring about them said march lightly the painters themselves dont half the time  the girl looked at him with that glance at once defiant and appealing insolent and anxious which he had noticed before especially when she stole it toward himself and his wife during her sisters babble in the light of fulkersons history of the family its origin and its ambition he interpreted it to mean a sense of her sisters folly and an ignorant will to override his opinion of anything incongruous in themselves and their surroundings he said to himself that she was deathly proudtoo proud to try to palliate anything but capable of anything that would put others under her feet her eyes seemed hopelessly to question his wifes social quality and he fancied with not unkindly interest the inexperienced girls doubt whether to treat them with much or little respect he lost himself in fancies about her and her ideals necessarily sordid of her possibilities of suffering of the triumphs and disappointments before her her sister would accept both with a lightness that would keep no trace of either but in her they would sink lastingly deep he came out of his reverie to find mrs dryfoos saying to him in her hoarse voice  i think its a shame some of the picturs a body sees in the winders they say theres a law aginst them things and if there is i dont understand why the police dont take up them that paints em i hear 182 tell since i been here that theres women that goes to have picturs took from them that way by men painters the point seemed aimed at march as if he were personally responsible for the scandal and it fell with a silencing effect for the moment nobody seemed willing to take it up and mrs dryfoos went on with an old womans severity i say they ought to be all tarred and feathered and rode on a rail theyd be drummed out of town in moffitt  miss mela said with a crowing laugh i should think they would and they wouldnt anybody go low neck to the operahouse there eithernot low neck the way they do here anyway  and that pack of worthless hussies her mother resumed that come out on the stage and begun to kick  laws mother the girl shouted i thought you said you had your eyes shut  all but these two simpler creatures were abashed at the indecorum of suggesting in words the commonplaces of the theatre and of art  well i did mely as soon as i could believe my eyes i dont know what theyre doin in all their churches to let such things go on said the old woman its a sin and a shame i think dont you coonrod  a ring at the door cut short whatever answer he was about to deliver  if its going to be company coonrod said his mother making an effort to rise i reckon i better go upstairs  its mr fulkerson i guess said conrad he thought he might come and at the mention of this light spirit mrs dryfoos sank contentedly back in her chair and a relaxation of their painful tension seemed to pass through the whole company conrad went to the door himself the servingman tentatively appeared some minutes later and let in fulkersons cheerful voice before his cheerful person  ah how dye do conrad brought our friend mr beaton with me those within heard him say and then after a sound of putting off overcoats they saw him fill the doorway with his feet set square and his arms akimbo     ix  ah hello hello fulkerson said in recognition of the marches regular gathering of the clans how are you mrs dryfoos how do you do mrs mandel miss christine mela aunt hitty and all the folks how you wuz he shook hands gayly all round and took a chair next the old lady whose hand he kept in his own and left conrad to introduce beaton but he would not let the shadow of beatons solemnity fall upon the company he began to joke with mrs dryfoos and to match rheumatisms with her and he included all the ladies in the range of appropriate pleasantries ive brought mr beaton along tonight and i want you to make him feel at home like you do me mrs dryfoos he hasnt got any rheumatism to speak of but his parents live in syracuse and hes a kind of an orphan and weve just adopted him down at the office when you going to bring the young ladies down there mrs mandel for a champagne lunch i will have some hydromela and christine it heigh hows that for a little starter we dropped in at your place a moment mrs march and gave the young folks a few pointers about their studies my goodness it does me good to see a boy like that of yours business from the word go and your girl just scoops my youthful affections shes a beauty and i guess shes good too well well what a world it is miss christine wont you show mr beaton that seal ring of yours he knows about such things and i brought him here to see it as much as anything its an intaglio i brought from the other side he explained to mrs march and i guess youll like to look at it tried to give it to the dryfoos family and when i couldnt i sold it to em bound to see it on miss christines hand somehow hold on let him see it where it belongs first  he arrested the girl in the motion she made to take off the ring and let her have the pleasure of showing her hand to the company with the ring on it then he left her to hear the painters words about it which he continued to deliver dissyllabically as he stood with her under a gasjet twisting his elastic figure and bending his head over the ring  well mely child fulkerson went on with an open travesty of her mothers habitual address and how are you getting along mrs mandel hold you up to the proprieties pretty strictly well thats right you know youd be roaming all over the pasture if she didnt  the girl gurgled out her pleasure in his funning and everybody took him on his own ground of privileged character he brought them all together in their friendliness for himself and before the evening was over he had inspired mrs mandel to have them served with coffee and had made both the girls feel that they had figured brilliantly in society and that two young men had been devoted to them  oh i think hes just as lovely as he can live said mela as she stood a moment with her sister on the scene of her triumph where the others had left them after the departure of their guests  who asked christine deeply as she glanced down at her ring her eyes burned with a softened fire  she had allowed beaton to change it himself from the finger where she had worn it to the finger on which he said she ought to wear it she did not know whether it was right to let him but she was glad she had done it  who mr fulkerson goosiepoosie not that old stuckup mr beaton of yours  he is proud assented christine with a throb of exultation  beaton and fulkerson went to the elevated station with the marches but the painter said he was going to walk home and fulkerson let him go alone  one way is enough for me he explained when i walk up i dont walk down byebye my son he began talking about beaton to the marches as they climbed the station stairs together that fellow puzzles me i dont know anybody that i have such a desire to kick and at the same time that i want to flatter up so much affect you that way he asked of march  well as far as the kicking goes yes  and how is it with you mrs march  oh i want to flatter him up  no really why hold on ive got the change  fulkerson pushed march away from the ticketoffice window and made them his guests with the inexorable american hospitality for the ride downtown three he said to the ticketseller and when he had walked them before him out on the platform and dropped his tickets into the urn he persisted in his inquiry why  why because you always want to flatter conceited people dont you mrs march answered with a laugh  do you yes i guess you do you think beaton is conceited  well slightly mr fulkerson  i guess youre partly right said fulkerson with a sigh so unaccountable in its connection that they all laughed  an ideal busted march suggested  no not that exactly said fulkerson but i had a notion maybe beaton wasnt conceited all the time  oh mrs march exulted nobody could be so conceited all the time as mr beaton is most of the time he must have moments of the direst modesty when hed be quite flatteryproof  yes thats what i mean i guess thats what makes me want to kick him hes left compliments on my hands that no decent man would  oh thats tragical said march  mr fulkerson mrs march began with change of subject in her voice who is mrs mandel  who what do you think of her he rejoined ill tell you about her when we get in the cars look at that thing aint it beautiful  they leaned over the track and looked up at the next station where the train just starting throbbed out the flameshot steam into the white moonlight  the most beautiful thing in new yorkthe one always and certainly beautiful thing here said march and his wife sighed yes yes she clung to him and remained rapt by the sight till the train drew near and then pulled him back in a panic  well there aint really much to tell about her fulkerson resumed when they were seated in the car shes an invention of mine  of yours cried mrs march  of course exclaimed her husband  yesat least in her present capacity she sent me a story for the syndicate back in july some time along about the time i first met old dryfoos here it was a little too long for my purpose and i thought i could explain better how i wanted it cut in a call than i could in a letter she gave a brooklyn address and i went to see her i found her said fulkerson with a vague defiance a perfect lady she was living with an aunt over there and she had seen better days when she was a girl and worse ones afterward i dont mean to say her husband was a bad fellow i guess he was pretty good he was her musicteacher she met him in germany and they got married there and got through her property before they came over here well she didnt strike me like a person that could make much headway in literature her story was well enough but it hadnt much sand in it kind ofwell academic you know i told her so and she understood and cried a little but she did the best she could with the thing and i took it and syndicated it she kind of stuck in my mind and the first time i went to see the dryfooses they were stopping at a sort of family hotel then till they could find a house fulkerson broke off altogether and said i dont know as i know just how the dryfooses struck you mrs march  cant you imagine she answered with a kindly smile  yes but i dont believe i could guess how they would have struck you last summer when i first saw them my oh my there was the native earth for you mely is a pretty wild colt now but you ought to have seen her before she was broken to harness  and christine ever see that black leopard they got up there in the central park that was christine well i saw what they wanted they all saw itnobody is a fool in all directions and the dryfooses are in their right senses a good deal of the time well to cut a long story short i got mrs mandel to take em in handthe old lady as well as the girls she was a born lady and always lived like one till she saw mandel and that something academic that killed her for a writer was just the very thing for them she knows the world well enough to know just how much polish they can take on and she dont try to put on a bit more see  yes i can see said mrs march  well she took hold at once as ready as a hospitaltrained nurse and there aint anything readier on this planet she runs the whole concern socially and economically takes all the care of housekeeping off the old ladys hands and goes round with the girls bythebye im going to take my meals at your widows march and conrads going to have his lunch there im sick of browsing about  mr marchs widow said his wife looking at him with provisional severity  i have no widow isabel he said and never expect to have till i leave you in the enjoyment of my lifeinsurance i suppose fulkerson means the lady with the daughter who wanted to take us to board  oh yes how are they getting on i do wonder mrs march asked of fulkerson  well theyve got one family to board but its a small one i guess theyll pull through they didnt want to take any day boarders at first the widow said i guess they have had to come to it  poor things sighed mrs march i hope theyll go back to the country  well i dont know when youve once tasted new yorkyou wouldnt go back to boston would you  instantly  fulkerson laughed out a tolerant incredulity     x  beaton lit his pipe when he found himself in his room and sat down before the dull fire in his grate to think it struck him there was a dull fire in his heart a great deal like it and he worked out a fanciful analogy with the coals still alive and the ashes creeping over them and the dead clay and cinders he felt sick of himself sick of his life and of all his works he was angry with fulkerson for having got him into that art department of his for having bought him up and he was bitter at fate because he had been obliged to use the money to pay some pressing debts and had not been able to return the check his father had sent him he pitied his poor old father he ached with compassion for him and he set his teeth and snarled with contempt through them for his own baseness this was the kind of world it was but he washed his hands of it the fault was in human nature and he reflected with pride that he had at least not invented human nature he had not sunk so low as that yet the notion amused him he thought he might get a satanic epigram out of it some way but in the mean time that girl that wild animal she kept visibly tangibly before him if he put out his hand he might touch hers he might pass his arm round her waist in paris in a set he knew there what an effect she would be with that look of hers and that beauty all out of drawing they would recognize the flame quality in her he imagined a joke about her being a fiery spirit or nymph naiad whatever from one of her native gaswells he began to sketch on a bit of paper from the table at his elbow vague lines that veiled and revealed a level dismal landscape and a vast flame against an empty sky and a shape out of the flame that took on a likeness and floated detached from it the sketch ran up the left side of the sheet and stretched across it beaton laughed out pretty good to let fulkerson have that for the cover of his first number in black and red it would be effective it would catch the eye from the newsstands he made a motion to throw it on the fire but held it back and slid it into the tabledrawer and smoked on he saw the dummy with the other sketch in the open drawer which he had brought away from fulkersons in the morning and slipped in there and he took it out and looked at it he made some criticisms in line with his pencil on it correcting the drawing here and there and then he respected it a little more though he still smiled at the feminine qualitya young lady quality  in spite of his experience the night he called upon the leightons beaton could not believe that alma no longer cared for him she played at having forgotten him admirably but he knew that a few months before she had been very mindful of him he knew he had neglected them since they came to new york where he had led them to expect interest if not attention but he was used to neglecting people and he was somewhat less used to being punished for itpunished and forgiven he felt that alma had punished him so thoroughly that she ought to have been satisfied with her work and to have forgiven him in her heart afterward he bore no resentment after the first tingling moments werepast he rather admired her for it and he would have been ready to go back half an hour later and accept pardon and be on the footing of last summer again even now he debated with himself whether it was too late to call but decidedly a quarter to ten seemed late the next day he determined never to call upon the leightons again but he had no reason for this it merely came into a transitory scheme of conduct of retirement from the society of women altogether and after dinner he went round to see them  he asked for the ladies and they all three received him alma not without a surprise that intimated itself to him and her mother with no appreciable relenting miss woodburn with the needlework which she found easier to be voluble over than a book expressed in her welcome a neutrality both cordial to beaton and loyal to alma  is it snowing outdos she asked briskly after the greetings were transacted mah goodness she said in answer to his apparent surprise at the question ah mahght as well have stayed in the soath for all the winter ah have seen in new york yet  we dont often have snow much before newyears said beaton  miss woodburn is wild for a real northern winter mrs leighton explained  the othah naght ah woke up and looked oat of the window and saw all the roofs covered with snow and it turned oat to be nothing but moonlaght ah was never so disappointed in mah lahfe said miss woodburn  if youll come to st barnaby next summer you shall have all the winter you want said alma  i cant let you slander st barnaby in that way said beaton with the air of wishing to be understood as meaning more than he said  yes returned alma coolly i didnt know you were so fond of the climate  i never think of it as a climate its a landscape it doesnt matter whether its hot or cold  with the thermometer twenty below youd find that it mattered alma persisted  is that the way you feel about st barnaby too mrs leighton beaton asked with affected desolation  i shall be glad enough to go back in the summer mrs leighton conceded  and i should be glad to go now said beaton looking at alma he had the dummy of every other week in his hand and he saw almas eyes wandering toward it whenever he glanced at her i should be glad to go anywhere to get out of a job ive undertaken he continued to mrs leighton theyre going to start some sort of a new illustrated magazine and theyve got me in for their art department im not fit for it id like to run away dont you want to advise me a little mrs leighton you know how much i value your taste and id like to have you look at the design for the cover of the first number theyre going to have a different one for every number i dont know whether youll agree with me but i think this is rather nice  he faced the dummy round and then laid it on the table before mrs leighton pushing some of her work aside to make room for it and standing over her while she bent forward to look at it  alma kept her place away from the table  mah goodness ho exciting said miss woodburn may anybody look  everybody said beaton  well isnt it perfectly choming miss woodburn exclaimed come and look at this miss leighton she called to alma who reluctantly approached  what lines are these mrs leighton asked pointing to beatons pencil scratches  theyre suggestions of modifications he replied  i dont think they improve it much what do you think alma  oh i dont know said the girl constraining her voice to an effect of indifference and glancing carelessly down at the sketch the design might be improved but i dont think those suggestions would do it  theyre mine said beaton fixing his eyes upon her with a beautiful sad dreaminess that he knew he could put into them he spoke with a dreamy remoteness of tonehis windharp stop wetmore called it  i supposed so said alma calmly  oh mah goodness cried miss woodburn is that the way you awtusts talk to each othah well ahm glad ahm not an awtustunless i could do all the talking  artists cannot tell a fib alma said or even act one and she laughed in beatons upturned face  he did not unbend his dreamy gaze youre quite right the suggestions are stupid  alma turned to miss woodburn you hear even when we speak of our own work  ah nevah hoad anything lahke it  and the design itself beaton persisted  oh im not an art editor alma answered with a laugh of exultant evasion  a tall dark gravelooking man of fifty with a swarthy face and irongray mustache and imperial and goatee entered the room beaton knew the type he had been through virginia sketching for one of the illustrated papers and he had seen such men in richmond miss woodburn hardly needed to say may ah introduce you to mah fathaw conel woodburn mr beaton  the men shook hands and colonel woodburn said in that soft gentle slow southern voice without our northern contractions i am very glad to meet you sir happy to make yo acquaintance do not move madam he said to mrs leighton who made a deprecatory motion to let him pass to the chair beyond her i can find my way he bowed a bulk that did not lend itself readily to the devotion and picked up the ball of yarn she had let drop out of her lap in half rising yo worsteds madam  yarn yarn colonel woodburn alma shouted youre quite incorrigible a spade is a spade  but sometimes it is a trump my dear young lady said the colonel with unabated gallantry and when yo mothah uses yarn it is worsteds but i respect worsteds even under the name of yarn our ladiesmy own mothah and sistahshad to knit the socks we woreall we could get in the woe  yes and aftah the woe his daughter put in the knitting has not stopped yet in some places have you been much in the soath mr beaton  beaton explained just how much  well sir said the colonel then you have seen a country making gigantic struggles to retrieve its losses sir the south is advancing with enormous strides sir  too fast for some of us to keep up said miss woodburn in an audible aside the pace in charlottesboag is pofectly killing and we had to drop oat into a slow place like new york  the progress in the south is material now said the colonel and those of us whose interests are in another direction find ourselvesisolatedisolated sir the intellectual centres are still in the noth sir the great cities draw the mental activity of the country to them sir necessarily new york is the metropolis  oh everything comes here said beaton impatient of the elders ponderosity another sort of man would have sympathized with the southerners willingness to talk of himself and led him on to speak of his plans and ideals but the sort of man that beaton was could not do this he put up the dummy into the wrapper he had let drop on the floor beside him and tied it round with string while colonel woodburn was talking he got to his feet with the words he spoke and offered mrs leighton his hand  must you go she asked in surprise  i am on my way to a reception he said she had noticed that he was in evening dress and now she felt the vague hurt that people invited nowhere feel in the presence of those who are going somewhere she did not feel it for herself but for her daughter and she knew alma would not have let her feel it if she could have prevented it but alma had left the room for a moment and she tacitly indulged this sense of injury in her behalf  please say goodnight to miss leighton for me beaton continued he bowed to miss woodburn goodnight miss woodburn and to her father bluntly goodnight  goodnight sir said the colonel with a sort of severe suavity  oh isnt he choming miss woodburn whispered to mrs leighton when beaton left the room  alma spoke to him in the hall without you knew that was my design mr beaton why did you bring it  why he looked at her in gloomy hesitation  then he said you know why i wished to talk it over with you to serve you please you get back your good opinion but ive done neither the one nor the other ive made a mess of the whole thing  alma interrupted him has it been accepted  it will be accepted if you will let it  let it she laughed i shall be delighted she saw him swayed a little toward her its a matter of business isnt it  purely goodnight  when alma returned to the room colonel woodburn was saying to mrs leighton i do not contend that it is impossible madam but it is very difficult in a thoroughly commercialized society like yours to have the feelings of a gentleman how can a business man whose prosperity whose earthly salvation necessarily lies in the adversity of some one else be delicate and chivalrous or even honest if we could have had time to perfect our system at the south to eliminate what was evil and develop what was good in it we should have had a perfect system but the virus of commercialism was in us too it forbade us to make the best of a divine institution and tempted us to make the worst now the curse is on the whole country the dollar is the measure of every value the stamp of every success what does not sell is a failure and what sells succeeds  the hobby is oat mah deah said miss woodburn in an audible aside to alma  were you speaking of me colonel woodburn alma asked  surely not my dear young lady  but hes been saying that awtusts are just as greedy aboat money as anybody said his daughter  the law of commercialism is on everything in a commercial society the colonel explained softening the tone in which his convictions were presented the final reward of art is money and not the pleasure of creating  perhaps they would be willing to take it all oat in that if othah people would let them pay their bills in the pleasure of creating his daughter teased  they are helpless like all the rest said her father with the same deference to her as to other women i do not blame them  oh mah goodness didnt you say sir that mr beaton had bad manners  alma relieved a confusion which he seemed to feel in reference to her bad manners he has no manners that is when hes himself he has pretty good ones when hes somebody else  miss woodburn began oh mah and then stopped herself almas mother looked at her with distressed question but the girl seemed perfectly cool and contented and she gave her mind provisionally to a point suggested by colonel woodburns talk  still i cant believe it was right to hold people in slavery to whip them and sell them it never did seem right to me she added in apology for her extreme sentiments to the gentleness of her adversary  i quite agree with you madam said the colonel those were the abuses of the institution but if we had not been vitiated on the one hand and threatened on the other by the spirit of commercialism from the northand from europe toothose abuses could have been eliminated and the institution developed in the direction of the mild patriarchalism of the divine intention the colonel hitched his chair which figured a hobby careering upon its hind legs a little toward mrs leighton and the girls approached their heads and began to whisper they fell deferentially silent when the colonel paused in his argument and went on again when he went on  at last they heard mrs leighton saying and have you heard from the publishers about your book yet  then miss woodburn cut in before her father could answer the coase of commercialism is on that too they are trahing to fahnd oat whethah it will pay  and they are rightquite right said the colonel there is no longer any other criterion and even a work that attacks the system must be submitted to the tests of the system  the system wont accept destruction on any othah tomes said miss woodburn demurely     xi  at the reception where two men in livery stood aside to let him pass up the outside steps of the house and two more helped him off with his overcoat indoors and a fifth miscalled his name into the drawingroom the syracuse stonecutters son met the niece of mrs horn and began at once to tell her about his evening at the dryfooses he was in very good spirits for so far as he could have been elated or depressed by his parting with alma leighton he had been elated she had not treated his impudence with the contempt that he felt it deserved she must still be fond of him and the warm sense of this by operation of an obscure but wellrecognized law of the masculine being disposed him to be rather fond of miss vance she was a slender girl whose semiaesthetic dress flowed about her with an accentuation of her long forms and redeemed them from censure by the very frankness with which it confessed them nobody could have said that margaret vance was too tall her pretty little head which she had an effect of choosing to have little in the same spirit of judicious defiance had a good deal of reading in it she was proud to know literary and artistic fashions as well as society fashions she liked being singled out by an exterior distinction so obvious as beatons and she listened with sympathetic interest to his account of those people he gave their natural history reality by drawing upon his own he reconstructed their plebeian past from the experiences of his childhood and his youth of the preparisian period and he had a pang of suicidal joy in insulting their ignorance of the world  what different kinds of people you meet said the girl at last with an envious sigh her reading had enlarged the bounds of her imagination if not her knowledge the novels nowadays dealt so much with very common people and made them seem so very much more worth while than the people one met  she said something like this to beaton he answered you can meet the people im talking of very easily if you want to take the trouble its what they came to new york for i fancy its the great ambition of their lives to be met  oh yes said miss vance fashionably and looked down then she looked up and said intellectually dont you think its a great pity how much better for them to have stayed where they were and what they were  then you could never have had any chance of meeting them said beaton i dont suppose you intend to go out to the gas country  no said miss vance amused not that i shouldnt like to go  what a daring spirit you ought to be on the staff of every other week said beaton  the staffevery other week what is it  the missing link the longfelt want of a tie between the arts and the dollars beaton gave her a very picturesque a very dramatic sketch of the theory the purpose and the personnel of the new enterprise  miss vance understood too little about business of any kind to know how it differed from other enterprises of its sort she thought it was delightful she thought beaton must be glad to be part of it though he had represented himself so bored so injured by fulkersons insisting upon having him and is it a secret is it a thing not to be spoken of  tutt altro fulkerson will be enraptured to have it spoken of in society he would pay any reasonable bill for the advertisement  what a delightful creature tell him it shall all be spent in charity  he would like that he would get two paragraphs out of the fact and your name would go into the literary notes of all the newspapers  oh but i shouldnt want my name used cried the girl half horrified into fancying the situation real  then youd better not say anything about every other week fulkerson is preternaturally unscrupulous  march began to think so too at times he was perpetually suggesting changes in the makeup of the first number with a view to its greater vividness of effect one day he came and said this thing isnt going to have any sort of get up and howl about it unless you have a paper in the first number going for bevanss novels better get maxwell to do it  why i thought you liked bevanss novels  so i did but where the good of every other week is concerned i am a roman father the popular gag is to abuse bevans and maxwell is the man to do it there hasnt been a new magazine started for the last three years that hasnt had an article from maxwell in its first number cutting bevans all to pieces if people dont see it theyll think every other week is some old thing  march did not know whether fulkerson was joking or not he suggested perhaps theyll think its an old thing if they do see it  well get somebody else then or else get maxwell to write under an assumed name ori forgot hell be anonymous under our system anyway now there aint a more popular racket for us to work in that first number than a good swinging attack on bevans people read his books and quarrel over em and the critics are all against him and a regular flaying with salt and vinegar rubbed in afterward will tell more with people who like good oldfashioned fiction than anything else i like bevanss things but dad burn it when it comes to that first number id offer up anybody  what an immoral little wretch you are fulkerson said march with a laugh  fulkerson appeared not to be very strenuous about the attack on the novelist say he called out gayly what should you think of a paper defending the late lamented system of slavery  what do you mean fulkerson asked march with a puzzled smile  fulkerson braced his knees against his desk and pushed himself back but kept his balance to the eye by canting his hat sharply forward theres an old cock over there at the widows thats written a book to prove that slavery was and is the only solution of the labor problem hes a southerner  i should imagine march assented  hes got it on the brain that if the south could have been let alone by the commercial spirit and the pseudophilanthropy of the north it would have worked out slavery into a perfectly ideal condition for the laborer in which he would have been insured against want and protected in all his personal rights by the state he read the introduction to me last night i didnt catch on to all the pointshis daughters an awfully pretty girl and i was carrying that fact in my mind all the time too you knowbut thats about the gist of it  seems to regard it as a lost opportunity said march  exactly what a mighty catchy title neigh look well on the titlepage  well written  i reckon so i dont know the colonel read it mighty eloquently  it mightnt be such bad business said march in a muse could you get me a sight of it without committing yourself  if the colonel hasnt sent it off to another publisher this morning he just got it back with thanks yesterday he likes to keep it travelling  well try it ive a notion it might be a curious thing  look here march said fulkerson with the effect of taking a fresh hold i wish you could let me have one of those new york things of yours for the first number after all thats going to be the great card  i couldnt fulkerson i couldnt really i want to philosophize the material and im too new to it all yet i dont want to do merely superficial sketches  of course of course i understand that well i dont want to hurry you seen that old fellow of yours yet i think we ought to have that translation in the first number dont you we want to give em a notion of what were going to do in that line  yes said march and i was going out to look up lindau this morning ive inquired at maronis and he hasnt been there for several days ive some idea perhaps hes sick but they gave me his address and im going to see  well thats right we want the first number to be the keynote in every way  march shook his head you cant make it so the first number is bound to be a failure always as far as the representative character goes its invariably the case look at the first numbers of all the things youve seen started theyre experimental almost amateurish and necessarily so not only because the men that are making them up are comparatively inexperienced like ourselves but because the material sent them to deal with is more or less consciously tentative people send their adventurous things to a new periodical because the whole thing is an adventure ive noticed that quality in all the volunteer contributions its in the articles that have been done to order even no ive about made up my mind that if we can get one good striking paper into the first number that will take peoples minds off the others we shall be doing all we can possible hope for i should like march added less seriously to make up three numbers ahead and publish the third one first  fulkerson dropped forward and struck his fist on the desk its a firstrate idea why not do it  march laughed fulkerson i dont believe theres any quackish thing you wouldnt do in this cause from time to time im thoroughly ashamed of being connected with such a charlatan  fulkerson struck his hat sharply backward ah dad burn it to give that thing the right kind of start id walk up and down broadway between two boards with the titlepage of every other week facsimiled on one and my name and address on the  he jumped to his feet and shouted march ill do it  what  ill hire a lot of fellows to make mudturtles of themselves and ill have a lot of big facsimiles of the titlepage and ill paint the town red  march looked aghast at him oh come now fulkerson  i mean it i was in london when a new man had taken hold of the old cornhill and they were trying to boom it and they had a procession of these mudturtles that reached from charing cross to temple bar cornhill magazine sixpence not a dull page in it i said to myself then that it was the livest thing i ever saw i respected the man that did that thing from the bottom of my heart i wonder i ever forgot it but it shows what a shaky thing the human mind is at its best  you infamous mountebank said march with great amusement at fulkersons access you call that congeries of advertising instinct of yours the human mind at its best come dont be so diffident fulkerson well im off to find lindau and when i come back i hope mr dryfoos will have you under control i dont suppose youll be quite sane again till after the first number is out perhaps public opinion will sober you then  confound it march how do you think they will take it i swear im getting so nervous i dont know half the time which end of me is up i believe if we dont get that thing out by the first of february it ll be the death of me  couldnt wait till washingtons birthday i was thinking it would give the day a kind of distinction and strike the public imagination if  no ill be dogged if i could fulkerson lapsed more and more into the parlance of his early life in this season of strong excitement i believe if beaton lags any on the art leg ill kill him  well i shouldnt mind your killing beaton said march tranquilly as he went out  he went over to third avenue and took the elevated down to chatham square he found the variety of people in the car as unfailingly entertaining as ever he rather preferred the east side to the west side lines because they offered more nationalities conditions and characters to his inspection they draw not only from the uptown american region but from all the vast hive of populations swarming between them and the east river he had found that according to the hour american husbands going to and from business and american wives going to and from shopping prevailed on the sixth avenue road and that the most picturesque admixture to these familiar aspects of human nature were the brilliant eyes and complexions of the american hebrews who otherwise contributed to the effect of wellclad comfort and citizenselfsatisfaction of the crowd now and then he had found himself in a car mostly filled with neapolitans from the constructions far up the line where he had read how they are worked and fed and housed like beasts and listening to the jargon of their unintelligible dialect he had occasion for pensive question within himself as to what notion these poor animals formed of a free republic from their experience of life under its conditions and whether they found them practically very different from those of the immemorial brigandage and enforced complicity with rapine under which they had been born but after all this was an infrequent effect however massive of travel on the west side whereas the east offered him continual entertainment in like sort the sort was never quite so squalid for short distances the lowest poverty the hardest pressed labor must walk but march never entered a car without encountering some interesting shape of shabby adversity which was almost always adversity of foreign birth new york is still popularly supposed to be in the control of the irish but march noticed in these east side travels of his what must strike every observer returning to the city after a prolonged absence the numerical subordination of the dominant race if they do not outvote them the people of germanic of slavonic of pelasgic of mongolian stock outnumber the prepotent celts and march seldom found his speculation centred upon one of these the small eyes the high cheeks the broad noses the puff lips the bare cuefilleted skulls of russians poles czechs chinese the furtive glitter of italians the blonde dulness of germans the cold quiet of scandinaviansfire under icewere aspects that he identified and that gave him abundant suggestion for the personal histories he constructed and for the more publicspirited reveries in which he dealt with the future economy of our heterogeneous commonwealth it must be owned that he did not take much trouble about this what these poor people were thinking hoping fearing enjoying suffering just where and how they lived who and what they individually werethese were the matters of his waking dreams as he stared hard at them while the train raced farther into the gay uglinessthe shapeless graceful reckless picturesqueness of the bowery  there were certain signs certain facades certain audacities of the prevailing hideousness that always amused him in that uproar to the eye which the strident forms and colors made he was interested in the insolence with which the railway had drawn its erasing line across the corinthian front of an old theatre almost grazing its fluted pillars and flouting its dishonored pediment the colossal effigies of the fat women and the tuftheaded circassian girls of cheap museums the vistas of shabby cross streets the survival of an old hiproofed house here and there at their angles the swiss chalet histrionic decorativeness of the stations in prospect or retrospect the vagaries of the lines that narrowed together or stretched apart according to the width of the avenue but always in wanton disregard of the life that dwelt and bought and sold and rejoiced or sorrowed and clattered or crawled around below abovewere features of the frantic panorama that perpetually touched his sense of humor and moved his sympathy accident and then exigency seemed the forces at work to this extraordinary effect the play of energies as free and planless as those that force the forest from the soil to the sky and then the fierce struggle for survival with the stronger life persisting over the deformity the mutilation the destruction the decay of the weaker the whole at moments seemed to him lawless godless the absence of intelligent comprehensive purpose in the huge disorder and the violent struggle to subordinate the result to the greater good penetrated with its dumb appeal the consciousness of a man who had always been too selfenwrapped to perceive the chaos to which the individual selfishness must always lead  but there was still nothing definite nothing better than a vague discomfort however poignant in his half recognition of such facts and he descended the station stairs at chatham square with a sense of the neglected opportunities of painters in that locality he said to himself that if one of those fellows were to see in naples that turmoil of cars trucks and teams of every sort intershot with footpassengers going and coming to and from the crowded pavements under the web of the railroad tracks overhead and amid the spectacular approach of the streets that open into the square he would have it down in his sketchbook at once he decided simultaneously that his own local studies must be illustrated and that he must come with the artist and show him just which bits to do not knowing that the two arts can never approach the same material from the same point he thought he would particularly like his illustrator to render the dickensy cockneyish quality of the shabbygenteel balladseller of whom he stopped to ask his way to the street where lindau lived and whom he instantly perceived to be with his stock in trade the sufficient object of an entire study by himself he had his ballads strung singly upon a cord against the house wall and held down in piles on the pavement with stones and blocks of wood their control in this way intimated a volatility which was not perceptible in their sentiment they were mostly tragical or doleful some of them dealt with the wrongs of the workingman others appealed to a gay experience of the high seas but vastly the greater part to memories and associations of an irish origin some still uttered the poetry of plantation life in the artless accents of the endman where they trusted themselves with syntax that yielded promptly to any exigency of rhythmic art to the ordinary american speech it was to strike directly for the affections to celebrate the domestic ties and above all to embalm the memories of angel and martyr mothers whose dissipated sons deplored their sufferings too late march thought this not at all a bad thing in them he smiled in patronage of their simple pathos he paid the tribute of a laugh when the poet turned as he sometimes did from his conception of angel and martyr motherhood and portrayed the mother in her more familiar phases of virtue and duty with the retributive shingle or slipper in her hand he bought a pocketful of this literature popular in a sense which the most successful book can never be and enlisted the ballad vendor so deeply in the effort to direct him to lindaus dwelling by the best way that he neglected another customer till a sarcasm on his absentmindedness stung hint to retort im atrying to answer a gentleman a civil question thats where the absentminded comes in  it seemed for some reason to be a day of leisure with the chinese dwellers in mott street which march had been advised to take first they stood about the tops of basement stairs and walked two and two along the dirty pavement with their little hands tucked into their sleeves across their breasts aloof in immaculate cleanliness from the filth around them and scrutinizing the scene with that cynical sneer of faint surprise to which all aspects of our civilization seem to move their superiority their numbers gave character to the street and rendered not them but what was foreign to them strange there so that march had a sense of missionary quality in the old catholic church built long before their incursion was dreamed of it seemed to have come to them there and he fancied in the statued saint that looked down from its facade something not so much tolerant as tolerated something propitiatory almost deprecatory it was a fancy of course the street was sufficiently peopled with christian children at any rate swarming and shrieking at their games and presently a christian mother appeared pushed along by two policemen on a handcart with a gelatinous tremor over the paving and a gelatinous jouncing at the curbstones she lay with her face to the sky sending up an inarticulate lamentation but the indifference of the officers forbade the notion of tragedy in her case she was perhaps a local celebrity the children left off their games and ran gayly trooping after her even the young fellow and young girl exchanging playful blows in a robust flirtation at the corner of a liquor store suspended their scuffle with a pleased interest as she passed march understood the unwillingness of the poor to leave the worst conditions in the city for comfort and plenty in the country when he reflected upon this dramatic incident one of many no doubt which daily occur to entertain them in such streets a small town could rarely offer anything comparable to it and the country never he said that if life appeared so hopeless to him as it must to the dwellers in that neighborhood he should not himself be willing to quit its distractions its alleviations for the vague promise of unknown good in the distance somewhere  but what charm could such a man as lindau find in such a place it could not be that he lived there because he was too poor to live elsewhere with a shutting of the heart march refused to believe this as he looked round on the abounding evidences of misery and guiltily remembered his neglect of his old friend lindau could probably find as cheap a lodging in some decenter part of the town and in fact there was some amelioration of the prevailing squalor in the quieter street which he turned into from mott  a woman with a tiedup face of toothache opened the door for him when he pulled with a shiver of foreboding the bellknob from which a yard of rusty crape dangled but it was not lindau who was dead for the woman said he was at home and sent march stumbling up the four or five dark flights of stairs that led to his tenement it was quite at the top of the house and when march obeyed the germanenglish komm that followed his knock he found himself in a kitchen where a meagre breakfast was scattered in stale fragments on the table before the stove the place was bare and cold a halfempty beer bottle scarcely gave it a convivial air on the left from this kitchen was a room with a bed in it which seemed also to be a cobblers shop on the right through a door that stood ajar came the germanenglish voice again saying this time hier     xii  march pushed the door open into a room like that on the left but with a writingdesk instead of a cobblers bench and a bed where lindau sat propped up with a coat over his shoulders and a skullcap on his head reading a book from which he lifted his eyes to stare blankly over his spectacles at march his hairy old breast showed through the nightshirt which gaped apart the stump of his left arm lay upon the book to keep it open  ah my tear yong friendt passil marge iss it you he called out joyously the next moment  why are you sick lindau march anxiously scanned his face in taking his hand  lindau laughed no im all righdt only a lidtle lazy and a lidtle eggonomigal idts jeaper to stay in pedt sometimes as to geep a fire agoin all the time dont wandt to gome too hardt on the brafer mann you know       braver mann er

jair well idt is goodt for zore eyess how didt you findt where i lif  they told me at maronis said march he tried to keep his eyes on lindaus face and not see the discomfort of the room but he was aware of the shabby and frowsy bedding the odor of stale smoke and the pipes and tobacco shreds mixed with the books and manuscripts strewn over the leaf of the writingdesk he laid down on the mass the pile of foreign magazines he had brought under his arm they gave me another address first  yes i have chust gome here said lindau idt is not very coy neigh  it might be gayer march admitted with a smile still he added soberly a good many people seem to live in this part of the town apparently they die here too lindau there is crape on your outside door i didnt know but it was for you  nodt this time said lindau in the same humor berhaps some other time we geep the ondertakers bratty puzy down here  well said march undertakers must live even if the rest of us have to die to let them lindau laughed and march went on but im glad it isnt your funeral lindau and you say youre not sick and so i dont see why we shouldnt come to business  pusiness lindau lifted his eyebrows you gome on pusiness  and pleasure combined said march and he went on to explain the service he desired at lindaus hands  the old man listened with serious attention and with assenting nods that culminated in a spoken expression of his willingness to undertake the translations march waited with a sort of mechanical expectation of his gratitude for the work put in his way but nothing of the kind came from lindau and march was left to say well everything is understood then and i dont know that i need add that if you ever want any little advance on the work  i will ask you said lindau quietly and i thank you for that but i can wait i tont needt any money just at bresent as if he saw some appeal for greater frankness in marchs eye he went on i tidnt gome here begause i was too boor to lif anywhere else and i tont stay in pedt begause i couldnt haf a fire to geep warm if i wanted it im nodt zo padt off as marmontel when he went to paris im a lidtle loaxurious that is all if i stay in pedt its zo i can fling money away on somethings else heigh  but what are you living here for lindau march smiled at the irony lurking in lindaus words  well you zee i foundt i was begoming a lidtle too moch of an aristograt i hadt a room oap in creenvidge willage among dose pig pugs over on the west side and i foundtliudaus voice lost its jesting quality and his face darkenedthat i was beginning to forget the boor  i should have thought said march with impartial interest that you might have seen poverty enough now and then in greenwich village to remind you of its existence  nodt like here said lindau andt you must zee it all the dtimezee it hear it smell it dtaste itor you forget it that is what i gome here for i was begoming a ploated aristograt i thought i was nodt like these beople down here when i gome down once to look aroundt i thought i must be somethings else and zo i zaid i better take myself in time and i gome here among my brothersthe becears and the thiefs a noise made itself heard in the next room as if the door were furtively opened and a faint sound of tiptoeing and of hands clawing on a table  thiefs lindau repeated with a shout lidtle thiefs that gabture your breakfast ah ha ha a wild scurrying of feet joyous cries and tittering and a slamming door followed upon his explosion and he resumed in the silence idt is the children cot pack from school they gome and steal what i leaf there on my daple idts one of our lidtle chokes we onderstand one another thats all righdt once the gobbler in the other room there he used to chase em he couldnt onderstand their lidtle tricks now dot gopplers teadt and he tont chase em any more he was a bohemian gindt of grazy i cuess  well its a sociable existence march suggested but perhaps if you let them have the things without stealing  oh no no most nodt mage them too gonceitedt they mostnt go and feel themselfs petter than those boor millionairss that hadt to steal their money  march smiled indulgently at his old friends violence oh there are fagots and fagots you know lindau perhaps not all the millionaires are so guilty  let us speak german cried lindau in his own tongue pushing his book aside and thrusting his skullcap back from his forehead how much money can a man honestly earn without wronging or oppressing some other man  well if youll let me answer in english said march i should say about five thousand dollars a year i name that figure because its my experience that i never could earn more but the experience of other men may be different and if they tell me they can earn ten or twenty or fifty thousand a year im not prepared to say they cant do it  lindau hardly waited for his answer not the most gifted man that ever lived in the practice of any art or science and paid at the highest rate that exceptional genius could justly demand from those who have worked for their money could ever earn a million dollars it is the landlords and the merchant princes the railroad kings and the coal barons the oppressors to whom you instinctively give the titles of tyrantsit is these that make the millions but no man earns them what artist what physician what scientist what poet was ever a millionaire  i can only think of the poet rogers said march amused by lindaus tirade but he was as exceptional as the other rogers the martyr who died with warm feet lindau had apparently not understood his joke and he went on with the american ease of mind about everything but you must allow lindau that some of those fellows dont do so badly with their guilty gains some of them give work to armies of poor people  lindau furiously interrupted yes when they have gathered their millions together from the hunger and cold and nakedness and ruin and despair of hundreds of thousands of other men they give work to the poor they give work they allow their helpless brothers to earn enough to keep life in them they give work who is it gives toil and where will your rich men be when once the poor shall refuse to give toil why you have come to give me work  march laughed outright well im not a millionaire anyway lindau and i hope you wont make an example of me by refusing to give toil i dare say the millionaires deserve it but id rather they wouldnt suffer in my person  no returned the old man mildly relaxing the fierce glare he had bent upon march no man deserves to sufer at the hands of another i lose myself when i think of the injustice in the world but i must not forget that i am like the worst of them  you might go up fifth avenue and live among the rich awhile when youre in danger of that suggested march at any rate he added by an impulse which he knew he could not justify to his wife i wish youd come some day and lunch with their emissary ive been telling mrs march about you and i want her and the children to see you come over with these things and report he put his hand on the magazines as he rose  i will come said lindau gently  shall i give you your book asked march  no i gidt oap bretty soon  andandcan you dress yourself  i vhistle and one of those lidtle fellowss comess we haf to dake gare of one another in a blace like this idt iss nodt like the worldt said lindau gloomily  march thought he ought to cheer him up oh it isnt such a bad world lindau after all the average of millionaires is small in it he added and i dont believe theres an american living that could look at that arm of yours and not wish to lend you a hand for the one you gave us all march felt this to be a fine turn and his voice trembled slightly in saying it  lindau smiled grimly you think zo i wouldnt moch like to drost em ive driedt idt too often he began to speak german again fiercely besides they owe me nothing do you think i knowingly gave my hand to save this oligarchy of traders and tricksters this aristocracy of railroad wreckers and stock gamblers and mineslave drivers and millserf owners no i gave it to the slave the slaveha ha hawhom i helped to unshackle to the common liberty of hunger and cold and you think i would be the beneficiary of such a state of things  im sorry to hear you talk so lindau said march very sorry he stopped with a look of pain and rose to go lindau suddenly broke into a laugh and into english  oh well it is only dalk passil and it toes me goodt my parg is worse than my pidte i cuess i pring these things roundt bretty soon goodbye passil my tear poy auf wiedersehen     xiii  march went away thinking of what lindau had said but not for the impersonal significance of his words so much as for the light they cast upon lindau himself he thought the words violent enough but in connection with what he remembered of the cheery poetic hopeful idealist they were even more curious than lamentable in his own life of comfortable reverie he had never heard any one talk so before but he had read something of the kind now and then in blatant labor newspapers which he had accidentally fallen in with and once at a strikers meeting he had heard rich people denounced with the same frenzy he had made his own reflections upon the tastelessness of the rhetoric and the obvious buncombe of the motive and he had not taken the matter seriously  he could not doubt lindaus sincerity and he wondered how he came to that way of thinking from his experience of himself he accounted for a prevailing literary quality in it he decided it to be from lindaus reading and feeling rather than his reflection that was the notion he formed of some things he had met with in ruskin to much the same effect he regarded them with amusement as the chimeras of a rhetorician run away with by his phrases  but as to lindau the chief thing in his mind was a conception of the droll irony of a situation in which so fervid a hater of millionaires should be working indirectly at least for the prosperity of a man like dryfoos who as march understood had got his money together out of every gamblers chance in speculation and all a schemers thrift from the error and need of others the situation was not more incongruous however than all the rest of the every other week affair it seemed to him that there were no crazy fortuities that had not tended to its existence and as time went on and the day drew near for the issue of the first number the sense of this intensified till the whole lost at moments the quality of a waking fact and came to be rather a fantastic fiction of sleep  yet the heterogeneous forces did cooperate to a reality which march could not deny at least in their presence and the first number was representative of all their nebulous intentions in a tangible form as a result it was so respectable that march began to respect these intentions began to respect himself for combining and embodying them in the volume which appealed to him with a novel fascination when the first advance copy was laid upon his desk every detail of it was tiresomely familiar already but the whole had a fresh interest now he now saw how extremely fit and effective miss leightons decorative design for the cover was printed in black and brickred on the delicate gray tone of the paper it was at once attractive and refined and he credited beaton with quite all he merited in working it over to the actual shape the touch and the taste of the art editor were present throughout the number as fulkerson said beaton had caught on with the delicacy of a hummingbird and the tenacity of a bulldog to the virtues of their illustrative process and had worked it for all it was worth there were seven papers in the number and a poem on the last page of the cover and he had found some graphic comment for each it was a larger proportion than would afterward be allowed but for once in a way it was allowed fulkerson said they could not expect to get their money back on that first number anyway seven of the illustrations were beatons two or three he got from practised hands the rest were the work of unknown people which he had suggested and then related and adapted with unfailing ingenuity to the different papers he handled the illustrations with such sympathy as not to destroy their individual quality and that indefinable charm which comes from good amateur work in whatever art he rescued them from their weaknesses and errors while he left in them the evidence of the pleasure with which a clever young man or a sensitive girl or a refined woman had done them inevitably from his manipulation however the art of the number acquired homogeneity and there was nothing casual in its appearance the result march eagerly owned was better than the literary result and he foresaw that the number would be sold and praised chiefly for its pictures yet he was not ashamed of the literature and he indulged his admiration of it the more freely because he had not only not written it but in a way had not edited it to be sure he had chosen all the material but he had not voluntarily put it all together for that number it had largely put itself together as every number of every magazine does and as it seems more and more to do in the experience of every editor there had to be of course a story and then a sketch of travel there was a literary essay and a social essay there was a dramatic trifle very gay very light there was a dashing criticism on the new pictures the new plays the new books the new fashions and then there was the translation of a bit of vivid russian realism which the editor owed to lindaus exploration of the foreign periodicals left with him lindau was himself a romanticist of the victor hugo sort but he said this fragment of dostoyevski was good of its kind the poem was a bit of society verse with a backward look into simpler and wholesomer experiences  fulkerson was extremely proud of the number but he said it was too goodtoo good from every point of view the cover was too good and the paper was too good and that device of rough edges which got over the objection to uncut leaves while it secured their aesthetic effect was a thing that he trembled for though he rejoiced in it as a stroke of the highest genius it had come from beaton at the last moment as a compromise when the problem of the vulgar croppiness of cut leaves and the unpopularity of uncut leaves seemed to have no solution but suicide fulkerson was still morally crawling round on his hands and knees as he said in abject gratitude at beatons feet though he had his qualms his questions and he declared that beaton was the most inspired ass since balaams were all asses of course he admitted in semiapology to march but were no such asses as beaton he said that if the tasteful decorativeness of the thing did not kill it with the public outright its literary excellence would give it the finishing stroke perhaps that might be overlooked in the impression of novelty which a first number would give but it must never happen again he implored march to promise that it should never happen again he said their only hope was in the immediate cheapening of the whole affair it was bad enough to give the public too much quantity for their money but to throw in such quality as that was simply ruinous it must be stopped these were the expressions of his intimate moods every front that he presented to the public wore a glow of lofty of devout exultation his pride in the number gushed out in fresh bursts of rhetoric to every one whom he could get to talk with him about it he worked the personal kindliness of the press to the utmost he did not mind making himself ridiculous or becoming a joke in the good cause as he called it he joined in the applause when a humorist at the club feigned to drop dead from his chair at fulkersons introduction of the topic and he went on talking that first number into the surviving spectators he stood treat upon all occasions and he lunched attaches of the press at all hours he especially befriended the correspondents of the newspapers of other cities for as he explained to march those fellows could give him any amount of advertising simply as literary gossip many of the fellows were ladies who could not be so summarily asked out to lunch but fulkersons ingenuity was equal to every exigency and he contrived somehow to make each of these feel that she had been possessed of exclusive information there was a moment when march conjectured a willingness in fulkerson to work mrs march into the advertising department by means of a tea to these ladies and their friends which she should administer in his apartment but he did not encourage fulkerson to be explicit and the moment passed afterward when he told his wife about it he was astonished to find that she would not have minded doing it for fulkerson and he experienced another proof of the bluntness of the feminine instincts in some directions and of the personal favor which fulkerson seemed to enjoy with the whole sex this alone was enough to account for the willingness of these correspondents to write about the first number but march accused him of sending it to their addresses with boxes of jacqueminot roses and huyler candy  fulkerson let him enjoy his joke he said that he would do that or anything else for the good cause short of marrying the whole circle of female correspondents  march was inclined to hope that if the first number had been made too good for the country at large the more enlightened taste of metropolitan journalism would invite a compensating favor for it in new york but first fulkerson and then the event proved him wrong in spite of the quality of the magazine and in spite of the kindness which so many newspaper men felt for fulkerson the notices in the new york papers seemed grudging and provisional to the ardor of the editor a merit in the work was acknowledged and certain defects in it for which march had trembled were ignored but the critics astonished him by selecting for censure points which he was either proud of or had never noticed which being now brought to his notice he still could not feel were faults he owned to fulkerson that if they had said so and so against it he could have agreed with them but that to say thus and so was preposterous and that if the advertising had not been adjusted with such generous recognition of the claims of the different papers he should have known the countingroom was at the bottom of it as it was he could only attribute it to perversity or stupidity it was certainly stupid to condemn a magazine novelty like every other week for being novel and to augur that if it failed it would fail through its departure from the lines on which all the other prosperous magazines had been built was in the last degree perverse and it looked malicious the fact that it was neither exactly a book nor a magazine ought to be for it and not against it since it would invade no other field it would prosper on no ground but its own     xiv  the more march thought of the injustice of the new york press which had not however attacked the literary quality of the number the more bitterly he resented it and his wifes indignation superheated his own every other week had become a very personal affair with the whole family the children shared their parents disgust belle was outspoken in her denunciations of a venal press mrs march saw nothing but ruin ahead and began tacitly to plan a retreat to boston and an establishment retrenched to the basis of two thousand a year she shed some secret tears in anticipation of the privations which this must involve but when fulkerson came to see march rather late the night of the publication day she nobly told him that if the worst came to the worst she could only have the kindliest feeling toward him and should not regard him as in the slightest degree responsible  oh hold on hold on he protested you dont think weve made a failure do you  why of course she faltered while march remained gloomily silent  well i guess well wait for the official count first even new york hasnt gone against us and i guess theres a majority coming down to harlem river that could sweep everything before it anyway  what do you mean fulkerson march demanded sternly  oh nothing only the news company has ordered ten thousand now and you know we had to give them the first twenty on commission  what do you mean march repeated his wife held her breath  i mean that the first number is a booming success already and that its going to a hundred thousand before it stops that unanimity and variety of censure in the morning papers combined with the attractiveness of the thing itself has cleared every stand in the city and now if the favor of the country press doesnt turn the tide against us our fortunes made the marches remained dumb why look here didnt i tell you those criticisms would be the making of us when they first began to turn you blue this morning march  he came home to lunch perfectly sick said mrs marcli and i wouldnt let him go back again  didnt i tell you so fulkerson persisted  march could not remember that he had or that he had been anything but incoherently and hysterically jocose over the papers but he said yes yesi think so  i knew it from the start said fulkerson the only other person who took those criticisms in the right spirit was mother dryfoosive just been bolstering up the dryfoos family she had them read to her by mrs mandel and she understood them to be all the most flattering prophecies of success well i didnt read between the lines to that extent quite but i saw that they were going to help us if there was anything in us more than anything that could have been done and there was something in us i tell you march that sevenshooting selfcocking donkey of a beaton has given us the greatest start hes caught on like a mouse hes made the thing awfully chic its jimmy theres lots of dog about it hes managed that process so that the illustrations look as expensive as firstclass woodcuts and theyre cheaper than chromos hes put style into the whole thing  oh yes said march with eager meekness its beaton thats done it  fulkerson read jealousy of beaton in mrs marchs face beaton has given us the start because his work appeals to the eye theres no denying that the pictures have sold this first number but i expect the literature of this first number to sell the pictures of the second ive been reading it all over nearly since i found how the cat was jumping i was anxious about it and i tell you old man its good yes sir i was afraid maybe you had got it too good with that boston refinement of yours but i reckon you havent ill risk it i dont see how you got so much variety into so few things and all of them palpitant all of em on the keen jump with actuality  the mixture of american slang with the jargon of european criticism in fulkersons talk made march smile but his wife did not seem to notice it in her exultation that is just what i say she broke in its perfectly wonderful i never was anxious about it a moment except as you say mr fulkerson i was afraid it might be too good  they went on in an antiphony of praise till march said really i dont see whats left me but to strike for higher wages i perceive that im indispensable  why old man youre coming in on the divvy you know said fulkerson  they both laughed and when fulkerson was gone mrs march asked her husband what a divvy was  its a chicken before its hatched  no truly  he explained and she began to spend the divvy  at mrs leightons fulkerson gave alma all the honor of the success he told her mother that the girls design for the cover had sold every number and mrs leighton believed him  well ah think ah maght have some of the glory miss woodburn pouted where am ah comin in  youre coming in on the cover of the next number said fulkerson were going to have your face there miss leightons going to sketch it in he said this reckless of the fact that he had already shown them the design of the second number which was beatons weird bit of gascountry landscape  ah dont see why you dont wrahte the fiction for your magazine mr fulkerson said the girl  this served to remind fulkerson of something he turned to her father ill tell you what colonel woodburn i want mr march to see some chapters of that book of yours ive been talking to him about it  i do not think it would add to the popularity of your periodical sir said the colonel with a stately pleasure in being asked my views of a civilization based upon responsible slavery would hardly be acceptable to your commercialized society  well not as a practical thing of course fulkerson admitted but as something retrospective speculative i believe it would make a hit theres so much going on now about social questions i guess people would like to read it  i do not know that my work is intended to amuse people said the colonel with some state  mah goodness ah only wish it was then said his daughter and she added yes mr fulkerson the colonel will be very glad to submit potions of his woak to yo edito we want to have some of the honaw perhaps we can say we helped to stop yo magazine if we didnt help to stawt it  they all laughed at her boldness and fulkerson said it ll take a good deal more than that to stop every other week the colonels whole book couldnt do it then he looked unhappy for colonel woodburn did not seem to enjoy his reassuring words but miss woodburn came to his rescue you maght illustrate it with the potrait of the awthoris daughtaw if its too late for the covah  going to have that in every number miss woodburn he cried  oh mah goodness she said with mock humility  alma sat looking at her piquant head black unconsciously outlined against the lamp as she sat working by the table just keep still a moment  she got her sketchblock and pencils and began to draw fulkerson tilted himself forward and looked over her shoulder he smiled outwardly inwardly he was divided between admiration of miss woodburns arch beauty and appreciation of the skill which reproduced it at the same time he was trying to remember whether march had authorized him to go so far as to ask for a sight of colonel woodburns manuscript he felt that he had trenched upon marchs province and he framed one apology to the editor for bringing him the manuscript and another to the author for bringing it back  most ah hold raght still like it was a photograph asked miss woodburn can ah toak  talk all you want said alma squinting her eyes and you neednt be either adamantine nor yetwooden  oh ho very good of you well if ah can toakgo on mr fulkerson  me talk i cant breathe till this thing is done sighed fulkerson at that point of his mental drama the colonel was behaving rustily about the return of his manuscript and he felt that he was looking his last on miss woodburns profile  is she getting it raght asked the girl  i dont know which is which said fulkerson  oh ah hope ah shall ah dont want to go round feelin like a sheet of papah half the time  you could rattle on just the same suggested alma  oh now jost listen to that mr fulkerson do you call that any way to toak to people  you might know which you were by the color fulkerson began and then he broke off from the personal consideration with a business inspiration and smacked himself on the knee we could print it in color  mrs leighton gathered up her sewing and held it with both hands in her lap while she came round and looked critically at the sketch and the model over her glasses its very good alma she said  colonel woodburn remained restively on his side of the table of course mr fulkerson you were jesting sir when you spoke of printing a sketch of my daughter  why i dont knowif you object  i do sirdecidedly said the colonel  then that settles it of coursei only meant  indeed it doesnt cried the girl whos to know who its from ahm jost set on havin it printed ahm going to appear as the head of slaveryin opposition to the head of liberty  therell be a revolution inside of fortyeight hours and well have the colonels system going wherever a copy of every other week circulates said fulkerson  this sketch belongs to me alma interposed im not going to let it be printed  oh mah goodness said miss woodburn laughing goodhumoredly thats becose you were brought up to hate slavery  i should like mr beaton to see it said mrs leighton in a sort of absent tone she added to fulkerson i rather expected he might be in tonight  well if he comes well leave it to beaton fulkerson said with relief in the solution and an anxious glance at the colonel across the table to see how he took that form of the joke miss woodburn intercepted his glance and laughed and fulkerson laughed too but rather forlornly  alma set her lips primly and turned her head first on one side and then on the other to look at the sketch i dont think well leave it to mr beaton even if he comes  we left the other design for the cover to beaton fulkerson insinuated i guess you neednt be afraid of him  is it a question of my being afraid alma asked she seemed coolly intent on her drawing  miss leighton thinks he ought to be afraid of her miss woodburn explained  its a question of his courage then said alma  well i dont think there are many young ladies that beatons afraid of said fulkerson giving himself the respite of this purely random remark while he interrogated the faces of mrs leighton and colonel woodburn for some light upon the tendency of their daughters words  he was not helped by mrs leightons saying with a certain anxiety i dont know what you mean mr fulkerson  well youre as much in the dark as i am myself then said fulkerson i suppose i meant that beaton is ratherafavorite you know the women like him  mrs leighton sighed and colonel woodburn rose and left the room  in the silence that followed fulkerson looked from one lady to the other with dismay i seem to have put my foot in it somehow he suggested and miss woodburn gave a cry of laughter  poo mr fulkerson poo mr fulkerson papa thoat you wanted him to go  wanted him to go repeated fulkerson  we always mention mr beaton when we want to get rid of papa  well it seems to me that i have noticed that he didnt take much interest in beaton as a general topic but i dont know that i ever saw it drive him out of the room before  well he isnt always so bad said miss woodburn but it was a case of hate at first sight and it seems to be growin on papa  well i can understand that said fulkerson the impulse to destroy beaton is something that everybody has to struggle against at the start  i must say mr fulkerson said mrs leighton in the tremor through which she nerved herself to differ openly with any one she liked i never had to struggle with anything of the kind in regard to mr beaton he has always been most respectful andandconsiderate with me whatever he has been with others  well of course mrs leighton fulkerson came back in a soothing tone but you see youre the rule that proves the exception i was speaking of the way men felt about beaton its different with ladies i just said so  is it always different alma asked lifting her head and her hand from her drawing and staring at it absently  fulkerson pushed both his hands through his whiskers look here look here he said wont somebody start some other subject we havent had the weather up yet have we or the opera what is the matter with a few remarks about politics  why ah thoat you lahked to toak about the staff of yo magazine said miss woodburn  oh i do said fulkerson but not always about the same member of it he gets monotonous when he doesnt get complicated ive just come round from the marches he added to mrs leighton  i suppose theyve got thoroughly settled in their apartment by this time mrs leighton said something like this whenever the marches were mentioned at the bottom of her heart she had not forgiven them for not taking her rooms she had liked their looks so much and she was always hoping that they were uncomfortable or dissatisfied she could not help wanting them punished a little  well yes as much as they ever will be fulkerson answered the boston style is pretty different you know and the marches are oldfashioned folks and i reckon they never went in much for bricabrac theyve put away nine or ten barrels of dragon candlesticks but they keep finding new ones  their landlady has just joined our class said alma isnt her name green she happened to see my copy of every other week and said she knew the editor and told me  well its a little world said fulkerson you seem to be touching elbows with everybody just think of your having had our head translator for a model  ah think that your whole publication revolves aroand the leighton family said miss woodburn  thats pretty much so fulkerson admitted anyhow the publisher seems disposed to do so  are you the publisher i thought it was mr dryfoos said alma  it is  oh  the tone and the word gave fulkerson a discomfort which he promptly confessed missed again  the girls laughed and he regained something of his lost spirits and smiled upon their gayety which lasted beyond any apparent reason for it  miss woodburn asked and is mr dryfoos senio anything like ouah mr dryfoos  not the least  but hes jost as exemplary  yes in his way  well ah wish ah could see all those pinks of puffection togethah once  why look here ive been thinking id celebrate a little when the old gentleman gets back have a little suppersomething of that kind how would you like to let me have your parlors for it mrs leighton you ladies could stand on the stairs and have a peep at us in the bunch  oh mah what a privilege and will miss alma be there with the othah contributors ah shall jost expah of envy  she wont be there in person said fulkerson but shell be represented by the head of the art department  mah goodness and wholl the head of the publishing department represent  he can represent you said alma  well ah want to be represented someho  well have the banquet the night before you appear on the cover of our fourth number said fulkerson  ah thoat that was doubly fobidden said miss woodburn by the stern parent and the envious awtust  well get beaton to get round them somehow i guess we can trust him to manage that  mrs leighton sighed her resentment of the implication  i always feel that mr beaton doesnt do himself justice she began  fulkerson could not forego the chance of a joke well maybe he would rather temper justice with mercy in a case like his this made both the younger ladies laugh i judge this is my chance to get off with my life he added and he rose as he spoke mrs leighton i am about the only man of my sex who doesnt thirst for beatons blood most of the time but i know him and i dont hes more kinds of a good fellow than people generally understand he doesnt wear his heart upon his sleevenot his ulster sleeve anyway you can always count me on your side when its a question of finding beaton not guilty if hell leave the state  alma set her drawing against the wall in rising to say goodnight to fulkerson he bent over on his stick to look at it well its beautiful he sighed with unconscious sincerity  alma made him a courtesy of mock modesty thanks to miss woodburn  oh no all she had to do was simply to stay put  dont you think ah might have improved it if ah had looked better the girl asked gravely  oh you couldnt said fulkerson and he went off triumphant in their applause and their cries of which which  mrs leighton sank deep into an accusing gloom when at last she found herself alone with her daughter i dont know what you are thinking about alma leighton if you dont like mr beaton  i dont  you dont you know better than that you know that you did care for him  oh thats a very different thing thats a thing that can be got over  got over repeated mrs leighton aghast  of course it can dont be romantic mamma people get over dozens of such fancies they even marry for love two or three times  never cried her mother doing her best to feel shocked and at last looking it  her looking it had no effect upon alma you can easily get over caring for people but you cant get over liking themif you like them because they are sweet and good thats what lasts i was a simple goose and he imposed upon me because he was a sophisticated goose now the case is reversed  he does care for you now you can see it why do you encourage him to come here  i dont said alma i will tell him to keep away if you like but whether he comes or goes it will be the same  not to him alma he is in love with you  he has never said so  and you would really let him say so when you intend to refuse him  i cant very well refuse him till he does say so  this was undeniable mrs leighton could only demand in an awful tone may i ask whyif you cared for him and i know you care for him still you will refuse him  alma laughed becausebecause im wedded to my art and im not going to commit bigamy whatever i do  alma  well then because i dont like himthat is i dont believe in him and dont trust him hes fascinating but hes false and hes fickle he cant help it i dare say  and you are perfectly hard is it possible that you were actually pleased to have mr fulkerson tease you about mr dryfoos  oh goodnight now mamma this is becoming personal   pg editors bookmarks      artists never do anything like other people     ballast of her instinctive despondency     clinging persistence of such natures     dividend its a chicken before its hatched     gayety which lasted beyond any apparent reason for it     hopeful recklessness     how much can a man honestly earn without wronging or oppressing     i cannot endure thisthis hopefulness of yours     if you dread harm enough it is less likely to happen     it must be your despair that helps you to bear up     marry for love two or three times     no man deserves to sufer at the hands of another     patience with mediocrity putting on the style of genius     person talks about taking lessons as if they could learn it     say when he is gone that the woman gets along better without him     shouldnt ca fo the disgrace of bein pooits inconvenience     timidity of the elder in the presence of the younger man     part third     i  the scheme of a banquet to celebrate the initial success of every other week expanded in fulkersons fancy into a series instead of the publishing and editorial force with certain of the more representative artists and authors sitting down to a modest supper in mrs leightons parlors he conceived of a dinner at delmonicos with the principal literary and artistic people throughout the country as guests and an inexhaustible hospitality to reporters and correspondents from whom paragraphs prophetic and historic would flow weeks before and after the first of the series he said the thing was a new departure in magazines it amounted to something in literature as radical as the american revolution in politics it was the idea of self government in the arts and it was this idea that had never yet been fully developed in regard to it that was what must be done in the speeches at the dinner and the speeches must be reported then it would go like wildfire he asked march whether he thought mr depew could be got to come mark twain he was sure would come he was a literary man they ought to invite mr evarts and the cardinal and the leading protestant divines his ambition stopped at nothing nothing but the question of expense there he had to wait the return of the elder dryfoos from the west and dryfoos was still delayed at moffitt and fulkerson openly confessed that he was afraid he would stay there till his own enthusiasm escaped in other activities other plans  fulkerson was as little likely as possible to fall under a superstitious subjection to another man but march could not help seeing that in this possible measure dryfoos was fulkersons fetish he did not revere him march decided because it was not in fulkersons nature to revere anything he could like and dislike but he could not respect apparently however dryfoos daunted him somehow and besides the homage which those who have not pay to those who have fulkerson rendered dryfoos the tribute of a feeling which march could only define as a sort of bewilderment as well as march could make out this feeling was evoked by the spectacle of dryfooss unfailing luck which fulkerson was fond of dazzling himself with it perfectly consisted with a keen sense of whatever was sordid and selfish in a man on whom his career must have had its inevitable effect he liked to philosophize the case with march to recall dryfoos as he was when he first met him still somewhat in the sap at moffitt and to study the processes by which he imagined him to have dried into the hardened speculator without even the pretence to any advantage but his own in his ventures he was aware of painting the character too vividly and he warned march not to accept it exactly in those tints but to subdue them and shade it for himself he said that where his advantage was not concerned there was ever so much good in dryfoos and that if in some things he had grown inflexible he had expanded in others to the full measure of the vast scale on which he did business it had seemed a little odd to march that a man should put money into such an enterprise as every other week and go off about other affairs not only without any sign of anxiety but without any sort of interest but fulkerson said that was the splendid side of dryfoos he had a courage a magnanimity that was equal to the strain of any such uncertainty he had faced the music once for all when he asked fulkerson what the thing would cost in the different degrees of potential failure and then he had gone off leaving everything to fulkerson and the younger dryfoos with the instruction simply to go ahead and not bother him about it fulkerson called that pretty tall for an old fellow who used to bewail the want of pigs and chickens to occupy his mind he alleged it as another proof of the versatility of the american mind and of the grandeur of institutions and opportunities that let every man grow to his full size so that any man in america could run the concern if necessary he believed that old dryfoos could step into bismarcks shoes and run the german empire at ten days notice or about as long as it would take him to go from new york to berlin but bismarck would not know anything about dryfooss plans till dryfoos got ready to show his hand fulkerson himself did not pretend to say what the old man had been up to since he went west he was at moffitt first and then he was at chicago and then he had gone out to denver to look after some mines he had out there and a railroad or two and now he was at moffitt again he was supposed to be closing up his affairs there but nobody could say  fulkerson told march the morning after dryfoos returned that he had not only not pulled out at moffitt but had gone in deeper ten times deeper than ever he was in a royal goodhumor fulkerson reported and was going to drop into the office on his way up from the street march understood wall street that afternoon he was tickled to death with every other week so far as it had gone and was anxious to pay his respects to the editor  march accounted for some rhetoric in this but let it flatter him and prepared himself for a meeting about which he could see that fulkerson was only less nervous than he had shown himself about the public reception of the first number it gave march a disagreeable feeling of being owned and of being about to be inspected by his proprietor but he fell back upon such independence as he could find in the thought of those two thousand dollars of income beyond the caprice of his owner and maintained an outward serenity  he was a little ashamed afterward of the resolution it had cost him to do so it was not a question of dryfooss physical presence that was rather effective than otherwise and carried a suggestion of moneyed indifference to convention in the gray business suit of provincial cut and the low widebrimmed hat of flexible black felt he had a stick with an oldfashioned top of buckhorn worn smooth and bright by the palm of his hand which had not lost its character in fat and which had a history of former work in its enlarged knuckles though it was now as soft as marchs and must once have been small even for a man of mr dryfooss stature he was below the average size but what struck march was the fact that dryfoos seemed furtively conscious of being a country person and of being aware that in their meeting he was to be tried by other tests than those which would have availed him as a shrewd speculator he evidently had some curiosity about march as the first of his kind whom he had encountered some such curiosity as the country school trustee feels and tries to hide in the presence of the new schoolmaster but the whole affair was of course on a higher plane on one side dryfoos was much more a man of the world than march was and he probably divined this at once and rested himself upon the fact in a measure it seemed to be his preference that his son should introduce them for he came upstairs with conrad and they had fairly made acquaintance before fulkerson joined them  conrad offered to leave them at once but his father made him stay i reckon mr march and i havent got anything so private to talk about that we want to keep it from the other partners well mr march are you getting used to new york yet it takes a little time  oh yes but not so much time as most places everybody belongs more or less in new york nobody has to belong here altogether  yes that is so you can try it and go away if you dont like it a good deal easier than you could from a smaller place wouldnt make so much talk would it he glanced at march with a jocose light in his shrewd eyes that is the way i feel about it all the time just visiting now it wouldnt be that way in boston i reckon  you couldnt keep on visiting there your whole life said march  dryfoos laughed showing his lower teeth in a way that was at once simple and fierce mr fulkerson didnt hardly know as he could get you to leave i suppose you got used to it there i never been in your city  i had got used to it but it was hardly my city except by marriage my wifes a bostonian  shes been a little homesick here then said dryfoos with a smile of the same quality as his laugh  less than i expected said march of course she was very much attached to our old home  i guess my wife wont ever get used to new york said dryfoos and he drew in his lower lip with a sharp sigh but my girls like it theyre young you never been out our way yet mr march out west  well only for the purpose of being born and brought up i used to live in crawfordsville and then indianapolis  indianapolis is bound to be a great place said dryfoos i remember now mr fulkerson told me you was from our state he went on to brag of the west as if march were an easterner and had to be convinced you ought to see all that country its a great country  oh yes said march i understand that he expected the praise of the great west to lead up to some comment on every other week and there was abundant suggestion of that topic in the manuscripts proofs of letterpress and illustrations with advance copies of the latest number strewn over his table  but dryfoos apparently kept himself from looking at these things he rolled his head about on his shoulders to take in the character of the room and said to his son you didnt change the woodwork after all  no the architect thought we had better let it be unless we meant to change the whole place he liked its being oldfashioned  i hope you feel comfortable here mr march the old man said bringing his eyes to bear upon him again after their tour of inspection  too comfortable for a workingman said march and he thought that this remark must bring them to some talk about his work but the proprietor only smiled again  i guess i shant lose much on this house he returned as if musing aloud this downtown property is coming up business is getting in on all these side streets i thought i paid a pretty good price for it too he went on to talk of real estate and march began to feel a certain resentment at his continued avoidance of the only topic in which they could really have a common interest you live down this way somewhere dont you the old man concluded  yes i wished to be near my work march was vexed with himself for having recurred to it but afterward he was not sure but dryfoos shared his own diffidence in the matter and was waiting for him to bring it openly into the talk at times he seemed wary and masterful and then march felt that he was being examined and tested at others so simple that march might well have fancied that he needed encouragement and desired it he talked of his wife and daughters in a way that invited march to say friendly things of his family which appeared to give the old man first an undue pleasure and then a final distrust at moments he turned with an effect of finding relief in it to his son and spoke to him across march of matters which he was unacquainted with he did not seem aware that this was rude but the young man must have felt it so he always brought the conversation back and once at some cost to himself when his father made it personal  i want to make a regular new york business man out of that fellow he said to march pointing at conrad with his stick you spose im ever going to do it  well i dont know said march trying to fall in with the joke do you mean nothing but a business man  the old man laughed at whatever latent meaning he fancied in this and said you think he would be a little too much for me there well ive seen enough of em to know it dont always take a large pattern of a man to do a large business but i want him to get the business training and then if he wants to go into something else he knows what the world is anyway heigh  oh yes march assented with some compassion for the young man reddening patiently under his fathers comment  dryfoos went on as if his son were not in hearing now that boy wanted to be a preacher what does a preacher know about the world he preaches against when hes been brought up a preacher he dont know so much as a bad little boy in his sundayschool he knows about as much as a girl i always told him you be a man first and then you be a preacher if you want to heigh  precisely march began to feel some compassion for himself in being witness of the young fellows discomfort under his fathers homily  when we first come to new york i told him now heres your chance to see the world on a big scale you know already what work and saving and steady habits and sense will bring a man to you dont want to go round among the rich you want to go among the poor and see what laziness and drink and dishonesty and foolishness will bring men to and i guess he knows about as well as anybody and if he ever goes to preaching hell know what hes preaching about the old man smiled his fierce simple smile and in his sharp eyes march fancied contempt of the ambition he had balked in his son the present scene must have been one of many between them ending in meek submission on the part of the young man whom his father perhaps without realizing his cruelty treated as a child march took it hard that he should be made to suffer in the presence of a coordinate power like himself and began to dislike the old man out of proportion to his offence which might have been mere want of taste or an effect of mere embarrassment before him but evidently whatever rebellion his daughters had carried through against him he had kept his dominion over this gentle spirit unbroken march did not choose to make any response but to let him continue if he would entirely upon his own impulse     ii  a silence followed of rather painful length it was broken by the cheery voice of fulkerson sent before him to herald fulkersons cheery person well i suppose youve got the glorious success of every other week down pretty cold in your talk by this time i should have been up sooner to join you but i was nipping a man for the last page of the cover i guess well have to let the muse have that for an advertisement instead of a poem the next time march well the old gentleman given you boys your scolding the person of fulkerson had got into the room long before he reached this question and had planted itself astride a chair fulkerson looked over the chairback now at march and now at the elder dryfoos as he spoke  march answered him i guess we must have been waiting for you fulkerson at any rate we hadnt got to the scolding yet  why i didnt suppose mr dryfoos could a held in so long i understood he was awful mad at the way the thing started off and wanted to give you a piece of his mind when he got at you i inferred as much from a remark that he made march and dryfoos looked foolish as men do when made the subject of this sort of merry misrepresentation  i reckon my scolding will keep awhile yet said the old man dryly  well then i guess its a good chance to give mr dryfoos an idea of what weve really donejust while were resting as artemus ward says heigh march  i will let you blow the trumpet fulkerson i think it belongs strictly to the advertising department said march he now distinctly resented the old mans failure to say anything to him of the magazine he made his inference that it was from a suspicion of his readiness to presume upon a recognition of his share in the success and he was determined to second no sort of appeal for it  the advertising department is the heart and soul of every business said fulkerson hardily and i like to keep my hand in with a little practise on the trumpet in private i dont believe mr dryfoos has got any idea of the extent of this thing hes been out among those rackensackens where we were all born and hes read the notices in their seven by nine dailies and hes seen the thing selling on the cars and he thinks he appreciates whats been done but i should just like to take him round in this little old metropolis awhile and show him every other week on the centre tables of the millionairesthe vanderbilts and the astorsand in the homes of culture and refinement everywhere and let him judge for himself its the talk of the clubs and the dinnertables children cry for it its the castoria of literature and the pearline of art the wontbehappytillhegetsit of every en lightened man woman and child in this vast city i knew we could capture the country but my goodness i didnt expect to have new york fall into our hands at a blow but thats just exactly what new york has done every other week supplies the longfelt want thats been grinding round in new york and keeping it awake nights ever since the war its the culmination of all the high and ennobling ideals of the past  how much asked dryfoos do you expect to get out of it the first year if it keeps the start its got  comes right down to business every time said fulkerson referring the characteristic to march with a delighted glance well sir if everything works right and we get rain enough to fill up the springs and it isnt a grasshopper year i expect to clear above all expenses something in the neighborhood of twentyfive thousand dollars  humph and you are all going to work a yeareditor manager publisher artists writers printers and the rest of emto clear twentyfive thousand dollarsi made that much in half a day in moffitt once i see it made in half a minute in wall street sometimes the old man presented this aspect of the case with a goodnatured contempt which included fulkerson and his enthusiasm in an obvious liking  his son suggested but when we make that money here no one loses it  can you prove that his father turned sharply upon him whatever is won is lost its all a game it dont make any difference what you bet on business is business and a business man takes his risks with his eyes open  ah but the glory fulkerson insinuated with impudent persiflage i hadnt got to the glory yet because its hard to estimate it but put the glory at the lowest figure mr dryfoos and add it to the twentyfive thousand and youve got an annual income from every other week of dollars enough to construct a silver railroad doubletrack from this office to the moon i dont mention any of the sister planets because i like to keep within bounds  dryfoos showed his lower teeth for pleasure in fulkersons fooling and said thats what i like about you mr fulkersonyou always keep within bounds  well i aint a shrinking boston violet like march here more sunflower in my style of diffidence but i am modest i dont deny it said fulkerson and i do hate to have a thing overstated  and the gloryyou do really think theres something in the glory that pays  not a doubt of it i shouldnt care for the paltry return in money said fulkerson with a burlesque of generous disdain if it wasnt for the glory along with it  and how should you feel about the glory if there was no money along with it  well sir im happy to say we havent come to that yet  now conrad here said the old man with a sort of pathetic rancor would rather have the glory alone i believe he dont even care much for your kind of glory either mr fulkerson  fulkerson ran his little eyes curiously over conrads face and then marchs as if searching for a trace there of something gone before which would enable him to reach dryfooss whole meaning he apparently resolved to launch himself upon conjecture oh well we know how conrad feels about the things of this world anyway i should like to take em on the plane of another sphere too sometimes but i noticed a good while ago that this was the world i was born into and so i made up my mind that i would do pretty much what i saw the rest of the folks doing here below and i cant see but what conrad runs the thing on business principles in his department and i guess youll find it so if you look into it i consider that were a whole team and big dog under the wagon with you to draw on for supplies and march here at the head of the literary business and conrad in the countingroom and me to do the heavy lying in the advertising part oh and beaton of course in the art i most forgot beatonhamlet with hamlet left out  dryfoos looked across at his son wasnt that the fellows name that was there last night  yes said conrad  the old man rose well i reckon i got to be going you ready to go uptown conrad  well not quite yet father  the old man shook hands with march and went downstairs followed by his son  fulkerson remained  he didnt jump at the chance you gave him to compliment us all round fulkerson said march with a smile not wholly of pleasure  fulkerson asked with as little joy in the grin he had on didnt he say anything to you before i came in  not a word  dogged if i know what to make of it sighed fulkerson but i guess hes been having a talk with conrad thats soured on him i reckon maybe he came back expecting to find that boy reconciled to the glory of this world and conrads showed himself just as set against it as ever  it might have been that march admitted pensively i fancied something of the kind myself from words the old man let drop  fulkerson made him explain and then he said  thats it then and its all right conrad ll come round in time and all weve got to do is to have patience with the old man till he does i know he likes you fulkerson affirmed this only interrogatively and looked so anxiously to march for corroboration that march laughed  he dissembled his love he said but afterward in describing to his wife his interview with mr dryfoos he was less amused with this fact  when she saw that he was a little cast down by it she began to encourage him hes just a common ignorant man and probably didnt know how to express himself you may be perfectly sure that hes delighted with the success of the magazine and that he understands as well as you do that he owes it all to you  ah im not so sure i dont believe a mans any better for having made money so easily and rapidly as dryfoos has done and i doubt if hes any wiser i dont know just the point hes reached in his evolution from grub to beetle but i do know that so far as its gone the process must have involved a bewildering change of ideals and criterions i guess hes come to despise a great many things that he once respected and that intellectual ability is among themwhat we call intellectual ability he must have undergone a moral deterioration an atrophy of the generous instincts and i dont see why it shouldnt have reached his mental makeup he has sharpened but he has narrowed his sagacity has turned into suspicion his caution to meanness his courage to ferocity thats the way i philosophize a man of dryfooss experience and i am not very proud when i realize that such a man and his experience are the ideal and ambition of most americans i rather think they came pretty near being mine once  no dear they never did his wife protested  well theyre not likely to be in the future the dryfoos feature of every other week is thoroughly distasteful to me  why but he hasnt really got anything to do with it has he beyond furnishing the money  thats the impression that fulkerson has allowed us to get but the man that holds the purse holds the reins he may let us guide the horse but when he likes he can drive if we dont like his driving then we can get down  mrs march was less interested in this figure of speech than in the personal aspects involved then you think mr fulkerson has deceived you  oh no said her husband laughing but i think he has deceived himself perhaps  how she pursued  he may have thought he was using dryfoos when dryfoos was using him and he may have supposed he was not afraid of him when he was very much so his courage hadnt been put to the test and courage is a matter of proof like proficiency on the fiddle you know you cant tell whether youve got it till you try  nonsense do you mean that he would ever sacrifice you to mr dryfoos  i hope he may not be tempted but id rather be taking the chances with fulkerson alone than with fulkerson and dryfoos to back him dryfoos seems somehow to take the poetry and the pleasure out of the thing  mrs march was a long time silent then she began well my dear i never wanted to come to new york  neither did i march promptly put in  but now that were here she went on im not going to have you letting every little thing discourage you i dont see what there was in mr dryfooss manner to give you any anxiety hes just a common stupid inarticulate country person and he didnt know how to express himself as i said in the beginning and thats the reason he didnt say anything  well i dont deny youre right about it  its dreadful his wife continued to be mixed up with such a man and his family but i dont believe hell ever meddle with your management and till he does all you need do is to have as little to do with him as possible and go quietly on your own way  oh i shall go on quietly enough said march i hope i shant begin going stealthily  well my dear said mrs march just let me know when youre tempted to do that if ever you sacrifice the smallest grain of your honesty or your selfrespect to mr dryfoos or anybody else i will simply renounce you  in view of that im rather glad the management of every other week involves tastes and not convictions said march     iii  that night dryfoos was wakened from his afterdinner nap by the sound of gay talk and nervous giggling in the drawingroom the talk which was christines and the giggling which was melas were intershot with the heavier tones of a mans voice and dryfoos lay awhile on the leathern lounge in his library trying to make out whether he knew the voice his wife sat in a deep chair before the fire with her eyes on his face waiting for him to wake  who is that out there he asked without opening his eyes  indeed indeed i dont know jacob his wife answered i reckon its just some visitor of the girls  was i snoring  not a bit you was sleeping as quiet i did hate to have em wake you and i was just goin out to shoo them theyve been playin something and that made them laugh  i didnt know but i had snored said the old man sitting up  no said his wife then she asked wistfully was you out at the old place jacob  yes  did it look natural  yes mostly theyre sinking the wells down in the woods pasture  andthe childrens graves  they havent touched that part but i reckon we got to have em moved to the cemetery i bought a lot  the old woman began softly to weep it does seem too hard that they cant be let to rest in peace pore little things i wanted you and me to lay there too when our time come jacob just there back o the beehives and under them shoomakesmy i can see the very place and i dont believe ill ever feel at home anywheres else i woont know where i am when the trumpet sounds i have to think before i can tell where the east is in new york and what if i should git faced the wrong way when i raise jacob i wonder you could sell it her head shook and the firelight shone on her tears as she searched the folds of her dress for her pocket  a peal of laughter came from the drawingroom and then the sound of chords struck on the piano  hush dont you cry lizbeth said dryfoos here take my handkerchief ive got a nice lot in the cemetery and im goin to have a monument with two lambs on itlike the one you always liked so much it aint the fashion any more to have family buryin grounds theyre collectin em into the cemeteries all round  i reckon i got to bear it said his wife muffling her face in his handkerchief and i suppose the lord kin find me wherever i am but i always did want to lay just there you mind how we used to go out and set there after milkin and watch the sun go down and talk about where their angels was and try to figger it out  i remember lizbeth  the mans voice in the drawingroom sang a snatch of french song insolent mocking salient and then christines attempted the same strain and another cry of laughter from mela followed  well i always did expect to lay there but i reckon its all right it wont be a great while now anyway jacob i dont believe im agoin to live very long i know it dont agree with me here  oh i guess it does lizbeth youre just a little pulled down with the weather its coming spring and you feel it but the doctor says youre all right i stopped in on the way up and he says so  i reckon he dont know everything the old woman persisted ive been runnin down ever since we left moffitt and i didnt feel any too well there even its a very strange thing jacob that the richer you git the less you aint able to stay where you want to dead or alive  its for the children we do it said dryfoos we got to give them their chance in the world  oh the world they ought to bear the yoke in their youth like we done i know its what coonrod would like to do  dryfoos got upon his feet if coonrod ll mind his own business and do what i want him to hell have yoke enough to bear he moved from his wife without further effort to comfort her and pottered heavily out into the diningroom beyond its obscurity stretched the glitter of the deep drawingroom his feet in their broad flat slippers made no sound on the dense carpet and he came unseen upon the little group there near the piano mela perched upon the stool with her back to the keys and beaton bent over christine who sat with a banjo in her lap letting him take her hands and put them in the right place on the instrument her face was radiant with happiness and mela was watching her with foolish unselfish pleasure in her bliss  there was nothing wrong in the affair to a man of dryfooss traditions and perceptions and if it had been at home in the farm sittingroom or even in his parlor at moffitt he would not have minded a young mans placing his daughters hands on a banjo or even holding them there it would have seemed a proper attention from him if he was courting her but here in such a house as this with the daughter of a man who had made as much money as he had he did not know but it was a liberty he felt the angry doubt of it which beset him in regard to so many experiences of his changed life he wanted to show his sense of it if it was a liberty but he did not know how and he did not know that it was so besides he could not help a touch of the pleasure in christines happiness which mela showed and he would have gone back to the library if he could without being discovered  but beaton had seen him and dryfoos with a nonchalant nod to the young man came forward what you got there christine  a banjo said the girl blushing in her fathers presence  mela gurgled mr beaton is learnun her the first position  beaton was not embarrassed he was in evening dress and his face pointed with its brown beard showed extremely handsome above the expanse of his broad white shirtfront he gave back as nonchalant a nod as he had got and without further greeting to dryfoos he said to christine no no you must keep your hand and arm so he held them in position there now strike with your right hand see  i dont believe i can ever learn said the girl with a fond upward look at him  oh yes you can said beaton  they both ignored dryfoos in the little play of protests which followed and he said half jocosely half suspiciously and is the banjo the fashion now he remembered it as the emblem of lowdown show business and associated it with endmen and blackened faces and grotesque shirtcollars  its all the rage mela shouted in answer for all everybody plays it mr beaton borrowed this from a lady friend of his  humph pity i got you a piano then said dryfoos a banjo would have been cheaper  beaton so far admitted him to the conversation as to seem reminded of the piano by his mentioning it he said to mela oh wont you just strike those chords and as mela wheeled about and beat the keys he took the banjo from christine and sat down with it this way he strummed it and murmured the tune dryfoos had heard him singing from the library while he kept his beautiful eyes floating on christines you try that now its very simple  where is mrs mandel dryfoos demanded trying to assert himself  neither of the girls seemed to have heard him at first in the chatter they broke into over what beaton proposed then mela said absently oh she had to go out to see one of her friends thats sick and she struck the piano keys come try it chris  dryfoos turned about unheeded and went back to the library he would have liked to put beaton out of his house and in his heart he burned against him as a contumacious hand he would have liked to discharge him from the art department of every other week at once but he was aware of not having treated beaton with much ceremony and if the young man had returned his behavior in kind with an electrical response to his own feeling had he any right to complain after all there was no harm in his teaching christine the banjo  his wife still sat looking into the fire i cant see she said as weve got a bit more comfort of our lives jacob because weve got such piles and piles of money i wisht to gracious we was back on the farm this minute i wisht you had held out aginst the childern about sellin it twould a bin the best thing fur em i say i believe in my soul theyll git spoiled here in new york i kin see a change in em areadyin the girls  dryfoos stretched himself on the lounge again i cant see as coonrod is much comfort either why aint he here with his sisters what does all that work of his on the east side amount to it seems as if he done it to cross me as much as anything dryfoos complained to his wife on the basis of mere affectional habit which in married life often survives the sense of intellectual equality he did not expect her to reason with him but there was help in her listening and though she could only soothe his fretfulness with soft answers which were often wide of the purpose he still went to her for solace here ive gone into this newspaper business or whatever it is on his account and he dont seem any more satisfied than ever i can see he haint got his heart in it  the pore boy tries i know he does jacob and he wants to please you but he give up a good deal when he give up bein a preacher i spose we ought to remember that  a preacher sneered dryfoos i reckon bein a preacher wouldnt satisfy him now he had the impudence to tell me this afternoon that he would like to be a priest and he threw it up to me that he never could be because id kept him from studyin  he dont mean a catholic priestnot a roman one jacob the old woman explained wistfully hes told me all about it they aint the kind o catholics we been used to some sort of piscopalians and they do a heap o good amongst the poor folks over there he says we aint got any idea how folks lives in them tenement houses hundreds of em in one house and whole families in a room and it burns in his heart to help em like them fathers as he calls em that gives their lives to it he cant be a father he says because he cant git the eddication now but he can be a brother and i cant find a word to say aginst it when it gits to talkin jacob  i aint saying anything against his priests lizbeth said dryfoos theyre all well enough in their way theyve given up their lives to it and its a matter of business with them like any other but what im talking about now is coonrod i dont object to his doin all the charity he wants to and the lord knows ive never been stingy with him about it he might have all the money he wants to give round any way he pleases  thats what i told him once but he says money aint the thingor not the only thing you got to give to them poor folks you got to give your time and your knowledge and your lovei dont know what all you got to give yourself if you expect to help em thats what coonrod says  well i can tell him that charity begins at home said dryfoos sitting up in his impatience and hed better give himself to us a littleto his old father and mother and his sisters whats he doin goin off there to his meetings and i dont know what all an leavin them here alone  why aint mr beaton with em asked the old woman i thought i heared his voice  mr beaton of course he is and whos mr beaton anyway  why aint he one of the men in coonrods office i thought i heared  yes he is but who is he whats he doing round here is he makin up to christine  i reckon he is from melys talk shes about crazy over the fellow dont you like him jacob  i dont know him or what he is he hasnt got any manners who brought him here howd he come to come in the first place  mr fulkerson brung him i believe said the old woman patiently  fulkerson dryfoos snorted wheres mrs mandel i should like to know he brought her too does she go traipsin off this way every evening  no she seems to be here pretty regular most o the time i dont know how we could ever git along without her jacob she seems to know just what to do and the girls would be ten times as outbreakin without her i hope you aint thinkin o turnin her off jacob  dryfoos did not think it necessary to answer such a question its all fulkerson fulkerson fulkerson it seems to me that fulkerson about runs this family he brought mrs mandel and he brought that beaton and he brought that boston fellow i guess i give him a dose though and ill learn fulkerson that he cant have everything his own way i dont want anybody to help me spend my money i made it and i can manage it i guess mr fulkerson can bear a little watching now hes been travelling pretty free and hes got the notion hes driving maybe im agoing to look after that book a little myself  youll kill yourself jacob said his wife tryin to do so many things and what is it all fur i dont see as were better off any for all the money its just as much care as it used to be when we was all there on the farm together i wisht we could go back ja  we cant go back shouted the old man fiercely theres no farm any more to go back to the fields is full of gaswells and oilwells and hellholes generally the house is tore down and the barns goin  the barn gasped the old woman oh my  if i was to give all im worth this minute we couldnt go back to the farm any more than them girls in there could go back and be little children i dont say were any better off for the money ive got more of it now than i ever had and theres no end to the luck it pours in but i feel like i was tied hand and foot i dont know which way to move i dont know whats best to do about anything the money dont seem to buy anything but more and more care and trouble we got a big house that we aint at home in and we got a lot of hired girls round under our feet that hinder and dont help our children dont mind us and we got no friends or neighbors but it had to be i couldnt help but sell the farm and we cant go back to it for it aint there so dont you say anything more about it lizbeth  pore jacob said his wife well i woont dear     iv  it was clear to beaton that dryfoos distrusted him and the fact heightened his pleasure in christines liking for him he was as sure of this as he was of the other though he was not so sure of any reason for his pleasure in it she had her charm the charm of wildness to which a certain wildness in himself responded and there were times when his fancy contrived a common future for them which would have a prosperity forced from the old fellows love of the girl beaton liked the idea of this compulsion better than he liked the idea of the money there was something a little repulsive in that he imagined himself rejecting it he almost wished he was enough in love with the girl to marry her without it that would be fine he was taken with her in a certain measure in a certain way the question was in what measure in what way  it was partly to escape from this question that he hurried downtown and decided to spend with the leightons the hour remaining on his hands before it was time to go to the reception for which he was dressed it seemed to him important that he should see alma leighton after all it was her charm that was most abiding with him perhaps it was to be final he found himself very happy in his present relations with her she had dropped that barrier of pretences and ironical surprise it seemed to him that they had gone back to the old ground of common artistic interest which he had found so pleasant the summer before apparently she and her mother had both forgiven his neglect of them in the first months of their stay in new york he was sure that mrs leighton liked him as well as ever and if there was still something a little provisional in almas manner at times it was something that piqued more than it discouraged it made him curious not anxious  he found the young ladies with fulkerson when he rang he seemed to be amusing them both and they were both amused beyond the merit of so small a pleasantry beaton thought when fulkerson said introduce myself mr beaton mr fulkerson of every other week think ive met you at our place the girls laughed and alma explained that her mother was not very well and would be sorry not to see him then she turned as he felt perversely and went on talking with fulkerson and left him to miss woodburn  she finally recognized his disappointment ah dont often get a chance at you mr beaton and ahm just goin to toak yo to death yo have been soath yoself and yo know ho we do toak  ive survived to say yes beaton admitted  oh now do you think we toak so much mo than you do in the noth the young lady deprecated  i dont know i only know you cant talk too much for me i should like to hear you say soath and house and about for the rest of my life  thats what ah call raght personal mr beaton now ahm goin to be personal too miss woodburn flung out over her lap the square of cloth she was embroidering and asked him dont you think thats beautiful now as an awtusta great awtust  as a great awtust yes said beaton mimicking her accent if i were less than great i might have something to say about the arrangement of colors youre as bold and original as nature  really oh now do tell me yo favoite colo mr beaton  my favorite color bless my soul why should i prefer any is blue good or red wicked do people have favorite colors beaton found himself suddenly interested  of cose they do answered the girl dont awtusts  i never heard of one that hadconsciously  is it possible i supposed they all had now mah favoite colo is gawnet dont you think its a pretty colo  it depends upon how its used do you mean in neckties beaton stole a glance at the one fulkerson was wearing  miss woodburn laughed with her face bowed upon her wrist ah do think you gentlemen in the noth awe ten tahms as lahvely as the ladies  strange said beaton in the southsoath excuse me i made the observation that the ladies were ten times as lively as the gentlemen what is that youre working  this miss woodburn gave it another flirt and looked at it with a glance of dawning recognition oh this is a tablecovah wouldnt you lahke to see where its to go  why certainly  well if youll be raght good ill let yo give me some professional advass about putting something in the coners or not when you have seen it on the table  she rose and led the way into the other room beaton knew she wanted to talk with him about something else but he waited patiently to let her play her comedy out she spread the cover on the table and he advised her as he saw she wished against putting anything in the corners just run a line of her stitch around the edge he said  mr fulkerson and ah why weve been having a regular faght aboat it she commented but we both agreed fahnally to leave it to you mr fulkerson said youd be sure to be raght ahm so glad you took mah sahde but hes a great admahrer of yours mr beaton she concluded demurely suggestively  is he well im a great admirer of fulkerson said beaton with a capricious willingness to humor her wish to talk about fulkerson hes a capital fellow generous magnanimous with quite an ideal of friendship and an eye single to the main chance all the time he would advertise every other week on his family vault  miss woodburn laughed and said she should tell him what beaton had said  do but hes used to defamation from me and hell think youre joking  ah suppose said miss woodburn that hes quahte the tahpe of a new york business man she added as if it followed logically hes so different from what i thought a new york business man would be  its your virginia tradition to despise business said beaton rudely  miss woodburn laughed again despahse it mah goodness we want to get into it and woak it fo all its woth as mr fulkerson says that tradition is all past you dont know what the soath is now ah suppose mah fathaw despahses business but hes a tradition himself as ah tell him beaton would have enjoyed joining the young lady in anything she might be going to say in derogation of her father but he restrained himself and she went on more and more as if she wished to account for her fathers habitual hauteur with beaton if not to excuse it ah tell him he dont understand the rising generation he was brought up in the old school and he thinks were all just lahke he was when he was young with all those ahdeals of chivalry and family but mah goodness its money that cyoants noadays in the soath just lahke it does everywhere else ah suppose if we could have slavery back in the fawm mah fathaw thinks it could have been brought up to when the commercial spirit wouldnt let it alone it would be the best thing but we cant have it back and ah tell him we had better have the commercial spirit as the next best thing  miss woodburn went on with sufficient loyalty and piety to expose the difference of her own and her fathers ideals but with what beaton thought less reference to his own unsympathetic attention than to a knowledge finally of the personnel and materiel of every other week and mr fulkersons relation to the enterprise you most excuse my asking so many questions mr beaton you know its all mah doing that we awe heah in new york ah just told mah fathaw that if he was evah goin to do anything with his wrahtings he had got to come noth and ah made him come ah believe hed have stayed in the soath all his lahfe and now mr fulkerson wants him to let his editor see some of his wrahtings and ah wanted to know something aboat the magazine we awe a great deal excited aboat it in this hoase you know mr beaton she concluded with a look that now transferred the interest from fulkerson to alma she led the way back to the room where they were sitting and went up to triumph over fulkerson with beatons decision about the tablecover  alma was left with beaton near the piano and he began to talk about the dryfooses as he sat down on the pianostool he said he had been giving miss dryfoos a lesson on the banjo he had borrowed the banjo of miss vance then he struck the chord he had been trying to teach christine and played over the air he had sung  how do you like that he asked whirling round  it seems rather a disrespectful little tune somehow said alma placidly  beaton rested his elbow on the corner of the piano and gazed dreamily at her your perceptions are wonderful it is disrespectful i played it up there because i felt disrespectful to them  do you claim that as a merit  no i state it as a fact how can you respect such people  you might respect yourself then said the girl or perhaps that wouldnt be so easy either  no it wouldnt i like to have you say these things to me said beaton impartially  well i like to say them alma returned  they do me good  oh i dont know that that was my motive  there is no one like youno one said beaton as if apostrophizing her in her absence to come from that house with its assertions of moneyyou can hear it chink you can smell the foul old banknotes it stifles youinto an atmosphere like this is like coming into another world  thank you said alma im glad there isnt that unpleasant odor here but i wish there was a little more of the chinking  no no dont say that he implored i like to think that there is one soul uncontaminated by the sense of money in this big brutal sordid city  you mean two said alma with modesty but if you stifle at the dryfooses why do you go there  why do i go he mused dont you believe in knowing all the natures the types you can those girls are a strange study the young one is a simple earthly creature as common as an oatfield and the other a sort of sylvan life fierce flashing feline  alma burst out into a laugh what apt alliteration and do they like being studied i should think the sylvan life mightscratch  no said beaton with melancholy absence it onlypurrs  the girl felt a rising indignation well then mr beaton i should hope it would scratch and bite too i think youve no business to go about studying people as you do its abominable  go on said the young man that puritan conscience of yours it appeals to the old covenanter strain in melike a voice of preexistence go on  oh if i went on i should merely say it was not only abominable but contemptible  you could be my guardian angel alma said the young man making his eyes more and more slumbrous and dreamy  stuff i hope i have a soul above buttons  he smiled as she rose and followed her across the room goodnight mr beaton she said  miss woodburn and fulkerson came in from the other room what youre not going beaton  yes im going to a reception i stopped in on my way  to kill time alma explained  well said fulkerson gallantly this is the last place i should like to do it but i guess id better be going too it has sometimes occurred to me that there is such a thing as staying too late but with brother beaton here just starting in for an evenings amusement it does seem a little early yet cant you urge me to stay somebody  the two girls laughed and miss woodburn said  mr beaton is such a butterfly of fashion ah wish ah was on mah way to a pawty ah feel quahte envious  but he didnt say it to make you alma explained with meek softness  well we cant all be swells where is your party anyway beaton asked fulkerson how do you manage to get your invitations to those things i suppose a fellow has to keep hinting round pretty lively neigh  beaton took these mockeries serenely and shook hands with miss woodburn with the effect of having already shaken hands with alma she stood with hers clasped behind her     v  beaton went away with the smile on his face which he had kept in listening to fulkerson and carried it with him to the reception he believed that alma was vexed with him for more personal reasons than she had implied it flattered him that she should have resented what he told her of the dryfooses she had scolded him in their behalf apparently but really because he had made her jealous by his interest of whatever kind in some one else what followed had followed naturally unless she had been quite a simpleton she could not have met his provisional lovemaking on any other terms and the reason why beaton chiefly liked alma leighton was that she was not a simpleton even up in the country when she was overawed by his acquaintance at first she was not very deeply overawed and at times she was not overawed at all at such times she astonished him by taking his most solemn histrionics with flippant incredulity and even burlesquing them but he could see all the same that he had caught her fancy and he admired the skill with which she punished his neglect when they met in new york he had really come very near forgetting the leightons the intangible obligations of mutual kindness which hold some men so fast hung loosely upon him it would not have hurt him to break from them altogether but when he recognized them at last he found that it strengthened them indefinitely to have alma ignore them so completely if she had been sentimental or softly reproachful that would have been the end he could not have stood it he would have had to drop her but when she met him on his own ground and obliged him to be sentimental the game was in her hands beaton laughed now when he thought of that and he said to himself that the girl had grown immensely since she had come to new york nothing seemed to have been lost upon her she must have kept her eyes uncommonly wide open he noticed that especially in their talks over her work she had profited by everything she had seen and heard she had all of wetmores ideas pat it amused beaton to see how she seized every useful word that he dropped too and turned him to technical account whenever she could he liked that she had a great deal of talent there was no question of that if she were a man there could be no question of her future he began to construct a future for her it included provision for himself too it was a common future in which their lives and work were united  he was full of the glow of its prosperity when he met margaret vance at the reception  the house was one where people might chat a long time together without publicly committing themselves to an interest in each other except such a grew out of each others ideas miss vance was there because she united in her catholic sympathies or ambitions the objects of the fashionable people and of the aesthetic people who met there on common ground it was almost the only house in new york where this happened often and it did not happen very often there it was a literary house primarily with artistic qualifications and the frequenters of it were mostly authors and artists wetmore who was always trying to fit everything with a phrase said it was the unfrequenters who were fashionable there was great ease there and simplicity and if there was not distinction it was not for want of distinguished people but because there seems to be some solvent in new york life that reduces all men to a common level that touches everybody with its potent magic and brings to the surface the deeply underlying nobody the effect for some temperaments for consciousness for egotism is admirable for curiosity for hero worship it is rather baffling it is the spirit of the street transferred to the drawingroom indiscriminating levelling but doubtless finally wholesome and witnessing the immensity of the place if not consenting to the grandeur of reputations or presences  beaton now denied that this house represented a salon at all in the old sense and he held that the salon was impossible even undesirable with us when miss vance sighed for it at any rate he said that this turmoil of coming and going this bubble and babble this cackling and hissing of conversation was not the expression of any such civilization as had created the salon here he owned were the elements of intellectual delightfulness but he said their assemblage in such quantity alone denied the salon there was too much of a good thing the french word implied a long evening of general talk among the guests crowned with a little chicken at supper ending at cockcrow here was tea with milk or with lemonbaths of it and claretcup for the hardier spirits throughout the evening it was very nice very pleasant but it was not the little chickennot the salon in fact he affirmed the salon descended from above out of the great world and included the aesthetic world in it but our great worldthe rich people were stupid with no wish to be otherwise they were not even curious about authors and artists beaton fancied himself speaking impartially and so he allowed himself to speak bitterly he said that in no other city in the world except vienna perhaps were such people so little a part of society  it isnt altogether the rich peoples fault said margaret and she spoke impartially too i dont believe that the literary men and the artists would like a salon that descended to them madame geoffrin you know was very plebeian her husband was a business man of some sort  he would have been a howling swell in new york said beaton still impartially  wetmore came up to their corner with a scroll of bread and butter in one hand and a cup of tea in the other large and fat and cleanshaven he looked like a monk in evening dress  we were talking about salons said margaret  why dont you open a salon yourself asked wetmore breathing thickly from the anxiety of getting through the crowd without spilling his tea  like poor lady barberina lemon said the girl with a laugh what a good story that idea of a woman who couldnt be interested in any of the arts because she was socially and traditionally the material of them we can never reach that height of nonchalance in this country  not if we tried seriously suggested the painter ive an idea that if the americans ever gave their minds to that sort of thing they could take the palmor the cake as beaton here would sayjust as they do in everything else when we do have an aristocracy it will be an aristocracy that will go ahead of anything the world has ever seen why dont somebody make a beginning and go in openly for an ancestry and a lower middle class and an hereditary legislature and all the rest weve got liveries and crests and palaces and caste feeling were all right as far as weve gone and weve got the money to go any length  like your naturalgas man mr beaton said the girl with a smiling glance round at him  ah said wetmore stirring his tea has beaton got a naturalgas man  my naturalgas man said beaton ignoring wetmores question doesnt know how to live in his palace yet and i doubt if he has any caste feeling i fancy his family believe themselves victims of it they sayone of the young ladies doesthat she never saw such an unsociable place as new york nobody calls  thats good said wetmore i suppose theyre all ready for company too good cook furniture servants carriages  galore said beaton  well thats too bad theres a chance for you miss vance doesnt your philanthropy embrace the socially destitute as well as the financially just think of a family like that without a friend in a great city i should think common charity had a duty therenot to mention the uncommon  he distinguished that kind as margarets by a glance of ironical deference she had a repute for good works which was out of proportion to the works as it always is but she was really active in that way under the vague obligation which we now all feel to be helpful she was of the church which seems to have found a reversion to the imposing ritual of the past the way back to the early ideals of christian brotherhood  oh they seem to have mr beaton margaret answered and beaton felt obscurely flattered by her reference to his patronage of the dryfooses  he explained to wetmore they have me because they partly own me dryfoos is fulkersons financial backer in every other week  is that so well thats interesting too arent you rather astonished miss vance to see what a petty thing beaton is making of that magazine of his  oh said margaret its so very nice every way it makes you feel as if you did have a country after all its as chicthat detestable little wordas those new french books  beaton modelled it on them but you mustnt suppose he does everything about every other week hed like you to beaton you havent come up to that cover of your first number since that was the design of one of my pupils miss vancea little girl that beaton discovered down in new hampshire last summer  oh yes and have you great hopes of her mr wetmore  she seems to have more love of it and knack for it than any one of her sex ive seen yet it really looks like a case of art for arts sake at times but you cant tell theyre liable to get married at any moment you know look here beaton when your naturalgas man gets to the picturebuying stage in his development just remember your old friends will you you know miss vance those new fellows have their regular stages they never know what to do with their money but they find out that people buy pictures at one point they shut your things up in their houses where nobody comes and after a while they overeat themselvesthey dont know what else to doand die of apoplexy and leave your pictures to a gallery and then they see the light its slow but its pretty sure well i see beaton isnt going to move on as he ought to do and so i must he always was an unconventional creature  wetmore went away but beaton remained and he outstayed several other people who came up to speak to miss vance she was interested in everybody and she liked the talk of these clever literary artistic clerical even theatrical people and she liked the sort of court with which they recognized her fashion as well as her cleverness it was very pleasant to be treated intellectually as if she were one of themselves and socially as if she was not habitually the same but a sort of guest in bohemia a distinguished stranger if it was arcadia rather than bohemia still she felt her quality of distinguished stranger the flattery of it touched her fancy and not her vanity she had very little vanity beatons devotion made the same sort of appeal it was not so much that she liked him as she liked being the object of his admiration she was a girl of genuine sympathies intellectual rather than sentimental in fact she was an intellectual person whom qualities of the heart saved from being disagreeable as they saved her on the other hand from being worldly or cruel in her fashionableness she had read a great many books and had ideas about them quite courageous and original ideas she knew about picturesshe had been in wetmores class she was fond of music she was willing to understand even politics in boston she might have been agnostic but in new york she was sincerely religious she was very accomplished and perhaps it was her goodness that prevented her feeling what was not best in beaton  do you think she said after the retreat of one of the comers and goers left her alone with him again that those young ladies would like me to call on them  those young ladies beaton echoed miss leighton and  no i have been there with my aunts cards already  oh yes said beaton as if he had known of it he admired the pluck and pride with which alma had refrained from ever mentioning the fact to him and had kept her mother from mentioning it which must have been difficult  i mean the miss dryfooses it seems really barbarous if nobody goes near them we do all kinds of things and help all kinds of people in some ways but we let strangers remain strangers unless they know how to make their way among us  the dryfooses certainly wouldnt know how to make their way among you said beaton with a sort of dreamy absence in his tone  miss vance went on speaking out the process of reasoning in her mind rather than any conclusions she had reached we defend ourselves by trying to believe that they must have friends of their own or that they would think us patronizing and wouldnt like being made the objects of social charity but they neednt really suppose anything of the kind  i dont imagine they would said beaton i think theyd be only too happy to have you come but you wouldnt know what to do with each other indeed miss vance  perhaps we shall like each other said the girl bravely and then we shall know what church are they of  i dont believe theyre of any said beaton the mother was brought up a dunkard  a dunkard  beaton told what he knew of the primitive sect with its early christian polity its literal interpretation of christs ethics and its quaint ceremonial of footwashing he made something picturesque of that the father is a mammonworshipper pure and simple i suppose the young ladies go to church but i dont know where they havent tried to convert me  ill tell them not to despairafter ive converted them said miss vance will you let me use you as a point dappui mr beaton  any way you like if youre really going to see them perhaps id better make a confession i left your banjo with them after i got it put in order  how very nice then we have a common interest already  do you mean the banjo or  the banjo decidedly which of them plays  neither but the eldest heard that the banjo was all the rage as the youngest says perhaps you can persuade them that good works are the rage too  beaton had no very lively belief that margaret would go to see the dryfooses he did so few of the things he proposed that he went upon the theory that others must be as faithless still he had a cruel amusement in figuring the possible encounter between margaret vance with her intellectual elegance her eager sympathies and generous ideals and those girls with their rude past their false and distorted perspective their sordid and hungry selfishness and their faith in the omnipotence of their fathers wealth wounded by their experience of its present social impotence at the bottom of his heart he sympathized with them rather than with her he was more like them  people had ceased coming and some of them were going miss vance said she must go too and she was about to rise when the host came up with march beaton turned away  miss vance i want to introduce mr march the editor of every other week you oughtnt to be restricted to the art department we literary fellows think that arm of the service gets too much of the glory nowadays his banter was for beaton but he was already beyond earshot and the host went on  mr march can talk with you about your favorite boston hes just turned his back on it  oh i hope not said miss vance i cant imagine anybody voluntarily leaving boston  i dont say hes so bad as that said the host committing march to her he came to new york because he couldnt help itlike the rest of us i never know whether thats a compliment to new york or not  they talked boston a little while without finding that they had common acquaintance there miss vance must have concluded that society was much larger in boston than she had supposed from her visits there or else that march did not know many people in it but she was not a girl to care much for the inferences that might be drawn from such conclusions she rather prided herself upon despising them and she gave herself to the pleasure of being talked to as if she were of marchs own age in the glow of her sympathetic beauty and elegance he talked his best and tried to amuse her with his jokes which he had the art of tingeing with a little seriousness on one side he made her laugh and he flattered her by making her think in her turn she charmed him so much by enjoying what he said that he began to brag of his wife as a good husband always does when another woman charms him and she asked oh was mrs march there and would he introduce her  she asked mrs march for her address and whether she had a day and she said she would come to see her if she would let her mrs march could not be so enthusiastic about her as march was but as they walked home together they talked the girl over and agreed about her beauty and her amiability mrs march said she seemed very unspoiled for a person who must have been so much spoiled they tried to analyze her charm and they succeeded in formulating it as a combination of intellectual fashionableness and worldly innocence i think said mrs march that city girls brought up as she must have been are often the most innocent of all they never imagine the wickedness of the world and if they marry happily they go through life as innocent as children everything combines to keep them so the very hollowness of society shields them they are the loveliest of the human race but perhaps the rest have to pay too much for them  for such an exquisite creature as miss vance said march we couldnt pay too much  a wild laughing cry suddenly broke upon the air at the streetcrossing in front of them a girls voice called out run run jen the copper is after you a womans figure rushed stumbling across the way and into the shadow of the houses pursued by a burly policeman  ah but if thats part of the price  they went along fallen from the gay spirit of their talk into a silence which he broke with a sigh can that poor wretch and the radiant girl we left yonder really belong to the same system of things how impossible each makes the other seem     vi  mrs horn believed in the world and in society and its unwritten constitution devoutly and she tolerated her nieces benevolent activities as she tolerated her aesthetic sympathies because these things however oddly were toleratedeven encouragedby society and they gave margaret a charm they made her originality interesting mrs horn did not intend that they should ever go so far as to make her troublesome and it was with a sense of this abeyant authority of her aunts that the girl asked her approval of her proposed call upon the dryfooses she explained as well as she could the social destitution of these opulent people and she had of course to name beaton as the source of her knowledge concerning them  did mr beaton suggest your calling on them  no he rather discouraged it  and why do you think you ought to go in this particular instance new york is full of people who dont know anybody  margaret laughed i suppose its like any other charity you reach the cases you know of the others you say you cant help and you try to ignore them  its very romantic said mrs horn i hope youve counted the cost all the possible consequences  margaret knew that her aunt had in mind their common experience with the leightons whom to give their common conscience peace she had called upon with her aunts cards and excuses and an invitation for her thursdays somewhat too late to make the visit seem a welcome to new york she was so coldly received not so much for herself as in her quality of envoy that her aunt experienced all the comfort which vicarious penance brings she did not perhaps consider sufficiently her nieces guiltlessness in the expiation margaret was not with her at st barnaby in the fatal fortnight she passed there and never saw the leightons till she went to call upon them she never complained the strain of asceticism which mysteriously exists in us all and makes us put peas boiled or unboiled in our shoes gave her patience with the snub which the leightons presented her for her aunt but now she said with this in mind nothing seems simpler than to get rid of people if you dont want them you merely have to let them alone  it isnt so pleasant letting them alone said mrs horn  or having them let you alone said margaret for neither mrs leighton nor alma had ever come to enjoy the belated hospitality of mrs horns thursdays  yes or having them let you alone mrs horn courageously consented and all that i ask you margaret is to be sure that you really want to know these people  i dont said the girl seriously in the usual way  then the question is whether you do in the un usual way they will build a great deal upon you said mrs horn realizing how much the leightons must have built upon her and how much out of proportion to her desert they must now dislike her for she seemed to have had them on her mind from the time they came and had always meant to recognize any reasonable claim they had upon her  it seems very odd very sad margaret returned that you never could act unselfishly in society affairs if i wished to go and see those girls just to do them a pleasure and perhaps because if theyre strange and lonely i might do them good evenit would be impossible  quite said her aunt such a thing would be quixotic society doesnt rest upon any such basis it cant it would go to pieces if people acted from unselfish motives  then its a painted savage said the girl all its favors are really bargains its gifts are for gifts back again  yes that is true said mrs horn with no more sense of wrong in the fact than the political economist has in the fact that wages are the measure of necessity and not of merit you get what you pay for its a matter of business she satisfied herself with this formula which she did not invent as fully as if it were a reason but she did not dislike her nieces revolt against it that was part of margarets originality which pleased her aunt in proportion to her own conventionality she was really a timid person and she liked the show of courage which margarets magnanimity often reflected upon her she had through her a repute with people who did not know her well for intellectual and moral qualities she was supposed to be literary and charitable she almost had opinions and ideals but really fell short of their possession she thought that she set bounds to the girls originality because she recognized them margaret understood this better than her aunt and knew that she had consulted her about going to see the dryfooses out of deference and with no expectation of luminous instruction she was used to being a law to herself but she knew what she might and might not do so that she was rather a bylaw she was the kind of girl that might have fancies for artists and poets but might end by marrying a prosperous broker and leavening a vast lump of moneyed and fashionable life with her culture generosity and goodwill the intellectual interests were first with her but she might be equal to sacrificing them she had the best heart but she might know how to harden it if she was eccentric her social orbit was defined comets themselves traverse space on fixed lines she was like every one else a congeries of contradictions and inconsistencies but obedient to the general expectation of what a girl of her position must and must not finally be provisionally she was very much what she liked to be     vii  margaret vance tried to give herself some reason for going to call upon the dryfooses but she could find none better than the wish to do a kind thing this seemed queerer and less and less sufficient as she examined it and she even admitted a little curiosity as a harmless element in her motive without being very well satisfied with it she tried to add a slight sense of social duty and then she decided to have no motive at all but simply to pay her visit as she would to any other eligible strangers she saw fit to call upon she perceived that she must be very careful not to let them see that any other impulse had governed her she determined if possible to let them patronize her to be very modest and sincere and diffident and above all not to play a part this was easy compared with the choice of a manner that should convey to them the fact that she was not playing a part when the hesitating irish servingman had acknowledged that the ladies were at home and had taken her card to them she sat waiting for them in the drawingroom her study of its appointments with their impersonal costliness gave her no suggestion how to proceed the two sisters were upon her before she had really decided and she rose to meet them with the conviction that she was going to play a part for want of some chosen means of not doing so she found herself before she knew it making her banjo a property in the little comedy and professing so much pleasure in the fact that miss dryfoos was taking it up she had herself been so much interested by it anything she said was a relief from the piano and then between the guitar and the banjo one must really choose the banjo unless one wanted to devote ones whole natural life to the violin of course there was the mandolin but margaret asked if they did not feel that the bit of shell you struck it with interposed a distance between you and the real soul of the instrument and then it did have such a faint mosquitoy little tone she made much of the question which they left her to debate alone while they gazed solemnly at her till she characterized the tone of the mandolin when mela broke into a large coarse laugh  well thats just what it does sound like she explained defiantly to her sister i always feel like it was going to settle somewhere and i want to hit myself a slap before it begins to bite i dont see what ever brought such a thing into fashion  margaret had not expected to be so powerfully seconded and she asked after gathering herself together and you are both learning the banjo my no said mela ive gone through enough with the piano christine is learnun it  im so glad you are making my banjo useful at the outset miss dryfoos both girls stared at her but found it hard to cope with the fact that this was the lady friend whose banjo beaton had lent them mr beaton mentioned that he had left it here i hope youll keep it as long as you find it useful  at this amiable speech even christine could not help thanking her of course she said i expect to get another right off mr beaton is going to choose it for me  you are very fortunate if you havent a teacher yet i should so like to recommend mine  mela broke out in her laugh again oh i guess christines pretty well suited with the one shes got she said with insinuation her sister gave her a frowning glance and margaret did not tempt her to explain  then thats much better she said i have a kind of superstition in such matters i dont like to make a second choice in a shop i like to take the first thing of the kind im looking for and even if i choose further i come back to the original  how funny said mela well now im just the other way i always take the last thing after ive picked over all the rest my luck always seems to be at the bottom of the heap now christine shes more like you i believe she could walk right up blindfolded and put her hand on the thing she wants every time  im like father said christine softened a little by the celebration of her peculiarity he says the reason so many people dont get what they want is that they dont want it bad enough now when i want a thing it seems to me that i want it all through  well thats just like father too said mela thats the way he done when he got that eightyacre piece next to moffitt that he kept when he sold the farm and thats got some of the best gaswells on it now that there is anywhere she addressed the explanation to her sister to the exclusion of margaret who nevertheless listened with a smiling face and a resolutely polite air of being a party to the conversation mela rewarded her amiability by saying to her finally youve never been in the naturalgas country have you  oh no and i should so much like to see it said margaret with a fervor that was partly voluntary  would you well were kind of sick of it but i suppose it would strike a stranger  i never got tired of looking at the big wells when they lit them up said christine it seems as if the world was on fire  yes and when you see the surfacegas burnun down in the woods like it used to by our springhouseso still and never spreadun any just like a bed of some kind of wild flowers when you ketch sight of it a piece off  they began to tell of the wonders of their strange land in an antiphony of reminiscences and descriptions they unconsciously imputed a merit to themselves from the number and violence of the wells on their fathers property they bragged of the high civilization of moffitt which they compared to its advantage with that of new york they became excited by margarets interest in natural gas and forgot to be suspicious and envious  she said as she rose oh how much i should like to see it all then she made a little pause and added  im so sorry my aunts thursdays are over she never has them after lent but were to have some people tuesday evening at a little concert which a musical friend is going to give with some other artists there wont be any banjos im afraid but therell be some very good singing and my aunt would be so glad if you could come with your mother  she put down her aunts card on the table near her while mela gurgled as if it were the best joke oh my mother never goes anywhere you couldnt get her out for love or money but she was herself overwhelmed with a simple joy at margarets politeness and showed it in a sensuous way like a child as if she had been tickled she came closer to margaret and seemed about to fawn physically upon her  aint she just as lovely as she can live she demanded of her sister when margaret was gone  i dont know said christine i guess she wanted to know who mr beaton had been lending her banjo to  pshaw do you suppose shes in love with him asked mela and then she broke into her hoarse laugh at the look her sister gave her well dont eat me christine i wonder who she is anyway im goun to git it out of mr beaton the next time he calls i guess shes somebody mrs mandel can tell i wish that old friend of hers would hurry up and git wellor something but i guess we appeared about as well as she did i could see she was afraid of you christine i reckon its gittun around a little about father and when it does i dont believe we shall want for callers say are you goun to that concert of theirs  i dont know not till i know who they are first  well weve got to hump ourselves if were goun to find out before tuesday  as she went home margaret felt wrought in her that most incredible of the miracles which nevertheless any one may make his experience she felt kindly to these girls because she had tried to make them happy and she hoped that in the interest she had shown there had been none of the poison of flattery she was aware that this was a risk she ran in such an attempt to do good if she had escaped this effect she was willing to leave the rest with providence     viii  the notion that a girl of margaret vances traditions would naturally form of girls like christine and mela dryfoos would be that they were abashed in the presence of the new conditions of their lives and that they must receive the advance she had made them with a certain grateful humility however they received it she had made it upon principle from a romantic conception of duty but this was the way she imagined they would receive it because she thought that she would have done so if she had been as ignorant and unbred as they her error was in arguing their attitude from her own temperament and endowing them for the purposes of argument with her perspective they had not the means intellectual or moral of feeling as she fancied if they had remained at home on the farm where they were born christine would have grown up that embodiment of impassioned suspicion which we find oftenest in the narrowest spheres and mela would always have been a goodnatured simpleton but they would never have doubted their equality with the wisest and the finest as it was they had not learned enough at school to doubt it and the splendor of their fathers success in making money had blinded them forever to any possible difference against them they had no question of themselves in the social abeyance to which they had been left in new york they had been surprised mystified it was not what they had expected there must be some mistake  they were the victims of an accident which would be repaired as soon as the fact of their fathers wealth had got around they had been steadfast in their faith through all their disappointment that they were not only better than most people by virtue of his money but as good as any and they took margarets visit so far as they investigated its motive for a sign that at last it was beginning to get around of course a thing could not get around in new york so quick as it could in a small place they were confirmed in their belief by the sensation of mrs mandel when she returned to duty that afternoon and they consulted her about going to mrs horns musicale if she had felt any doubt at the name for there were horns and hornsthe address on the card put the matter beyond question and she tried to make her charges understand what a precious chance had befallen them she did not succeed they had not the premises the experience for a sufficient impression and she undid her work in part by the effort to explain that mrs horns standing was independent of money that though she was positively rich she was comparatively poor christine inferred that miss vance had called because she wished to be the first to get in with them since it had begun to get around this view commended itself to mela too but without warping her from her opinion that miss vance was all the same too sweet for anything she had not so vivid a consciousness of her fathers money as christine had but she reposed perhaps all the more confidently upon its power she was far from thinking meanly of any one who thought highly of her for it that seemed so natural a result as to be amiable even admirable she was willing that any such person should get all the good there was in such an attitude toward her  they discussed the matter that night at dinner before their father and mother who mostly sat silent at their meals the father frowning absently over his plate with his head close to it and making play into his mouth with the back of his knife he had got so far toward the use of his fork as to despise those who still ate from the edge of their knives and the mother partly missing hers at times in the nervous tremor that shook her face from side to side  after a while the subject of melas hoarse babble and of christines highpitched thin sharp forays of assertion and denial in the field which her sisters voice seemed to cover made its way into the old mans consciousness and he perceived that they were talking with mrs mandel about it and that his wife was from time to time offering an irrelevant and mistaken comment he agreed with christine and silently took her view of the affair some time before he made any sign of having listened there had been a time in his life when other things besides his money seemed admirable to him he had once respected himself for the hardheaded practical common sense which first gave him standing among his country neighbors which made him supervisor school trustee justice of the peace county commissioner secretary of the moffitt county agricultural society in those days he had served the public with disinterested zeal and proud ability he used to write to the lake shore farmer on agricultural topics he took part in opposing through the moffitt papers the legislative waste of the peoples money on the question of selling a local canal to the railroad company which killed that fine old state work and let the dry ditch grow up to grass he might have gone to the legislature but he contented himself with defeating the moffitt member who had voted for the job if he opposed some measures for the general good like high schools and school libraries it was because he lacked perspective in his intense individualism and suspected all expense of being spendthrift he believed in good district schools and he had a fondness crude but genuine for some kinds of readinghistory and forensics of an elementary sort  with his good head for figures he doubted doctors and despised preachers he thought lawyers were all rascals but he respected them for their ability he was not himself litigious but he enjoyed the intellectual encounters of a difficult lawsuit and he often attended a sitting of the fall term of court when he went to town for the pleasure of hearing the speeches he was a good citizen and a good husband as a good father he was rather severe with his children and used to whip them especially the gentle conrad who somehow crossed him most till the twins died after that he never struck any of them and from the sight of a blow dealt a horse he turned as if sick it was a long time before he lifted himself up from his sorrow and then the will of the man seemed to have been breached through his affections he let the girls do as they pleasedthe twins had been girls he let them go away to school and got them a piano it was they who made him sell the farm if conrad had only had their spirit he could have made him keep it he felt and he resented the want of support he might have found in a less yielding spirit than his sons  his moral decay began with his perception of the opportunity of making money quickly and abundantly which offered itself to him after he sold his farm he awoke to it slowly from a desolation in which he tasted the last bitter of homesickness the utter misery of idleness and listlessness when he broke down and cried for the hardworking wholesome life he had lost he was near the end of this season of despair but he was also near the end of what was best in himself he devolved upon a meaner ideal than that of conservative good citizenship which had been his chief moral experience the money he had already made without effort and without merit bred its unholy selflove in him he began to honor money especially money that had been won suddenly and in large sums for money that had been earned painfully slowly and in little amounts he had only pity and contempt the poison of that ambition to go somewhere and be somebody which the local speculators had instilled into him began to work in the vanity which had succeeded his somewhat scornful selfrespect he rejected europe as the proper field for his expansion he rejected washington he preferred new york whither the men who have made money and do not yet know that money has made them all instinctively turn he came where he could watch his money breed more money and bring greater increase of its kind in an hour of luck than the toil of hundreds of men could earn in a year he called it speculation stocks the street and his pride his faith in himself mounted with his luck he expected when he had sated his greed to begin to spend and he had formulated an intention to build a great house to add another to the palaces of the countrybred millionaires who have come to adorn the great city in the mean time he made little account of the things that occupied his children except to fret at the ungrateful indifference of his son to the interests that could alone make a man of him he did not know whether his daughters were in society or not with people coming and going in the house he would have supposed they must be so no matter who the people were in some vague way he felt that he had hired society in mrs mandel at so much a year he never met a superior himself except now and then a man of twenty or thirty millions to his one or two and then he felt his soul creep within him without a sense of social inferiority it was a question of financial inferiority and though dryfooss soul bowed itself and crawled it was with a gamblers admiration of wonderful luck other men said these manymillioned millionaires were smart and got their money by sharp practices to which lesser men could not attain but dryfoos believed that he could compass the same ends by the same means with the same chances he respected their money not them  when he now heard mrs mandel and his daughters talking of that person whoever she was that mrs mandel seemed to think had honored his girls by coming to see them his curiosity was pricked as much as his pride was galled  well anyway said mela i dont care whether christines goon or not i am and you got to go with me mrs mandel  well theres a little difficulty said mrs mandel with her unfailing dignity and politeness i havent been asked you know  then what are we goun to do demanded mela almost crossly she was physically too amiable she felt too well corporeally ever to be quite cross she might a knowedwell knownwe couldnt a come alone in new york i dont see why we couldnt i dont call it much of an invitation  i suppose she thought you could come with your mother mrs mandel suggested  she didnt say anything about mother did she christine or yes she did too and i told her she couldnt git mother out dont you remember  i didnt pay much attention said christine i wasnt certain we wanted to go  i reckon you wasnt goun to let her see that we cared much said mela half reproachful half proud of this attitude of christine well i dont see but what we got to stay at home she laughed at this lame conclusion of the matter  perhaps mr conradyou could very properly take him without an express invitation mrs mandel began  conrad looked up in alarm and protest ii dont think i could go that evening  whats the reason his father broke in harshly youre not such a sheep that youre afraid to go into company with your sisters or are you too good to go with them  if its to be anything like that night when them hussies come out and danced that way said mrs dryfoos i dont blame coonrod for not wantun to go i never saw the beat of it  mela sent a yelling laugh across the table to her mother well i wish miss vance could a heard that why mother did you think it like the ballet  well i didnt know mely child said the old woman i didnt know what it was like i haint never been to one and you cant be too keerful where you go in a place like new york  whats the reason you cant go dryfoos ignored the passage between his wife and daughter in making this demand of his son with a sour face  i have an engagement that nightits one of our meetings  i reckon you can let your meeting go for one night said dryfoos it cant be so important as all that that you must disappoint your sisters  i dont like to disappoint those poor creatures they depend so much upon the meetings  i reckon they can stand it for one night said the old man he added the poor ye have with you always  thats so coonrod said his mother its the saviours own words  yes mother but theyre not meant just as father used them  how do you know how they were meant or how i used them cried the father now you just make your plans to go with the girls tuesday night they cant go alone and mrs mandel cant go with them  pshaw said mela we dont want to take conrad away from his meetun do we chris  i dont know said christine in her high fine voice they could get along without him for one night as father says  well im not agoun to take him said mela now mrs mandel just think out some other way say whats the reason we couldnt get somebody else to take us just as well aint that rulable  it would be allowable  allowable i mean mela corrected herself  but it might look a little significant unless it was some old family friend  well lets get mr fulkerson to take us hes the oldest family friend we got  i wont go with mr fulkerson said christine serenely  why im sure christine her mother pleaded mr fulkerson is a very good young man and very nice appearun  mela shouted hes ten times as pleasant as that old mr beaton of christines  christine made no effort to break the constraint that fell upon the table at this sally but her father said christine is right mela it wouldnt do for you to go with any other young man conrad will go with you  im not certain i want to go yet said christine  well settle that among yourselves but if you want to go your brother will go with you  of course coonrod ll go if his sisters wants him to the old woman pleaded i reckon it aint agoun to be anything very bad and if it is coonrod why you can just git right up and come out  it will be all right mother and i will go of course  there now i knowed you would coonrod now fawther this appeal was to make the old man say something in recognition of conrads sacrifice  youll always find he said that its those of your own household that have the first claim on you  thats so coonrod urged his mother its bible truth your fawther aint a perfesser but he always did read his bible search the scriptures thats what it means  laws cried mely a body can see easy enough from mother where conrads wantun to be a preacher comes from i should a thought shed a wanted to been one herself  let your women keep silence in the churches said the old woman solemnly  there you go again mother i guess if you was to say that to some of the lady ministers nowadays youd git yourself into trouble mela looked round for approval and gurgled out a hoarse laugh     ix  the dryfooses went late to mrs horns musicale in spite of mrs mandels advice christine made the delay both because she wished to show miss vance that she was not anxious and because she had some vague notion of the distinction of arriving late at any sort of entertainment mrs mandel insisted upon the difference between this musicale and an ordinary reception but christine rather fancied disturbing a company that had got seated and perhaps making people rise and stand while she found her way to her place as she had seen them do for a tardy comer at the theatre  mela whom she did not admit to her reasons or feelings always followed her with the servile admiration she had for all that christine did and she took on trust as somehow successful the result of christines obstinacy when they were allowed to stand against the wall at the back of the room through the whole of the long piece begun just before they came in there had been no one to receive them a few people in the rear rows of chairs near them turned their heads to glance at them and then looked away again mela had her misgivings but at the end of the piece miss vance came up to them at once and then mela knew that she had her eyes on them all the time and that christine must have been right christine said nothing about their coming late and so mela did not make any excuse and miss vance seemed to expect none she glanced with a sort of surprise at conrad when christine introduced him mela did not know whether she liked their bringing him till she shook hands with him and said oh i am very glad indeed mr dryfoos and i have met before without explaining where or when she led them to her aunt and presented them and then said im going to put you with some friends of yours and quickly seated them next the marches mela liked that well enough she thought she might have some joking with mr march for all his wife was so stiff but the look which christine wore seemed to forbid provisionally at least any such recreation on her part christine was cool with the marches it went through her mind that they must have told miss vance they knew her and perhaps they had boasted of her intimacy she relaxed a little toward them when she saw beaton leaning against the wall at the end of the row next mrs march then she conjectured that he might have told miss vance of her acquaintance with the marches and she bent forward and nodded to mrs march across conrad mela and mr march she conceived of him as a sort of hand of her fathers but she was willing to take them at their apparent social valuation for the time she leaned back in her chair and did not look up at beaton after the first furtive glance though she felt his eyes on her  the music began again almost at once before mela had time to make conrad tell her where miss vance had met him before she would not have minded interrupting the music but every one else seemed so attentive even christine that she had not the courage the concert went onto an end without realizing for her the ideal of pleasure which one ought to find in society she was not exacting but it seemed to her there were very few young men and when the music was over and their opportunity came to be sociable they were not very sociable they were not introduced for one thing but it appeared to mela that they might have got introduced if they had any sense she saw them looking at her and she was glad she had dressed so much she was dressed more than any other lady there and either because she was the most dressed of any person there or because it had got around who her father was she felt that she had made an impression on the young men in her satisfaction with this and from her good nature she was contented to be served with her refreshments after the concert by mr march and to remain joking with him she was at her ease she let her hoarse voice out in her largest laugh she accused him to the admiration of those near of getting her into a perfect gale it appeared to her in her own pleasure her mission to illustrate to the rather subdued people about her what a good time really was so that they could have it if they wanted it her joy was crowned when march modestly professed himself unworthy to monopolize her and explained how selfish he felt in talking to a young lady when there were so many young men dying to do so  oh pshaw dyun yes cried mela tasting the irony i guess i see them  he asked if he might really introduce a friend of his to her and she said well yes if he thought he could live to get to her and march brought up a man whom he thought very young and mela thought very old he was a contributor to every other week and so march knew him he believed himself a student of human nature in behalf of literature and he now set about studying mela he tempted her to express her opinion on all points and he laughed so amiably at the boldness and humorous vigor of her ideas that she was delighted with him she asked him if he was a newyorker by birth and she told him she pitied him when he said he had never been west she professed herself perfectly sick of new york and urged him to go to moffitt if he wanted to see a real live town he wondered if it would do to put her into literature just as she was with all her slang and brag but he decided that he would have to subdue her a great deal he did not see how he could reconcile the facts of her conversation with the facts of her appearance her beauty her splendor of dress her apparent right to be where she was these things perplexed him he was afraid the great american novel if true must be incredible mela said he ought to hear her sister go on about new york when they first came but she reckoned that christine was getting so she could put up with it a little better now she looked significantly across the room to the place where christine was now talking with beaton and the student of human nature asked was she here and would she introduce him mela said she would the first chance she got and she added they would be much pleased to have him call she felt herself to be having a beautiful time and she got directly upon such intimate terms with the student of human nature that she laughed with him about some peculiarities of his such as his going so far about to ask things he wanted to know from her she said she never did believe in beating about the bush much she had noticed the same thing in miss vance when she came to call that day and when the young man owned that he came rather a good deal to mrs horns house she asked him well what sort of a girl was miss vance anyway and where did he suppose she had met her brother the student of human nature could not say as to this and as to miss vance he judged it safest to treat of the nonsociety side of her character her activity in charity her special devotion to the work among the poor on the east side which she personally engaged in  oh thats where conrad goes too mela interrupted ill bet anything thats where she met him i wisht i could tell christine but i suppose she would want to kill me if i was to speak to her now  the student of human nature said politely oh shall i take you to her  mela answered i guess you better not with a laugh so significant that he could not help his inferences concerning both christines absorption in the person she was talking with and the habitual violence of her temper he made note of how mela helplessly spoke of all her family by their names as if he were already intimate with them he fancied that if he could get that in skillfully it would be a valuable color in his study the english lord whom she should astonish with it began to form himself out of the dramatic nebulosity in his mind and to whirl on a definite orbit in american society but he was puzzled to decide whether melas willingness to take him into her confidence on short notice was typical or personal the trait of a daughter of the naturalgas millionaire or a foible of her own  beaton talked with christine the greater part of the evening that was left after the concert he was very grave and took the tone of a fatherly friend he spoke guardedly of the people present and moderated the severity of some of christines judgments of their looks and costumes he did this out of a sort of unreasoned allegiance to margaret whom he was in the mood of wishing to please by being very kind and good as she always was he had the sense also of atoning by this behavior for some reckless things he had said before that to christine he put on a sad reproving air with her and gave her the feeling of being held in check  she chafed at it and said glancing at margaret in talk with her brother i dont think miss vance is so very pretty do you  i never think whether shes pretty or not said becton with dreamy affectation she is merely perfect does she know your brother  so she says i didnt suppose conrad ever went anywhere except to tenementhouses  it might have been there becton suggested she goes among friendless people everywhere  maybe thats the reason she came to see us said christine  becton looked at her with his smouldering eyes and felt the wish to say yes it was exactly that but he only allowed himself to deny the possibility of any such motive in that case he added i am so glad you know her miss dryfoos i never met miss vance without feeling myself better and truer somehow or the wish to be so  and you think we might be improved too christine retorted well i must say youre not very flattering mr becton anyway  becton would have liked to answer her according to her cattishness with a good clawing sarcasm that would leave its smart in her pride but he was being good and he could not change all at once besides the girls attitude under the social honor done her interested him he was sure she had never been in such good company before but he could see that she was not in the least affected by the experience he had told her who this person and that was and he saw she had understood that the names were of consequence but she seemed to feel her equality with them all her serenity was not obviously akin to the savage stoicism in which beaton hid his own consciousness of social inferiority but having won his way in the world so far by his talent his personal quality he did not conceive the simple fact in her case christine was selfpossessed because she felt that a knowledge of her fathers fortune had got around and she had the peace which money gives to ignorance but beaton attributed her poise to indifference to social values this while he inwardly sneered at it avenged him upon his own too keen sense of them and together with his temporary allegiance to margarets goodness kept him from retaliating christines vulgarity he said i dont see how that could be and left the question of flattery to settle itself  the people began to go away following each other up to take leave of mrs horn christine watched them with unconcern and either because she would not be governed by the general movement or because she liked being with beaton gave no sign of going mela was still talking to the student of human nature sending out her laugh in deep gurgles amid the unimaginable confidences she was making him about herself her family the staff of every other week mrs mandel and the kind of life they had all led before she came to them he was not a blind devotee of art for arts sake and though he felt that if one could portray mela just as she was she would be the richest possible material he was rather ashamed to know some of the things she told him and he kept looking anxiously about for a chance of escape the company had reduced itself to the dryfoos groups and some friends of mrs horns who had the right to linger when margaret crossed the room with conrad to christine and beaton  im so glad miss dryfoos to find that i was not quite a stranger to you all when i ventured to call the other day your brother and i are rather old acquaintances though i never knew who he was before i dont know just how to say we met where he is valued so much i suppose i mustnt try to say how much she added with a look of deep regard at him  conrad blushed and stood folding his arms tight over his breast while his sister received margarets confession with the suspicion which was her first feeling in regard to any new thing what she concluded was that this girl was trying to get in with them for reasons of her own she said yes its the first i ever heard of his knowing you hes so much taken up with his meetings he didnt want to come tonight  margaret drew in her lip before she answered without apparent resentment of the awkwardness or ungraciousness whichever she found it i dont wonder you become so absorbed in such work that you think nothing else is worth while but im glad mr dryfoos could come with you im so glad you could all come i knew you would enjoy the music do sit down  no said christine bluntly we must be going mela she called out come  the last group about mrs horn looked round but christine advanced upon them undismayed and took the hand mrs horn promptly gave her well i must bid you goodnight  oh goodnight murmured the elder lady so very kind of you to come  ive had the best kind of a time said mela cordially i haint laughed so much i dont know when  oh im glad you enjoyed it said mrs horn in the same polite murmur she had used with christine but she said nothing to either sister about any future meeting  they were apparently not troubled mela said over her shoulder to the student of human nature the next time i see you ill give it to you for what you said about moffitt  margaret made some entreating paces after them but she did not succeed in covering the retreat of the sisters against critical conjecture she could only say to conrad as if recurring to the subject i hope we can get our friends to play for us some night i know it isnt any real help but such things take the poor creatures out of themselves for the time being dont you think  oh yes he answered theyre good in that way he turned back hesitatingly to mrs horn and said with a blush i thank you for a happy evening  oh i am very glad she replied in her murmur  one of the old friends of the house arched her eyebrows in saying goodnight and offered the two young men remaining seats home in her carriage beaton gloomily refused and she kept herself from asking the student of human nature till she had got him into her carriage what is moffitt and what did you say about it  now you see margaret said mrs horn with bated triumph when the people were all gone  yes i see the girl consented from one point of view of course its been a failure i dont think weve given miss dryfoos a pleasure but perhaps nobody could and at least weve given her the opportunity of enjoying herself  such people said mrs horn philosophically people with their money must of course be received sooner or later you cant keep them out only i believe i would rather let some one else begin with them the leightons didnt come  i sent them cards i couldnt call again  mrs horn sighed a little i suppose mr dryfoos is one of your fellowphilanthropists  hes one of the workers said margaret i met him several times at the hall but i only knew his first name i think hes a great friend of father benedict he seems devoted to the work dont you think he looks good  very said mrs horn with a color of censure in her assent the younger girl seemed more amiable than her sister but what manners  dreadful said margaret with knit brows and a pursed mouth of humorous suffering but she appeared to feel very much at home  oh as to that neither of them was much abashed do you suppose mr beaton gave the other one some hints for that quaint dress of hers i dont imagine that black and lace is her own invention she seems to have some sort of strange fascination for him  shes very picturesque margaret explained and artists see points in people that the rest of us dont  could it be her money mrs horn insinuated he must be very poor  but he isnt base retorted the girl with a generous indignation that made her aunt smile  oh no but if he fancies her so picturesque it doesnt follow that he would object to her being rich  it would with a man like mr beaton  you are an idealist margaret i suppose your mr march has some disinterested motive in paying court to miss melapamela i suppose is her name he talked to her longer than her literature would have lasted  he seems a very kind person said margaret  and mr dryfoos pays his salary  i dont know anything about that but that wouldnt make any difference with him  mrs horn laughed out at this security but she was not displeased by the nobleness which it came from she liked margaret to be highminded and was really not distressed by any good that was in her  the marches walked home both because it was not far and because they must spare in carriage hire at any rate as soon as they were out of the house she applied a point of conscience to him  i dont see how you could talk to that girl so long basil and make her laugh so  why there seemed no one else to do it till i thought of kendricks  yes but i kept thinking now hes pleasant to her because he thinks its to his interest if she had no relation to every other week he wouldnt waste his time on her  isabel march complained i wish you wouldnt think of me in he him and his i never personalize you in my thoughts you remain always a vague unindividualized essence not quite without form and void but nounless and pronounless i call that a much more beautiful mental attitude toward the object of ones affections but if you must he and him and his me in your thoughts i wish youd have more kindly thoughts of me  do you deny that its true basil  do you believe that its true isabel  no matter but could you excuse it if it were  ah i see youd have been capable of it in my place and youre ashamed  yes sighed the wife im afraid that i should but tell me that you wouldnt basil  i can tell you that i wasnt but i suppose that in a real exigency i could truckle to the proprietary dryfooses as well as you  oh no you mustnt dear im a woman and im dreadfully afraid but you must always be a man especially with that horrid old mr dryfoos promise me that youll never yield the least point to him in a matter of right and wrong  not if hes right and im wrong  dont trifle dear you know what i mean will you promise  ill promise to submit the point to you and let you do the yielding as for me i shall be adamant nothing i like better  theyre dreadful even that poor good young fellow whos so different from all the rest hes awful too because you feel that hes a martyr to them  and i never did like martyrs a great deal march interposed  i wonder how they came to be there mrs march pursued unmindful of his joke  that is exactly what seemed to be puzzling miss mela about us she asked and i explained as well as i could and then she told me that miss vance had come to call on them and invited them and first they didnt know how they could come till they thought of making conrad bring them but she didnt say why miss vance called on them mr dryfoos doesnt employ her on every other week but i suppose she has her own vile little motive  it cant be their money it cant be sighed mrs march  well i dont know we all respect money  yes but miss vances position is so secure she neednt pay court to those stupid vulgar people  well lets console ourselves with the belief that she would if she needed such people as the dryfooses are the raw material of good society it isnt made up of refined or meritorious peopleprofessors and litterateurs ministers and musicians and their families all the fashionable people there tonight were like the dryfooses a generation or two ago i dare say the material works up faster now and in a season or two you wont know the dryfooses from the other plutocrats they willa little better than they do now theyll see a difference but nothing radical nothing painful people who get up in the world by service to othersthrough letters or art or sciencemay have their modest little misgivings as to their social value but people that rise by moneyespecially if their gains are suddennever have and thats the kind of people that form our nobility theres no use pretending that we havent a nobility we might as well pretend we havent firstclass cars in the presence of a vestibuled pullman those girls had no more doubt of their right to be there than if they had been duchesses we thought it was very nice of miss vance to come and ask us but they didnt they werent afraid or the least embarrassed they were perfectly naturallike born aristocrats and you may be sure that if the plutocracy that now owns the country ever sees fit to take on the outward signs of an aristocracytitles and arms and ancestorsit wont falter from any inherent question of its worth money prizes and honors itself and if there is anything it hasnt got it believes it can buy it  well basil said his wife i hope you wont get infected with lindaus ideas of rich people some of them are very good and kind  who denies that not even lindau himself its all right and the great thing is that the evenings enjoyment is over ive got my society smile off and im radiantly happy go on with your little pessimistic diatribes isabel you cant spoil my pleasure  i could see said mela as she and christine drove home together that she was as jealous as she could be all the time you was talkun to mr beaton she pretended to be talkun to conrad but she kep her eye on you pretty close i can tell you i bet she just got us there to see how him and you would act together and i reckon she was satisfied hes dead gone on you chris  christine listened with a dreamy pleasure to the flatteries with which mela plied her in the hope of some return in kind and not at all because she felt spitefully toward miss vance or in anywise wished her ill who was that fellow with you so long asked christine i suppose you turned yourself inside out to him like you always do  mela was transported by the cruel ingratitude its a lie i didnt tell him a single thing  conrad walked home choosing to do so because he did not wish to hear his sisters talk of the evening and because there was a tumult in his spirit which he wished to let have its way in his life with its single purpose defeated by stronger wills than his own and now struggling partially to fulfil itself in acts of devotion to others the thought of women had entered scarcely more than in that of a child his ideals were of a virginal vagueness faces voices gestures had filled his fancy at times but almost passionately and the sensation that he now indulged was a kind of worship ardent but reverent and exalted the brutal experiences of the world make us forget that there are such natures in it and that they seem to come up out of the lowly earth as well as down from the high heaven in the heart of this man well on toward thirty there had never been left the stain of a base thought not that suggestion and conjecture had not visited him but that he had not entertained them or in anywise made them his in a catholic age and country he would have been one of those monks who are sainted after death for the angelic purity of their lives and whose names are invoked by believers in moments of trial like san luigi gonzaga as he now walked along thinking with a lovers beatified smile on his face of how margaret vance had spoken and looked he dramatized scenes in which he approved himself to her by acts of goodness and unselfishness and died to please her for the sake of others he made her praise him for them to his face when he disclaimed their merit and after his death when he could not all the time he was poignantly sensible of her grace her elegance her style they seemed to intoxicate him some tones of her voice thrilled through his nerves and some looks turned his brain with a delicious swooning sense of her beauty her refinement bewildered him but all this did not admit the idea of possession even of aspiration at the most his worship only set her beyond the love of other men as far as beyond his own   pg editors bookmarks      affectional habit     brag of his wife as a good husband always does     but when we make that money here no one loses it     courage hadnt been put to the test     family buryin grounds     homage which those who have not pay to those who have     hurry up and git wellor something     made money and do not yet know that money has made them     society all its favors are really bargains     wages are the measure of necessity and not of merit     without realizing his cruelty treated as a child     part fourth     i  not long after lent fulkerson set before dryfoos one day his scheme for a dinner in celebration of the success of every other week dryfoos had never meddled in any manner with the conduct of the periodical but fulkerson easily saw that he was proud of his relation to it and he proceeded upon the theory that he would be willing to have this relation known on the days when he had been lucky in stocks he was apt to drop in at the office on eleventh street on his way uptown and listen to fulkersons talk he was on good enough terms with march who revised his first impressions of the man but they had not much to say to each other and it seemed to march that dryfoos was even a little afraid of him as of a piece of mechanism he had acquired but did not quite understand he left the working of it to fulkerson who no doubt bragged of it sufficiently the old man seemed to have as little to say to his son he shut himself up with fulkerson where the others could hear the manager begin and go on with an unstinted flow of talk about every other week for fulkerson never talked of anything else if he could help it and was always bringing the conversation back to it if it strayed  the day he spoke of the dinner he rose and called from his door march i say come down here a minute will you conrad i want you too  the editor and the publisher found the manager and the proprietor seated on opposite sides of the table its about those funeral baked meats you know fulkerson explained and i was trying to give mr dryfoos some idea of what we wanted to do that is what i wanted to do he continued turning from march to dryfoos march here is opposed to it of course hed like to publish every other week on the sly keep it out of the papers and off the newsstands hes a modest boston petunia and he shrinks from publicity but i am not that kind of herb myself and i want all the publicity we can getbeg borrow or stealfor this thing i say that you cant work the sacred rites of hospitality in a better cause and what i propose is a little dinner for the purpose of recognizing the hit weve made with this thing my idea was to strike you for the necessary funds and do the thing on a handsome scale the term little dinner is a mere figure of speech a little dinner wouldnt make a big talk and what we want is the big talk at present if we dont lay up a cent my notion was that pretty soon after lent now when everybody is feeling just right we should begin to send out our paragraphs affirmative negative and explanatory and along about the first of may we should sit down about a hundred strong the most distinguished people in the country and solemnize our triumph there it is in a nutshell i might expand and i might expound but thats the sum and substance of it  fulkerson stopped and ran his eyes eagerly over the faces of his three listeners one after the other march was a little surprised when dryfoos turned to him but that reference of the question seemed to give fulkerson particular pleasure what do you think mr march  the editor leaned back in his chair i dont pretend to have mr fulkersons genius for advertising but it seems to me a little early yet we might celebrate later when weve got more to celebrate at present were a pleasing novelty rather than a fixed fact  ah you dont get the idea said fulkerson what we want to do with this dinner is to fix the fact  am i going to come in anywhere the old man interrupted  youre going to come in at the head of the procession we are going to strike everything that is imaginative and romantic in the newspaper soul with you and your history and your fancy for going in for this thing i can start you in a paragraph that will travel through all the newspapers from maine to texas and from alaska to florida we have had all sorts of rich men backing up literary enterprises but the naturalgas man in literature is a new thing and the combination of your picturesque past and your aesthetic present is something that will knock out the sympathies of the american public the first round i feel said fulkerson with a tremor of pathos in his voice that every other week is at a disadvantage before the public as long as its supposed to be my enterprise my idea as far as im known at all im known simply as a syndicate man and nobody in the press believes that ive got the money to run the thing on a grand scale a suspicion of insolvency must attach to it sooner or later and the fellows on the press will work up that impression sooner or later if we dont give them something else to work up now as soon as i begin to give it away to the correspondents that youre in it with your untold millionsthat in fact it was your idea from the start that you originated it to give full play to the humanitarian tendencies of conrad here whos always had these theories of cooperation and longed to realize them for the benefit of our struggling young writers and artists  march had listened with growing amusement to the mingled burlesque and earnest of fulkersons selfsacrificing impudence and with wonder as to how far dryfoos was consenting to his preposterous proposition when conrad broke out mr fulkerson i could not allow you to do that it would not be true i did not wish to be here andand what i thinkwhat i wish to dothat is something i will not let any one put me in a false position about no the blood rushed into the young mans gentle face and he met his fathers glance with defiance  dryfoos turned from him to fulkerson without speaking and fulkerson said caressingly why of course coonrod i know how you feel and i shouldnt let anything of that sort go out uncontradicted afterward but there isnt anything in these times that would give us better standing with the public than some hint of the way you feel about such things the publics expects to be interested and nothing would interest it more than to be told that the success of every other week sprang from the first application of the principle of live and let live to a literary enterprise it would look particularly well coming from you and your father but if you object we can leave that part out though if you approve of the principle i dont see why you need object the main thing is to let the public know that it owes this thing to the liberal and enlightened spirit of one of the foremost capitalists of the country and that his purposes are not likely to be betrayed in the hands of his son i should get a little cut made from a photograph of your father and supply it gratis with the paragraphs  i guess said the old man we will get along without the cut  fulkerson laughed well well have it your own way but the sight of your face in the patent outsides of the country press would be worth half a dozen subscribers in every school district throughout the length and breadth of this fair land  there was a fellow dryfoos explained in an aside to march that was getting up a history of moffitt and he asked me to let him put a steel engraving of me in he said a good many prominent citizens were going to have theirs in and his price was a hundred and fifty dollars i told him i couldnt let mine go for less than two hundred and when he said he could give me a splendid plate for that money i said i should want it cash you never saw a fellow more astonished when he got it through him that i expected him to pay the two hundred  fulkerson laughed in keen appreciation of the joke well sir i guess every other week will pay you that much but if you wont sell at any price all right we must try to worry along without the light of your countenance on the posters but we got to have it for the banquet  i dont seem to feel very hungry yet said they old man dryly  oh lappeit vient en mangeant as our french friends say youll be hungry enough when you see the preliminary little neck clam its too late for oysters  doesnt that fact seem to point to a postponement till they get back sometime in october march suggested  no no said fulkerson you dont catch on to the business end of this thing my friends youre proceeding on something like the old exploded idea that the demand creates the supply when everybody knows if hes watched the course of modern events that its just as apt to be the other way i contend that weve got a real substantial success to celebrate now but even if we hadnt the celebration would do more than anything else to create the success if we got it properly before the public people will say those fellows are not fools they wouldnt go and rejoice over their magazine unless they had got a big thing in it and the state of feeling we should produce in the public mind would make a boom of perfectly unprecedented grandeur for e o w heigh  he looked sunnily from one to the other in succession the elder dryfoos said with his chin on the top of his stick i reckon those little neck clams will keep  well just as you say fulkerson cheerfully assented i understand you to agree to the general principle of a little dinner  the smaller the better said the old man  well i say a little dinner because the idea of that seems to cover the case even if we vary the plan a little i had thought of a reception maybe that would include the lady contributors and artists and the wives and daughters of the other contributors that would give us the chance to ring in a lot of society correspondents and get the thing written up in firstclass shape bytheway cried fulkerson slapping himself on the leg why not have the dinner and the reception both  i dont understand said dryfoos  why have a select little dinner for ten or twenty choice spirits of the male persuasion and then about ten oclock throw open your palatial drawingrooms and admit the females to champagne salads and ices it is the very thing come  what do you think of it mr march asked dryfoos on whose social inexperience fulkersons words projected no very intelligible image and who perhaps hoped for some more light  its a beautiful vision said march and if it will take more time to realize it i think i approve i approve of anything that will delay mr fulkersons advertising orgie  then fulkerson pursued we could have the pleasure of miss christine and miss melas company and maybe mrs dryfoos would look in on us in the course of the evening theres no hurry as mr march suggests if we can give the thing this shape i will cheerfully adopt the idea of my honorable colleague  march laughed at his impudence but at heart he was ashamed of fulkerson for proposing to make use of dryfoos and his house in that way he fancied something appealing in the look that the old man turned on him and something indignant in conrads flush but probably this was only his fancy he reflected that neither of them could feel it as people of more worldly knowledge would and he consoled himself with the fact that fulkerson was really not such a charlatan as he seemed but it went through his mind that this was a strange end for all dryfooss moneymaking to come to and he philosophically accepted the fact of his own humble fortunes when he reflected how little his money could buy for such a man it was an honorable use that fulkerson was putting it to in every other week it might be far more creditably spent on such an enterprise than on horses or wines or women the usual resources of the brute rich and if it were to be lost it might better be lost that way than in stocks he kept a smiling face turned to dryfoos while these irreverent considerations occupied him and hardened his heart against father and son and their possible emotions  the old man rose to put an end to the interview he only repeated i guess those clams will keep till fall  but fulkerson was apparently satisfied with the progress he had made and when he joined march for the stroll homeward after office hours he was able to detach his mind from the subject as if content to leave it  this is about the best part of the year in new york he said in some of the areas the grass had sprouted and the tender young foliage had loosened itself froze the buds on a sidewalk tree here and there the soft air was full of spring and the delicate sky far aloof had the look it never wears at any other season it aint a time of year to complain much of anywhere but i dont want anything better than the month of may in new york farther south its too hot and ive been in boston in may when that east wind of yours made every nerve in my body get up and howl i reckon the weather has a good deal to do with the local temperament the reason a new york man takes life so easily with all his rush is that his climate dont worry him but a boston man must be rasped the whole while by the edge in his air that accounts for his sharpness and when hes lived through twentyfive or thirty boston mays he gets to thinking that providence has some particular use for him or he wouldnt have survived and that makes him conceited see  i see said march but i dont know how youre going to work that idea into an advertisement exactly  oh pahaw now march you dont think ive got that on the brain all the time  you were gradually leading up to every other week somehow  no sir i wasnt i was just thinking what a different creature a massachusetts man is from a virginian and yet i suppose theyre both as pure english stock as youll get anywhere in america marsh i think colonel woodburns paper is going to make a hit  youve got there when it knocks down the sale about onehalf i shall know its made a hit  im not afraid said fulkerson that thing is going to attract attention its well writtenyou can take the pomposity out of it here and there and its novel our people like a bold strike and its going to shake them up tremendously to have serfdom advocated on high moral grounds as the only solution of the labor problem you see in the first place he goes for their sympathies by the way he portrays the actual relations of capital and labor he shows how things have got to go from bad to worse and then he trots out his little old hobby and proves that if slavery had not been interfered with it would have perfected itself in the interest of humanity he makes a pretty strong plea for it  march threw back his head and laughed hes converted you i swear fulkerson if we had accepted and paid for an article advocating cannibalism as the only resource for getting rid of the superfluous poor youd begin to believe in it  fulkerson smiled in approval of the joke and only said i wish you could meet the colonel in the privacy of the domestic circle march youd like him hes a splendid old fellow regular type talk about spring  you ought to see the widows little back yard these days you know that glass gallery just beyond the diningroom those girls have got the potplants out of that and a lot more and theyve turned the edges of that back yard along the fence into a regular bower theyve got sweet peas planted and nasturtiums and we shall be in a blaze of glory about the beginning of june fun to see em work in the garden and the bird bossing the job in his cage under the cherrytree have to keep the middle of the yard for the clothesline but six days in the week its a lawn and i go over it with a mower myself march there aint anything like a home is there dear little cot of your own heigh i tell you march when i get to pushing that mower round and the colonel is smoking his cigar in the gallery and those girls are pottering over the flowers one of these soft evenings after dinner i feel like a human being yes i do i struck it rich when i concluded to take my meals at the widows for eight dollars a week i get good board refined society and all the advantages of a christian home bytheway youve never had much talk with miss woodburn have you march  not so much as with miss woodburns father  well he is rather apt to scoop the conversation i must draw his fire sometime when you and mrs march are around and get you a chance with miss woodburn  i should like that better i believe said march  well i shouldnt wonder if you did curious but miss woodburn isnt at all your idea of a southern girl shes got lots of go shes never idle a minute she keeps the old gentleman in firstclass shape and she dont believe a bit in the slavery solution of the labor problem says shes glad its gone and if its anything like the effects of it shes glad it went before her time no sir shes as full of snap as the liveliest kind of a northern girl none of that sunny southern languor you read about  i suppose the typical southerner like the typical anything else is pretty difficult to find said march but perhaps miss woodburn represents the new south the modern conditions must be producing a modern type  well thats what she and the colonel both say they say there aint anything left of that walter scott dignity and chivalry in the rising generation takes too much time you ought to see her sketch the oldschool highandmighty manners as they survive among some of the antiques in charlottesburg if that thing could be put upon the stage it would be a killing success makes the old gentleman laugh in spite of himself but hes as proud of her as punch anyway why dont you and mrs march come round oftener look here how would it do to have a little excursion somewhere after the spring fairly gets in its work  reporters present  no no nothing of that kind perfectly sincere and disinterested enjoyment  oh a few handbills to be scattered around buy every other week look out for the next number of every other week every other week at all the newsstands well ill talk it over with mrs march i suppose theres no great hurry  march told his wife of the idyllic mood in which he had left fulkerson at the widows door and she said he must be in love  why of course i wonder i didnt think of that but fulkerson is such an impartial admirer of the whole sex that you cant think of his liking one more than another i dont know that he showed any unjust partiality though in his talk of those girls as he called them and i always rather fancied that mrs mandelhes done so much for her you know and she is such a wellbalanced wellpreserved person and so ladylike and correct  fulkerson had the word for her academic shes everything that instruction and discipline can make of a woman but i shouldnt think they could make enough of her to be in love with  well i dont know the academic has its charm there are moods in which i could imagine myself in love with an academic person that regularity of line that reasoned strictness of contour that neatness of pose that slightly conventional but harmonious grouping of the emotions and moralsyou can see how it would have its charm the wedgwood in human nature i wonder where mrs mandel keeps her urn and her willow  i should think she might have use for them in that family poor thing said mrs march  ah that reminds me said her husband that we had another talk with the old gentleman this afternoon about fulkersons literary artistic and advertising orgie and its postponed till october  the later the better i should think said mrs march who did not really think about it at all but whom the date fixed for it caused to think of the intervening time we have got to consider what we will do about the summer before long basil  oh not yet not yet he pleaded with that mans willingness to abide in the present which is so trying to a woman its only the end of april  it will be the end of june before we know and these people wanting the boston house another year complicates it we cant spend the summer there as we planned  they oughtnt to have offered us an increased rent they have taken an advantage of us  i dont know that it matters said mrs march i had decided not to go there  had you this is a surprise  everything is a surprise to you basil when it happens  true i keep the world fresh that way  it wouldnt have been any change to go from one city to another for the summer we might as well have stayed in new york  yes i wish we had stayed said march idly humoring a conception of the accomplished fact mrs green would have let us have the gimcrackery very cheap for the summer months and we could have made all sorts of nice little excursions and trips off and been twice as well as if we had spent the summer away  nonsense you know we couldnt spend the summer in new york  i know i could  what stuff you couldnt manage  oh yes i could i could take my meals at fulkersons widows or at maronis with poor old lindau hes got to dining there again or i could keep house and he could dine with me here  there was a teasing look in marchs eyes and he broke into a laugh at the firmness with which his wife said i think if there is to be any housekeeping i will stay too and help to look after it i would try not intrude upon you and your guest  oh we should be only too glad to have you join us said march playing with fire  very well then i wish you would take him off to maronis the next time he comes to dine here cried his wife  the experiment of making marchs old friend free of his house had not given her all the pleasure that so kind a thing ought to have afforded so good a woman she received lindau at first with robust benevolence and the high resolve not to let any of his little peculiarities alienate her from a sense of his claim upon her sympathy and gratitude not only as a man who had been so generously fond of her husband in his youth but a hero who had suffered for her country her theory was that his mutilation must not be ignored but must be kept in mind as a monument of his sacrifice and she fortified bella with this conception so that the child bravely sat next his maimed arm at table and helped him to dishes he could not reach and cut up his meat for him as for mrs march herself the thought of his mutilation made her a little faint she was not without a bewildered resentment of its presence as a sort of oppression she did not like his drinking so much of marchs beer either it was no harm but it was somehow unworthy out of character with a hero of the war but what she really could not reconcile herself to was the violence of lindaus sentiments concerning the whole political and social fabric she did not feel sure that he should be allowed to say such things before the children who had been nurtured in the faith of bunker hill and appomattox as the beginning and the end of all possible progress in human rights as a woman she was naturally an aristocrat but as an american she was theoretically a democrat and it astounded it alarmed her to hear american democracy denounced as a shuffling evasion she had never cared much for the united states senate but she doubted if she ought to sit by when it was railed at as a rich mans club it shocked her to be told that the rich and poor were not equal before the law in a country where justice must be paid for at every step in fees and costs or where a poor man must go to war in his own person and a rich man might hire someone to go in his mrs march felt that this rebellious mind in lindau really somehow outlawed him from sympathy and retroactively undid his past suffering for the country she had always particularly valued that provision of the law because in forecasting all the possible mischances that might befall her own son she had been comforted by the thought that if there ever was another war and tom were drafted his father could buy him a substitute compared with such blasphemy as this lindaus declaration that there was not equality of opportunity in america and that fully onehalf the people were debarred their right to the pursuit of happiness by the hopeless conditions of their lives was flattering praise she could not listen to such things in silence though and it did not help matters when lindau met her arguments with facts and reasons which she felt she was merely not sufficiently instructed to combat and he was not quite gentlemanly to urge i am afraid for the effect on the children she said to her husband such perfectly distorted ideastom will be ruined by them  oh let tom find out where theyre false said march it will be good exercise for his faculties of research at any rate those things are getting said nowadays hell have to hear them sooner or later  had he better hear them at home demanded his wife  why you know as youre here to refute them isabel he teased perhaps its the best place but dont mind poor old lindau my dear he says himself that his parg is worse than his pidte you know  ah its too late now to mind him she sighed in a moment of rash good feeling or perhaps an exalted conception of duty she had herself proposed that lindau should come every week and read german with tom and it had become a question first how they could get him to take pay for it and then how they could get him to stop it mrs march never ceased to wonder at herself for having brought this about for she had warned her husband against making any engagement with lindau which would bring him regularly to the house the germans stuck so and were so unscrupulously dependent yet the deed being done she would not ignore the duty of hospitality and it was always she who made the old man stay to their sundayevening tea when he lingered near the hour reading schiller and heine and uhland with the boy in the clean shirt with which he observed the day lindaus linen was not to be trusted during the week she now concluded a season of mournful reflection by saying he will get you into trouble somehow basil  well i dont know how exactly i regard lindau as a political economist of an unusual type but i shall not let him array me against the constituted authorities short of that i think i am safe  well be careful basil be careful you know you are so rash  i suppose i may continue to pity him he is such a poor lonely old fellow are you really sorry hes come into our lives my dear  no no not that i feel as you do about it but i wish i felt easier about himsure that is that were not doing wrong to let him keep on talking so  i suspect we couldnt help it march returned lightly its one of what lindau calls his brincibles to say what he thinks     ii  the marches had no longer the gross appetite for novelty which urges youth to a surfeit of strange scenes experiences ideas and makes travel with all its annoyances and fatigues an inexhaustible delight but there is no doubt that the chief pleasure of their life in new york was from its quality of foreignness the flavor of olives which once tasted can never be forgotten the olives may not be of the first excellence they may be a little stale and small and poor to begin with but they are still olives and the fond palate craves them the sort which grew in new york on lower sixth avenue and in the region of jefferson market and on the soft exposures south of washington square were none the less acceptable because they were of the commonest italian variety  the marches spent a good deal of time and money in a grocery of that nationality where they found all the patriotic comestibles and potables and renewed their faded italian with the friendly family in charge italian table dhotes formed the adventure of the week on the day when mrs march let her domestics go out and went herself to dine abroad with her husband and children and they became adepts in the restaurants where they were served and which they varied almost from dinner to dinner the perfect decorum of these places and their immunity from offence in any emboldened the marches to experiment in spanish restaurants where red pepper and beans insisted in every dinner and where once they chanced upon a night of olla podrida with such appeals to marchs memory of a boyish ambition to taste the dish that he became poetic and then pensive over its cabbage and carrots peas and bacon for a rare combination of international motives they prized most the table dhote of a french lady who had taken a spanish husband in a second marriage and had a cuban negro for her cook with a crosseyed alsation for waiter and a slim young southamerican for cashier march held that some thing of the catholic character of these relations expressed itself in the generous and tolerant variety of the dinner which was singularly abundant for fifty cents without wine at one very neat french place he got a dinner at the same price with wine but it was not so abundant and march inquired in fruitless speculation why the table dhote of the italians a notoriously frugal and abstemious people should be usually more than you wanted at seventyfive cents and a dollar and that of the french rather less at half a dollar he could not see that the frequenters were greatly different at the different places they were mostly americans of subdued manners and conjecturably subdued fortunes with here and there a table full of foreigners there was no noise and not much smoking anywhere march liked going to that neat french place because there madame sat enthroned and high behind a comptoir at one side of the room and every body saluted her in going out it was there that a gentlelooking young couple used to dine in whom the marches became effectlessly interested because they thought they looked like that when they were young the wife had an aesthetic dress and defined her pretty head by wearing her backhair pulled up very tight under her bonnet the husband had dreamy eyes set wide apart under a pure forehead they are artists august i think march suggested to the waiter when he had vainly asked about them oh hartis cedenly august consented but heaven knows whether they were or what they were march never learned  this immunity from acquaintance this touchand go quality in their new york sojourn this almost loss of individuality at times after the intense identification of their boston life was a relief though mrs march had her misgivings and questioned whether it were not perhaps too relaxing to the moral fibre march refused to explore his conscience he allowed that it might be so but he said he liked now and then to feel his personality in that state of solution they went and sat a good deal in the softening evenings among the infants and dotards of latin extraction in washington square safe from all who ever knew them and enjoyed the advancing season which thickened the foliage of the trees and flattered out of sight the church wardens gothic of the university building the infants were sometimes cross and cried in their weary mothers or little sisters arms but they did not disturb the dotards who slept some with their heads fallen forward and some with their heads fallen back march arbitrarily distinguished those with the drooping faces as tipsy and ashamed to confront the public the small italian children raced up and down the asphalt paths playing american games of tag and hide andwhoop larger boys passed ball in training for potential championships the marches sat and mused or quarrelled fitfully about where they should spend the summer like sparrows he once said till the electric lights began to show distinctly among the leaves and they looked round and found the infants and dotards gone and the benches filled with lovers that was the signal for the marches to go home he said that the spectacle of so much courtship as the eye might take in there at a glance was not perhaps oppressive but the thought that at the same hour the same thing was going on all over the country wherever two young fools could get together was more than he could bear he did not deny that it was natural and in a measureuthorized but he declared that it was hackneyed and the fact that it must go on forever as long as the race lasted made him tired  at home generally they found that the children had not missed them and were perfectly safe it was one of the advantages of a flat that they could leave the children there whenever they liked without anxiety they liked better staying there than wandering about in the evening with their parents whose excursions seemed to them somewhat aimless and their pleasures insipid they studied or read or looked out of the window at the street sights and their mother always came back to them with a pang for their lonesomeness bella knew some little girls in the house but in a ceremonious way tom had formed no friendships among the boys at school such as he had left in boston as nearly as he could explain the new york fellows carried canes at an age when they would have had them broken for them by the other boys at boston and they were both sissyish and fast it was probably prejudice he never could say exactly what their demerits were and neither he nor bella was apparently so homesick as they pretended though they answered inquirers the one that new york was a hole and the other that it was horrid and that all they lived for was to get back to boston in the mean time they were thrown much upon each other for society which march said was well for both of them he did not mind their cultivating a little gloom and the sense of a common wrong it made them better comrades and it was providing them with amusing reminiscences for the future they really enjoyed bohemianizing in that harmless way though tom had his doubts of its respectability he was very punctilious about his sister and went round from his own school every day to fetch her home from hers the whole family went to the theatre a good deal and enjoyed themselves together in their desultory explorations of the city  they lived near greenwich village and march liked strolling through its quaintness toward the waterside on a sunday when a hereditary sabbatarianism kept his wife at home he made her observe that it even kept her at home from church he found a lingering quality of pure americanism in the region and he said the very bells called to worship in a nasal tone he liked the streets of small brick houses with here and there one painted red and the mortar lines picked out in white and with now and then a fine wooden portal of fluted pillars and a bowed transom the rear of the tenementhouses showed him the picturesqueness of clotheslines fluttering far aloft as in florence and the new apartmenthouses breaking the old skyline with their towering stories implied a life as alien to the american manner as anything in continental europe in fact foreign faces and foreign tongues prevailed in greenwich village but no longer german or even irish tongues or faces the eyes and earrings of italians twinkled in and out of the alleyways and basements and they seemed to abound even in the streets where long ranks of trucks drawn up in sunday rest along the curbstones suggested the presence of a race of sturdier strength than theirs march liked the swarthy strange visages he found nothing menacing for the future in them for wickedness he had to satisfy himself as he could with the sneering insolent cleanshaven mug of some rare american of the bhoy type now almost as extinct in new york as the dodo or the volunteer fireman when he had found his way among the ashbarrels and the groups of decently dressed churchgoers to the docks he experienced a sufficient excitement in the recent arrival of a french steamer whose sheds were thronged with hacks and expresswagons and in a tacit inquiry into the emotions of the passengers fresh from the cleanliness of paris and now driving up through the filth of those streets  some of the streets were filthier than others there was at least a choice there were boxes and barrels of kitchen offal on all the sidewalks but not everywhere manureheaps and in some places the stench was mixed with the more savory smell of cooking one sunday morning before the winter was quite gone the sight of the frozen refuse melting in heaps and particularly the loathsome edges of the rotting ice near the gutters with the strata of wastepaper and straw litter and eggshells and orange peel potatoskins and cigarstumps made him unhappy he gave a whimsical shrug for the squalor of the neighboring houses and said to himself rather than the boy who was with him its curious isnt it how fond the poor people are of these unpleasant thoroughfares you always find them living in the worst streets  the burden of all the wrong in the world comes on the poor said the boy every sort of fraud and swindling hurts them the worst the city wastes the money its paid to clean the streets with and the poor have to suffer for they cant afford to pay twice like the rich  march stopped short hallo tom is that your wisdom  its what mr lindau says answered the boy doggedly as if not pleased to have his ideas mocked at even if they were secondhand  and you didnt tell him that the poor lived in dirty streets because they liked them and were too lazy and worthless to have them cleaned  no i didnt  im surprised what do you think of lindau generally speaking tom  well sir i dont like the way he talks about some things i dont suppose this country is perfect but i think its about the best there is and it dont do any good to look at its drawbacks all the time  sound my son said march putting his hand on the boys shoulder and beginning to walk on well  well then he says that it isnt the public frauds only that the poor have to pay for but they have to pay for all the vices of the rich that when a speculator fails or a bank cashier defaults or a firm suspends or hard times come its the poor who have to give up necessaries where the rich give up luxuries  well well and then  well then i think the crank comes in in mr lindau he says theres no need of failures or frauds or hard times its ridiculous there always have been and there always will be but if you tell him that it seems to make him perfectly furious  march repeated the substance of this talk to his wife im glad to know that tom can see through such ravings he has lots of good common sense  it was the afternoon of the same sunday and they were sauntering up fifth avenue and admiring the wide old double houses at the lower end at one corner they got a distinct pleasure out of the gnarled elbows that a pollarded wistaria leaned upon the top of a garden wallfor its convenience in looking into the street he said the line of these comfortable dwellings once so fashionable was continually broken by the facades of shops and march professed himself vulgarized by a want of style in the people they met in their walk to twentythird street  take me somewhere to meet my fellowexclusives isabel he demanded i pine for the society of my peers  he hailed a passing omnibus and made his wife get on the roof with him think of our doing such a thing in boston she sighed with a little shiver of satisfaction in her immunity from recognition and comment  you wouldnt be afraid to do it in london or paris  no we should be strangers therejust as we are in new york i wonder how long one could be a stranger here  oh indefinitely in our way of living the place is really vast so much larger than it used to seem and so heterogeneous  when they got down very far uptown and began to walk back by madison avenue they found themselves in a different population from that they dwelt among not heterogeneous at all very homogeneous and almost purely american the only qualification was american hebrew such a welldressed wellsatisfied wellfed looking crowd poured down the broad sidewalks before the handsome stupid houses that march could easily pretend he had got among his fellowplutocrats at last still he expressed his doubts whether this sunday afternoon parade which seemed to be a thing of custom represented the best form among the young people of that region he wished he knew he blamed himself for becoming of a fastidious conjecture he could not deny the fashion and the richness and the indigeneity of the spectacle the promenaders looked newyorky they were the sort of people whom you would know for newyorkers elsewhereso well equipped and so perfectly kept at all points their silk hats shone and their boots their frocks had the right distension behind and their bonnets perfect poise and distinction  the marches talked of these and other facts of their appearance and curiously questioned whether this were the best that a great material civilization could come to it looked a little dull the mens faces were shrewd and alert and yet they looked dull the womens were pretty and knowing and yet dull it was probably the holiday expression of the vast prosperous commercial class with unlimited money and no ideals that money could not realize fashion and comfort were all that they desired to compass and the culture that furnishes showily that decorates and that tells the culture say of plays and operas rather than books  perhaps the observers did the promenaders injustice they might not have been as commonminded as they looked but march said i understand now why the poor people dont come up here and live in this clean handsome respectable quarter of the town they would be bored to death on the whole i think i should prefer mott street myself  in other walks the marches tried to find some of the streets they had wandered through the first day of their wedding journey in new york so long ago they could not make sure of them but once they ran down to the battery and easily made sure of that though not in its old aspect they recalled the hot morning when they sauntered over the trodden weed that covered the sickly grassplots there and sentimentalized the sweltering paupers who had crept out of the squalid tenements about for a breath of air after a sleepless night now the paupers were gone and where the old mansions that had fallen to their use once stood there towered aloft and abroad those heights and masses of manystoried brickwork for which architecture has yet no proper form and aesthetics no name the trees and shrubs all in their young spring green blew briskly over the guarded turf in the south wind that came up over the water and in the wellpaved alleys the ghosts of eighteenthcentury fashion might have met each other in their old haunts and exchanged stately congratulations upon its vastly bettered condition and perhaps puzzled a little over the colossal lady on bedloes island with her lifted torch and still more over the curving tracks and chaletstations of the elevated road it is an outlook of unrivalled beauty across the bay that smokes and flashes with the in numerable stacks and sails of commerce to the hills beyond where the moving forest of masts halts at the shore and roots itself in the groves of the many villaged uplands the marches paid the charming prospects a willing duty and rejoiced in it as generously as if it had been their own perhaps it was they decided he said people owned more things in common than they were apt to think and they drew the consolations of proprietorship from the excellent management of castle garden which they penetrated for a moments glimpse of the huge rotunda where the immigrants first set foot on our continent it warmed their hearts so easily moved to any cheap sympathy to see the friendly care the nation took of these humble guests they found it even pathetic to hear the proper authority calling out the names of such as had kin or acquaintance waiting there to meet them no one appeared troubled or anxious the officials had a conscientious civility the government seemed to manage their welcome as well as a private company or corporation could have done in fact it was after the simple strangers had left the government care that march feared their woes might begin and he would have liked the government to follow each of them to his home wherever he meant to fix it within our borders he made note of the looks of the licensed runners and touters waiting for the immigrants outside the government premises he intended to work them up into a dramatic effect in some sketch but they remained mere material in his memorandumbook together with some quaint old houses on the sixth avenue road which he had noticed on the way down on the way up these were superseded in his regard by some hiproof structures on the ninth avenue which he thought more dutchlooking the perspectives of the crossstreets toward the river were very lively with their turmoil of trucks and cars and carts and hacks and foot passengers ending in the chimneys and masts of shipping and final gleams of dancing water at a very noisy corner clangorous with some sort of ironworking he made his wife enjoy with him the quiet sarcasm of an inn that called itself the homelike hotel and he speculated at fantastic length on the gentle associations of one who should have passed his youth under its roof     iii  first and last the marches did a good deal of travel on the elevated roads which he said gave you such glimpses of material aspects in the city as some violent invasion of others lives might afford in human nature once when the impulse of adventure was very strong in them they went quite the length of the west side lines and saw the city pushing its way by irregular advances into the country some spaces probably held by the owners for that rise in value which the industry of others providentially gives to the land of the wise and good it left vacant comparatively far down the road and built up others at remoter points it was a world of lofty apartment houses beyond the park springing up in isolated blocks with stretches of invaded rusticity between and here and there an old countryseat standing dusty in its budding vines with the ground before it in rocky upheaval for city foundations but wherever it went or wherever it paused new york gave its peculiar stamp and the adventurers were amused to find one hundred and twentyfifth street inchoately like twentythird street and fourteenth street in its shops and shoppers the butchers shops and milliners shops on the avenue might as well have been at tenth as at one hundredth street  the adventurers were not often so adventurous they recognized that in their willingness to let their fancy range for them and to let speculation do the work of inquiry they were no longer young their point of view was singularly unchanged and their impressions of new york remained the same that they had been fifteen years before huge noisy ugly kindly it seemed to them now as it seemed then the main difference was that they saw it more now as a life and then they only regarded it as a spectacle and march could not release himself from a sense of complicity with it no matter what whimsical or alien or critical attitude he took a sense of the striving and the suffering deeply possessed him and this grew the more intense as he gained some knowledge of the forces at workforces of pity of destruction of perdition of salvation he wandered about on sunday not only through the streets but into this tabernacle and that as the spirit moved him and listened to those who dealt with christianity as a system of economics as well as a religion he could not get his wife to go with him she listened to his report of what he heard and trembled it all seemed fantastic and menacing she lamented the literary peace the intellectual refinement of the life they had left behind them and he owned it was very pretty but he said it was not lifeit was deathinlife she liked to hear him talk in that strain of virtuous selfdenunciation but she asked him which of your prophets are you going to follow and he answered allall and a fresh one every sunday and so they got their laugh out of it at last but with some sadness at heart and with a dim consciousness that they had got their laugh out of too many things in life  what really occupied and compassed his activities in spite of his strenuous reveries of work beyond it was his editorship on its social side it had not fulfilled all the expectations which fulkersons radiant sketch of its duties and relations had caused him to form of it most of the contributions came from a distance even the articles written in new york reached him through the post and so far from having his valuable time as they called it consumed in interviews with his collaborators he rarely saw any of them the boy on the stairs who was to fence him from importunate visitors led a life of luxurious disoccupation and whistled almost uninterruptedly when any one came march found himself embarrassed and a little anxious the visitors were usually young men terribly respectful but cherishing as he imagined ideals and opinions chasmally different from his and he felt in their presence something like an anachronism something like a fraud he tried to freshen up his sympathies on them to get at what they were really thinking and feeling and it was some time before he could understand that they were not really thinking and feeling anything of their own concerning their art but were necessarily in their quality of young inexperienced men mere acceptants of older mens thoughts and feelings whether they were tremendously conservative as some were or tremendously progressive as others were certain of them called themselves realists certain romanticists but none of them seemed to know what realism was or what romanticism they apparently supposed the difference a difference of material march had imagined himself taking home to lunch or dinner the aspirants for editorial favor whom he liked whether he liked their work or not but this was not an easy matter those who were at all interesting seemed to have engagements and preoccupations after two or three experiments with the bashfuller sortthose who had come up to the metropolis with manuscripts in their hands in the good old literary traditionhe wondered whether he was otherwise like them when he was young like them he could not flatter himself that he was not and yet he had a hope that the world had grown worse since his time which his wife encouraged  mrs march was not eager to pursue the hospitalities which she had at first imagined essential to the literary prosperity of every other week her family sufficed her she would willingly have seen no one out of it but the strangers at the weekly tabledhote dinner or the audiences at the theatres marchs devotion to his work made him reluctant to delegate it to any one and as the summer advanced and the question of where to go grew more vexed he showed a mans base willingness to shirk it for himself by not going anywhere he asked his wife why she did not go somewhere with the children and he joined her in a search for nonmalarial regions on the map when she consented to entertain this notion but when it came to the point she would not go he offered to go with her then and then she would not let him she said she knew he would be anxious about his work he protested that he could take it with him to any distance within a few hours but she would not be persuaded she would rather he stayed the effect would be better with mr fulkerson they could make excursions and they could all get off a week or two to the seashore near bostonthe only real seashorein august the excursions were practically confined to a single day at coney island and once they got as far as boston on the way to the seashore near boston that is mrs march and the children went an editorial exigency kept march at the last moment the boston streets seemed very queer and clean and empty to the children and the buildings little in the horsecars the boston faces seemed to arraign their mother with a downdrawn severity that made her feel very guilty she knew that this was merely the puritan mask the cast of a dead civilization which people of very amiable and tolerant minds were doomed to wear and she sighed to think that less than a year of the heterogeneous gayety of new york should have made her afraid of it the sky seemed cold and gray the east wind which she had always thought so delicious in summer cut her to the heart she took her children up to the south end and in the pretty square where they used to live they stood before their alienated home and looked up at its closeshuttered windows the tenants must have been away but mrs march had not the courage to ring and make sure though she had always promised herself that she would go all over the house when she came back and see how they had used it she could pretend a desire for something she wished to take away she knew she could not bear it now and the children did not seem eager she did not push on to the seaside it would be forlorn there without their father she was glad to go back to him in the immense friendly homelessness of new york and hold him answerable for the change in her heart or her mind which made its shapeless tumult a refuge and a consolation  she found that he had been giving the cook a holiday and dining about hither and thither with fulkerson once he had dined with him at the widows as they always called mrs leighton and then had spent the evening there and smoked with fulkerson and colonel woodburn on the gallery overlooking the back yard they were all spending the summer in new york the widow had got so good an offer for her house at st barnaby for the summer that she could not refuse it and the woodburns found new york a wateringplace of exemplary coolness after the burning augusts and septembers of charlottesburg  you can stand it well enough in our climate sir the colonel explained till you come to the september heat that sometimes runs well into october and then you begin to lose your temper sir its never quite so hot as it is in new york at times but its hot longer sir he alleged as if something of the sort were necessary the example of a famous southwestern editor who spent all his summers in a new york hotel as the most luxurious retreat on the continent consulting the weather forecasts and running off on torrid days to the mountains or the sea and then hurrying back at the promise of cooler weather the colonel had not found it necessary to do this yet and he had been reluctant to leave town where he was working up a branch of the inquiry which had so long occupied him in the libraries and studying the great problem of labor and poverty as it continually presented itself to him in the streets he said that he talked with all sorts of people whom he found monstrously civil if you took them in the right way and he went everywhere in the city without fear and apparently without danger march could not find out that he had ridden his hobby into the homes of want which he visited or had proposed their enslavement to the inmates as a short and simple solution of the great question of their lives he appeared to have contented himself with the collection of facts for the persuasion of the cultivated classes it seemed to march a confirmation of this impression that the colonel should address his deductions from these facts so unsparingly to him he listened with a respectful patience for which fulkerson afterward personally thanked him fulkerson said it was not often the colonel found such a good listener generally nobody listened but mrs leighton who thought his ideas were shocking but honored him for holding them so conscientiously fulkerson was glad that march as the literary department had treated the old gentleman so well because there was an open feud between him and the art department beaton was outrageously rude fulkerson must say though as for that the old colonel seemed quite able to take care of himself and gave beaton an unqualified contempt in return for his unmannerliness the worst of it was it distressed the old lady so she admired beaton as much as she respected the colonel and she admired beaton fulkerson thought rather more than miss leighton did he asked march if he had noticed them together march had noticed them but without any very definite impression except that beaton seemed to give the whole evening to the girl afterward he recollected that he had fancied her rather harassed by his devotion and it was this point that he wished to present for his wifes opinion  girls often put on that air she said its one of their ways of teasing but then if the man was really very much in love and she was only enough in love to be uncertain of herself she might very well seem troubled it would be a very serious question girls often dont know what to do in such a case  yes said march ive often been glad that i was not a girl on that account but i guess that on general principles beaton is not more in love than she is i couldnt imagine that young man being more in love with anybody unless it was himself he might be more in love with himself than any one else was  well he doesnt interest me a great deal and i cant say miss leighton does either i think she can take care of herself she has herself very well in hand  why so censorious pleaded march i dont defend her for having herself in hand but is it a fault  mrs march did not say she asked and how does mr fulkersons affair get on  his affair you really think it is one well ive fancied so myself and ive had an idea of some time asking him fulkerson strikes one as truly domesticable conjugable at heart but ive waited for him to speak  i should think so  yes hes never opened on the subject yet do you know i think fulkerson has his moments of delicacy  moments hes all delicacy in regard to women  well perhaps so there is nothing in them to rouse his advertising instincts     iv  the dryfoos family stayed in town till august then the father went west again to look after his interests and mrs mandel took the two girls to one of the great hotels in saratoga fulkerson said that he had never seen anything like saratoga for fashion and mrs mandel remembered that in her own young ladyhood this was so for at least some weeks of the year she had been too far withdrawn from fashion since her marriage to know whether it was still so or not in this as in so many other matters the dryfoos family helplessly relied upon fulkerson in spite of dryfooss angry determination that he should not run the family and in spite of christines doubt of his omniscience if he did not know everything she was aware that he knew more than herself she thought that they had a right to have him go with them to saratoga or at least go up and engage their rooms beforehand but fulkerson did not offer to do either and she did not quite see her way to commanding his services the young ladies took what mela called splendid dresses with them they sat in the park of tall slim trees which the hotels quadrangle enclosed and listened to the music in the morning or on the long piazza in the afternoon and looked at the driving in the street or in the vast parlors by night where all the other ladies were and they felt that they were of the best there but they knew nobody and mrs mandel was so particular that mela was prevented from continuing the acquaintance even of the few young men who danced with her at the saturdaynight hops they drove about but they went to places without knowing why except that the carriage man took them and they had all the privileges of a proud exclusivism without desiring them once a motherly matron seemed to perceive their isolation and made overtures to them but then desisted as if repelled by christines suspicion or by melas too instant and hilarious goodfellowship which expressed itself in hoarse laughter and in a flow of talk full of topical and syntactical freedom from time to time she offered to bet christine that if mr fulkerson was only there they would have a good time she wondered what they were all doing in new york where she wished herself she rallied her sister about beaton and asked her why she did not write and tell him to come up there  mela knew that christine had expected beaton to follow them some banter had passed between them to this effect he said he should take them in on his way home to syracuse christine would not have hesitated to write to him and remind him of his promise but she had learned to distrust her literature with beaton since he had laughed at the spelling in a scrap of writing which dropped out of her musicbook one night she believed that he would not have laughed if he had known it was hers but she felt that she could hide better the deficiencies which were not committed to paper she could manage with him in talking she was too ignorant of her ignorance to recognize the mistakes she made then through her own passion she perceived that she had some kind of fascination for him she was graceful and she thought it must be that she did not understand that there was a kind of beauty in her small irregular features that piqued and haunted his artistic sense and a look in her black eyes beyond her intelligence and intention once he sketched her as they sat together and flattered the portrait without getting what he wanted in it he said he must try her some time in color and he said things which when she made mela repeat them could only mean that he admired her more than anybody else he came fitfully but he came often and she rested content in a girls indefiniteness concerning the affair if her thought went beyond lovemaking to marriage she believed that she could have him if she wanted him her fathers money counted in this she divined that beaton was poor but that made no difference she would have enough for both the money would have counted as an irresistible attraction if there had been no other  the affair had gone on in spite of the sidelong looks of restless dislike with which dryfoos regarded it but now when beaton did not come to saratoga it necessarily dropped and christines content with it she bore the trial as long as she could she used pride and resentment against it but at last she could not bear it and with melas help she wrote a letter bantering beaton on his stay in new york and playfully boasting of saratoga it seemed to them both that it was a very bright letter and would be sure to bring him they would have had no scruple about sending it but for the doubt they had whether they had got some of the words right mela offered to bet christine anything she dared that they were right and she said send it anyway it was no difference if they were wrong but christine could not endure to think of that laugh of beatons and there remained only mrs mandel as authority on the spelling christine dreaded her authority on other points but mela said she knew she would not interfere and she undertook to get round her mrs mandel pronounced the spelling bad and the taste worse she forbade them to send the letter and mela failed to get round her though she threatened if mrs mandel would not tell her how to spell the wrong words that she would send the letter as it was then mrs mandel said that if mr beaton appeared in saratoga she would instantly take them both home when mela reported this result christine accused her of having mismanaged the whole business she quarrelled with her and they called each other names christine declared that she would not stay in saratoga and that if mrs mandel did not go back to new york with her she should go alone they returned the first week in september but by that time beaton had gone to see his people in syracuse  conrad dryfoos remained at home with his mother after his father went west he had already taken such a vacation as he had been willing to allow himself and had spent it on a charity farm near the city where the fathers with whom he worked among the poor on the east side in the winter had sent some of their wards for the summer it was not possible to keep his recreation a secret at the office and fulkerson found a pleasure in figuring the jolly time brother conrad must have teaching farm work among those paupers and potential reprobates he invented details of his experience among them and march could not always help joining in the laugh at conrads humorless helplessness under fulkersons burlesque denunciation of a summer outing spent in such dissipation  they had time for a great deal of joking at the office during the season of leisure which penetrates in august to the very heart of business and they all got on terms of greater intimacy if not greater friendliness than before fulkerson had not had so long to do with the advertising side of human nature without developing a vein of cynicism of no great depth perhaps but broad and underlying his whole point of view he made light of beatons solemnity as he made light of conrads humanity the art editor with abundant sarcasm had no more humor than the publisher and was an easy prey in the managers hands but when he had been led on by fulkersons flatteries to make some betrayal of egotism he brooded over it till he had thought how to revenge himself in elaborate insult for beatons talent fulkerson never lost his admiration but his joke was to encourage him to give himself airs of being the sole source of the magazines prosperity no bait of this sort was too obvious for beaton to swallow he could be caught with it as often as fulkerson chose though he was ordinarily suspicious as to the motives of people in saying things with march he got on no better than at first he seemed to be lying in wait for some encroachment of the literary department on the art department and he met it now and then with anticipative reprisal after these rebuffs the editor delivered him over to the manager who could turn beatons contrarymindedness to account by asking the reverse of what he really wanted done this was what fulkerson said the fact was that he did get on with beaton and march contented himself with musing upon the contradictions of a character at once so vain and so offensive so fickle and so sullen so conscious and so simple  after the first jarring contact with dryfoos the editor ceased to feel the disagreeable fact of the old mans mastery of the financial situation none of the chances which might have made it painful occurred the control of the whole affair remained in fulkersons hands before he went west again dryfoos had ceased to come about the office as if having once worn off the novelty of the sense of owning a literary periodical he was no longer interested in it  yet it was a relief somehow when he left town which he did not do without coming to take a formal leave of the editor at his office he seemed willing to leave march with a better impression than he had hitherto troubled himself to make he even said some civil things about the magazine as if its success pleased him and he spoke openly to march of his hope that his son would finally become interested in it to the exclusion of the hopes and purposes which divided them it seemed to march that in the old mans warped and toughened heart he perceived a disappointed love for his son greater than for his other children but this might have been fancy lindau came in with some copy while dryfoos was there and march introduced them when lindau went out march explained to dryfoos that he had lost his hand in the war and he told him something of lindaus career as he had known it dryfoos appeared greatly pleased that every other week was giving lindau work he said that he had helped to enlist a good many fellows for the war and had paid money to fill up the moffitt county quota under the later calls for troops he had never been an abolitionist but he had joined the antinebraska party in 55 and he had voted for fremont and for every republican president since then  at his own house march saw more of lindau than of any other contributor but the old man seemed to think that he must transact all his business with march at his place of business the transaction had some peculiarities which perhaps made this necessary lindau always expected to receive his money when he brought his copy as an acknowledgment of the immediate right of the laborer to his hire and he would not take it in a check because he did not approve of banks and regarded the whole system of banking as the capitalistic manipulation of the peoples money he would receive his pay only from marchs hand because he wished to be understood as working for him and honestly earning money honestly earned and sometimes march inwardly winced a little at letting the old man share the increase of capital won by such speculation as dryfooss but he shook off the feeling as the summer advanced and the artists and classes that employed lindau as a model left town one after another he gave largely of his increasing leisure to the people in the office of every other week it was pleasant for march to see the respect with which conrad dryfoos always used him for the sake of his hurt and his gray beard there was something delicate and fine in it and there was nothing unkindly on fulkersons part in the hostilities which usually passed between himself and lindau fulkerson bore himself reverently at times too but it was not in him to keep that up especially when lindau appeared with more beer aboard than as fulkerson said he could manage shipshape on these occasions fulkerson always tried to start him on the theme of the unduly rich he made himself the champion of monopolies and enjoyed the invectives which lindau heaped upon him as a slave of capital he said that it did him good  one day with the usual show of writhing under lindaus scorn he said well i understand that although you despise me now lindau  i tont desbise you the old man broke in his nostrils swelling and his eyes flaming with excitement i bity you  well it seems to come to the same thing in the end said fulkerson what i understand is that you pity me now as the slave of capital but you would pity me a great deal more if i was the master of it  how you mean  if i was rich  that would tebendt said lindau trying to control himself if you hat inheritedt your money you might pe innocent but if you hat mate it efery man that resbectedt himself would haf to ask how you mate it and if you hat mate moch he would know  hold on hold on now lindau aint that rather unamerican doctrine were all brought up aint we to honor the man that made his money and look downor try to look down sometimes its difficult on the fellow that his father left it to  the old man rose and struck his breast on amerigan he roared and as he went on his accent grew more and more uncertain what iss amerigan dere iss no ameriga any more you start here free and brafe and you glaim for efery man de right to life liperty and de bursuit of habbiness and where haf you entedt no man that vorks vith his handts among you has the liperty to bursue his habbiness he iss the slafe of some richer man some gompany some gorporation dat crindt him down to the least he can lif on and that rops him of the marchin of his earnings that he knight pe habby on oh you amerigans you haf cot it down goldt as you say you tont puy foters you puy lechislatures and goncressmen you puy gourts you puy gombetitors you pay infentors not to infent you atfertise and the gountingroom sees dat de etitorialroom toesnt tink  yes weve got a little arrangement of that sort with march here said fulkerson  oh i am sawry said the old man contritely i meant noting bersonal i tont tink we are all cuilty or gorrubt and efen among the rich there are goodt men but gabidalhis passion rose againwhere you find gabidal millions of money that a man hass cot togeder in fife ten twenty years you findt the smell of tears and ploodt dat iss what i say and you cot to loog oudt for yourself when you meet a rich man whether you meet an honest man  well said fulkerson i wish i was a subject of suspicion with you lindau bytheway he added i understand that you think capital was at the bottom of the veto of that pension of yours  what bension what fetothe old man flamed up again no bension of mine was efer fetoedt i renounce my bension begause i would sgorn to dake money from a gofernment that i tont peliefe in any more where you hear that story  well i dont know said fulkerson rather embarrassed its common talk  its a gommon lie then when the time gome dat dis iss a free gountry again then i dake a bension again for my woundts but i would sdarfe before i dake a bension now from a rebublic dat iss bought oap by monobolies and ron by drusts and gompines and railroadts andt oil gompanies  look out lindau said fulkerson you bite yourself mit dat dog some day but when the old man with a ferocious gesture of renunciation whirled out of the place he added i guess i went a little too far that time i touched him on a sore place i didnt mean to i heard some talk about his pension being vetoed from miss leighton he addressed these exculpations to marchs grave face and to the pitying deprecation in the eyes of conrad dryfoos whom lindaus roaring wrath had summoned to the door but ill make it all right with him the next time he comes i didnt know he was loaded or i wouldnt have monkeyed with him  lindau does himself injustice when he gets to talking in that way said march i hate to hear him hes as good an american as any of us and its only because he has too high an ideal of us  oh go on rub it inrub it in cried fulkerson clutching his hair in suffering which was not altogether burlesque how did i know he had renounced his bension why didnt you tell me  i didnt know it myself i only knew that he had none and i didnt ask for i had a notion that it might be a painful subject  fulkerson tried to turn it off lightly well hes a noble old fellow pity he drinks march would not smile and fulkerson broke out dog on it ill make it up to the old fool the next time he comes i dont like that dynamite talk of his but any man thats given his hand to the country has got mine in his grip for good why march you dont suppose i wanted to hurt his feelings do you  why of course not fulkerson  but they could not get away from a certain ruefulness for that time and in the evening fulkerson came round to marchs to say that he had got lindaus address from conrad and had looked him up at his lodgings  well there isnt so much bricabrac there quite as mrs green left you but ive made it all right with lindau as far as im concerned i told him i didnt know when i spoke that way and i honored him for sticking to his brinciples i dont believe in his brincibles and we wept on each others necksat least he did dogged if he didnt kiss me before i knew what he was up to he said i was his chenerous gong friendt and he begged my barton if he had said anything to wound me i tell you it was an affecting scene march and rats enough round in that old barracks where he lives to fit out a firstclass case of delirium tremens what does he stay there for hes not obliged to  lindaus reasons as march repeated them affected fulkerson as deliciously comical but after that he confined his pleasantries at the office to beaton and conrad dryfoos or as he said he spent the rest of the summer in keeping lindau smoothed up  it is doubtful if lindau altogether liked this as well perhaps he missed the occasions fulkerson used to give him of bursting out against the millionaires and he could not well go on denouncing as the slafe of gabidal a man who had behaved to him as fulkerson had done though fulkersons servile relations to capital had been in nowise changed by his nople gonduct  their relations continued to wear this irksome character of mutual forbearance and when dryfoos returned in october and fulkerson revived the question of that dinner in celebration of the success of every other week he carried his complaisance to an extreme that alarmed march for the consequences     v  you see fulkerson explained i find that the old man has got an idea of his own about that banquet and i guess theres some sense in it he wants to have a preliminary little dinner where we can talk the thing up firsthalf a dozen of us and he wants to give us the dinner at his house well thats no harm i dont believe the old man ever gave a dinner and hed like to show off a little theres a good deal of human nature in the old man after all he thought of you of course and colonel woodburn and beaton and me at the foot of the table and conrad and i suggested kendricks hes such a nice little chap and the old man himself brought up the idea of lindau he said you told him something about him and he asked why couldnt we have him too and i jumped at it  have lindau to dinner asked march  certainly why not father dryfoos has a notion of paying the old fellow a compliment for what he done for the country there wont be any trouble about it you can sit alongside of him and cut up his meat for him and help him to things  yes but it wont do fulkerson i dont believe lindau ever had on a dresscoat in his life and i dont believe his brincibles would let him wear one  well neither had dryfoos for the matter of that hes as highprincipled as old panelectric himself when it comes to a dresscoat said fulkerson were all going to go in business dress the old man stipulated for that  it isnt the dresscoat alone march resumed lindau and dryfoos wouldnt get on you know theyre opposite poles in everything you mustnt do it dryfoos will be sure to say something to outrage lindaus brincibles and therell be an explosion its all well enough for dryfoos to feel grateful to lindau and his wish to honor him does him credit but to have lindau to dinner isnt the way at the best the old fellow would be very unhappy in such a house he would have a bad conscience and i should be sorry to have him feel that hed been recreant to his brincibles theyre about all hes got and whatever we think of them were bound to respect his fidelity to them march warmed toward lindau in taking this view of him i should feel ashamed if i didnt protest against his being put in a false position after all hes my old friend and i shouldnt like to have him do himself injustice if he is a crank  of course said fulkerson with some trouble in his face i appreciate your feeling but there aint any danger he added buoyantly anyhow you spoke too late as the irishman said to the chicken when he swallowed him in a fresh egg ive asked lindau and hes accepted with blayzure thats what he says  march made no other comment than a shrug  youll see fulkerson continued it ll go off all right ill engage to make it and i wont hold anybody else responsible  in the course of his married life march had learned not to censure the irretrievable but this was just what his wife had not learned and she poured out so much astonishment at what fulkerson had done and so much disapproval that march began to palliate the situation a little  after all it isnt a question of life and death and if it were i dont see how its to be helped now  oh its not to be helped now but i am surprised at mr fulkerson  well fulkerson has his moments of being merely human too  mrs march would not deign a direct defence of her favorite well im glad there are not to be ladies  i dont know dryfoos thought of having ladies but it seems your infallible fulkerson overruled him their presence might have kept lindau and our host in bounds  it had become part of the marches conjugal joke for him to pretend that she could allow nothing wrong in fulkerson and he now laughed with a mocking air of having expected it when she said well then if mr fulkerson says he will see that it all comes out right i suppose you must trust his tact i wouldnt trust yours basil the first wrong step was taken when mr lindau was asked to help on the magazine  well it was your infallible fulkerson that took the step or at least suggested it im happy to say i had totally forgotten my early friend  mrs march was daunted and silenced for a moment then she said oh pshaw you know well enough he did it to please you  im very glad he didnt do it to please you isabel said her husband with affected seriousness though perhaps he did  he began to look at the humorous aspect of the affair which it certainly had and to comment on the singular incongruities which every other week was destined to involve at every moment of its career i wonder if im mistaken in supposing that no other periodical was ever like it perhaps all periodicals are like it but i dont believe theres another publication in new york that could bring together in honor of itself a fraternity and equality crank like poor old lindau and a belated sociological crank like woodburn and a truculent speculator like old dryfoos and a humanitarian dreamer like young dryfoos and a sentimentalist like me and a nondescript like beaton and a pure advertising essence like fulkerson and a society spirit like kendricks if we could only allow one another to talk uninterruptedly all the time the dinner would be the greatest success in the world and we should come home full of the highest mutual respect but i suspect we cant manage thateven your infallible fulkerson couldnt work itand im afraid that therell be some listening that ll spoil the pleasure of the time  march was so well pleased with this view of the case that he suggested the idea involved to fulkerson fulkerson was too good a fellow not to laugh at another mans joke but he laughed a little ruefully and he seemed worn with more than one kind of care in the interval that passed between the present time and the night of the dinner  dryfoos necessarily depended upon him for advice concerning the scope and nature of the dinner but he received the advice suspiciously and contested points of obvious propriety with pertinacious stupidity fulkerson said that when it came to the point he would rather have had the thing as he called it at delmonicos or some other restaurant but when he found that dryfooss pride was bound up in having it at his own house he gave way to him dryfoos also wanted his womancook to prepare the dinner but fulkerson persuaded him that this would not do he must have it from a caterer then dryfoos wanted his maids to wait at table but fulkerson convinced him that this would be incongruous at a mans dinner it was decided that the dinner should be sent in from frescobaldis and dryfoos went with fulkerson to discuss it with the caterer he insisted upon having everything explained to him and the reason for having it and not something else in its place and he treated fulkerson and frescobaldi as if they were in league to impose upon him there were moments when fulkerson saw the varnish of professional politeness cracking on the neapolitans volcanic surface and caught a glimpse of the lava fires of the cooks nature beneath he trembled for dryfoos who was walking roughshod over him in the security of an american who had known how to make his money and must know how to spend it but he got him safely away at last and gave frescobaldi a wink of sympathy for his shrug of exhaustion as they turned to leave him  it was at first a relief and then an anxiety with fulkerson that lindau did not come about after accepting the invitation to dinner until he appeared at dryfooss house prompt to the hour there was to be sure nothing to bring him but fulkerson was uneasily aware that dryfoos expected to meet him at the office and perhaps receive some verbal acknowledgment of the honor done him dryfoos he could see thought he was doing all his invited guests a favor and while he stood in a certain awe of them as people of much greater social experience than himself regarded them with a kind of contempt as people who were going to have a better dinner at his house than they could ever afford to have at their own he had finally not spared expense upon it after pushing frescobaldi to the point of eruption with his misgivings and suspicions at the first interview he had gone to him a second time alone and told him not to let the money stand between him and anything he would like to do in the absence of frescobaldis fellowconspirator he restored himself in the caterers esteem by adding whatever he suggested and fulkerson after trembling for the old mans niggardliness was now afraid of a fantastic profusion in the feast dryfoos had reduced the scale of the banquet as regarded the number of guests but a confusing remembrance of what fulkerson had wished to do remained with him in part and up to the day of the dinner he dropped in at frescobaldis and ordered more dishes and more of them he impressed the italian as an american original of a novel kind and when he asked fulkerson how dryfoos had made his money and learned that it was primarily in natural gas he made note of some of his eccentric tastes as peculiarities that were to be caressed in any future naturalgas millionaire who might fall into his hands he did not begrudge the time he had to give in explaining to dryfoos the relation of the different wines to the different dishes dryfoos was apt to substitute a costlier wine where he could for a cheaper one and he gave frescobaldi carte blanche for the decoration of the table with pieces of artistic confectionery among these the caterer designed one for a surprise to his patron and a delicate recognition of the source of his wealth which he found dryfoos very willing to talk about when he intimated that he knew what it was  dryfoos left it to fulkerson to invite the guests and he found ready acceptance of his politeness from kendricks who rightly regarded the dinner as a part of the every other week business and was too sweet and kindhearted anyway not to seem very glad to come march was a matter of course but in colonel woodburn fulkerson encountered a reluctance which embarrassed him the more because he was conscious of having for motives of his own rather strained a point in suggesting the colonel to dryfoos as a fit subject for invitation there had been only one of the colonels articles printed as yet and though it had made a sensation in its way and started the talk about that number still it did not fairly constitute him a member of the staff or even entitle him to recognition as a regular contributor fulkerson felt so sure of pleasing him with dryfooss message that he delivered it in full family council at the widows his daughter received it with all the enthusiasm that fulkerson had hoped for but the colonel said stiffly i have not the pleasure of knowing mr dryfoos miss woodburn appeared ready to fall upon him at this but controlled herself as if aware that filial authority had its limits and pressed her lips together without saying anything  yes i know fulkerson admitted but it isnt a usual case mr dryfoos dont go in much for the conventionalities i reckon he dont know much about em come to boil it down and he hopedhere fulkerson felt the necessity of inventing a littlethat you would excuse any want of ceremony its to be such an informal affair anyway were all going in business dress and there aint going to be any ladies hed have come himself to ask you but hes a kind of a bashful old fellow its all right colonel woodburn  i take it that it is sir said the colonel courteously but with unabated state coming from you but in these matters we have no right to burden our friends with our decisions  of course of course said fulkerson feeling that he had been delicately told to mind his own business  i understand the colonel went on the relation that mr dryfoos bears to the periodical in which you have done me the honor to print my papah but this is a question of passing the bounds of a purely business connection and of eating the salt of a man whom you do not definitely know to be a gentleman  mah goodness his daughter broke in if you bah your own salt with his money  it is supposed that i earn his money before i buy my salt with it returned her father severely and in these times when money is got in heaps through the natural decay of our nefarious commercialism it behooves a gentleman to be scrupulous that the hospitality offered him is not the profusion of a thief with his booty i dont say that mr dryfooss goodfortune is not honest i simply say that i know nothing about it and that i should prefer to know something before i sat down at his board  youre all right colonel said fulkerson and so is mr dryfoos i give you my word that there are no flies on his personal integrity if thats what you mean hes hard and hed push an advantage but i dont believe he would take an unfair one hes speculated and made money every time but i never heard of his wrecking a railroad or belonging to any swindling company or any grinding monopoly he does chance it in stocks but hes always played on the square if you call stocks gambling  may i think this over till morning asked the colonel  oh certainly certainly said fulkerson eagerly i dont know as theres any hurry  miss woodburn found a chance to murmur to him before he went hell come and ahm so much oblahged mr fulkerson ah jost know its all you doing and it will give papa a chance to toak to some new people and get away from us evahlastin women for once  i dont see why any one should want to do that said fulkerson with grateful gallantry but ill be dogged he said to march when he told him about this odd experience if i ever expected to find colonel woodburn on old lindaus ground he did come round handsomely this morning at breakfast and apologized for taking time to think the invitation over before he accepted you understand he says that if it had been to the table of some friend not so prosperous as mr dryfoosyour friend mr march for instanceit would have been sufficient to know that he was your friend but in these days it is a duty that a gentleman owes himself to consider whether he wishes to know a rich man or not the chances of making money disreputably are so great that the chances are against a man who has made money if hes made a great deal of it  march listened with a face of ironical insinuation that was very good and he seems to have had a good deal of confidence in your patience and in your sense of his importance to the occasion  no no fulkerson protested theres none of that kind of thing about the colonel i told him to take time to think it over hes the simplesthearted old fellow in the world  i should say so after all he didnt give any reason he had for accepting but perhaps the young lady had the reason  pshaw march said fulkerson     vi  so far as the dryfoos family was concerned the dinner might as well have been given at frescobaldis rooms none of the ladies appeared mrs dryfoos was glad to escape to her own chamber where she sat before an autumnal fire shaking her head and talking to herself at times with the foreboding of evil which old women like her make part of their religion the girls stood just out of sight at the head of the stairs and disputed which guest it was at each arrival mrs mandel had gone to her room to write letters after beseeching them not to stand there when kendricks came christine gave mela a little pinch equivalent to a little mocking shriek for on the ground of his long talk with mela at mrs horns in the absence of any other admirer they based a superstition of his interest in her when beaton came mela returned the pinch but awkwardly so that it hurt and then christine involuntarily struck her  frescobaldis men were in possession everywhere they had turned the cook out of her kitchen and the waitress out of her pantry the reluctant irishman at the door was supplemented by a vivid italian who spoke french with the guests and said bien monsieur and toute suite and merci to all as he took their hats and coats and effused a hospitality that needed no language but the gleam of his eyes and teeth and the play of his eloquent hands from his professional dresscoat lustrous with the grease spotted on it at former dinners and parties they passed to the frocks of the elder and younger dryfoos in the drawingroom which assumed informality for the affair but did not put their wearers wholly at their ease the fathers coat was of black broadcloth and he wore it unbuttoned the skirts were long and the sleeves came down to his knuckles he shook hands with his guests and the same dryness seemed to be in his palm and throat as he huskily asked each to take a chair conrads coat was of modern texture and cut and was buttoned about him as if it concealed a bad conscience within its lapels he met march with his entreating smile and he seemed no more capable of coping with the situation than his father they both waited for fulkerson who went about and did his best to keep life in the party during the halfhour that passed before they sat down at dinner beaton stood gloomily aloof as if waiting to be approached on the right basis before yielding an inch of his ground colonel woodburn awaiting the moment when he could sally out on his hobby kept himself intrenched within the dignity of a gentleman and examined askance the figure of old lindau as he stared about the room with his fine head up and his empty sleeve dangling over his wrist march felt obliged to him for wearing a new coat in the midst of that hostile luxury and he was glad to see dryfoos make up to him and begin to talk with him as if he wished to show him particular respect though it might have been because he was less afraid of him than of the others he heard lindau saying boat the name is choarman and dryfoos beginning to explain his pennsylvania dutch origin and he suffered himself with a sigh of relief to fall into talk with kendricks who was always pleasant he was willing to talk about something besides himself and had no opinions that he was not ready to hold in abeyance for the time being out of kindness to others in that group of impassioned individualities march felt him a refuge and comfortwith his harmless dilettante intention of some day writing a novel and his belief that he was meantime collecting material for it  fulkerson while breaking the ice for the whole company was mainly engaged in keeping colonel woodburn thawed out he took kendricks away from march and presented him to the colonel as a person who like himself was looking into social conditions he put one hand on kendrickss shoulder and one on the colonels and made some flattering joke apparently at the expense of the young fellow and then left them march heard kendricks protest in vain and the colonel say gravely i do not wonder sir that these things interest you they constitute a problem which society must solve or which will dissolve society and he knew from that formula which the colonel had once used with him that he was laying out a road for the exhibition of the hobbys paces later  fulkerson came back to march who had turned toward conrad dryfoos and said if we dont get this thing going pretty soon it ll be the death of me and just then frescobaldis butler came in and announced to dryfoos that dinner was served the old man looked toward fulkerson with a troubled glance as if he did not know what to do he made a gesture to touch lindaus elbow fulkerson called out heres colonel woodburn mr dryfoos as if dryfoos were looking for him and he set the example of what he was to do by taking lindaus arm himself mr lindau is going to sit at my end of the table alongside of march stand not upon the order of your going gentlemen but fall in at once he contrived to get dryfoos and the colonel before him and he let march follow with kendricks conrad came last with beaton who had been turning over the music at the piano and chafing inwardly at the whole affair at the table colonel woodburn was placed on dryfooss right and march on his left march sat on fulkersons right with lindau next him and the young men occupied the other seats  put you next to march mr lindau said fulkerson so you can begin to put apollinaris in his champagneglass at the right moment you know his little weakness of old sorry to say its grown on him  march laughed with kindly acquiescence in fulkersons wish to start the gayety and lindau patted him on the shoulder i know hiss veakness if he liges a class of vine it iss begause his loaf ingludes efen hiss enemy as shakespeare galled it  ah but shakespeare couldnt have been thinking of champagne said kendricks  i suppose sir colonel woodburn interposed with lofty courtesy champagne could hardly have been known in his day  i suppose not colonel returned the younger man deferentially he seemed to think that sack and sugar might be a fault but he didnt mention champagne  perhaps he felt there was no question about that suggested beaton who then felt that he had not done himself justice in the sally  i wonder just when champagne did come in said march  i know when it ought to come in said fulkerson before the soup  they all laughed and gave themselves the air of drinking champagne out of tumblers every day as men like to do dryfoos listened uneasily he did not quite understand the allusions though he knew what shakespeare was well enough conrads face expressed a gentle deprecation of joking on such a subject but he said nothing  the talk ran on briskly through the dinner the young men tossed the ball back and forth they made some wild shots but they kept it going and they laughed when they were hit the wine loosed colonel woodburns tongue he became very companionable with the young fellows with the feeling that a literary dinner ought to have a didactic scope he praised scott and addison as the only authors fit to form the minds of gentlemen  kendricks agreed with him but wished to add the name of flaubert as a master of style style you know he added is the man  very true sir you are quite right sir the colonel assented he wondered who flaubert was  beaton praised baudelaire and maupassant he said these were the masters he recited some lurid verses from baudelaire lindau pronounced them a disgrace to human nature and gave a passage from victor hugo on louis napoleon with his heavy german accent and then he quoted schiller ach boat that is a peaudifool not zo he demanded of march  yes beautiful but of course you know i think theres nobody like heine  lindau threw back his great old head and laughed showing a want of teeth under his mustache he put his hand on marchs back this poyhe was a poy denwars so gracy to pekin reading heine that he gommence with the tictionary bevore he knows any grammar and ve bick it out vort by vort togeder  he was a pretty cay poy in those days heigh lindau asked fulkerson burlesquing the old mans accent with an impudent wink that made lindau himself laugh but in the dark ages i mean there in indianapolis just how long ago did you old codgers meet there anyway fulkerson saw the restiveness in dryfooss eye at the purely literary course the talk had taken he had intended it to lead up that way to business to every other week but he saw that it was leaving dryfoos too far out and he wished to get it on the personal ground where everybody is at home  ledt me zee mused lindau wass it in fiftynine or zixty passil idt wass a year or dwo pefore the war proke oudt anyway  those were exciting times said dryfoos making his first entry into the general talk i went down to indianapolis with the first company from our place and i saw the redshirts pouring in everywhere they had a song    oh never mind the weather but git over double trouble    for were bound for the land of canaan  the fellows locked arms and went singin it up and down four or five abreast in the moonlight crowded everybody else off the sidewalk  i remember i remember said lindau nodding his head slowly up and down a coodt many off them nefer gome pack from that landt of ganaan mr dryfoos  youre right mr lindau but i reckon it was worth itthe country weve got now here young man he caught the arm of the waiter who was going round with the champagne bottle fill up mr lindaus glass there i want to drink the health of those old times with him heres to your empty sleeve mr lindau god bless it no offence to you colonel woodburn said dryfoos turning to him before he drank  not at all sir not at all said the colonel i will drink with you if you will permit me  well all drinkstanding cried fulkerson help march to get up somebody fill high the bowl with samian apollinaris for coonrod now then hurrah for lindau  they cheered and hammered on the table with the butts of their knifehandles lindau remained seated the tears came into his eyes he said i thank you chendlemen and hiccoughed  id a went into the war myself said dryfoos but i was raisin a family of young children and i didnt see how i could leave my farm but i helped to fill up the quota at every call and when the volunteering stopped i went round with the subscription paper myself and we offered as good bounties as any in the state my substitute was killed in one of the last skirmishesin fact after lees surrenderand ive took care of his family more or less ever since  bytheway march said fulkerson what sort of an idea would it be to have a good war storymight be a serialin the magazine the war has never fully panned out in fiction yet it was used a good deal just after it was over and then it was dropped i think its time to take it up again i believe it would be a card  it was running in marchs mind that dryfoos had an old rankling shame in his heart for not having gone into the war and that he had often made that explanation of his course without having ever been satisfied with it he felt sorry for him the fact seemed pathetic it suggested a dormant nobleness in the man  beaton was saying to fulkerson you might get a series of sketches by substitutes the substitutes havent been much heard from in the war literature how would the autobiography of a substitute do you might follow him up to the moment he was killed in the other mans place and inquire whether he had any right to the feelings of a hero when he was only hired in the place of one might call it the career of a deputy hero  i fancy said march that there was a great deal of mixed motive in the men who went into the war as well as in those who kept out of it we canonized all that died or suffered in it but some of them must have been selfseeking and lowminded like men in other vocations he found himself saying this in dryfooss behalf the old man looked at him gratefully at first he thought and then suspiciously  lindau turned his head toward him and said you are righdt passil you are righdt i haf zeen on the fieldt of pattle the voarst eggsipitions of human pasenesschelousy fanity ecodistic bridte i haf zeen men in the face off death itself gofferned by motifes as low asas pusiness motifes  well said fulkerson it would be a grand thing for every other week if we could get some of those ideas worked up into a series it would make a lot of talk  colonel woodburn ignored him in saying i think major lindau  high brifate prefet gorporal the old man interrupted in rejection of the title  hendricks laughed and said with a glance of appreciation at lindau brevet corporal is good  colonel woodburn frowned a little and passed over the joke i think mr lindau is right such exhibitions were common to both sides though if you gentlemen will pardon me for saying so i think they were less frequent on ours we were fighting more immediately for existence we were fewer than you were and we knew it we felt more intensely that if each were not for all then none was for any  the colonels words made their impression dryfoos said with authority that is so  colonel woodburn fulkerson called out if youll work up those ideas into a short papersay three thousand wordsill engage to make march take it  the colonel went on without replying but mr lindau is right in characterizing some of the motives that led men to the cannons mouth as no higher than business motives and his comparison is the most forcible that he could have used i was very much struck by it  the hobby was out the colonel was in the saddle with so firm a seat that no effort sufficed to dislodge him the dinner went on from course to course with barbaric profusion and from time to time fulkerson tried to bring the talk back to every other week but perhaps because that was only the ostensible and not the real object of the dinner which was to bring a number of men together under dryfooss roof and make them the witnesses of his splendor make them feel the power of his wealth fulkersons attempts failed the colonel showed how commercialism was the poison at the heart of our national life how we began as a simple agricultural people who had fled to these shores with the instinct divinely implanted of building a state such as the sun never shone upon before how we had conquered the wilderness and the savage how we had flung off in our struggle with the mothercountry the trammels of tradition and precedent and had settled down a free nation to the practice of the arts of peace how the spirit of commercialism had stolen insidiously upon us and the infernal impulse of competition had embroiled us in a perpetual warfare of interests developing the worst passions of our nature and teaching us to trick and betray and destroy one another in the strife for money till now that impulse had exhausted itself and we found competition gone and the whole economic problem in the hands of monopoliesthe standard oil company the sugar trust the rubber trust and what not and now what was the next thing affairs could not remain as they were it was impossible and what was the next thing  the company listened for the main part silently dryfoos tried to grasp the idea of commercialism as the colonel seemed to hold it he conceived of it as something like the drygoods business on a vast scale and he knew he had never been in that he did not like to hear competition called infernal he had always supposed it was something sacred but he approved of what colonel woodburn said of the standard oil company it was all true the standard oil has squeezed dryfoos once and made him sell it a lot of oilwells by putting down the price of oil so low in that region that he lost money on every barrel he pumped  all the rest listened silently except lindau at every point the colonel made against the present condition of things he said more and more fiercely you are righdt you are righdt his eyes glowed his hand played with his knifehilt when the colonel demanded and what is the next thing he threw himself forward and repeated yes sir what is the next thing  natural gas by thunder shouted fulkerson  one of the waiters had profited by lindaus posture to lean over him and put down in the middle of the table a structure in white sugar it expressed frescobaldis conception of a derrick and a touch of nature had been added in the flame of brandy which burned luridly up from a small pit in the centre of the base and represented the gas in combustion as it issued from the ground fulkerson burst into a roar of laughter with the words that recognized frescobaldis personal tribute to dryfoos everybody rose and peered over at the thing while he explained the work of sinking a gaswell as he had already explained it to frescobaldi in the midst of his lecture he caught sight of the caterer himself where he stood in the pantry doorway smiling with an artists anxiety for the effect of his masterpiece  come in come in frescobaldi we want to congratulate you fulkerson called to him here gentlemen heres frescobaldis health  they all drank and frescobaldi smiling brilliantly and rubbing his hands as he bowed right and left permitted himself to say to dryfoos you are please no you like  firstrate firstrate said the old man but when the italian had bowed himself out and his guests had sunk into their seats again he said dryly to fulkerson i reckon they didnt have to torpedo that well or the derrick wouldnt look quite so nice and clean  yes fulkerson answered and that aint quite the stylethat little wigglywaggly blue flamethat the gas acts when you touch off a good vein of it this might do for weak gas and he went on to explain  they call it weak gas when they tap it two or three hundred feet down and anybody can sink a well in his back yard and get enough gas to light and heat his house i remember one fellow that had it blazing up from a pipe through a flowerbed just like a jet of water from a fountain my my my you felyou gentlemenought to go out and see that country all of you wish we could torpedo this well mr dryfoos and let em see how it works mind that one you torpedoed for me you know when they sink a well he went on to the company they cant always most generally sometimes tell whether theyre goin to get gas or oil or salt water why when they first began to bore for salt water out on the kanawha back about the beginning of the century they used to get gas now and then and then they considered it a failure they called a gaswell a blower and give it up in disgust the time wasnt ripe for gas yet now they bore away sometimes till they get halfway to china and dont seem to strike anything worth speaking of then they put a dynamite torpedo down in the well and explode it they have a little bar of iron that they call a godevil and they just drop it down on the business end of the torpedo and then stand from under if you please you hear a noise and in about half a minute you begin to see one and it begins to rain oil and mud and salt water and rocks and pitchforks and adoptive citizens and when it clears up the derricks paintedgot a coat on that ll wear in any climate thats what our honored host meant generally get some visiting lady when theres one round to drop the godevil but that day we had to put up with conrad here they offered to let me drop it but i declined i told em i hadnt much practice with godevils in the newspaper syndicate business and i wasnt very well myself anyway astonishing fulkerson continued with the air of relieving his explanation by an anecdote how reckless they get using dynamite when theyre torpedoing wells we stopped at one place where a fellow was handling the cartridges pretty freely and mr dryfoos happened to caution him a little and that ass came up with one of em in his hand and began to pound it on the buggywheel to show us how safe it was i turned green i was so scared but mr dryfoos kept his color and kind of coaxed the fellow till he quit you could see he was the fool kind that if you tried to stop him hed keep on hammering that cartridge just to show that it wouldnt explode till he blew you into kingdom come when we got him to go away mr dryfoos drove up to his foreman pay sheney off and discharge him on the spot says he hes too safe a man to have round he knows too much about dynamite i never saw anybody so cool  dryfoos modestly dropped his head under fulkersons flattery and without lifting it turned his eyes toward colonel woodburn i had all sorts of men to deal with in developing my property out there but i had very little trouble with them generally speaking  ah ah you foundt the laboringman reasonabledractabletocile lindau put in  yes generally speaking dryfoos answered they mostly knew which side of their bread was buttered i did have one little difficulty at one time it happened to be when mr fulkerson was out there some of the men tried to form a union  no no cried fulkerson let me tell that i know you wouldnt do yourself justice mr dryfoos and i want em to know how a strike can be managed if you take it in time you see some of those fellows got a notion that there ought to be a union among the workingmen to keep up wages and dictate to the employers and mr dryfooss foreman was the ringleader in the business they understood pretty well that as soon as he found it out that foreman would walk the plank and so they watched out till they thought they had mr dryfoos just where they wanted himeverything on the keen jump and every man worth his weight in diamondsand then they came to him andtold him to sign a promise to keep that foreman to the end of the season or till he was through with the work on the dryfoos and hendry addition under penalty of having them all knock off mr dryfoos smelled a mouse but he couldnt tell where the mouse was he saw that they did have him and he signed of course there wasnt anything really against the fellow anyway he was a firstrate man and he did his duty every time only hed got some of those ideas into his head and they turned it mr dryfoos signed and then he laid low  march saw lindau listening with a mounting intensity and heard him murmur in german shameful shameful  fulkerson went on well it wasnt long before they began to show their hand but mr dryfoos kept dark he agreed to everything there never was such an obliging capitalist before there wasnt a thing they asked of him that he didnt do with the greatest of pleasure and all went merry as a marriagebell till one morning a whole gang of fresh men marched into the dryfoos and hendry addition under the escort of a dozen pinkertons with repeating rifles at halfcock and about fifty fellows found themselves out of a job you never saw such a mad set  pretty neat said kendricks who looked at the affair purely from an aesthetic point of view such a coup as that would tell tremendously in a play  that was vile treason said lindau in german to march hes an infamous traitor i cannot stay here i must go  he struggled to rise while march held him by the coat and implored him under his voice for heavens sake dont lindau you owe it to yourself not to make a scene if you come here something in it all affected him comically he could not help laughing  the others were discussing the matter and seemed not to have noticed lindau who controlled himself and sighed you are right i must have patience  beaton was saying to dryfoos pity your pinkertons couldnt have given them a few shots before they left  no that wasnt necessary said dryfoos i succeeded in breaking up the union i entered into an agreement with other parties not to employ any man who would not swear that he was nonunion if they had attempted violence of course they could have been shot but there was no fear of that those fellows can always be depended upon to cut one anothers throats in the long run  but sometimes said colonel woodburn who had been watching throughout for a chance to mount his hobby again they make a good deal of trouble first how was it in the great railroad strike of 77  well i guess there was a little trouble that time colonel said fulkerson but the men that undertake to override the laws and paralyze the industries of a country like this generally get left in the end  yes sir generally and up to a certain point always but its the exceptional that is apt to happen as well as the unexpected and a little reflection will convince any gentleman here that there is always a danger of the exceptional in your system the fact is those fellows have the game in their own hands already a strike of the whole body of the brotherhood of engineers alone would starve out the entire atlantic seaboard in a week labor insurrection could make head at a dozen given points and your government couldnt move a man over the roads without the help of the engineers  that is so said kendrick struck by the dramatic character of the conjecture he imagined a fiction dealing with the situation as something already accomplished  why dont some fellow do the battle of dorking act with that thing said fulkerson it would be a card  exactly what i was thinking mr fulkerson said kendricks  fulkerson laughed telepathyclear case of mind transference better see march here about it id like to have it in every other week it would make talk  perhaps it might set your people to thinking as well as talking said the colonel  well sir said dryfoos setting his lips so tightly together that his imperial stuck straight outward if i had my way there wouldnt be any brotherhood of engineers nor any other kind of labor union in the whole country  what shouted lindau you would sobbress the unionss of the voarkingmen  yes i would  and what would you do with the unionss of the gabidaliststhe drostsand gompines and boolss would you dake the righdt from one and gif it to the odder  yes sir i would said dryfoos with a wicked look at him  lindau was about to roar back at him with some furious protest but march put his hand on his shoulder imploringly and lindau turned to him to say in german but it is infamousinfamous what kind of man is this who is he he has the heart of a tyrant  colonel woodburn cut in you couldnt do that mr dryfoos under your system and if you attempted it with your conspiracy laws and that kind of thing it might bring the climax sooner than you expected your commercialized society has built its house on the sands it will have to go but i should be sorry if it went before its time  you are righdt sir said lindau it would be a bity i hobe it will last till it feelss its rottenness like herodt boat when its hour gomes when it trope to bieces with the veight off its own gorrubtionwhat then  its not to be supposed that a system of things like this can drop to pieces of its own accord like the old republic of venice said the colonel but when the last vestige of commercial society is gone then we can begin to build anew and we shall build upon the central idea not of the false liberty you now worship but of responsibilityresponsibility the enlightened the moneyed the cultivated class shall be responsible to the central authorityemperor duke president the name does not matterfor the national expense and the national defence and it shall be responsible to the workingclasses of all kinds for homes and lands and implements and the opportunity to labor at all times  the workingclasses shall be responsible to the leisure class for the support of its dignity in peace and shall be subject to its command in war the rich shall warrant the poor against planless production and the ruin that now follows against danger from without and famine from within and the poor  no no no shouted lindau the state shall do thatthe whole beople the men who voark shall have and shall eat and the men that will not voark they shall sdarfe but no man need sdarfe he will go to the state and the state will see that he haf voark and that he haf foodt all the roadts and mills and mines and landts shall be the beoples and be ron by the beople for the beople there shall be no rich and no boor and there shall not be war any more for what bower wouldt dare to addack a beople bound togeder in a broderhood like that  lion and lamb act said fulkerson not well knowing after so much champagne what words he was using  no one noticed him and colonel woodburn said coldly to lindau you are talking paternalism sir  and you are dalking feutalism retorted the old man  the colonel did not reply a silence ensued which no one broke till fulkerson said well now look here if either one of these millenniums was brought about by force of arms or otherwise what would become of every other week who would want march for an editor how would beaton sell his pictures who would print mr kendrickss little society verses and short stories what would become of conrad and his good works those named grinned in support of fulkersons diversion but lindau and the colonel did not speak dryfoos looked down at his plate frowning  a waiter came round with cigars and fulkerson took one ah he said as he bit off the end and leaned over to the emblematic masterpiece where the brandy was still feebly flickering i wonder if theres enough natural gas left to light my cigar his effort put the flame out and knocked the derrick over it broke in fragments on the table fulkerson cackled over the ruin i wonder if all moffitt will look that way after labor and capital have fought it out together i hope this aint ominous of anything personal dryfoos  ill take the risk of it said the old man harshly  he rose mechanically and fulkerson said to frescobaldis man you can bring us the coffee in the library  the talk did not recover itself there landau would not sit down he refused coffee and dismissed himself with a haughty bow to the company colonel woodburn shook hands elaborately all round when he had smoked his cigar the others followed him it seemed to march that his own goodnight from dryfoos was dry and cold     vii  march met fulkerson on the steps of the office next morning when he arrived rather later than his wont fulkerson did not show any of the signs of suffering from the last nights pleasure which painted themselves in marchs face he flirted his hand gayly in the air and said hows your poor head and broke into a knowing laugh you dont seem to have got up with the lark this morning the old gentleman is in there with conrad as bright as a biscuit hes beat you down well we did have a good time didnt we and old lindau and the colonel didnt they have a good time i dont suppose they ever had a chance before to give their theories quite so much air oh my how they did ride over us im just going down to see beaton about the cover of the christmas number i think we ought to try it in three or four colors if we are going to observe the day at all he was off before march could pull himself together to ask what dryfoos wanted at the office at that hour of the morning he always came in the afternoon on his way uptown  the fact of his presence renewed the sinister misgivings with which march had parted from him the night before but fulkersons cheerfulness seemed to gainsay them afterward march did not know whether to attribute this mood to the slipperiness that he was aware of at times in fulkerson or to a cynical amusement he might have felt at leaving him alone to the old man who mounted to his room shortly after march had reached it  a sort of dumb anger showed itself in his face his jaw was set so firmly that he did not seem able at once to open it he asked without the ceremonies of greeting what does that onearmed dutchman do on this book  what does he do march echoed as people are apt to do with a question that is mandatory and offensive  yes sir what does he do does he write for it  i suppose you mean lindau said march he saw no reason for refusing to answer dryfooss demand and he decided to ignore its terms no he doesnt write for it in the usual way he translates for it he examines the foreign magazines and draws my attention to anything he thinks of interest but i told you about this before  i know what you told me well enough and i know what he is he is a redmouthed labor agitator hes one of those foreigners that come here from places where theyve never had a decent meals victuals in their lives and as soon as they get their stomachs full they begin to make trouble between our people and their hands theres where the strikes come from and the unions and the secret societies they come here and break our sabbath and teach their atheism they ought to be hung let em go back if they dont like it over here they want to ruin the country  march could not help smiling a little at the words which came fast enough now in the hoarse staccato of dryfooss passion i dont know whom you mean by they generally speaking but i had the impression that poor old lindau had once done his best to save the country i dont always like his way of talking but i know that he is one of the truest and kindest souls in the world and he is no more an atheist than i am he is my friend and i cant allow him to be misunderstood  i dont care what he is dryfoos broke out i wont have him round he cant have any more work from this office i want you to stop it i want you to turn him off  march was standing at his desk as he had risen to receive dryfoos when he entered he now sat down and began to open his letters  do you hear the old man roared at him i want you to turn him off  excuse me mr dryfoos said march succeeding in an effort to speak calmly i dont know you in such a matter as this my arrangements as editor of every other week were made with mr fulkerson i have always listened to any suggestion he has had to make  i dont care for mr fulkerson he has nothing to do with it retorted dryfoos but he seemed a little daunted by marchs position  he has everything to do with it as far as i am concerned march answered with a steadiness that he did not feel i know that you are the owner of the periodical but i cant receive any suggestion from you for the reason that i have given nobody but mr fulkerson has any right to talk with me about its management  dryfoos glared at him for a moment and demanded threateningly then you say you wont turn that old loafer off you say that i have got to keep on paying my money out to buy beer for a man that would cut my throat if he got the chance  i say nothing at all mr dryfoos march answered the blood came into his face and he added but i will say that if you speak again of mr lindau in those terms one of us must leave this room i will not hear you  dryfoos looked at him with astonishment then he struck his hat down on his head and stamped out of the room and down the stairs and a vague pity came into marchs heart that was not altogether for himself he might be the greater sufferer in the end but he was sorry to have got the better of that old man for the moment and he felt ashamed of the anger into which dryfooss anger had surprised him he knew he could not say too much in defence of lindaus generosity and unselfishness and he had not attempted to defend him as a political economist he could not have taken any ground in relation to dryfoos but that which he held and he felt satisfied that he was right in refusing to receive instructions or commands from him yet somehow he was not satisfied with the whole affair and not merely because his present triumph threatened his final advantage but because he felt that in his heat he had hardly done justice to dryfooss rights in the matter it did not quite console him to reflect that dryfoos had himself made it impossible he was tempted to go home and tell his wife what had happened and begin his preparations for the future at once but he resisted this weakness and kept mechanically about his work opening the letters and the manuscripts before him with that curious double action of the mind common in men of vivid imaginations it was a relief when conrad dryfoos having apparently waited to make sure that his father would not return came up from the countingroom and looked in on march with a troubled face  mr march he began i hope father hasnt been saying anything to you that you cant overlook i know he was very much excited and when he is excited he is apt to say things that he is sorry for  the apologetic attitude taken for dryfoos so different from any attitude the peremptory old man would have conceivably taken for himself made march smile oh no i fancy the boot is on the other leg i suspect ive said some things your father cant overlook conrad he called the young man by his christian name partly to distinguish him from his father partly from the infection of fulkersons habit and partly from a kindness for him that seemed naturally to express itself in that way  i know he didnt sleep last night after you all went away conrad pursued and of course that made him more irritable and he was tried a good deal by some of the things that mr lindau said  i was tried a good deal myself said march lindau ought never to have been there  no conrad seemed only partially to assent  i told mr fulkerson so i warned him that lindau would be apt to break out in some way it wasnt just to him and it wasnt just to your father to ask him  mr fulkerson had a good motive conrad gently urged he did it because he hurt his feelings that day about the pension  yes but it was a mistake he knew that lindau was inflexible about his principles as he calls them and that one of his first principles is to denounce the rich in season and out of season i dont remember just what he said last night and i really thought id kept him from breaking out in the most offensive way but your father seems very much incensed  yes i know said conrad  of course i dont agree with lindau i think there are as many good kind just people among the rich as there are among the poor and that they are as generous and helpful but lindau has got hold of one of those partial truths that hurt worse than the whole truth and  partial truth the young man interrupted didnt the saviour himself say how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god  why bless my soul cried march do you agree with lindau  i agree with the lord jesus christ said the young man solemnly and a strange light of fanaticism of exaltation came into his wide blue eyes and i believe he meant the kingdom of heaven upon this earth as well as in the skies  march threw himself back in his chair and looked at him with a kind of stupefaction in which his eye wandered to the doorway where he saw fulkerson standing it seemed to him a long time before he heard him saying hello hello whats the row conrad pitching into you on old lindaus account too  the young man turned and after a glance at fulkersons light smiling face went out as if in his present mood he could not bear the contact of that persiflant spirit  march felt himself getting provisionally very angry again excuse me fulkerson but did you know when you went out what mr dryfoos wanted to see me for  well no i didnt exactly said fulkerson taking his usual seat on a chair and looking over the back of it at march i saw he was on his car about something and i thought id better not monkey with him much i supposed he was going to bring you to book about old lindau somehow fulkerson broke into a laugh  march remained serious mr dryfoos he said willing to let the simple statement have its own weight with fulkerson and nothing more came in here and ordered me to discharge lindau from his employment on the magazineto turn him off as he put it  did he asked fulkerson with unbroken cheerfulness the old man is business every time well i suppose you can easily get somebody else to do lindaus work for you this town is just running over with halfstarved linguists what did you say  what did i say march echoed look here fulkerson you may regard this as a joke but i dont im not used to being spoken to as if i were the foreman of a shop and told to discharge a sensitive and cultivated man like lindau as if he were a drunken mechanic and if thats your idea of me  oh hello now march you mustnt mind the old mans way he dont mean anything by ithe dont know any better if you come to that  then i know better said march i refused to receive any instructions from mr dryfoos whom i dont know in my relations with every other week and i referred him to you  you did fulkerson whistled he owns the thing  i dont care who owns the thing said march my negotiations were with you alone from the beginning and i leave this matter with you what do you wish done about lindau  oh better let the old fool drop said fulkerson hell light on his feet somehow and it will save a lot of rumpus  and if i decline to let him drop  oh come now march dont do that fulkerson began  if i decline to let him drop march repeated what will you do  ill be dogged if i know what ill do said fulkerson i hope you wont take that stand if the old man went so far as to speak to you about it his mind is made up and we might as well knock under first as last  and do you mean to say that you would not stand by me in what i considered my dutyin a matter of principle  why of course march said fulkerson coaxingly i mean to do the right thing but dryfoos owns the magazine  he doesnt own me said march rising he has made the little mistake of speaking to me as if he did and whenmarch put on his hat and took his overcoat down from its nailwhen you bring me his apologies or come to say that having failed to make him understand they were necessary you are prepared to stand by me i will come back to this desk otherwise my resignation is at your service  he started toward the door and fulkerson intercepted him ah now look here march dont do that hang it all dont you see where it leaves me now you just sit down a minute and talk it over i can make you seei can show youwhy confound the old dutch beerbuzzer twenty of him wouldnt be worth the trouble hes makin let him go and the old man ll come round in time  i dont think weve understood each other exactly mr fulkerson said march very haughtily perhaps we never can but ill leave you to think it out  he pushed on and fulkerson stood aside to let him pass with a dazed look and a mechanical movement there was something comic in his rueful bewilderment to march who was tempted to smile but he said to himself that he had as much reason to be unhappy as fulkerson and he did not smile his indignation kept him hot in his purpose to suffer any consequence rather than submit to the dictation of a man like dryfoos he felt keenly the degradation of his connection with him and all his resentment of fulkersons original uncandor returned at the same time his heart ached with foreboding it was not merely the work in which he had constantly grown happier that he saw taken from him but he felt the misery of the man who stakes the security and plenty and peace of home upon some cast and knows that losing will sweep from him most that most men find sweet and pleasant in life he faced the fact which no good man can front without terror that he was risking the support of his family and for a point of pride of honor which perhaps he had no right to consider in view of the possible adversity he realized as every hireling must no matter how skillfully or gracefully the tie is contrived for his wearing that he belongs to another whose will is his law his indignation was shot with abject impulses to go back and tell fulkerson that it was all right and that he gave up to end the anguish of his struggle he quickened his steps so that he found he was reaching home almost at a run     viii  he must have made more clatter than he supposed with his key at the apartment door for his wife had come to let him in when he flung it open why basil she said whats brought you back are you sick youre all pale well no wonder this is the last of mr fulkersons dinners you shall go to youre not strong enough for it and your stomach will be all out of order for a week how hot you are and in a drip of perspiration now youll be sick she took his hat away which hung dangling in his hand and pushed him into a chair with tender impatience what is the matter has anything happened  everything has happened he said getting his voice after one or two husky endeavors for it and then he poured out a confused and huddled statement of the case from which she only got at the situation by prolonged crossquestioning  at the end she said i knew lindau would get you into trouble  this cut march to the heart isabel he cried reproachfully  oh i know she retorted and the tears began to come i dont wonder you didnt want to say much to me about that dinner at breakfast i noticed it but i thought you were just dull and so i didnt insist i wish i had now if you had told me what lindau had said i should have known what would have come of it and i could have advised you  would you have advised me march demanded curiously to submit to bullying like that and meekly consent to commit an act of cruelty against a man who had once been such a friend to me  it was an unlucky day when you met him i suppose we shall have to go and just when we bad got used to new york and begun to like it i dont know where we shall go now boston isnt like home any more and we couldnt live on two thousand there i should be ashamed to try im sure i dont know where we can live on it i suppose in some country village where there are no schools or anything for the children i dont know what theyll say when we tell them poor things  every word was a stab in marchs heart so weakly tender to his own his wifes tears after so much experience of the comparative lightness of the griefs that weep themselves out in women always seemed wrung from his own soul if his children suffered in the least through him he felt like a murderer it was far worse than he could have imagined the way his wife took the affair though he had imagined certain words or perhaps only looks from her that were bad enough he had allowed for trouble but trouble on his account a svmpathy that might burden and embarrass him but he had not dreamed of this merely domestic this petty this sordid view of their potential calamity which left him wholly out of the question and embraced only what was most crushing and desolating in the prospect he could not bear it he caught up his hat again and with some hope that his wife would try to keep him rushed out of the house he wandered aimlessly about thinking the same exhausting thoughts over and over till he found himself horribly hungry then he went into a restaurant for his lunch and when he paid he tried to imagine how he should feel if that were really his last dollar  he went home toward the middle of the afternoon basely hoping that fulkerson had sent him some conciliatory message or perhaps was waiting there for him to talk it over march was quite willing to talk it over now but it was his wife who again met him at the door though it seemed another woman than the one he had left weeping in the morning  i told the children she said in smiling explanation of his absence from lunch that perhaps you were detained by business i didnt know but you had gone back to the office  did you think i would go back there isabel asked march with a haggard look well if you say so i will go back and do what dryfoos ordered me to do im sufficiently cowed between him and you i can assure you  nonsense she said i approve of everything you did but sit down now and dont keep walking that way and let me see if i understand it perfectly of course i had to have my say out  she made him go all over his talk with dryfoos again and report his own language precisely from time to time as she got his points she said that was splendid good enough for him and oh im so glad you said that to him at the end she said  well now lets look at it from his point of view lets be perfectly just to him before we take another step forward  or backward march suggested ruefully the case is simply this he owns the magazine  of course  and he has a right to expect that i will consider his pecuniary interests  oh those detestable pecuniary interests dont you wish there wasnt any money in the world  yes or else that there was a great deal more of it and i was perfectly willing to do that i have always kept that in mind as one of my duties to him ever since i understood what his relation to the magazine was  yes i can bear witness to that in any court of justice youve done it a great deal more than i could basil and it was just the same way with those horrible insurance people  i know march went on trying to be proof against her flatteries or at least to look as if he did not deserve praise i know that what lindau said was offensive to him and i can understand how he felt that he had a right to punish it all i say is that he had no right to punish it through me  yes said mrs march askingly  if it had been a question of making every other week the vehicle of lindaus peculiar opinionsthough theyre not so very peculiar he might have got the most of them out of ruskini shouldnt have had any ground to stand on or at least then i should have had to ask myself whether his opinions would be injurious to the magazine or not  i dont see mrs march interpolated how they could hurt it much worse than colonel woodburns article crying up slavery  well said march impartially we could print a dozen articles praising the slavery its impossible to have back and it wouldnt hurt us but if we printed one paper against the slavery which lindau claims still exists some people would call us bad names and the countingroom would begin to feel it but that isnt the point lindaus connection with every other week is almost purely mechanical hes merely a translator of such stories and sketches as he first submits to me and it isnt at all a question of his opinions hurting us but of my becoming an agent to punish him for his opinions that is what i wouldnt do thats what i never will do  if you did said his wife i should perfectly despise you i didnt understand how it was before i thought you were just holding out against dryfoos because he took a dictatorial tone with you and because you wouldnt recognize his authority but now im with you basil every time as that horrid little fulkerson says but who would ever have supposed he would be so base as to side against you  i dont know said march thoughtfully that we had a right to expect anything else fulkersons standards are low theyre merely business standards and the good thats in him is incidental and something quite apart from his morals and methods hes naturally a generous and rightminded creature but life has taught him to truckle and trick like the rest of us  it hasnt taught you that basil  dont be so sure perhaps its only that im a poor scholar but i dont know really that i despise fulkerson so much for his course this morning as for his gross and fulsome flatteries of dryfoos last night i could hardly stomach it  his wife made him tell her what they were and then she said yes that was loathsome i couldnt have believed it of mr fulkerson  perhaps he only did it to keep the talk going and to give the old man a chance to say something march leniently suggested it was a worse effect because he didnt or couldnt follow up fulkersons lead  it was loathsome all the same his wife insisted its the end of mr fulkerson as far as im concerned  i didnt tell you before march resumed after a moment of my little interview with conrad dryfoos after his father left and now he went on to repeat what had passed between him and the young man  i suspect that he and his father had been having some words before the old man came up to talk with me and that it was that made him so furious  yes but what a strange position for the son of such a man to take do you suppose he says such things to his father  i dont know but i suspect that in his meek way conrad would say what he believed to anybody i suppose we must regard him as a kind of crank  poor young fellow he always makes me feel sad somehow he has such a pathetic face i dont believe i ever saw him look quite happy except that night at mrs horns when he was talking with miss vance and then he made me feel sadder than ever  i dont envy him the life he leads at home with those convictions of his i dont see why it wouldnt be as tolerable there for old lindau himself  well now said mrs march let us put them all out of our minds and see what we are going to do ourselves  they began to consider their ways and means and how and where they should live in view of marchs severance of his relations with every other week they had not saved anything from the first years salary they had only prepared to save and they had nothing solid but their two thousand to count upon but they built a future in which they easily lived on that and on what march earned with his pen he became a free lance and fought in whatever cause he thought just he had no ties no chains they went back to boston with the heroic will to do what was most distasteful they would have returned to their own house if they had not rented it again but any rate mrs march helped out by taking boarders or perhaps only letting rooms to lodgers they had some hard struggles but they succeeded  the great thing she said is to be right im ten times as happy as if you had come home and told me that you had consented to do what dryfoos asked and he had doubled your salary  i dont think that would have happened in any event said march dryly  well no matter i just used it for an example  they both experienced a buoyant relief such as seems to come to people who begin life anew on whatever terms i hope we are young enough yet basil she said and she would not have it when he said they had once been younger  they heard the childrens knock on the door they knocked when they came home from school so that their mother might let them in shall we tell them at once she asked and ran to open for them before march could answer  they were not alone fulkerson smiling from ear to ear was with them is march in he asked  mr march is at home yes she said very haughtily hes in his study and she led the way there while the children went to their rooms  well march fulkerson called out at sight of him its all right the old man has come down  i suppose if you gentlemen are going to talk business mrs march began  oh we dont want you to go away said fulkerson i reckon march has told you anyway  yes ive told her said march dont go isabel what do you mean fulkerson  hes just gone on up home and he sent me round with his apologies he sees now that he had no business to speak to you as he did and he withdraws everything hed a come round himself if id said so but i told him i could make it all right  fulkerson looked so happy in having the whole affair put right and the marches knew him to be so kindly affected toward them that they could not refuse for the moment to share his mood they felt themselves slipping down from the moral height which they had gained and march made a clutch to stay himself with the question and lindau  well said fulkerson hes going to leave lindau to me you wont have anything to do with it ill let the old fellow down easy  do you mean asked march that mr dryfoos insists on his being dismissed  why there isnt any dismissing about it fulkerson argued if you dont send him any more work he wont do any more thats all or if he comes round you canhes to be referred to me  march shook his head and his wife with a sigh felt herself plucked up from the soft circumstance of their lives which she had sunk back into so quickly and set beside him on that cold peak of principle again it wont do fulkerson its very good of you and all that but it comes to the same thing in the end i could have gone on without any apology from mr dryfoos he transcended his authority but thats a minor matter i could have excused it to his ignorance of life among gentlemen but i cant consent to lindaus dismissalit comes to that whether you do it or i do it and whether its a positive or a negative thingbecause he holds this opinion or that  but dont you see said fulkerson that its just lindaus opinions the old man cant stand he hasnt got anything against him personally i dont suppose theres anybody that appreciates lindau in some ways more than the old man does  i understand he wants to punish him for his opinions well i cant consent to that directly or indirectly we dont print his opinions and he has a perfect right to hold them whether mr dryfoos agrees with them or not  mrs march had judged it decorous for her to say nothing but she now went and sat down in the chair next her husband  ah dog on it cried fulkerson rumpling his hair with both his hands what am i to do the old man says hes got to go  and i dont consent to his going said march  and you wont stay if he goes  fulkerson rose well well ive got to see about it im afraid the old man wont stand it march i am indeed i wish youd reconsider iid take it as a personal favor if you would it leaves me in a fix you see ive got to side with one or the other  march made no reply to this except to say yes you must stand by him or you must stand by me  well well hold on awhile ill see you in the morning dont take any steps  oh there are no steps to take said march with a melancholy smile the steps are stopped thats all he sank back into his chair when fulkerson was gone and drew a long breath this is pretty rough i thought we had got through it  no said his wife it seems as if i had to make the fight all over again  well its a good thing its a holy war  i cant bear the suspense why didnt you tell him outright you wouldnt go back on any terms  i might as well and got the glory hell never move dryfoos i suppose we both would like to go back if we could  oh i suppose so  they could not regain their lost exaltation their lost dignity at dinner mrs march asked the children how they would like to go back to boston to live  why were not going are we asked tom without enthusiasm  i was just wondering how you felt about it now she said with an underlook at her husband  well if we go back said bella i want to live on the back bay its awfully micky at the south end  i suppose i should go to harvard said tom and id room out at cambridge it would be easier to get at you on the back bay  the parents smiled ruefully at each other and in view of these grand expectations of his children march resolved to go as far as he could in meeting dryfooss wishes he proposed the theatre as a distraction from the anxieties that he knew were pressing equally on his wife we might go to the old homestead he suggested with a sad irony which only his wife felt  oh yes lets cried bella  while they were getting ready some one rang and bella went to the door and then came to tell her father that it was mr lindau he says he wants to see you just a moment hes in the parlor and he wont sit down or anything  what can he want groaned mrs march from their common dismay  march apprehended a storm in the old mans face but he only stood in the middle of the room looking very sad and grave you are going oudt he said i wont geep you long i haf gome to pring pack dose macassines and dis mawney i cant do any more voark for you and i cant geep the mawney you haf baid me aready it iss not hawnest mawneythat hass been oarned py voark it iss mawney that hass peen mate py sbeculation and the obbression off lapor and the necessity of the boor py a manhere it is efery tollar efery zent dake it i feel as if dere vas ploodt on it  why lindau march began but the old man interrupted him  tont dalk to me passil i could not haf believedt it of you when you know how i feel about dose tings why tidnt you dell me whose mawney you bay oudt to me ach i tont plame youi tont rebroach you you haf nefer thought of it boat i have thought and i should be

not hoart hiss feelings boat i could not pear to douch him and hiss mawney iss like boison  march tried to reason with lindau to show him the folly the injustice the absurdity of his course it ended in their both getting angry and in lindaus going away in a whirl of german that included basil in the guilt of the man whom lindau called his master  well said mrs march he is a crank and i think youre well rid of him now you have no quarrel with that horrid old dryfoos and you can keep right on  yes said march i wish it didnt make me feel so sneaking what a long day its been it seems like a century since i got up  yes a thousand years is there anything else left to happen  i hope not id like to go to bed  why arent you going to the theatre wailed bella coming in upon her fathers desperate expression  the theatre oh yes certainly i meant after we got home and march amused himself at the puzzled countenance of the child come on is tom ready     ix  fulkerson parted with the marches in such trouble of mind that he did not feel able to meet that night the people whom he usually kept so gay at mrs leightons table he went to maronis for his dinner for this reason and for others more obscure he could not expect to do anything more with dryfoos at once he knew that dryfoos must feel that he had already made an extreme concession to march and he believed that if he was to get anything more from him it must be after dryfoos had dined but he was not without the hope vague and indefinite as it might be that he should find lindau at maronis and perhaps should get some concession from him some word of regret or apology which he could report to dryfoos and at lest make the means of reopening the affair with him perhaps lindau when he knew how matters stood would back down altogether and for marchs sake would withdraw from all connection with every other week himself and so leave everything serene fulkerson felt capable in his desperation of delicately suggesting such a course to lindau or even of plainly advising it he did not care for lindau a great deal and he did care a great deal for the magazine  but he did not find lindau at maronis he only found beaton he sat looking at the doorway as fulkerson entered and fulkerson naturally came and took a place at his table something in beatons largeeyed solemnity of aspect invited fulkerson to confidence and he said as he pulled his napkin open and strung it still a little damp as the scanty oftenwashed linen at maronis was apt to be across his knees i was looking for you this morning to talk with you about the christmas number and i was a good deal worked up because i couldnt find you but i guess i might as well have spared myself my emotions  why asked beaton briefly  well i dont know as theres going to be any christmas number  why beaton asked again  row between the financial angel and the literary editor about the chief translator and polyglot smeller  lindau  lindau is his name  what does the literary editor expect after lindaus expression of his views last night  i dont know what he expected but the ground he took with the old man was that as lindaus opinions didnt characterize his work on the magazine he would not be made the instrument of punishing him for them the old man wanted him turned off as he calls it  seems to be pretty good ground said beaton impartially while he speculated with a dull trouble at heart on the effect the row would have on his own fortunes his late visit home had made him feel that the claim of his family upon him for some repayment of help given could not be much longer delayed with his mother sick and his father growing old he must begin to do something for them but up to this time he had spent his salary even faster than he had earned it when fulkerson came in he was wondering whether he could get him to increase it if he threatened to give up his work and he wished that he was enough in love with margaret vance or even christine dryfoos to marry her only to end in the sorrowful conviction that he was really in love with alma leighton who had no money and who had apparently no wish to be married for love even and what are you going to do about it he asked listlessly  be dogged if i know what im going to do about it said fulkerson ive been round all day trying to pick up the piecesrow began right after breakfast this morningand one time i thought id got the thing all put together again i got the old man to say that he had spoken to march a little too authoritatively about lindau that in fact he ought to have communicated his wishes through me and that he was willing to have me get rid of lindau and march neednt have anything to do with it i thought that was pretty white but march says the apologies and regrets are all well enough in their way but they leave the main question where they found it  what is the main question beaton asked pouring himself out some chianti as he set the flask down he made the reflection that if he would drink water instead of chianti he could send his father three dollars a week on his back debts and he resolved to do it  the main question as march looks at it is the question of punishing lindau for his private opinions he says that if he consents to my bouncing the old fellow its the same as if he bounced him  it might have that complexion in some lights said beaton he drank off his chianti and thought he would have it twice a week or make maroni keep the halfbottles over for him and send his father two dollars and what are you going to do now  thats what i dont know said fulkerson ruefully after a moment he said desperately beaton youve got a pretty good head why dont you suggest something  why dont you let march go beaton suggested  ah i couldnt said fulkerson i got him to break up in boston and come here i like him nobody else could get the hang of the thing like he has hesa friend fulkerson said this with the nearest approach he could make to seriousness which was a kind of unhappiness  beaton shrugged oh if you can afford to have ideals i congratulate you theyre too expensive for me then suppose you get rid of dryfoos  fulkerson laughed forlornly go on bildad like to sprinkle a few ashes over my boils dont mind me  they both sat silent a little while and then beaton said i suppose you havent seen dryfoos the second time  no i came in here to gird up my loins with a little dinner before i tackled him but something seems to be the matter with maronis cook i dont want anything to eat  the cookings about as bad as usual said beaton after a moment he added ironically for he found fulkersons misery a kind of relief from his own and was willing to protract it as long as it was amusing why not try an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary  what do you mean  get that other old fool to go to dryfoos for you  which other old fool the old fools seem to be as thick as flies  that southern one  colonel woodburn  mmmmm  he did seem to rather take to the colonel fulkerson mused aloud  of course he did woodburn with his idiotic talk about patriarchal slavery is the man on horseback to dryfooss muddy imagination hed listen to him abjectly and hed do whatever woodburn told him to do beaton smiled cynically  fulkerson got up and reached for his coat and hat youve struck it old man the waiter came up to help him on with his coat fulkerson slipped a dollar in his hand never mind the coat you can give the rest of my dinner to the poor paolo beaton shake youve saved my life little boy though i dont think you meant it he took beatons hand and solemnly pressed it and then almost ran out of the door  they had just reached coffee at mrs leightons when he arrived and sat down with them and began to put some of the life of his new hope into them his appetite revived and after protesting that he would not take anything but coffee he went back and ate some of the earlier courses but with the pressure of his purpose driving him forward he did not conceal from miss woodburn at least that he was eager to get her apart from the rest for some reason when he accomplished this it seemed as if he had contrived it all himself but perhaps he had not wholly contrived it  im so glad to get a chance to speak to you alone he said at once and while she waited for the next word he made a pause and then said desperately i want you to help me and if you cant help me theres no help for me  mah goodness she said is the case so bad as that what in the woald is the trouble  yes its a bad case said fulkerson i want your father to help me  oh i thoat you said me  yes i want you to help me with your father i suppose i ought to go to him at once but im a little afraid of him  and you awe not afraid of me i dont think thats very flattering mr fulkerson you ought to think ahm twahce as awful as papa  oh i do you see im quite paralyzed before you and so i dont feel anything  well its a pretty lahvely kyand of paralysis butgo on  i willi will if i can only begin  pohaps ah maght begin fo you  no you cant lord knows id like to let you well its like this  fulkerson made a clutch at his hair and then after another hesitation he abruptly laid the whole affair before her he did not think it necessary to state the exact nature of the offence lindau had given dryfoos for he doubted if she could grasp it and he was profuse of his excuses for troubling her with the matter and of wonder at himself for having done so in the rapture of his concern at having perhaps made a fool of himself he forgot why he had told her but she seemed to like having been confided in and she said well ah dont see what you can do with you ahdeals of friendship except stand bah mr mawch  my ideals of friendship what do you mean  oh dont you suppose we know mr beaton said you we a pofect bahyard in friendship and you would sacrifice anything to it  is that so said fulkerson thinking how easily he could sacrifice lindau in this case he had never supposed before that he was chivalrous in such matters but he now began to see it in that light and he wondered that he could ever have entertained for a moment the idea of throwing march over  but ah most say miss woodburn went on ah dont envy you you next interview with mr dryfoos ah suppose youll have to see him at once aboat it  the conjecture recalled fulkerson to the object of his confidences ah theres where your help comes in ive exhausted all the influence i have with dryfoos  good gracious you dont expect ah could have any  they both laughed at the comic dismay with which she conveyed the preposterous notion and fulkerson said if i judged from myself i should expect you to bring him round instantly  oh thank you mr fulkerson she said with mock meekness  not at all but it isnt dryfoos i want you to help me with its your father i want your father to interview dryfoos for me and iim afraid to ask him  poo mr fulkerson she said and she insinuated something through her burlesque compassion that lifted him to the skies he swore in his heart that the woman never lived who was so witty so wise so beautiful and so good come raght with me this minute if the cyoasts clea she went to the door of the diningroom and looked in across its gloom to the little gallery where her father sat beside a lamp reading his evening paper mrs leighton could be heard in colloquy with the cook below and alma had gone to her room she beckoned fulkerson with the hand outstretched behind her and said go and ask him  alone he palpitated  oh what a cyowahd she cried and went with him ah suppose youll want me to tell him aboat it  well i wish youd begin miss woodburn he said the fact is you know ive been over it so much im kind of sick of the thing  miss woodburn advanced and put her hand on her fathers shoulder look heah papa mr fulkerson wants to ask you something and he wants me to do it fo him  the colonel looked up through his glasses with the sort of ferocity elderly men sometimes have to put on in order to keep their glasses from falling off his daughter continued hes got into an awful difficulty with his edito and his proprieto and he wants you to pacify them  i do not know whethah i understand the case exactly said the colonel but mr fulkerson may command me to the extent of my ability  you dont understand it aftah what ahve said cried the girl then ah dont see but what youll have to explain it youself mr fulkerson  well miss woodburn has been so luminous about it colonel said fulkerson glad of the joking shape she had given the affair that i can only throw in a little sidelight here and there  the colonel listened as fulkerson went on with a grave diplomatic satisfaction he felt gratified honored even he said by mr fulkersons appeal to him and probably it gave him something of the high joy that an affair of honor would have brought him in the days when he had arranged for meetings between gentlemen next to bearing a challenge this work of composing a difficulty must have been grateful but he gave no outward sign of his satisfaction in making a resume of the case so as to get the points clearly in his mind  i was afraid sir he said with the state due to the serious nature of the facts that mr lindau had given mr dryfoos offence by some of his questions at the dinnertable last night  perfect red rag to a bull fulkerson put in and then he wanted to withdraw his words at the colonels look of displeasure  i have no reflections to make upon mr landau colonel woodburn continued and fulkerson felt grateful to him for going on i do not agree with mr lindau i totally disagree with him on sociological points but the course of the conversation had invited him to the expression of his convictions and he had a right to express them so far as they had no personal bearing  of course said fulkerson while miss woodburn perched on the arm of her fathers chair  at the same time sir i think that if mr dryfoos felt a personal censure in mr lindaus questions concerning his suppression of the strike among his workmen he had a right to resent it  exactly fulkerson assented  but it must be evident to you sir that a highspirited gentleman like mr marchi confess that my feelings are with him very warmly in the mattercould not submit to dictation of the nature you describe  yes i see said fulkerson and with that strange duplex action of the human mind he wished that it was his hair and not her fathers that miss woodburn was poking apart with the corner of her fan  mr lindau the colonel concluded was right from his point of view and mr dryfoos was equally right the position of mr march is perfectly correct  his daughter dropped to her feet from his chairarm mah goodness if nobodys in the wrong ho awe you evah going to get the mattah straight  yes you see fulkerson added nobody can give in  pardon me said the colonel the case is one in which all can give in  i dont know which ll begin said fulkerson  the colonel rose mr lindau must begin sir we must begin by seeing mr lindau and securing from him the assurance that in the expression of his peculiar views he had no intention of offering any personal offence to mr dryfoos if i have formed a correct estimate of mr lindau this will be perfectly simple  fulkerson shook his head but it wouldnt help dryfoos dont care a rap whether lindau meant any personal offence or not as far as that is concerned hes got a hide like a hippopotamus but what he hates is lindaus opinions and what he says is that no man who holds such opinions shall have any work from him and what march says is that no man shall be punished through him for his opinions he dont care what they are  the colonel stood a moment in silence and what do you expect me to do under the circumstances  i came to you for advicei thought you might suggest  do you wish me to see mr dryfoos  well thats about the size of it fulkerson admitted you see colonel he hastened on i know that you have a great deal of influence with him that article of yours is about the only thing hes ever read in every other week and hes proud of your acquaintance well you knowand here fulkerson brought in the figure that struck him so much in beatons phrase and had been on his tongue ever sinceyoure the man on horseback to him and hed be more apt to do what you say than if anybody else said it  you are very good sir said the colonel trying to be proof against the flattery but i am afraid you overrate my influence fulkerson let him ponder it silently and his daughter governed her impatience by holding her fan against her lips whatever the process was in the colonels mind he said at last i see no good reason for declining to act for you mr fulkerson and i shall be very happy if i can be of service to you buthe stopped fulkerson from cutting in with precipitate thanksi think i have a right sir to ask what your course will be in the event of failure  failure fulkerson repeated in dismay  yes sir i will not conceal from you that this mission is one not wholly agreeable to my feelings  oh i understand that colonel and i assure you that i appreciate i  there is no use trying to blink the fact sir that there are certain aspects of mr dryfooss character in which he is not a gentleman we have alluded to this fact before and i need not dwell upon it now i may say however that my misgivings were not wholly removed last night  no fulkerson assented though in his heart he thought the old man had behaved very well  what i wish to say now is that i cannot consent to act for you in this matter merely as an intermediary whose failure would leave the affair in state quo  i see said fulkerson  and i should like some intimation some assurance as to which party your own feelings are with in the difference  the colonel bent his eyes sharply on fulkerson miss woodburn let hers fall fulkerson felt that he was being tested and he said to gain time as between lindau and dryfoos though he knew this was not the point  as between mr dryfoos and mr march said the colonel  fulkerson drew a long breath and took his courage in both hands there cant be any choice for me in such a case im for march every time  the colonel seized his hand and miss woodburn said if there had been any choice fo you in such a case i should never have let papa stir a step with you  why in regard to that said the colonel with a literal application of the idea was it your intention that we should both go  well i dont know i suppose it was  i think it will be better for me to go alone said the colonel and with a color from his experience in affairs of honor he added in these matters a principal cannot appear without compromising his dignity i believe i have all the points clearly in mind and i think i should act more freely in meeting mr dryfoos alone  fulkerson tried to hide the eagerness with which he met these agreeable views he felt himself exalted in some sort to the level of the colonels sentiments though it would not be easy to say whether this was through the desperation bred of having committed himself to marchs side or through the buoyant hope he had that the colonel would succeed in his mission  im not afraid to talk with dryfoos about it he said  there is no question of courage said the colonel it is a question of dignityof personal dignity  well dont let that delay you papa said his daughter following him to the door where she found him his hat and fulkerson helped him on with his overcoat ah shall be jost wald to know ho its toned oat  wont you let me go up to the house with you fulkerson began i neednt go in  i prefer to go alone said the colonel i wish to turn the points over in my mind and i am afraid you would find me rather dull company  he went out and fulkerson returned with miss woodburn to the drawingroom where she said the leightons were they were not there but she did not seem disappointed  well mr fulkerson she said you have got an ahdeal of friendship sure enough  me said fulkerson oh my lord dont you see i couldnt do anything else and im scared half to death anyway if the colonel dont bring the old man round i reckon its all up with me but hell fetch him and im just prostrated with gratitude to you miss woodburn  she waved his thanks aside with her fan what do you mean by its being all up with you  why if the old man sticks to his position and i stick to march weve both got to go overboard together dryfoos owns the magazine he can stop it or he can stop us which amounts to the same thing as far as were concerned  and then what the girl pursued  and then nothingtill we pick ourselves up  do you mean that mr dryfoos will put you both oat of your places  he may  and mr mawch takes the risk of that jost fo a principle  i reckon  and you do it jost fo an ahdeal  it wont do to own it i must have my little axe to grind somewhere  well men awe splendid sighed the girl ah will say it  oh theyre not so much better than women said fulkerson with a nervous jocosity i guess march would have backed down if it hadnt been for his wife she was as hot as pepper about it and you could see that she would have sacrificed all her husbands relations sooner than let him back down an inch from the stand he had taken its pretty easy for a man to stick to a principle if he has a woman to stand by him but when you come to play it alone  mr fulkerson said the girl solemnly ah will stand bah you in this if all the woald tones against you the tears came into her eyes and she put out her hand to him  you will he shouted in a rapture in every wayand alwaysas long as you live do you mean it he had caught her hand to his breast and was grappling it tight there and drawing her to him  the changing emotions chased one another through her heart and over her face dismay shame pride tenderness you dont believe she said hoarsely that ah meant that  no but i hope you do mean it for if you dont nothing else means anything  there was no space there was only a point of wavering ah do mean it  when they lifted their eyes from each other again it was halfpast ten no you most go she said  but the colonelour fate  the conel is often oat late and ahm not afraid of ouah fate no that weve taken it into ouah own hands she looked at him with dewy eyes of trust of inspiration  oh its going to come out all right he said it cant come out wrong now no matter what happens but whod have thought it when i came into this house in such a state of sin and misery half an hour ago  three houahs and a half ago she said no you most jost go ahm tahed to death goodnight you can come in the mawning to seepapa she opened the door and pushed him out with enrapturing violence and he ran laughing down the steps into her fathers arms  why colonel i was just going up to meet you he had really thought he would walk off his exultation in that direction  i am very sorry to say mr fulkerson the colonel began gravely that mr dryfoos adheres to his position  oh all right said fulkerson with unabated joy its what i expected well my course is clear i shall stand by march and i guess the world wont come to an end if he bounces us both but im everlastingly obliged to you colonel woodburn and i dont know what to say to you ii wont detain you now its so late ill see you in the morning goodni  fulkerson did not realize that it takes two to part the colonel laid hold of his arm and turned away with him i will walk toward your place with you i can understand why you should be anxious to know the particulars of my interview with mr dryfoos and in the statement which followed he did not spare him the smallest it outlasted their walk and detained them long on the steps of the every other week building but at the end fulkerson let himself in with his key as light of heart as if he had been listening to the gayest promises that fortune could make  by the time he met march at the office next morning a little but only a very little misgiving saddened his golden heaven he took marchs hand with high courage and said well the old man sticks to his point march he added with the sense of saying it before miss woodburn and i stick by you ive thought it all over and id rather be right with you than wrong with him  well i appreciate your motive fulkerson said march but perhapsperhaps we can save over our heroics for another occasion lindau seems to have got in with his for the present  he told him of lindaus last visit and they stood a moment looking at each other rather queerly fulkerson was the first to recover his spirits well he said cheerily that lets us out  does it im not sure it lets me out said march but he said this in tribute to his crippled selfrespect rather than as a forecast of any action in the matter  why what are you going to do fulkerson asked if lindau wont work for dryfoos you cant make him  march sighed what are you going to do with this money he glanced at the heap of bills he had flung on the table between them  fulkerson scratched his head ah dogged if i know cant we give it to the deserving poor somehow if we can find em  i suppose weve no right to use it in any way you must give it to dryfoos  to the deserving rich well you can always find them i reckon you dont want to appear in the transaction i dont either but i guess i must fulkerson gathered up the money and carried it to conrad he directed him to account for it in his books as consciencemoney and he enjoyed the joke more than conrad seemed to do when he was told where it came from  fulkerson was able to wear off the disagreeable impression the affair left during the course of the forenoon and he met miss woodburn with all a lovers buoyancy when he went to lunch she was as happy as he when he told her how fortunately the whole thing had ended and he took her view that it was a reward of his courage in having dared the worst they both felt as the newly plighted always do that they were in the best relations with the beneficent powers and that their felicity had been especially looked to in the disposition of events they were in a glow of rapturous content with themselves and radiant worship of each other she was sure that he merited the bright future opening to them both as much as if he owed it directly to some noble action of his own he felt that he was indebted for the favor of heaven entirely to the still incredible accident of her preference of him over other men  colonel woodburn who was not yet in the secret of their love perhaps failed for this reason to share their satisfaction with a result so unexpectedly brought about the blessing on their hopes seemed to his ignorance to involve certain sacrifices of personal feeling at which he hinted in suggesting that dryfoos should now be asked to make some abstract concessions and acknowledgments his daughter hastened to deny that these were at all necessary and fulkerson easily explained why the thing was over what was the use of opening it up again  perhaps none the colonel admitted but he added i should like the opportunity of taking mr lindaus hand in the presence of mr dryfoos and assuring him that i considered him a man of principle and a man of honora gentleman sir whom i was proud and happy to have known  well ahve no doabt said his daughter demurely that youll have the chance some day and we would all lahke to join you but at the same tahme ah think mr fulkerson is well oat of it fo the present   pg editors bookmarks      anticipative reprisal     buttoned about him as if it concealed a bad conscience     courtship     got their laugh out of too many things in life     had learned not to censure the irretrievable     had no opinions that he was not ready to hold in abeyance     ignorant of her ignorance     it dont do any good to look at its drawbacks all the time     justice must be paid for at every step in fees and costs     life has taught him to truckle and trick     mans willingness to abide in the present     no longer the gross appetite for novelty     no right to burden our friends with our decisions     travel with all its annoyances and fatigues     typical anything else is pretty difficult to find     part fifth     i  superficially the affairs of every other week settled into their wonted form again and for fulkerson they seemed thoroughly reinstated but march had a feeling of impermanency from what had happened mixed with a fantastic sense of shame toward lindau he did not sympathize with lindaus opinions he thought his remedy for existing evils as wildly impracticable as colonel woodburns but while he thought this and while he could justly blame fulkerson for lindaus presence at dryfooss dinner which his zeal had brought about in spite of marchs protests still he could not rid himself of the reproach of uncandor with lindau he ought to have told him frankly about the ownership of the magazine and what manner of man the man was whose money he was taking but he said that he never could have imagined that he was serious in his preposterous attitude in regard to a class of men who embody half the prosperity of the country and he had moments of revolt against his own humiliation before lindau in which he found it monstrous that he should return dryfooss money as if it had been the spoil of a robber his wife agreed with him in these moments and said it was a great relief not to have that tiresome old german coming about they had to account for his absence evasively to the children whom they could not very well tell that their father was living on money that lindau disdained to take even though lindau was wrong and their father was right this heightened mrs marchs resentment toward both lindau and dryfoos who between them had placed her husband in a false position if anything she resented dryfooss conduct more than lindaus he had never spoken to march about the affair since lindau had renounced his work or added to the apologetic messages he had sent by fulkerson so far as march knew dryfoos had been left to suppose that lindau had simply stopped for some reason that did not personally affect him they never spoke of him and march was too proud to ask either fulkerson or conrad whether the old man knew that lindau had returned his money he avoided talking to conrad from a feeling that if he did he should involuntarily lead him on to speak of his differences with his father between himself and fulkerson even he was uneasily aware of a want of their old perfect friendliness fulkerson had finally behaved with honor and courage but his provisional reluctance had given march the measure of fulkersons character in one direction and he could not ignore the fact that it was smaller than he could have wished  he could not make out whether fulkerson shared his discomfort or not it certainly wore away even with march as time passed and with fulkerson in the bliss of his fortunate love it was probably far more transient if it existed at all he advanced into the winter as radiantly as if to meet the spring and he said that if there were any pleasanter month of the year than november it was december especially when the weather was good and wet and muddy most of the time so that you had to keep indoors a long while after you called anywhere  colonel woodburn had the anxiety in view of his daughters engagement when she asked his consent to it that such a dreamer must have in regard to any reality that threatens to affect the course of his reveries he had not perhaps taken her marriage into account except as a remote contingency and certainly fulkerson was not the kind of soninlaw that he had imagined in dealing with that abstraction but because he had nothing of the sort definitely in mind he could not oppose the selection of fulkerson with success he really knew nothing against him and he knew many things in his favor fulkerson inspired him with the liking that every one felt for him in a measure he amused him he cheered him and the colonel had been so much used to leaving action of all kinds to his daughter that when he came to close quarters with the question of a soninlaw he felt helpless to decide it and he let her decide it as if it were still to be decided when it was submitted to him she was competent to treat it in all its phases not merely those of personal interest but those of duty to the broken southern past sentimentally dear to him and practically absurd to her no such south as he remembered had ever existed to her knowledge and no such civilization as he imagined would ever exist to her belief anywhere she took the world as she found it and made the best of it she trusted in fulkerson she had proved his magnanimity in a serious emergency and in small things she was willing fearlessly to chance it with him she was not a sentimentalist and there was nothing fantastic in her expectations she was a girl of good sense and right mind and she liked the immediate practicality as well as the final honor of fulkerson she did not idealize him but in the highest effect she realized him she did him justice and she would not have believed that she did him more than justice if she had sometimes known him to do himself less  their engagement was a fact to which the leighton household adjusted itself almost as simply as the lovers themselves miss woodburn told the ladies at once and it was not a thing that fulkerson could keep from march very long he sent word of it to mrs march by her husband and his engagement perhaps did more than anything else to confirm the confidence in him which had been shaken by his early behavior in the lindau episode and not wholly restored by his tardy fidelity to march but now she felt that a man who wished to get married so obviously and entirely for love was full of all kinds of the best instincts and only needed the guidance of a wife to become very noble she interested herself intensely in balancing the respective merits of the engaged couple and after her call upon miss woodburn in her new character she prided herself upon recognizing the worth of some strictly southern qualities in her while maintaining the general average of new england superiority she could not reconcile herself to the virginian custom illustrated in her having been christened with the surname of madison and she said that its pet form of mad which fulkerson promptly invented only made it more ridiculous  fulkerson was slower in telling beaton he was afraid somehow of beatons taking the matter in the cynical way miss woodburn said she would break off the engagement if beaton was left to guess it or find it out by accident and then fulkerson plucked up his courage beaton received the news with gravity and with a sort of melancholy meekness that strongly moved fulkersons sympathy and made him wish that beaton was engaged too  it made beaton feel very old it somehow left him behind and forgotten in a manner it made him feel trifled with something of the unfriendliness of fate seemed to overcast his resentment and he allowed the sadness of his conviction that he had not the means to marry on to tinge his recognition of the fact that alma leighton would not have wanted him to marry her if he had he was now often in that martyr mood in which he wished to help his father not only to deny himself chianti but to forego a furlined overcoat which he intended to get for the winter he postponed the moment of actual sacrifice as regarded the chianti and he bought the overcoat in an anguish of selfreproach he wore it the first evening after he got it in going to call upon the leightons and it seemed to him a piece of ghastly irony when alma complimented his picturesqueness in it and asked him to let her sketch him  oh you can sketch me he said with so much gloom that it made her laugh  if you think its so serious id rather not  no no go ahead how do you want me  oh fling yourself down on a chair in one of your attitudes of studied negligence and twist one corner of your mustache with affected absence of mind  and you think im always studied always affected  i didnt say so  i didnt ask you what you said  and i wont tell you what i think  ah i know what you think  what made you ask then the girl laughed again with the satisfaction of her sex in cornering a man  beaton made a show of not deigning to reply and put himself in the pose she suggested frowning  ah thats it but a little more animation    as when a great thought strikes along the brain    and flushes all the cheek  she put her forehead down on the back of her hand and laughed again you ought to be photographed you look as if you were sitting for it  beaton said thats because i know i am being photographed in one way i dont think you ought to call me affected i never am so with you i know it wouldnt be of any use  oh mr beaton you flatter  no i never flatter you  i meant you flattered yourself  how  oh i dont know imagine  i know what you mean you think i cant be sincere with anybody  oh no i dont  what do you think  that you canttry alma gave another victorious laugh  miss woodburn and fulkerson would once have both feigned a great interest in almas sketching beaton and made it the subject of talk in which they approached as nearly as possible the real interest of their lives now they frankly remained away in the diningroom which was very cozy after the dinner had disappeared the colonel sat with his lamp and paper in the gallery beyond mrs leighton was about her housekeeping affairs in the content she always felt when alma was with beaton  they seem to be having a pretty good time in there said fulkerson detaching himself from his own absolute good time as well as he could  at least alma does said miss woodburn  do you think she cares for him  quahte as moch as he desoves  what makes you all down on beaton around here hes not such a bad fellow  we awe not all doan on him mrs leighton isnt doan on him  oh i guess if it was the old lady there wouldnt be much question about it  they both laughed and alma said they seem to be greatly amused with something in there  me probably said beaton i seem to amuse everybody tonight  dont you always  i always amuse you im afraid alma  she looked at him as if she were going to snub him openly for using her name but apparently she decided to do it covertly you didnt at first i really used to believe you could be serious once  couldnt you believe it again now  not when you put on that windharp stop  wetmore has been talking to you about me he would sacrifice his best friend to a phrase he spends his time making them  hes made some very pretty ones about you  like the one you just quoted  no not exactly he admires you ever so much he says she stopped teasingly  what  he says you could be almost anything you wished if you didnt wish to be everything  that sounds more like the school of wetmore thats what you say alma well if there were something you wished me to be i could be it  we might adapt kingsley be good sweet man and let who will be clever he could not help laughing she went on i always thought that was the most patronizing and exasperating thing ever addressed to a human girl and weve had to stand a good deal in our time i should like to have it applied to the other sect a while as if any girl that was a girl would be good if she had the remotest chance of being clever  then you wouldnt wish me to be good beaton asked  not if you were a girl  you want to shock me well i suppose i deserve it but if i were onetenth part as good as you are alma i should have a lighter heart than i have now i know that im fickle but im not false as you think i am  who said i thought you were false  no one said beaton it isnt necessary when you look itlive it  oh dear i didnt know i devoted my whole time to the subject  i know im despicable i could tell you somethingthe history of this day eventhat would make you despise me beaton had in mind his purchase of the overcoat which alma was getting in so effectively with the money he ought to have sent his father but he went on darkly with a sense that what he was that moment suffering for his selfishness must somehow be a kind of atonement which would finally leave him to the guiltless enjoyment of the overcoat you wouldnt believe the depths of baseness i could descend to  i would try said alma rapidly shading the collar if youd give me some hint  beaton had a sudden wish to pour out his remorse to her but he was afraid of her laughing at him he said to himself that this was a very wholesome fear and that if he could always have her at hand he should not make a fool of himself so often a man conceives of such an office as the very noblest for a woman he worships her for it if he is magnanimous but beaton was silent and alma put back her head for the right distance on her sketch mr fulkerson thinks you are the sublimest of human beings for advising him to get colonel woodburn to interview mr dryfoos about lindau what have you ever done with your judas  i havent done anything with it nadel thought he would take hold of it at one time but he dropped it again after all i dont suppose it could be popularized fulkerson wanted to offer it as a premium to subscribers for every other week but i sat down on that  alma could not feel the absurdity of this and she merely said every other week seems to be going on just the same as ever  yes the trouble has all blown over i believe fulkerson said beaton with a return to what they were saying has managed the whole business very well but he exaggerates the value of my advice  very likely alma suggested vaguely or no excuse me he couldnt he couldnt she laughed delightedly at beatons foolish look of embarrassment  he tried to recover his dignity in saying hes a very good fellow and he deserves his happiness  oh indeed said alma perversely does any one deserve happiness  i know i dont sighed beaton  you mean you dont get it  i certainly dont get it  ah but that isnt the reason  what is  thats the secret of the universe she bit in her lower lip and looked at him with eyes of gleaming fun  are you never serious he asked  with serious people always  i am serious and you have the secret of my happiness he threw himself impulsively forward in his chair  oh pose pose she cried  i wont pose he answered and you have got to listen to me you know im in love with you and i know that once you cared for me cant that timewont itcome back again try to think so alma  no she said briefly and seriously enough  but that seems impossible what is it ive done what have you against me  nothing but that time is past i couldnt recall it if i wished why did you bring it up youve broken your word you know i wouldnt have let you keep coming here if you hadnt promised never to refer to it  how could i help it with that happiness near usfulkerson  oh its that i might have known it  no it isnt thatits something far deeper but if its nothing you have against me what is it alma that keeps you from caring for me now as you did then i havent changed  but i have i shall never care for you again mr beaton you might as well understand it once for all dont think its anything in yourself or that i think you unworthy of me im not so selfsatisfied as that i know very well that im not a perfect character and that ive no claim on perfection in anybody else i think women who want that are fools they wont get it and they dont deserve it but ive learned a good deal more about myself than i knew in st barnaby and a life of work of art and of art alone thats what ive made up my mind to  a woman thats made up her mind to that has no heart to hinder her  would a man have that had done so  but i dont believe you alma youre merely laughing at me and besides with me you neednt give up art we could work together you know how much i admire your talent i believe i could help itserve it i would be its willing slave and yours heaven knows  i dont want any slavenor any slavery i want to be free always now do you see i dont care for you and i never could in the old way but i should have to care for some one more than i believe i ever shall to give up my work shall we go on she looked at her sketch  no we shall not go on he said gloomily as he rose  i suppose you blame me she said rising too  oh no i blame no oneor only myself i threw my chance away  im glad you see that and im glad you did it you dont believe me of course why do men think life can be only the one thing to women and if you come to the selfish view who are the happy women im sure that if work doesnt fail me health wont and happiness wont  but you could work on with me  second fiddle do you suppose i shouldnt be woman enough to wish my work always less and lower than yours at least ive heart enough for that  youve heart enough for anything alma i was a fool to say you hadnt  i think the women who keep their hearts have an even chance at least of having heart  ah theres where youre wrong  but mine isnt mine to give you anyhow and now i dont want you ever to speak to me about this again  oh theres no danger he cried bitterly i shall never willingly see you again  thats as you like mr beaton weve had to be very frank but i dont see why we shouldnt be friends still we neednt if you dont like  and i may comei may come hereasas usual  why if you can consistently she said with a smile and she held out her hand to him  he went home dazed and feeling as if it were a bad joke that had been put upon him at least the affair went so deep that it estranged the aspect of his familiar studio some of the things in it were not very familiar he had spent lately a great deal on rugs on stuffs on japanese bricabrac when he saw these things in the shops he had felt that he must have them that they were necessary to him and he was partly in debt for them still without having sent any of his earnings to pay his father as he looked at them now he liked to fancy something weird and conscious in them as the silent witnesses of a broken life he felt about among some of the smaller objects on the mantel for his pipe before he slept he was aware in the luxury of his despair of a remote relief an escape and after all the understanding he had come to with alma was only the explicit formulation of terms long tacit between them beaton would have been puzzled more than he knew if she had taken him seriously it was inevitable that he should declare himself in love with her but he was not disappointed at her rejection of his love perhaps not so much as he would have been at its acceptance though he tried to think otherwise and to give himself airs of tragedy he did not really feel that the result was worse than what had gone before and it left him free  but he did not go to the leightons again for so long a time that mrs leighton asked alma what had happened alma told her  and he wont come any more her mother sighed with reserved censure  oh i think he will he couldnt very well come the next night but he has the habit of coming and with mr beaton habit is everythingeven the habit of thinking hes in love with some one  alma said her mother i dont think its very nice for a girl to let a young man keep coming to see her after shes refused him  why not if it amuses him and doesnt hurt the girl  but it does hurt her alma itits indelicate it isnt fair to him it gives him hopes  well mamma it hasnt happened in the given case yet if mr beaton comes again i wont see him and you can forbid him the house  if i could only feel sure alma said her mother taking up another branch of the inquiry that you really knew your own mind i should be easier about it  then you can rest perfectly quiet mamma i do know my own mind and whats worse i know mr beatons mind  what do you mean  i mean that he spoke to me the other night simply because mr fulkersons engagement had broken him all up  what expressions mrs leighton lamented  he let it out himself alma went on and you wouldnt have thought it was very flattering yourself when im made love to after this i prefer to be made love to in an offyear when there isnt another engaged couple anywhere about  did you tell him that alma  tell him that what do you mean mamma i may be indelicate but im not quite so indelicate as that  i didnt mean you were indelicate really alma but i wanted to warn you i think mr beaton was very much in earnest  oh so did he  and you didnt  oh yes for the time being i suppose hes very much in earnest with miss vance at times and with miss dryfoos at others sometimes hes a painter and sometimes hes an architect and sometimes hes a sculptor he has too many giftstoo many tastes  and if miss vance and miss dryfoos  oh do say sculpture and architecture mamma its getting so dreadfully personal  alma you know that i only wish to get at your real feeling in the matter  and you know that i dont want to let youespecially when i havent got any real feeling in the matter but i should thinkspeaking in the abstract entirelythat if either of those arts was ever going to be in earnest about him it would want his exclusive devotion for a week at least  i didnt know said mrs leighton that he was doing anything now at the others i thought he was entirely taken up with his work on every other week  oh he is he is  and you certainly cant say my dear that he hasnt been very kindvery useful to you in that matter  and so i ought to have said yes out of gratitude thank you mamma i didnt know you held me so cheap  you know whether i hold you cheap or not alma i dont want you to cheapen yourself i dont want you to trifle with any one i want you to be honest with yourself  well come now mamma suppose you begin ive been perfectly honest with myself and ive been honest with mr beaton i dont care for him and ive told him i didnt so he may be supposed to know it if he comes here after this hell come as a plain unostentatious friend of the family and its for you to say whether he shall come in that capacity or not i hope you wont trifle with him and let him get the notion that hes coming on any other basis  mrs leighton felt the comfort of the critical attitude far too keenly to abandon it for anything constructive she only said you know very well alma thats a matter i can have nothing to do with  then you leave him entirely to me  i hope you will regard his right to candid and open treatment  hes had nothing but the most open and candid treatment from me mamma its you that wants to play fast and loose with him and to tell you the truth i believe he would like that a good deal better i believe that if theres anything he hates its openness and candor alma laughed and put her arms round her mother who could not help laughing a little too     ii  the winter did not renew for christine and mela the social opportunity which the spring had offered after the musicale at mrs horns they both made their partycall as mela said in due season but they did not find mrs horn at home and neither she nor miss vance came to see them after people returned to town in the fall they tried to believe for a time that mrs horn had not got their cards this pretence failed them and they fell back upon their pride or rather christines pride mela had little but her goodnature to avail her in any exigency and if mrs horn or miss vance had come to call after a year of neglect she would have received them as amiably as if they had not lost a day in coming but christine had drawn a line beyond which they would not have been forgiven and she had planned the words and the behavior with which she would have punished them if they had appeared then neither sister imagined herself in anywise inferior to them but christine was suspicious at least and it was mela who invented the hypothesis of the lost cards as nothing happened to prove or to disprove the fact she said i move we put coonrod up to gittun it out of miss vance at some of their meetuns  if you do said christine ill kill you  christine however had the visits of beaton to console her and if these seemed to have no definite aim she was willing to rest in the pleasure they gave her vanity but mela had nothing sometimes she even wished they were all back on the farm  it would be the best thing for both of you said mrs dryfoos in answer to such a burst of desperation i dont think new york is any place for girls  well what i hate mother said mela is it dont seem to be any place for young men either she found this so good when she had said it that she laughed over it till christine was angry  a body would think there had never been any joke before  i dont see as its a joke said mrs dryfoos its the plain truth  oh dont mind her mother said mela shes put out because her old mr beaton hart been round for a couple o weeks if you dont watch out that fellow ll give you the slip yit christine after all your pains  well there aint anybody to give you the slip mela christine clawed back  no i hant ever set my traps for anybody this was what mela said for want of a better retort but it was not quite true when kendricks came with beaton to call after her fathers dinner she used all her cunning to ensnare him and she had him to herself as long as beaton stayed dryfoos sent down word that he was not very well and had gone to bed the novelty of mela had worn off for kendricks and she found him as she frankly told him not half as entertaining as he was at mrs horns but she did her best with him as the only flirtable material which had yet come to her hand it would have been her ideal to have the young men stay till past midnight and her father come downstairs in his stockingfeet and tell them it was time to go but they made a visit of decorous brevity and kendricks did not come again she met him afterward once as she was crossing the pavement in union square to get into her coupe and made the most of him but it was necessarily very little and so he passed out of her life without having left any trace in her heart though mela had a heart that she would have put at the disposition of almost any young man that wanted it kendricks himself manhattan cockney as he was with scarcely more out look into the average american nature than if he had been kept a prisoner in new york society all his days perceived a property in her which forbade him as a man of conscience to trifle with her something earthly good and kind if it was simple and vulgar in revising his impressions of her it seemed to him that she would come even to better literary effect if this were recognized in her and it made her sacred in spite of her willingness to fool and to be fooled in her merely human quality after all he saw that she wished honestly to love and to be loved and the lures she threw out to that end seemed to him pathetic rather than ridiculous he could not join beaton in laughing at her and he did not like beatons laughing at the other girl either it seemed to kendricks with the code of honor which he mostly kept to himself because he was a little ashamed to find there were so few others like it that if beaton cared nothing for the other girland christine appeared simply detestable to kendrickshe had better keep away from her and not give her the impression he was in love with her he rather fancied that this was the part of a gentleman and he could not have penetrated to that aesthetic and moral complexity which formed the consciousness of a nature like beatons and was chiefly a torment to itself he could not have conceived of the wayward impulses indulged at every moment in little things till the straight highway was traversed and wellnigh lost under their tangle to do whatever one likes is finally to do nothing that one likes even though one continues to do what one will but kendricks though a sage of twentyseven was still too young to understand this  beaton scarcely understood it himself perhaps because he was not yet twentyseven he only knew that his will was somehow sick that it spent itself in caprices and brought him no happiness from the fulfilment of the most vehement wish but he was aware that his wishes grew less and less vehement he began to have a fear that some time he might have none at all it seemed to him that if he could once do something that was thoroughly distasteful to himself he might make a beginning in the right direction but when he tried this on a small scale it failed and it seemed stupid some sort of expiation was the thing he needed he was sure but he could not think of anything in particular to expiate a man could not expiate his temperament and his temperament was what beaton decided to be at fault he perceived that it went deeper than even fate would have gone he could have fulfilled an evil destiny and had done with it however terrible his trouble was that he could not escape from himself and for the most part he justified himself in refusing to try after he had come to that distinct understanding with alma leighton and experienced the relief it really gave him he thought for a while that if it had fallen out otherwise and she had put him in charge of her destiny he might have been better able to manage his own but as it was he could only drift and let all other things take their course it was necessary that he should go to see her afterward to show her that he was equal to the event but he did not go so often and he went rather oftener to the dryfooses it was not easy to see margaret vance except on the society terms with much sneering and scorning he fulfilled the duties to mrs horn without which he knew he should be dropped from her list but one might go to many of her thursdays without getting many words with her niece beaton hardly knew whether he wanted many the girl kept the charm of her innocent stylishness but latterly she wanted to talk more about social questions than about the psychical problems that young people usually debate so personally son of the workingpeople as he was beaton had never cared anything about such matters he did not know about them or wish to know he was perhaps too near them besides there was an embarrassment at least on her part concerning the dryfooses she was too highminded to blame him for having tempted her to her failure with them by his talk about them but she was conscious of avoiding them in her talk she had decided not to renew the effort she had made in the spring because she could not do them good as fellowcreatures needing food and warmth and work and she would not try to befriend them socially she had a horror of any such futile sentimentality she would have liked to account to beaton in this way for a course which she suspected he must have heard their comments upon but she did not quite know how to do it she could not be sure how much or how little he cared for them some tentative approaches which she made toward explanation were met with such eager disclaim of personal interest that she knew less than before what to think and she turned the talk from the sisters to the brother whom it seemed she still continued to meet in their common work among the poor  he seems very different she ventured  oh quite said beaton hes the kind of person that you might suppose gave the catholics a hint for the cloistral life hes a cloistered naturethe nature that atones and suffers for but hes awfully dull company dont you think i never can get anything out of him  hes very much in earnest  remorselessly weve got a profane and mundane creature there at the office who runs us all and its shocking merely to see the contact of the tyro natures when fulkerson gets to joking dryfooshe likes to put his joke in the form of a pretence that dryfoos is actuated by a selfish motive that he has an eye to office and is working up a political interest for himself on the east sideits something inexpressible  i should think so said miss vance with such lofty disapproval that beaton felt himself included in it for having merely told what caused it he could not help saying in natural rebellion well the man of one idea is always a little ridiculous  when his idea is right she demanded a right idea cant be ridiculous  oh i only said the man that held it was hes flat he has no relief no projection  she seemed unable to answer and he perceived that he had silenced her to his own disadvantage it appeared to beaton that she was becoming a little too exacting for comfort in her idealism he put down the cup of tea he had been tasting and said in his solemn staccato i must go goodbye and got instantly away from her with an effect he had of having suddenly thought of something imperative  he went up to mrs horn for a moments hail and farewell and felt himself subtly detained by her through fugitive passages of conversation with half a dozen other people he fancied that at crises of this strange interview mrs horn was about to become confidential with him and confidential of all things about her niece she ended by not having palpably been so in fact the concern in her mind would have been difficult to impart to a young man and after several experiments mrs horn found it impossible to say that she wished margaret could somehow be interested in lower things than those which occupied her she had watched with growing anxiety the girls tendency to various kinds of selfdevotion she had dark hours in which she even feared her entire withdrawal from the world in a life of good works before now girls had entered the protestant sisterhoods which appeal so potently to the young and generous imagination and margaret was of just the temperament to be influenced by them during the past summer she had been unhappy at her separation from the cares that had engrossed her more and more as their stay in the city drew to an end in the spring and she had hurried her aunt back to town earlier in the fall than she would have chosen to come margaret had her correspondents among the workingwomen whom she befriended mrs horn was at one time alarmed to find that margaret was actually promoting a strike of the buttonhole workers this of course had its ludicrous side in connection with a young lady in good society and a person of even so little humor as mrs horn could not help seeing it at the same time she could not help foreboding the worst from it she was afraid that margarets health would give way under the strain and that if she did not go into a sisterhood she would at least go into a decline she began the winter with all such counteractive measures as she could employ at an age when such things weary she threw herself into the pleasures of society with the hope of dragging margaret after her and a sympathetic witness must have followed with compassion her course from ball to ball from reception to reception from parlorreading to parlorreading from musicale to musicale from play to play from opera to opera she tasted after she had practically renounced them the bitter and the insipid flavors of fashionable amusement in the hope that margaret might find them sweet and now at the end she had to own to herself that she had failed it was coming lent again and the girl had only grown thinner and more serious with the diversions that did not divert her from the baleful works of beneficence on which mrs horn felt that she was throwing her youth away margaret could have borne either alone but together they were wearing her out she felt it a duty to undergo the pleasures her aunt appointed for her but she could not forego the other duties in which she found her only pleasure  she kept up her music still because she could employ it at the meetings for the entertainment and as she hoped the elevation of her workingwomen but she neglected the other aesthetic interests which once occupied her and at sight of beaton talking with her mrs horn caught at the hope that he might somehow be turned to account in reviving margarets former interest in art she asked him if mr wetmore had his classes that winter as usual and she said she wished margaret could be induced to go again mr wetmore always said that she did not draw very well but that she had a great deal of feeling for it and her work was interesting she asked were the leightons in town again and she murmured a regret that she had not been able to see anything of them without explaining why she said she had a fancy that if margaret knew miss leighton and what she was doing it might stimulate her perhaps she supposed miss leighton was still going on with her art beaton said oh yes he believed so  but his manner did not encourage mrs horn to pursue her aims in that direction and she said with a sigh she wished he still had a class she always fancied that margaret got more good from his instruction than from any one elses  he said that she was very good but there was really nobody who knew half as much as wetmore or could make any one understand half as much mrs horn was afraid she said that mr wetmores terrible sincerity discouraged margaret he would not let her have any illusions about the outcome of what she was doing and did not mr beaton think that some illusion was necessary with young people of course it was very nice of mr wetmore to be so honest but it did not always seem to be the wisest thing she begged mr beaton to try to think of some one who would be a little less severe her tone assumed a deeper interest in the people who were coming up and going away and beaton perceived that he was dismissed  he went away with vanity flattered by the sense of having been appealed to concerning margaret and then he began to chafe at what she had said of wetmores honesty apropos of her wish that he still had a class himself did she mean confound her that he was insincere and would let miss vance suppose she had more talent than she really had the more beaton thought of this the more furious he became and the more he was convinced that something like it had been unconsciously if not consciously in her mind he framed some keen retorts to the general effect that with the atmosphere of illusion preserved so completely at home miss vance hardly needed it in her art studies having just determined never to go near mrs horns thursdays again he decided to go once more in order to plant this sting in her capacious but somewhat callous bosom and he planned how he would lead the talk up to the point from which he should launch it  in the mean time he felt the need of some present solace such as only unqualified worship could give him a cruel wish to feel his power in some direction where even if it were resisted it could not be overcome drove him on that a woman who was to beaton the embodiment of artificiality should intimate however innocentlythe innocence made it all the worsethat he was less honest than wetmore whom he knew to be so much more honest was something that must be retaliated somewhere before his selfrespect could be restored it was only five oclock and he went on uptown to the dryfooses though he had been there only the night before last he asked for the ladies and mrs mandel received him  the young ladies are downtown shopping she said but i am very glad of the opportunity of seeing you alone mr beaton you know i lived several years in europe  yes said beaton wondering what that could have to do with her pleasure in seeing him alone i believe so he involuntarily gave his words the questioning inflection  you have lived abroad too and so you wont find what i am going to ask so strange mr beaton why do you come so much to this house mrs mandel bent forward with an aspect of ladylike interest and smiled  beaton frowned why do i come so much  yes  why do iexcuse me mrs mandel but will you allow me to ask why you ask  oh certainly theres no reason why i shouldnt say for i wish you to be very frank with me i ask because there are two young ladies in this house and in a certain way i have to take the place of a mother to them i neednt explain why you know all the people here and you understand i have nothing to say about them but i should not be speaking to you now if they were not all rather helpless people they do not know the world they have come to live in here and they cannot help themselves or one another but you do know it mr beaton and i am sure you know just how much or how little you mean by coming here you are either interested in one of these young girls or you are not if you are i have nothing more to say if you are not mrs mandel continued to smile but the smile had grown more perfunctory and it had an icy gleam  beaton looked at her with surprise that he gravely kept to himself he had always regarded her as a social nullity with a kind of pity to be sure as a civilized person living among such people as the dryfooses but not without a humorous contempt he had thought of her as mandel and sometimes as old mandel though she was not half a score of years his senior and was still well on the sunny side of forty he reddened and then turned an angry pallor excuse me again mrs mandel do you ask this from the young ladies  certainly not she said with the best temper and with something in her tone that convicted beaton of vulgarity in putting his question of her authority in the form of a sneer as i have suggested they would hardly know how to help themselves at all in such a matter i have no objection to saying that i ask it from the father of the young ladies of course in and for myself i should have no right to know anything about your affairs i assure you the duty of knowing isnt very pleasant the little tremor in her clear voice struck beaton as something rather nice  i can very well believe that mrs mandel he said with a dreamy sadness in his own he lifted his eyes and looked into hers if i told you that i cared nothing about them in the way you intimate  then i should prefer to let you characterize your own conduct in continuing to come here for the year past as you have done and tacitly leading them on to infer differently they both mechanically kept up the fiction of plurality in speaking of christine but there was no doubt in the mind of either which of the young ladies the other meant a good many thoughts went through beatons mind and none of them were flattering he had not been unconscious that the part he had played toward this girl was ignoble and that it had grown meaner as the fancy which her beauty had at first kindled in him had grown cooler he was aware that of late he had been amusing himself with her passion in a way that was not less than cruel not because he wished to do so but because he was listless and wished nothing he rose in saying i might be a little more lenient than you think mrs mandel but i wont trouble you with any palliating theory i will not come any more  he bowed and mrs mandel said of course its only your action that i am concerned with  she seemed to him merely triumphant and he could not conceive what it had cost her to nerve herself up to her too easy victory he left mrs mandel to a far harder lot than had fallen to him and he went away hating her as an enemy who had humiliated him at a moment when he particularly needed exalting it was really very simple for him to stop going to see christine dryfoos but it was not at all simple for mrs mandel to deal with the consequences of his not coming he only thought how lightly she had stopped him and the poor woman whom he had left trembling for what she had been obliged to do embodied for him the conscience that accused him of unpleasant things  by heavens this is piling it up he said to himself through his set teeth realizing how it had happened right on top of that stupid insult from mrs horn now he should have to give up his place on every other week he could not keep that under the circumstances even if some pretence were not made to get rid of him he must hurry and anticipate any such pretence he must see fulkerson at once he wondered where he should find him at that hour he thought with bitterness so real that it gave him a kind of tragical satisfaction how certainly he could find him a little later at mrs leightons and fulkersons happiness became an added injury  the thing had of course come about just at the wrong time there never had been a time when beaton needed money more when he had spent what he had and what he expected to have so recklessly he was in debt to fulkerson personally and officially for advance payments of salary the thought of sending money home made him break into a scoffing laugh which he turned into a cough in order to deceive the passers what sort of face should he go with to fulkerson and tell him that he renounced his employment on every other week and what should he do when he had renounced it take pupils perhaps open a class a lurid conception of a class conducted on those principles of shameless flattery at which mrs horn had hintedhe believed now she had meant to insult himpresented itself why should not he act upon the suggestion he thought with loathing for the whole race of womendabblers in art how easy the thing would be as easy as to turn back now and tell that old fools girl that he loved her and rake in half his millions why should not he do that no one else cared for him and at a years end probably one woman would be like another as far as the love was concerned and probably he should not be more tired if the woman were christine dryfoos than if she were margaret vance he kept alma leighton out of the question because at the bottom of his heart he believed that she must be forever unlike every other woman to him  the tide of his confused and aimless reverie had carried him far downtown he thought but when he looked up from it to see where he was he found himself on sixth avenue only a little below thirtyninth street very hot and blown that idiotic fur overcoat was stifling he could not possibly walk down to eleventh he did not want to walk even to the elevated station at thirtyfourth he stopped at the corner to wait for a surfacecar and fell again into his bitter fancies after a while he roused himself and looked up the track but there was no car coming he found himself beside a policeman who was lazily swinging his club by its thong from his wrist  when do you suppose a car will be along he asked rather in a general sarcasm of the absence of the cars than in any special belief that the policeman could tell him  the policeman waited to discharge his tobaccojuice into the gutter in about a week he said nonchalantly  whats the matter asked beaton wondering what the joke could be  strike said the policeman his interest in beatons ignorance seemed to overcome his contempt of it knocked off everywhere this morning except third avenue and one or two crosstown lines he spat again and kept his bulk at its incline over the gutter to glance at a group of men on the corner below they were neatly dressed and looked like something better than workingmen and they had a holiday air of being in their best clothes  some of the strikers asked beaton  the policeman nodded  any trouble yet  there wont be any trouble till we begin to move the cars said the policeman  beaton felt a sudden turn of his rage toward the men whose action would now force him to walk five blocks and mount the stairs of the elevated station if youd take out eight or ten of those fellows he said ferociously and set them up against a wall and shoot them youd save a great deal of bother  i guess we shant have to shoot much said the policeman still swinging his locust anyway we shant begin it if it comes to a fight though he said with a look at the men under the scooping rim of his helmet we can drive the whole six thousand of em into the east river without pullin a trigger  are there six thousand in it  about  what do the infernal fools expect to live on  the interest of their money i suppose said the officer with a grin of satisfaction in his irony its got to run its course then theyll come back with their heads tied up and their tails between their legs and plead to be taken on again  if i was a manager of the roads said beaton thinking of how much he was already inconvenienced by the strike and obscurely connecting it as one of the series with the wrongs he had suffered at the hands of mrs horn and mrs mandel i would see them starve before id take them backevery one of them  well said the policeman impartially as a man might whom the companies allowed to ride free but who had made friends with a good many drivers and conductors in the course of his free riding i guess thats what the roads would like to do if they could but the men are too many for them and there aint enough other men to take their places  no matter said beaton severely they can bring in men from other places  oh theyll do that fast enough said the policeman  a man came out of the saloon on the corner where the strikers were standing noisy drunk and they began as they would have said to have some fun with him the policeman left beaton and sauntered slowly down toward the group as if in the natural course of an afternoon ramble on the other side of the street beaton could see another officer sauntering up from the block below looking up and down the avenue so silent of its horsecar bells he saw a policeman at every corner it was rather impressive     iii  the strike made a good deal of talk in it he office of every other week that is it made fulkerson talk a good deal he congratulated himself that he was not personally incommoded by it like some of the fellows who lived uptown and had not everything under one roof as it were he enjoyed the excitement of it and he kept the office boy running out to buy the extras which the newsmen came crying through the street almost every hour with a lamentable unintelligible noise he read not only the latest intelligence of the strike but the editorial comments on it which praised the firm attitude of both parties and the admirable measures taken by the police to preserve order fulkerson enjoyed the interviews with the police captains and the leaders of the strike he equally enjoyed the attempts of the reporters to interview the road managers which were so graphically detailed and with such a fine feeling for the right use of scareheads as to have almost the value of direct expression from them though it seemed that they had resolutely refused to speak he said at secondhand from the papers that if the men behaved themselves and respected the rights of property they would have public sympathy with them every time but just as soon as they began to interfere with the roads right to manage their own affairs in their own way they must be put down with an iron hand the phrase iron hand did fulkerson almost as much good as if it had never been used before news began to come of fighting between the police and the strikers when the roads tried to move their cars with men imported from philadelphia and then fulkerson rejoiced at the splendid courage of the police at the same time he believed what the strikers said and that the trouble was not made by them but by gangs of roughs acting without their approval in this juncture he was relieved by the arrival of the state board of arbitration which took up its quarters with a great many scareheads at one of the principal hotels and invited the roads and the strikers to lay the matter in dispute before them he said that now we should see the working of the greatest piece of social machinery in modern times but it appeared to work only in the alacrity of the strikers to submit their grievance the road were as one road in declaring that there was nothing to arbitrate and that they were merely asserting their right to manage their own affairs in their own way one of the presidents was reported to have told a member of the board who personally summoned him to get out and to go about his business then to fulkersons extreme disappointment the august tribunal acting on behalf of the sovereign people in the interest of peace declared itself powerless and got out and would no doubt have gone about its business if it had had any fulkerson did not know what to say perhaps because the extras did not but march laughed at this result  its a good deal like the military manoeuvre of the king of france and his forty thousand men i suppose somebody told him at the top of the hill that there was nothing to arbitrate and to get out and go about his business and that was the reason he marched down after he had marched up with all that ceremony what amuses me is to find that in an affair of this kind the roads have rights and the strikers have rights but the public has no rights at all the roads and the strikers are allowed to fight out a private war in our midst as thoroughly and precisely a private war as any we despise the middle ages for having toleratedas any street war in florence or veronaand to fight it out at our pains and expense and we stand by like sheep and wait till they get tired its a funny attitude for a city of fifteen hundred thousand inhabitants  what would you do asked fulkerson a good deal daunted by this view of the case  do nothing hasnt the state board of arbitration declared itself powerless we have no hold upon the strikers and were so used to being snubbed and disobliged by common carriers that we have forgotten our hold on the roads and always allow them to manage their own affairs in their own way quite as if we had nothing to do with them and they owed us no services in return for their privileges  thats a good deal so said fulkerson disordering his hair well its nuts for the colonel nowadays he says if he was boss of this town he would seize the roads on behalf of the people and man em with policemen and run em till the managers had come to terms with the strikers and hed do that every time there was a strike  doesnt that rather savor of the paternalism he condemned in lindau asked march  i dont know it savors of horse sense  you are pretty far gone fulkerson i thought you were the most engaged man i ever saw but i guess youre more fatherinlawed and before youre married too  well the colonels a glorious old fellow march i wish he had the power to do that thing just for the fun of looking on while he waltzed in hes on the keen jump from morning till night and hes up late and early to see the row im afraid hell get shot at some of the fights he sees them all i cant get any show at them havent seen a brickbat shied or a club swung yet have you  no i find i can philosophize the situation about as well from the papers and thats what i really want to do i suppose besides im solemnly pledged by mrs march not to go near any sort of crowd under penalty of having her bring the children and go with me her theory is that we must all die together the children havent been at school since the strike began theres no precaution that mrs march hasnt used she watches me whenever i go out and sees that i start straight for this office  fulkerson laughed and said well its probably the only thing thats saved your life have you seen anything of beaton lately  no you dont mean to say hes killed  not if he knows it but i dont knowwhat do you say march whats the reason you couldnt get us up a paper on the strike  i knew it would fetch round to every other week somehow  no but seriously there ll be plenty of news paper accounts but you could treat it in the historical spiritlike something that happened several centuries ago de foes plague of london style heigh what made me think of it was beaton if i could get hold of him you two could go round together and take down its aesthetic aspects its a big thing march this strike is i tell you its imposing to have a private war as you say fought out this way in the heart of new york and new york not minding it a bit see might take that view of it with your descriptions and beatons sketcheswell it would just be the greatest card come what do you say  will you undertake to make it right with mrs march if im killed and she and the children are not killed with me  well it would be difficult i wonder how it would do to get kendricks to do the literary part  ive no doubt hed jump at the chance ive yet to see the form of literature that kendricks wouldnt lay down his life for  say march perceived that fulkerson was about to vent another inspiration and smiled patiently look here whats the reason we couldnt get one of the strikers to write it up for us  might have a symposium of strikers and presidents march suggested  no im in earnest they say some of those fellowsespecially the foreignersare educated men i know one fellowa bohemianthat used to edit a bohemian newspaper here he could write it out in his kind of dutch and we could get lindau to translate it  i guess not said march dryly  why not hed do it for the cause wouldnt he suppose you put it up on him the next time you see him  i dont see lindau any more said march he added i guess hes renounced me along with mr dryfooss money  pshaw you dont mean he hasnt been round since  he came for a while but hes left off coming now i dont feel particularly gay about it march said with some resentment of fulkersons grin hes left me in debt to him for lessons to the children  fulkerson laughed out well he is the greatest old fool whod a thought hed a been in earnest with those brincibles of his but i suppose there have to be just such cranks it takes all kinds to make a world  there has to be one such crank it seems march partially assented ones enough for me  i reckon this thing is nuts for lindau too said fulkerson why it must act like a schooner of beer on him all the while to see gabidal embarrassed like it is by this strike it must make old lindau feel like he was back behind those barricades at berlin well hes a splendid old fellow pity he drinks as i remarked once before  when march left the office he did not go home so directly as he came perhaps because mrs marchs eye was not on him he was very curious about some aspects of the strike whose importance as a great social convulsion he felt people did not recognize and with his temperance in everything he found its negative expressions as significant as its more violent phases he had promised his wife solemnly that he would keep away from these and he had a natural inclination to keep his promise he had no wish to be that peaceful spectator who always gets shot when there is any firing on a mob he interested himself in the apparent indifference of the mighty city which kept on about its business as tranquilly as if the private war being fought out in its midst were a vague rumor of indian troubles on the frontier and he realized how there might once have been a street feud of forty years in florence without interfering materially with the industry and prosperity of the city on broadway there was a silence where a jangle and clatter of horsecar bells and hoofs had been but it was not very noticeable and on the avenues roofed by the elevated roads this silence of the surface tracks was not noticeable at all in the roar of the trains overhead some of the crosstown cars were beginning to run again with a policeman on the rear of each on the third avenge line operated by nonunion men who had not struck there were two policemen beside the driver of every car and two beside the conductor to protect them from the strikers but there were no strikers in sight and on second avenue they stood quietly about in groups on the corners while march watched them at a safe distance a car laden with policemen came down the track but none of the strikers offered to molest it in their simple sunday best march thought them very quiet decentlooking people and he could well believe that they had nothing to do with the riotous outbreaks in other parts of the city he could hardly believe that there were any such outbreaks he began more and more to think them mere newspaper exaggerations in the absence of any disturbance or the disposition to it that he could see he walked on to the east river  avenues a b and c presented the same quiet aspect as second avenue groups of men stood on the corners and now and then a policeladen car was brought unmolested down the tracks before them they looked at it and talked together and some laughed but there was no trouble  march got a crosstown car and came back to the west side a policeman looking very sleepy and tired lounged on the platform  i suppose youll be glad when this cruel war is over march suggested as he got in  the officer gave him a surly glance and made him no answer  his behavior from a man born to the joking give and take of our life impressed march it gave him a fine sense of the ferocity which he had read of the french troops putting on toward the populace just before the coup detat he began to feel like the populace but he struggled with himself and regained his character of philosophical observer in this character he remained in the car and let it carry him by the corner where he ought to have got out and gone home and let it keep on with him to one of the farthermost tracks westward where so much of the fighting was reported to have taken place but everything on the way was as quiet as on the east side  suddenly the car stopped with so quick a turn of the brake that he was half thrown from his seat and the policeman jumped down from the platform and ran forward     iv  dryfoos sat at breakfast that morning with mrs mandel as usual to pour out his coffee conrad had gone downtown the two girls lay abed much later than their father breakfasted and their mother had gradually grown too feeble to come down till lunch suddenly christine appeared at the door her face was white to the edges of her lips and her eyes were blazing  look here father have you been saying anything to mr beaton  the old man looked up at her across his coffeecup through his frowning brows no  mrs mandel dropped her eyes and the spoon shook in her hand  then whats the reason he dont come here any more demanded the girl and her glance darted from her father to mrs mandel oh its you is it id like to know who told you to meddle in other peoples business  i did said dryfoos savagely i told her to ask him what he wanted here and he said he didnt want anything and he stopped coming thats all i did it myself  oh you did did you said the girl scarcely less insolently than she had spoken to mrs mandel i should like to know what you did it for id like to know what made you think i wasnt able to take care of myself i just knew somebody had been meddling but i didnt suppose it was you i can manage my own affairs in my own way if you please and ill thank you after this to leave me to myself in what dont concern you  dont concern me you impudent jade her father began  christine advanced from the doorway toward the table she had her hands closed upon what seemed trinkets some of which glittered and dangled from them she said will you go to him and tell him that this meddlesome minx here had no business to say anything about me to him and you take it all back  no shouted the old man and if  thats all i want of you the girl shouted in her turn here are your presents with both hands she flung the jewelspins and rings and earrings and braceletsamong the breakfastdishes from which some of them sprang to the floor she stood a moment to pull the intaglio ring from the finger where beaton put it a year ago and dashed that at her fathers plate then she whirled out of the room and they heard her running upstairs  the old man made a start toward her but he fell back in his chair before she was gone and with a fierce grinding movement of his jaws controlled himself taketake those things up he gasped to mrs mandel he seemed unable to rise again from his chair but when she asked him if he were unwell he said no with an air of offence and got quickly to his feet he mechanically picked up the intaglio ring from the table while he stood there and put it on his little finger his hand was not much bigger than christines how do you suppose she found it out he asked after a moment  she seems to have merely suspected it said mrs mandel in a tremor and with the fright in her eyes which christines violence had brought there  well it dont make any difference she had to know somehow and now she knows he started toward the door of the library as if to go into the hall where his hat and coat hung  mr dryfoos palpitated mrs mandel i cant remain here after the language your daughter has used to mei cant let you leave meiim afraid of her  lock yourself up then said the old man rudely he added from the hall before he went out i reckon shell quiet down now  he took the elevated road the strike seemed a vary faroff thing though the paper he bought to look up the stockmarket was full of noisy typography about yesterdays troubles on the surface lines among the millions in wall street there was some joking and some swearing but not much thinking about the six thousand men who had taken such chances in their attempt to better their condition dryfoos heard nothing of the strike in the lobby of the stock exchange where he spent two or three hours watching a favorite stock of his go up and go down under the betting by the time the exchange closed it had risen eight points and on this and some other investments he was five thousand dollars richer than he had been in the morning but he had expected to be richer still and he was by no means satisfied with his luck all through the excitement of his winning and losing had played the dull murderous rage he felt toward they child who had defied him and when the game was over and he started home his rage mounted into a sort of frenzy he would teach her he would break her he walked a long way without thinking and then waited for a car none came and he hailed a passing coupe  what has got all the cars he demanded of the driver who jumped down from his box to open the door for him and get his direction  been away asked the driver hasnt been any car along for a week strike  oh yes said dryfoos he felt suddenly giddy and he remained staring at the driver after he had taken his seat  the man asked where to  dryfoos could not think of his street or number and he said with uncontrollable fury i told you once go up to west eleventh and drive along slow on the south side ill show you the place  he could not remember the number of every other week office where he suddenly decided to stop before he went home he wished to see fulkerson and ask him something about beaton whether he had been about lately and whether he had dropped any hint of what had happened concerning christine dryfoos believed that fulkerson was in the fellows confidence  there was nobody but conrad in the countingroom whither dryfoos returned after glancing into fulkersons empty office wheres fulkerson he asked sitting down with his hat on  he went out a few moments ago said conrad glancing at the clock im afraid he isnt coming back again today if you wanted to see him  dryfoos twisted his head sidewise and upward to indicate marchs room that other fellow out too  he went just before mr fulkerson answered conrad  do you generally knock off here in the middle of the afternoon asked the old man  no said conrad as patiently as if his father had not been there a score of times and found the whole staff of every other week at work between four and five mr march you know always takes a good deal of his work home with him and i suppose mr fulkerson went out so early because there isnt much doing today perhaps its the strike that makes it dull  the strikeyes its a pretty piece of business to have everything thrown out because a parcel of lazy hounds want a chance to lay off and get drunk dryfoos seemed to think conrad would make some answer to this but the young mans mild face merely saddened and he said nothing ive got a coupe out there now that i had to take because i couldnt get a car if i had my way id have a lot of those vagabonds hung theyre waiting to get the city into a snarl and then rob the housespack of dirty worthless whelps they ought to call out the militia and fire into em clubbing is too good for them conrad was still silent and his father sneered but i reckon you dont think so  i think the strike is useless said conrad  oh you do do you comin to your senses a little gettin tired walkin so much i should like to know what your gentlemen over there on the east side think about the strike anyway  the young fellow dropped his eyes i am not authorized to speak for them  oh indeed and perhaps youre not authorized to speak for yourself  father you know we dont agree about these things id rather not talk  but im goin to make you talk this time cried dryfoos striking the arm of the chair he sat in with the side of his fist a maddening thought of christine came over him as long as you eat my bread you have got to do as i say i wont have my children telling me what i shall do and shant do or take on airs of being holier than me now you just speak up do you think those loafers are right or dont you come  conrad apparently judged it best to speak i think they were very foolish to strikeat this time when the elevated roads can do the work  oh at this time heigh and i suppose they think over there on the east side that it d been wise to strike before we got the elevated conrad again refused to answer and his father roared what do you think  i think a strike is always bad business its war but sometimes there dont seem any other way for the workingmen to get justice they say that sometimes strikes do raise the wages after a while  those lazy devils were paid enough already shrieked the old man  they got two dollars a day how much do you think they ought to a got twenty  conrad hesitated with a beseeching look at his father but he decided to answer the men say that with partial work and fines and other things they get sometimes a dollar and sometimes ninety cents a day  they lie and you know they lie said his father rising and coming toward him and what do you think the upshot of it all will be after theyve ruined business for another week and made people hire hacks and stolen the money of honest men how is it going to end  they will have to give in  oh give in heigh and what will you say then i should like to know how will you feel about it then speak  i shall feel as i do now i know you dont think that way and i dont blame youor anybody but if i have got to say how i shall feel why i shall feel sorry they didnt succeed for i believe they have a righteous cause though they go the wrong way to help themselves  his father came close to him his eyes blazing his teeth set do you dare so say that to me  yes i cant help it i pity them my whole heart is with those poor men  you impudent puppy shouted the old man he lifted his hand and struck his son in the face conrad caught his hand with his own left and while the blood began to trickle from a wound that christines intaglio ring had made in his temple he looked at him with a kind of grieving wonder and said father  the old man wrenched his fist away and ran out of the house he remembered his address now and he gave it as he plunged into the coupe he trembled with his evil passion and glared out of the windows at the passers as he drove home he only saw conrads mild grieving wondering eyes and the blood slowly trickling from the wound in his temple  conrad went to the neatset bowl in fulkersons comfortable room and washed the blood away and kept bathing the wound with the cold water till it stopped bleeding the cut was not deep and he thought he would not put anything on it after a while he locked up the office and started out he hardly knew where but he walked on in the direction he had taken till he found himself in union square on the pavement in front of brentanos it seemed to him that he heard some one calling gently to him mr dryfoos     v  conrad looked confusedly around and the same voice said again mr dryfoos and he saw that it was a lady speaking to him from a coupe beside the curbing and then he saw that it was miss vance  she smiled when he gave signs of having discovered her and came up to the door of her carriage i am so glad to meet you i have been longing to talk to somebody nobody seems to feel about it as i do oh isnt it horrible must they fail i saw cars running on all the lines as i came across it made me sick at heart must those brave fellows give in and everybody seems to hate them soi cant bear it her face was estranged with excitement and there were traces of tears on it you must think me almost crazy to stop you in the street this way but when i caught sight of you i had to speak i knew you would sympathizei knew you would feel as i do oh how can anybody help honoring those poor men for standing by one another as they do they are risking all they have in the world for the sake of justice oh they are true heroes they are staking the bread of their wives and children on the dreadful chance theyve taken but no one seems to understand it no one seems to see that they are willing to suffer more now that other poor men may suffer less hereafter and those wretched creatures that are coming in to take their placesthose traitors  we cant blame them for wanting to earn a living miss vance said conrad  no no i dont blame them who am i to do such a thing its wepeople like me of my classwho make the poor betray one another but this dreadful fightingthis hideous paper is full of it she held up an extra crumpled with her nervous reading cant something be done to stop it dont you think that if some one went among them and tried to make them see how perfectly hopeless it was to resist the companies and drive off the new men he might do some good i have wanted to go and try but i am a woman and i mustnt i shouldnt be afraid of the strikers but im afraid of what people would say conrad kept pressing his handkerchief to the cut in his temple which he thought might be bleeding and now she noticed this are you hurt mr dryfoos you look so pale  no its nothinga little scratch ive got  indeed you look pale have you a carriage how will you get home will you get in here with me and let me drive you  no no said conrad smiling at her excitement im perfectly well  and you dont think im foolish and wicked for stopping you here and talking in this way but i know you feel as i do  yes i feel as you do you are rightright in every wayi mustnt keep yougoodbye he stepped back to bow but she put her beautiful hand out of the window and when he took it she wrung his hand hard  thank you thank you you are good and you are just but no one can do anything its useless  the type of irreproachable coachman on the box whose respectability had suffered through the strange behavior of his mistress in this interview drove quickly off at her signal and conrad stood a moment looking after the carriage his heart was full of joy it leaped he thought it would burst as he turned to walk away it seemed to him as if he mounted upon the air the trust she had shown him the praise she had given him that crush of the hand he hoped nothing he formed no idea from it but it all filled him with love that cast out the pain and shame he had been suffering he believed that he could never be unhappy any more the hardness that was in his mind toward his father went out of it he saw how sorely he had tried him he grieved that he had done it but the means the difference of his feeling about the cause of their quarrel he was solemnly glad of that since she shared it he was only sorry for his father poor father he said under his breath as he went along he explained to her about his father in his reverie and she pitied his father too  he was walking over toward the west side aimlessly at first and then at times with the longing to do something to save those mistaken men from themselves forming itself into a purpose was not that what she meant when she bewailed her womans helplessness she must have wished him to try if he being a man could not do something or if she did not still he would try and if she heard of it she would recall what she had said and would be glad he had understood her so thinking of her pleasure in what he was going to do he forgot almost what it was but when he came to a streetcar track he remembered it and looked up and down to see if there were any turbulent gathering of men whom he might mingle with and help to keep from violence he saw none anywhere and then suddenly as if at the same moment for in his exalted mood all events had a dreamlike simultaneity he stood at the corner of an avenue and in the middle of it a little way off was a streetcar and around the car a tumult of shouting cursing struggling men the driver was lashing his horses forward and a policeman was at their heads with the conductor pulling them stones clubs brickbats hailed upon the car the horses the men trying to move them the mob closed upon them in a body and then a patrolwagon whirled up from the other side and a squad of policemen leaped out and began to club the rioters conrad could see how they struck them under the rims of their hats the blows on their skulls sounded as if they had fallen on stone the rioters ran in all directions  one of the officers rushed up toward the corner where conrad stood and then he saw at his side a tall old man with a long white beard who was calling out at the policemen ah yes glup the strikerssgif it to them why dont you co and glup the bresidents that insoalt your lawss and gick your boart of arpidration outoftoors glup the strikerssthey cot no friendts they cot no money to pribe you to dreat you  the officer lifted his club and the old man threw his left arm up to shield his head conrad recognized zindau and now he saw the empty sleeve dangle in the air over the stump of his wrist he heard a shot in that turmoil beside the car and something seemed to strike him in the breast he was going to say to the policeman dont strike him hes an old soldier you see he has no hand but he could not speak he could not move his tongue the policeman stood there he saw his face it was not bad not cruel it was like the face of a statue fixed perdurablea mere image of irresponsible and involuntary authority then conrad fell forward pierced through the heart by that shot fired from the car  march heard the shot as he scrambled out of his car and at the same moment he saw lindau drop under the club of the policeman who left him where he fell and joined the rest of the squad in pursuing the rioters the fighting round the car in the avenue ceased the driver whipped his horses into a gallop and the place was left empty  march would have liked to run he thought how his wife had implored him to keep away from the rioting but he could not have left lindau lying there if he would something stronger than his will drew him to the spot and there he saw conrad dead beside the old man     vi  in the cares which mrs march shared with her husband that night she was supported partly by principle but mainly by the potent excitement which bewildered conrads family and took all reality from what had happened it was nearly midnight when the marches left them and walked away toward the elevated station with fulkerson everything had been done by that time that could be done and fulkerson was not without that satisfaction in the businesslike despatch of all the details which attends each step in such an affair and helps to make death tolerable even to the most sorely stricken we are creatures of the moment we live from one little space to another and only one interest at a time fills these fulkerson was cheerful when they got into the street almost gay and mrs march experienced a rebound from her depression which she felt that she ought not to have experienced but she condoned the offence a little in herself because her husband remained so constant in his gravity and pending the final accounting he must make her for having been where he could be of so much use from the first instant of the calamity she was tenderly gratefully proud of all the use he had been to conrads family and especially his miserable old father to her mind march was the principal actor in the whole affair and much more important in having seen it than those who had suffered in it in fact he had suffered incomparably  well well said fulkerson theyll get along now weve done all we could and theres nothing left but for them to bear it of course its awful but i guess it ll come out all right i mean he added theyll pull through now  i suppose said march that nothing is put on us that we cant bear but i should think he went on musingly that when god sees what we poor finite creatures can bear hemmed round with this eternal darkness of death he must respect us  basil said his wife but in her heart she drew nearer to him for the words she thought she ought to rebuke him for  oh i know he said we school ourselves to despise human nature but god did not make us despicable and i say whatever end he meant us for he must have some such thrill of joy in our adequacy to fate as a father feels when his son shows himself a man when i think what we can be if we must i cant believe the least of us shall finally perish  oh i reckon the almighty wont scoop any of us said fulkerson with a piety of his own  that poor boys father sighed mrs march i cant get his face out of my sight he looked so much worse than death  oh death doesnt look bad said march its life that looks so in its presence death is peace and pardon i only wish poor old lindau was as well out of it as conrad there  ah lindau he has done harm enough said mrs march i hope he will be careful after this  march did not try to defend lindau against her theory of the case which inexorably held him responsible for conrads death  lindaus going to come out all right i guess said fulkerson he was firstrate when i saw him at the hospital tonight he whispered in marchs ear at a chance he got in mounting the station stairs i didnt like to tell you there at the house but i guess youd better know they had to take lindaus arm off near the shoulder smashed all to pieces by the clubbing  in the house vainly rich and foolishly unfit for them the bereaved family whom the marches had just left lingered together and tried to get strength to part for the night they were all spent with the fatigue that comes from heaven to such misery as theirs and they sat in a torpor in which each waited for the other to move to speak  christine moved and mela spoke christine rose and went out of the room without saying a word and they heard her going upstairs then mela said  i reckon the rest of us better be goun too father here lets git mother started  she put her arm round her mother to lift her from her chair but the old man did not stir and mela called mrs mandel from the next room between them they raised her to her feet  aint there anybody agoin to set up with it she asked in her hoarse pipe it appears like folks haint got any feelins in new york woont some o the neighbors come and offer to set up without waitin to be asked  oh thats all right mother the men ll attend to that dont you bother any mela coaxed and she kept her arm round her mother with tender patience  why mely child i cant feel right to have it left to hirelins so but there aint anybody any more to see things done as they ought if coonrod was ony here  well mother you are pretty mixed said mela with a strong tendency to break into her large guffaw but she checked herself and said i know just how you feel though it keeps acomun and agoun and its so and it aint so all at once thats the plague of it well father aint you goun to come  im goin to stay mela said the old man gently without moving get your mother to bed thats a good girl  you goin to set up with him jacob asked the old woman  yes lizbeth ill set up you go to bed  well i will jacob and i believe it ll do you good to set up i wished i could set up with you but i dont seem to have the strenth i did when the twins died i must git my sleep sos toi dont like very well to have you broke of your rest jacob but there dont appear to be anybody else you wouldnt have to do it if coonrod was here there i go agin mercy mercy  well do come along then mother said mela and she got her out of the room with mrs mandels help and up the stairs  from the top the old woman called down you tell coonrod she stopped and he heard her groan out my lord my lord  he sat one silence in the diningroom where they had all lingered together and in the library beyond the hireling watcher sat another silence the time passed but neither moved and the last noise in the house ceased so that they heard each other breathe and the vague remote rumor of the city invaded the inner stillness it grew louder toward morning and then dryfoos knew from the watchers deeper breathing that he had fallen into a doze  he crept by him to the drawingroom where his son was the place was full of the awful sweetness of the flowers that fulkerson had brought and that lay above the pulseless breast the old man turned up a burner in the chandelier and stood looking on the majestic serenity of the dead face  he could not move when he saw his wife coming down the stairway in the hall she was in her long white flannel bed gown and the candle she carried shook with her nervous tremor he thought she might be walking in her sleep but she said quite simply i woke up and i couldnt git to sleep agin without comin to have a look she stood beside their dead son with him well hes beautiful jacob he was the prettiest baby and he was always good coonrod was ill say that for him i dont believe he ever give me a minutes care in his whole life i reckon i liked him about the best of all the children but i dont know as i ever done much to show it but you was always good to him jacob you always done the best for him ever since he was a little feller i used to be afraid youd spoil him sometimes in them days but i guess youre glad now for every time you didnt cross him i dont suppose since the twins died you ever hit him a lick she stooped and peered closer at the face why jacob whats that there by his pore eye dryfoos saw it too the wound that he had feared to look for and that now seemed to redden on his sight he broke into a low wavering cry like a childs in despair like an animals in terror like a souls in the anguish of remorse     vii  the evening after the funeral while the marches sat together talking it over and making approaches through its shadow to the question of their own future which it involved they were startled by the twitter of the electric bell at their apartment door it was really not so late as the childrens having gone to bed made it seem but at nine oclock it was too late for any probable visitor except fulkerson it might be he and march was glad to postpone the impending question to his curiosity concerning the immediate business fulkerson might have with him he went himself to the door and confronted there a lady deeply veiled in black and attended by a very decorous servingwoman  are you alone mr marchyou and mrs march asked the lady behind her veil and as he hesitated she said you dont know me miss vance and she threw back her veil showing her face wan and agitated in the dark folds i am very anxious to see youto speak with you both may i come in  why certainly miss vance he answered still too much stupefied by her presence to realize it  she promptly entered and saying with a glance at the hall chair by the door my maid can sit here followed him to the room where he had left his wife  mrs march showed herself more capable of coping with the fact she welcomed miss vance with the liking they both felt for the girl and with the sympathy which her troubled face inspired  i wont tire you with excuses for coming mrs march she said for it was the only thing left for me to do and i come at my aunts suggestion she added this as if it would help to account for her more on the conventional plane and she had the instinctive good taste to address herself throughout to mrs march as much as possible though what she had to say was mainly for march i dont know how to begini dont know how to speak of this terrible affair but you know what i mean i feel as if i had lived a whole lifetime since it happened i dont want you to pity me for it she said forestalling a politeness from mrs march im the last one to be thought of and you mustnt mind me if i try to make you i came to find out all of the truth that i can and when i know just what that is i shall know what to do i have read the inquest its all burned into my brain but i dont care for thatfor myself you must let me say such things without minding me i know that your husbandthat mr march was there i read his testimony and i wished to ask himto ask him she stopped and looked distractedly about but what folly he must have said everything he knewhe had to her eyes wandered to him from his wife on whom she had kept them with instinctive tact  i said everythingyes he replied but if you would like to know  perhaps i had better tell you something first i had just parted with himit couldnt have been more than half an hourin front of brentanos he must have gone straight to his death we were talking and ii said why didnt some one go among the strikers and plead with them to be peaceable and keep them from attacking the new men i knew that he felt as i did about the strikers that he was their friend did you seedo you know anything that makes you think he had been trying to do that  i am sorry march began i didnt see him at all tilltill i saw him lying dead  my husband was there purely by accident mrs march put in i had begged and entreated him not to go near the striking anywhere and he had just got out of the car and saw the policeman strike that wretched lindauhes been such an anxiety to me ever since we have had anything to do with him here my husband knew him when he was a boy in the west mr march came home from it all perfectly prostrated it made us all sick nothing so horrible ever came into our lives before i assure you it was the most shocking experience  miss vance listened to her with that look of patience which those who have seen much of the real suffering of the worldthe daily portion of the poorhave for the nervous woes of comfortable people march hung his head he knew it would be useless to protest that his share of the calamity was by comparison infinitesimally small  after she had heard mrs march to the end even of her repetitions miss vance said as if it were a mere matter of course that she should have looked the affair up yes i have seen mr lindau at the hospital  my husband goes every day to see him mrs march interrupted to give a final touch to the conception of marchs magnanimity throughout  the poor man seems to have been in the wrong at the time said miss vance  i could almost say he had earned the right to be wrong hes a man of the most generous instincts and a high ideal of justice of equitytoo high to be considered by a policeman with a club in his hand said march with a bold defiance of his wifes different opinion of lindau its the policemans business i suppose to club the ideal when he finds it inciting a riot  oh i dont blame mr lindau i dont blame the policeman he was as much a mere instrument as his club was i am only trying to find out how much i am to blame myself i had no thought of mr dryfooss going thereof his attempting to talk with the strikers and keep them quiet i was only thinking as women do of what i should try to do if i were a man  but perhaps he understood me to ask him to goperhaps my words sent him to his death  she had a sort of calm in her courage to know the worst truth as to her responsibility that forbade any wish to flatter her out of it im afraid said march that is what can never be known now after a moment he added but why should you wish to know if he went there as a peacemaker he died in a good cause in such a way as he would wish to die i believe  yes said the girl i have thought of that but death is awful we must not think patiently forgivingly of sending any one to their death in the best causei fancy life was an awful thing to conrad dryfoos march replied he was thwarted and disappointed without even pleasing the ambition that thwarted and disappointed him that poor old man his father warped him from his simple lifelong wish to be a minister and was trying to make a business man of him if it will be any consolation to you to know it miss vance i can assure you that he was very unhappy and i dont see how he could ever have been happy here  it wont said the girl steadily if people are born into this world its because they were meant to live in it it isnt a question of being happy here no one is happy in that old selfish way or can be but he could have been of great use  perhaps he was of use in dying who knows he may have been trying to silence lindau  oh lindau wasnt worth it cried mrs march  miss vance looked at her as if she did not quite understand then she turned to march he might have been unhappy as we all are but i know that his life here would have had a higher happiness than we wish for or aim for the tears began to run silently down her cheeks  he looked strangely happy that day when he left me he had hurt himself somehow and his face was bleeding from a scratch he kept his handkerchief up he was pale but such a light came into his face when he shook handsah i know he went to try and do what i said they were all silent while she dried her eyes and then put her handkerchief back into the pocket from which she had suddenly pulled it with a series of vivid youngladyish gestures which struck march by their incongruity with the occasion of their talk and yet by their harmony with the rest of her elegance i am sorry miss vance he began that i cant really tell you anything more  you are very kind she said controlling herself and rising quickly i thank youthank you both very much she turned to mrs march and shook hands with her and then with him i might have knowni did know that there wasnt anything more for you to tell but at least ive found out from you that there was nothing and now i can begin to bear what i must how are those poor creatureshis mother and father his sisters some day i hope i shall be ashamed to have postponed them to the thought of myself but i cant pretend to be yet i could not come to the funeral i wanted to  she addressed her question to mrs march who answered i can understand but they were pleased with the flowers you sent people are at such times and they havent many friends  would you go to see them asked the girl would you tell them what ive told you  mrs march looked at her husband  i dont see what good it would do they wouldnt understand but if it would relieve you  ill wait till it isnt a question of selfrelief said the girl goodbye  she left them to long debate of the event at the end mrs march said she is a strange being such a mixture of the society girl and the saint  her husband answered shes the potentiality of several kinds of fanatic shes very unhappy and i dont see how shes to be happier about that poor fellow i shouldnt be surprised if she did inspire him to attempt something of that kind  well you got out of it very well basil i admired the way you managed i was afraid youd say something awkward  oh with a plain line of truth before me as the only possible thing i can get on pretty well when it comes to anything decorative id rather leave it to you isabel  she seemed insensible of his jest of course he was in love with her that was the light that came into his face when he was going to do what he thought she wanted him to do  and shedo you think that she was  what an idea it would have been perfectly grotesque     viii  their affliction brought the dryfooses into humaner relations with the marches who had hitherto regarded them as a necessary evil as the odious means of their own prosperity mrs march found that the women of the family seemed glad of her coming and in the sense of her usefulness to them all she began to feel a kindness even for christine but she could not help seeing that between the girl and her father there was an unsettled account somehow and that it was christine and not the old man who was holding out she thought that their sorrow had tended to refine the others mela was much more subdued and except when she abandoned herself to a childish interest in her mourning she did nothing to shock mrs marchs taste or to seem unworthy of her grief she was very good to her mother whom the blow had left unchanged and to her father whom it had apparently fallen upon with crushing weight once after visiting their house mrs march described to march a little scene between dryfoos and mela when he came home from wall street and the girl met him at the door with a kind of country simpleness and took his hat and stick and brought him into the room where mrs march sat looking tired and broken she found this look of dryfooss pathetic and dwelt on the sort of stupefaction there was in it he must have loved his son more than they ever realized yes said march i suspect he did hes never been about the place since that day he was always dropping in before on his way uptown he seems to go down to wall street every day just as before but i suppose thats mechanical he wouldnt know what else to do i dare say its best for him the sanguine fulkerson is getting a little anxious about the future of every other week now conrads gone he isnt sure the old man will want to keep on with it or whether hell have to look up another angel he wants to get married i imagine and he cant venture till this point is settled  its a very material point to us too basil said mrs march  well of course i hadnt overlooked that you may be sure one of the things that fulkerson and i have discussed is a scheme for buying the magazine its success is pretty well assured now and i shouldnt be afraid to put money into itif i had the money  i couldnt let you sell the house in boston basil  and i dont want to i wish we could go back and live in it and get the rent too it would be quite a support but i suppose if dryfoos wont keep on it must come to another angel i hope it wont be a literary one with a fancy for running my department  oh i guess whoever takes the magazine will be glad enough to keep you  do you think so well perhaps but i dont believe fulkerson would let me stand long between him and an angel of the right description  well then i believe he would and youve never seen anything basil to make you really think that mr fulkerson didnt appreciate you to the utmost  i think i came pretty near an undervaluation in that lindau trouble i shall always wonder what put a backbone into fulkerson just at that crisis fulkerson doesnt strike me as the stuff of a moral hero  at any rate he was one said mrs march and thats quite enough for me  march did not answer what a noble thing life is anyway here i am well on the way to fifty after twentyfive years of hard work looking forward to the potential poorhouse as confidently as i did in youth we might have saved a little more than we have saved but the little more wouldnt avail if i were turned out of my place now and we should have lived sordidly to no purpose some one always has you by the throat unless you have some one else in your grip i wonder if thats the attitude the almighty intended his respectable creatures to take toward one another i wonder if he meant our civilization the battle we fight in the game we trick in i wonder if he considers it final and if the kingdom of heaven on earth which we pray for  have you seen lindau today mrs march asked  you inferred it from the quality of my piety march laughed and then suddenly sobered yes i saw him its going rather hard with him im afraid the amputation doesnt heal very well the shock was very great and hes old it ll take time theres so much pain that they have to keep him under opiates and i dont think he fully knew me at any rate i didnt get my piety from him today  its horrible horrible said mrs march i cant get over it after losing his hand in the war to lose his whole arm now in this way it does seem too cruel of course he oughtnt to have been there we can say that but you oughtnt to have been there either basil  well i wasnt exactly advising the police to go and club the railroad presidents  neither was poor conrad dryfoos  i dont deny it all that was distinctly the chance of life and death that belonged to god and no doubt it was law though it seems chance but what i object to is this economic chanceworld in which we live and which we men seem to have created it ought to be law as inflexible in human affairs as the order of day and night in the physical world that if a man will work he shall both rest and eat and shall not be harassed with any question as to how his repose and his provision shall come nothing less ideal than this satisfies the reason but in our state of things no one is secure of this no one is sure of finding work no one is sure of not losing it i may have my work taken away from me at any moment by the caprice the mood the indigestion of a man who has not the qualification for knowing whether i do it well or ill at my time of lifeat every time of lifea man ought to feel that if he will keep on doing his duty he shall not suffer in himself or in those who are dear to him except through natural causes but no man can feel this as things are now and so we go on pushing and pulling climbing and crawling thrusting aside and trampling underfoot lying cheating stealing and then we get to the end covered with blood and dirt and sin and shame and look back over the way weve come to a palace of our own or the poorhouse which is about the only possession we can claim in common with our brothermen i dont think the retrospect can be pleasing  i know i know said his wife i think of those things too basil life isnt what it seems when you look forward to it but i think people would suffer less and wouldnt have to work so hard and could make all reasonable provision for the future if they were not so greedy and so foolish  oh without doubt we cant put it all on the conditions we must put some of the blame on character but conditions make character and people are greedy and foolish and wish to have and to shine because having and shining are held up to them by civilization as the chief good of life we all know they are not the chief good perhaps not good at all but if some one ventures to say so all the rest of us call him a fraud and a crank and go moiling and toiling on to the palace or the poorhouse we cant help it if one were less greedy or less foolish some one else would have and would shine at his expense we dont moil and toil to ourselves alone the palace or the poorhouse is not merely for ourselves but for our children whom weve brought up in the superstition that having and shining is the chief good we dare not teach them otherwise for fear they may falter in the fight when it comes their turn and the children of others will crowd them out of the palace into the poorhouse if we felt sure that honest work shared by all would bring them honest food shared by all some heroic few of us who did not wish our children to rise above their fellowsthough we could not bear to have them fall belowmight trust them with the truth but we have no such assurance and so we go on trembling before dryfooses and living in gimcrackeries  basil basil i was always willing to live more simply than you you know i was  i know you always said so my dear but how many bellratchets and speakingtubes would you be willing to have at the street door below i remember that when we were looking for a flat you rejected every building that had a bellratchet or a speakingtube and would have nothing to do with any that had more than an electric button you wanted a hallboy with electric buttons all over him i dont blame you i find such things quite as necessary as you do  and do you mean to say basil she asked abandoning this unprofitable branch of the inquiry that you are really uneasy about your place that you are afraid mr dryfoos may give up being an angel and mr fulkerson may play you false  play me false oh it wouldnt be playing me false it would be merely looking out for himself if the new angel had editorial tastes and wanted my place its what any one would do  you wouldnt do it basil  wouldnt i well if any one offered me more salary than every other week payssay twice as muchwhat do you think my duty to my suffering family would be its give and take in the business world isabel especially take but as to being uneasy im not in the least ive the spirit of a lion when it comes to such a chance as that when i see how readily the sensibilities of the passing stranger can be worked in new york i think of taking up the role of that desperate man on third avenue who went along looking for garbage in the gutter to eat i think i could pick up at least twenty or thirty cents a day by that little game and maintain my family in the affluence its been accustomed to  basil cried his wife you dont mean to say that man was an impostor and ive gone about ever since feeling that one such case in a million the bare possibility of it was enough to justify all that lindau said about the rich and the poor  march laughed teasingly oh i dont say he was an impostor perhaps he really was hungry but if he wasnt what do you think of a civilization that makes the opportunity of such a fraud that gives us all such a bad conscience for the need which is that we weaken to the need that isnt suppose that poor fellow wasnt personally founded on fact nevertheless he represented the truth he was the ideal of the suffering which would be less effective if realistically treated that man is a great comfort to me he probably rioted for days on that quarter i gave him made a dinner very likely or a champagne supper and if every other week wants to get rid of me i intend to work that racket you can hang round the corner with bella and tom can come up to me in tears at stated intervals and ask me if ive found anything yet to be sure we might be arrested and sent up somewhere but even in that extreme case we should be provided for oh no im not afraid of losing my place ive merely a sort of psychological curiosity to know how men like dryfoos and fulkerson will work out the problem before them     ix  it was a curiosity which fulkerson himself shared at least concerning dryfoos i dont know what the old mans going to do he said to march the day after the marches had talked their future over said anything to you yet  no not a word  youre anxious i suppose same as i am fact is said fulkerson blushing a little i cant ask to have a day named till i know where i am in connection with the old man i cant tell whether ive got to look out for something else or somebody else of course its full soon yet  yes march said much sooner than it seems to us were so anxious about the future that we dont remember how very recent the past is  thats something so the old mans hardly had time yet to pull himself together well im glad you feel that way about it march i guess its more of a blow to him than we realize he was a good deal bound up in coonrod though he didnt always use him very well well i reckon its apt to happen so oftentimes curious how cruel love can be heigh were an awful mixture march  yes thats the marvel and the curse as browning says  why that poor boy himself pursued fulkerson had streaks of the mule in him that could give odds to beaton and he must have tried the old man by the way he would give in to his will and hold out against his judgment i dont believe he ever budged a hairsbreadth from his original position about wanting to be a preacher and not wanting to be a business man well of course i dont think business is all in all but it must have made the old man mad to find that without saying anything or doing anything to show it and after seeming to come over to his ground and really coming practically coonrod was just exactly where he first planted himself every time  yes people that have convictions are difficult fortunately theyre rare  do you think so it seems to me that everybodys got convictions beaton himself who hasnt a principle to throw at a dog has got convictions the size of a barn they aint always the same ones i know but theyre always to the same effect as far as beatons being number one is concerned the old mans got convictions or did have unless this thing lately has shaken him all upand he believes that money will do everything colonel woodburns got convictions that he wouldnt part with for untold millions why march you got convictions yourself  have i said march i dont know what they are  well neither do i but i know you were ready to kick the trough over for them when the old man wanted us to bounce lindau that time  oh yes said march he remembered the fact but he was still uncertain just what the convictions were that he had been so stanch for  i suppose we could have got along without you fulkerson mused aloud its astonishing how you always can get along in this world without the man that is simply indispensable makes a fellow realize that he could take a day off now and then without deranging the solar system a great deal now heres coonrodor rather he isnt but that boy managed his part of the schooner so well that i used to tremble when i thought of his getting the better of the old man and going into a convent or something of that kind and now here he is snuffed out in half a second and i dont believe but what we shall be sailing along just as chipper as usual inside of thirty days i reckon it will bring the old man to the point when i come to talk with him about whos to be put in coonrods place i dont like very well to start the subject with him but its got to be done some time  yes march admitted its terrible to think how unnecessary even the best and wisest of us is to the purposes of providence when i looked at that poor young fellows face sometimesso gentle and true and purei used to think the world was appreciably richer for his being in it but are we appreciably poorer for his being out of it now  no i dont reckon we are said fulkerson and what a lot of the raw material of all kinds the almighty must have to waste us the way he seems to do think of throwing away a precious creature like coonrod dryfoos on one chance in a thousand of getting that old fool of a lindau out of the way of being clubbed for i suppose that was what coonrod was up to say have you been round to see lindau today  something in the tone or the manner of fulkerson startled march no i havent seen him since yesterday  well i dont know said fulkerson i guess i saw him a little while after you did and that young doctor there seemed to feel kind of worried about him  or not worried exactly they cant afford to let such things worry them i suppose but  hes worse asked march  oh he didnt say so but i just wondered if youd seen him today  i think ill go now said march with a pang at heart he had gone every day to see lindau but this day he had thought he would not go and that was why his heart smote him he knew that if he were in lindaus place lindau would never have left his side if he could have helped it march tried to believe that the case was the same as it stood now it seemed to him that he was always going to or from the hospital he said to himself that it must do lindau harm to be visited so much but he knew that this was not true when he was met at the door of the ward where lindau lay by the young doctor who had come to feel a personal interest in marchs interest in lindau  he smiled without gayety and said hes just going  what discharged  oh no he has been failing very fast since you saw him yesterday and now they had been walking softly and talking softly down the aisle between the long rows of beds would you care to see him  the doctor made a slight gesture toward the white canvas screen which in such places forms the deathchamber of the poor and friendless come round this wayhe wont know you ive got rather fond of the poor old fellow he wouldnt have a clergymansort of agnostic isnt he a good many of these germans arebut the young lady whos been coming to see him  they both stopped lindaus grand patriarchal head foreshortened to their view lay white upon the pillow and his broad white beard flowed upon the sheet which heaved with those long last breaths beside his bed margaret vance was kneeling her veil was thrown back and her face was lifted she held clasped between her hands the hand of the dying man she moved her lips inaudibly     x  in spite of the experience of the whole race from time immemorial when death comes to any one we know we helplessly regard it as an incident of life which will presently go on as before perhaps this is an instinctive perception of the truth that it does go on somewhere but we have a sense of death as absolutely the end even for earth only if it relates to some one remote or indifferent to us march tried to project lindau to the necessary distance from himself in order to realize the fact in his case but he could not though the man with whom his youth had been associated in a poetic friendship had not actually reentered the region of his affection to the same degree or in any like degree the changed conditions forbade that he had a soreness of heart concerning him but he could not make sure whether this soreness was grief for his death or remorse for his own uncandor with him about dryfoos or a foreboding of that accounting with his conscience which he knew his wife would now exact of him down to the last minutest particular of their joint and several behavior toward lindau ever since they had met him in new york  he felt something knock against his shoulder and he looked up to have his hat struck from his head by a horses nose he saw the horse put his foot on the hat and he reflected now it will always look like an accordion and he heard the horses driver address him some sarcasms before he could fully awaken to the situation he was standing bareheaded in the middle of fifth avenue and blocking the tide of carriages flowing in either direction among the faces put out of the carriage windows he saw that of dryfoos looking from a coupe the old man knew him and said jump in here mr march and march who had mechanically picked up his hat and was thinking now i shall have to tell isabel about this at once and she will never trust me on the street again without her mechanically obeyed her confidence in him had been undermined by his being so near conrad when he was shot and it went through his mind that he would get dryfoos to drive him to a hatters where he could buy a new hat and not be obliged to confess his narrow escape to his wife till the incident was some days old and she could bear it better it quite drove lindaus death out of his mind for the moment and when dryfoos said if he was going home he would drive up to the first crossstreet and turn back with him march said he would be glad if he would take him to a hatstore the old man put his head out again and told the driver to take them to the fifth avenue hotel theres a hatstore around there somewhere seems to me he said and they talked of marchs accident as well as they could in the rattle and clatter of the street till they reached the place march got his hat passing a joke with the hatter about the impossibility of pressing his old hat over again and came out to thank dryfoos and take leave of him  if you aint in any great hurry the old man said i wish youd get in here a minute id like to have a little talk with you  oh certainly said march and he thought its coming now about what he intends to do with every other week well i might as well have all the misery at once and have it over  dryfoos called up to his driver who bent his head down sidewise to listen go over there on madison avenue onto that asphalt and keep drivin up and down till i stop you i cant hear myself think on these pavements he said to march but after they got upon the asphalt and began smoothly rolling over it he seemed in no haste to begin at last he said i wanted to talk with you about thatthat dutchman that was at my dinnerlindau and marchs heart gave a jump with wonder whether he could already have heard of lindaus death but in an instant he perceived that this was impossible i been talkin with fulkerson about him and he says they had to take the balance of his arm off  march nodded it seemed to him he could not speak he could not make out from the close face of the old man anything of his motive it was set but set as a piece of broken mechanism is when it has lost the power to relax itself there was no other history in it of what the man had passed through in his sons death  i dont know dryfoos resumed looking aside at the cloth windowstrap which he kept fingering as you quite understood what made me the maddest i didnt tell him i could talk dutch because i cant keep it up with a regular german but my father was pennsylvany dutch and i could understand what he was saying to you about me i know i had no business to understood it after i let him think i couldnt but i did and i didnt like very well to have a man callin me a traitor and a tyrant at my own table well i look at it differently now and i reckon i had better have tried to put up with it and i would if i could have known he stopped with a quivering lip and then went on then again i didnt like his talkin that paternalism of his i always heard it was the worst kind of thing for the country i was brought up to think the best government was the one that governs the least and i didnt want to hear that kind of talk from a man that was livin on my money i couldnt bear it from him or i thought i couldnt beforebefore he stopped again and gulped i reckon now there aint anything i couldnt bear march was moved by the blunt words and the mute stare forward with which they ended mr dryfoos i didnt know that you understood lindaus german or i shouldnt have allowed him he wouldnt have allowed himselfto go on he wouldnt have knowingly abused his position of guest to censure you no matter how much he condemned you i dont care for it now said dryfoos its all past and gone as far as im concerned but i wanted you to see that i wasnt tryin to punish him for his opinions as you said  no i see now march assented though he thought his position still justified i wish  i dont know as i understand much about his opinions anyway but i aint ready to say i want the men dependent on me to manage my business for me i always tried to do the square thing by my hands and in that particular case out there i took on all the old hands just as fast as they left their union as for the game i came on them it was dog eat dog anyway  march could have laughed to think how far this old man was from even conceiving of lindaus pointof view and how he was saying the worst of himself that lindau could have said of him no one could have characterized the kind of thing he had done more severely than he when he called it dog eat dog  theres a great deal to be said on both sides march began hoping to lead up through this generality to the fact of lindaus death but the old man went on  well all i wanted him to know is that i wasnt trying to punish him for what he said about things in general you naturally got that idea i reckon but i always went in for lettin people say what they please and think what they please its the only way in a free country  im afraid mr dryfoos that it would make little difference to lindau now  i dont suppose he bears malice for it said dryfoos but what i want to do is to have him told so he could understand just why i didnt want to be called hard names and yet i didnt object to his thinkin whatever he pleased id like him to know  no one can speak to him no one can tell him march began again but again dryfoos prevented him from going on  i understand its a delicate thing and im not askin you to do it what i would really like to doif you think he could be prepared for it some way and could stand itwould be to go to him myself and tell him just what the trouble was im in hopes if i done that he could see how i felt about it  a picture of dryfoos going to the dead lindau with his vain regrets presented itself to march and he tried once more to make the old man understand mr dryfoos he said lindau is past all that forever and he felt the ghastly comedy of it when dryfoos continued without heeding him  i got a particular reason why i want him to believe it wasnt his ideas i objected tothem ideas of his about the government carryin everything on and givin work i dont understand em exactly but i found a writinamongmy sonsthings he seemed to force the words through his teeth and i reckon hethoughtthat way kind of a diarywhere heput downhis thoughts my son and mewe differed about a goodmany things his chin shook and from time to time he stopped i wasnt very good to him i reckon i crossed him where i guess i got no business to cross him but i thought everything ofcoonrod he was the best boy from a baby that ever was just so patient and mild and done whatever he was told i ought to a let him been a preacher oh my son my son the sobs could not be kept back any longer they shook the old man with a violence that made march afraid for him but he controlled himself at last with a series of hoarse sounds like barks well its all past and gone but as i understand you from what you saw when coonrod waskilled he was tryin to save that old man from trouble  yes yes it seemed so to me  that ll do then i want you to have him come back and write for the book when he gets well i want you to find out and let me know if theres anything i can do for him ill feel as if i done itfor myson ill take him into my own house and do for him there if you say so when he gets so he can be moved ill wait on him myself its what coonrod d do if he was here i dont feel any hardness to him because it was him that got coonrod killed as you might say in one sense of the term but ive tried to think it out and i feel like i was all the more beholden to him because my son died tryin to save him whatever i do ill be doin it for coonrod and thats enough for me he seemed to have finished and he turned to march as if to hear what he had to say  march hesitated im afraid mr dryfoosdidnt fulkerson tell you that lindau was very sick  yes of course but hes all right he said  now it had to come though the fact had been latterly playing fast and loose with marchs consciousness something almost made him smile the willingness he had once felt to give this old man pain then he consoled himself by thinking that at least he was not obliged to meet dryfooss wish to make atonement with the fact that lindau had renounced him and would on no terms work for such a man as he or suffer any kindness from him in this light lindau seemed the harder of the two and march had the momentary force to say  mr dryfoosit cant be lindaui have just come from himis dead     xi  how did he take it how could he bear it oh basil i wonder you could have the heart to say it to him it was cruel  yes cruel enough my dear march owned to his wife when they talked the matter over on his return home he could not wait till the children were out of the way and afterward neither he nor his wife was sorry that he had spoken of it before them the girl cried plentifully for her old friend who was dead and said she hated mr dryfoos and then was sorry for him too and the boy listened to all and spoke with a serious sense that pleased his father but as to how he took it march went on to answer his wifes question about dryfooshow do any of us take a thing that hurts some of us cry out and some of us dont dryfoos drew a kind of long quivering breath as a child does when it grievestheres something curiously simple and primitive about himand didnt say anything after a while he asked me how he could see the people at the hospital about the remains i gave him my card to the young doctor there that had charge of lindau i suppose he was still carrying forward his plan of reparation in his mindto the dead for the dead but how useless if he could have taken the living lindau home with him and cared for him all his days what would it have profited the gentle creature whose life his worldly ambition vexed and thwarted here he might as well offer a sacrifice at conrads grave children said march turning to them death is an exile that no remorse and no love can reach remember that and be good to every one here on earth for your longing to retrieve any harshness or unkindness to the dead will be the very ecstasy of anguish to you i wonder he mused if one of the reasons why were shut up to our ignorance of what is to be hereafter isnt because if we were sure of another world we might be still more brutal to one another here in the hope of making reparation somewhere else perhaps if we ever come to obey the law of love on earth the mystery of death will be taken away  wellthe ancestral puritanism spoke in mrs marchthese two old men have been terribly punished they have both been violent and wilful and they have both been punished no one need ever tell me there is not a moral government of the universe  march always disliked to hear her talk in this way which did both her head and heart injustice and conrad he said what was he punished for  heshe answered in an exaltationhe suffered for the sins of others  ah well if you put it in that way yes that goes on continually thats another mystery  he fell to brooding on it and presently he heard his son saying i suppose papa that mr lindau died in a bad cause  march was startled he had always been so sorry for lindau and admired his courage and generosity so much that he had never fairly considered this question why yes he answered he died in the cause of disorder he was trying to obstruct the law no doubt there was a wrong there an inconsistency and an injustice that he felt keenly but it could not be reached in his way without greater wrong  yes thats what i thought said the boy and whats the use of our ever fighting about anything in america i always thought we could vote anything we wanted  we can if were honest and dont buy and sell one anothers votes said his father and men like lindau who renounce the american means as hopeless and let their love of justice hurry them into sympathy with violenceyes they are wrong and poor lindau did die in a bad cause as you say tom  i think conrad had no business there or you either basil said his wife  oh i dont defend myself said march i was there in the cause of literary curiosity and of conjugal disobedience but conradyes he had some business there it was his business to suffer there for the sins of others isabel we cant throw aside that old doctrine of the atonement yet the life of christ it wasnt only in healing the sick and going about to do good it was suffering for the sins of others thats as great a mystery as the mystery of death why should there be such a principle in the world but its been felt and more or less dumbly blindly recognized ever since calvary if we love mankind pity them we even wish to suffer for them thats what has created the religious orders in all timesthe brotherhoods and sisterhoods that belong to our day as much as to the mediaeval past thats what is driving a girl like margaret vance who has everything that the world can offer her young beauty on to the work of a sister of charity among the poor and the dying  yes yes cried mrs march howhow did she look there basil she had her feminine misgivings she was not sure but the girl was something of a poseuse and enjoyed the picturesqueness as well as the pain and she wished to be convinced that it was not so  well she said when march had told again the little there was to tell i suppose it must be a great trial to a woman like mrs horn to have her niece going that way  the way of christ asked march with a smile  oh christ came into the world to teach us how to live rightly in it too if we were all to spend our time in hospitals it would be rather dismal for the homes but perhaps you dont think the homes are worth minding she suggested with a certain note in her voice that he knew  he got up and kissed her i think the gimcrackeries are he took the hat he had set down on the parlor table on coming in and started to put it in the hall and that made her notice it  youve been getting a new hat  yes he hesitated the old one had gotwas decidedly shabby  well thats right i dont like you to wear them too long did you leave the old one to be pressed  well the hatter seemed to think it was hardly worth pressing said march he decided that for the present his wifes nerves had quite all they could bear     xii  it was in a manner grotesque but to march it was all the more natural for that reason that dryfoos should have lindaus funeral from his house he knew the old man to be darkly groping through the payment of these vain honors to the dead for some atonement to his son and he imagined him finding in them such comfort as comes from doing all one can even when all is useless  no one knew what lindaus religion was and in default they had had the anglican burial service read over him it seems so often the refuge of the homeless dead mrs dryfoos came down for the ceremony she understood that it was for coonrods sake that his father wished the funeral to be there and she confided to mrs march that she believed coonrod would have been pleased coonrod was a member of the piscopal church and fawthers doin the whole thing for coonrod as much as for anybody he thought the world of coonrod fawther did mela she kind of thought it would look queer to have two funerals from the same house handrunnin as you might call it and one of em no relation either but when she saw how fawther was bent on it she give in seems as if she was tryin to make up to fawther for coonrod as much as she could mela always was a good child but nobody can ever come up to coonrod  march felt all the grotesqueness the hopeless absurdity of dryfooss endeavor at atonement in these vain obsequies to the man for whom he believed his son to have died but the effort had its magnanimity its pathos and there was a poetry that appealed to him in the reconciliation through death of men of ideas of conditions that could only have gone warring on in life he thought as the priest went on with the solemn liturgy how all the world must come together in that peace which struggle and strive as we may shall claim us at last he looked at dryfoos and wondered whether he would consider these rites a sufficient tribute or whether there was enough in him to make him realize their futility except as a mere sign of his wish to retrieve the past he thought how we never can atone for the wrong we do the heart we have grieved and wounded cannot kindle with pity for us when once it is stilled and yet we can put our evil from us with penitence and somehow somewhere the order of loving kindness which our passion or our wilfulness has disturbed will be restored  dryfoos through fulkerson had asked all the more intimate contributors of every other week to come beaton was absent but fulkerson had brought miss woodburn with her father and mrs leighton and alma to fill up as he said mela was much present and was official with the arrangement of the flowers and the welcome of the guests she imparted this impersonality to her reception of kendricks whom fulkerson met in the outer hall with his party and whom he presented in whisper to them all kendricks smiled under his breath as it were and was then mutely and seriously polite to the leightons alma brought a little bunch of flowers which were lost in those which dryfoos had ordered to be unsparingly provided  it was a kind of satisfaction to mela to have miss vance come and reassuring as to how it would look to have the funeral there miss vance would certainly not have come unless it had been all right she had come and had sent some easter lilies  aint christine coming down fulkerson asked mela  no she aint a bit well and she aint been ever since coonrod died i dont know whats got over her said mela she added well i should a thought mr beaton would a made out to a come  beatons peculiar said fulkerson if he thinks you want him he takes a pleasure in not letting you have him  well goodness knows i dont want him said the girl  christine kept her room and for the most part kept her bed but there seemed nothing definitely the matter with her and she would not let them call a doctor her mother said she reckoned she was beginning to feel the spring weather that always perfectly pulled a body down in new york and mela said if being as cross as two sticks was any sign of springfever christine had it bad she was faithfully kind to her and submitted to all her humors but she recompensed herself by the freest criticism of christine when not in actual attendance on her christine would not suffer mrs mandel to approach her and she had with her father a sullen submission which was not resignation for her apparently conrad had not died or had died in vain  pshaw said mela one morning when she came to breakfast i reckon if we was to send up an old card of mr beatons shed rattle downstairs fast enough if shes sick shes lovesick it makes me sick to see her  mela was talking to mrs mandel but her father looked up from his plate and listened mela went on i dont know whats made the fellow quit comun but he was an aggravatun thing and no more dependable than water its just like air fulkerson said if he thinks you want him hell take a pleasure in not lettun you have him i reckon thats whats the matter with christine i believe in my heart the girl ll die if she dont git him  mela went on to eat her breakfast with her own good appetite she now always came down to keep her father company as she said and she did her best to cheer and comfort him at least she kept the talk going and she had it nearly all to herself for mrs mandel was now merely staying on provisionally and in the absence of any regrets or excuses from christine was looking ruefully forward to the moment when she must leave even this ungentle home for the chances of the ruder world outside  the old man said nothing at table but when mela went up to see if she could do anything for christine he asked mrs mandel again about all the facts of her last interview with beaton  she gave them as fully as she could remember them and the old man made no comment on them but he went out directly after and at the every other week office he climbed the stairs to fulkersons room and asked for beatons address no one yet had taken charge of conrads work and fulkerson was running the thing himself as he said till he could talk with dryfoos about it the old man would not look into the empty room where he had last seen his son alive he turned his face away and hurried by the door     xiii  the course of public events carried beatons private affairs beyond the reach of his simple first intention to renounce his connection with every other week in fact this was not perhaps so simple as it seemed and long before it could be put in effect it appeared still simpler to do nothing about the matterto remain passive and leave the initiative to dryfoos to maintain the dignity of unconsciousness and let recognition of any change in the situation come from those who had caused the change after all it was rather absurd to propose making a purely personal question the pivot on which his relations with every other week turned he took a hint from marchs position and decided that he did not know dryfoos in these relations he knew only fulkerson who had certainly had nothing to do with mrs mandels asking his intentions as he reflected upon this he became less eager to look fulkerson up and make the magazine a partner of his own sufferings this was the soberer mood to which beaton trusted that night even before he slept and he awoke fully confirmed in it as he examined the offence done him in the cold light of day he perceived that it had not come either from mrs mandel who was visibly the faltering and unwilling instrument of it or from christine who was altogether ignorant of it but from dryfoos whom he could not hurt by giving up his place he could only punish fulkerson by that and fulkerson was innocent justice and interest alike dictated the passive course to which beaton inclined and he reflected that he might safely leave the punishment of dryfoos to christine who would find out what had happened and would be able to take care of herself in any encounter of tempers with her father  beaton did not go to the office during the week that followed upon this conclusion but they were used there to these sudden absences of his and as his work for the time was in train nothing was made of his staying away except the sarcastic comment which the thought of him was apt to excite in the literary department he no longer came so much to the leightons and fulkerson was in no state of mind to miss any one there except miss woodburn whom he never missed beaton was left then unmolestedly awaiting the course of destiny when he read in the morning paper over his coffee at maronis the deeply scareheaded story of conrads death and the clubbing of lindau he probably cared as little for either of them as any man that ever saw them but he felt a shock if not a pang at conrads fate so out of keeping with his life and character he did not know what to do and he did nothing he was not asked to the funeral but he had not expected that and when fulkerson brought him notice that lindau was also to be buried from dryfooss house it was without his usual sullen vindictiveness that he kept away in his sort and as much as a man could who was necessarily so much taken up with himself he was sorry for conrads father beaton had a peculiar tenderness for his own father and he imagined how his father would feel if it were he who had been killed in conrads place as it might very well have been he sympathized with himself in view of the possibility and for once they were mistaken who thought him indifferent and merely brutal in his failure to appear at lindaus obsequies  he would really have gone if he had known how to reconcile his presence in that house with the terms of his effective banishment from it and he was rather forgivingly finding himself wronged in the situation when dryfoos knocked at the studio door the morning after lindaus funeral beaton roared out come in as he always did to a knock if he had not a model if he had a model he set the door slightly ajar and with his palette on his thumb frowned at his visitor and told him he could not come in dryfoos fumbled about for the knob in the dim passageway outside and beaton who had experience of peoples difficulties with it suddenly jerked the door open the two men stood confronted and at first sight of each other their quiescent dislike revived each would have been willing to turn away from the other but that was not possible beaton snorted some sort of inarticulate salutation which dryfoos did not try to return he asked if he could see him alone for a minute or two and beaton bade him come in and swept some paintblotched rags from the chair which he told him to take he noticed as the old man sank tremulously into it that his movement was like that of his own father and also that he looked very much like christine dryfoos folded his hands tremulously on the top of his hornhandled stick and he was rather finely haggard with the dark hollows round his black eyes and the fall of the muscles on either side of his chin he had forgotten to take his soft widebrimmed hat off and beaton felt a desire to sketch him just as he sat  dryfoos suddenly pulled himself together from the dreary absence into which he fell at first young man he began maybe ive come here on a fools errand and beaton rather fancied that beginning  but it embarrassed him a little and he said with a shy glance aside i dont know what you mean i reckon dryfoos answered quietly you got your notion though i set that woman on to speak to you the way she done but if there was anything wrong in the way she spoke or if you didnt feel like she had any right to question you up as if we suspected you of anything mean i want you to say so  beaton said nothing and the old man went on  i aint very well up in the ways of the world and i dont pretend to be all i want is to be fair and square with everybody ive made mistakes though in my time he stopped and beaton was not proof against the misery of his face which was twisted as with some strong physical ache i dont know as i want to make any more if i can help it i dont know but what you had a right to keep on comin and if you had i want you to say so dont you be afraid but what ill take it in the right way i dont want to take advantage of anybody and i dont ask you to say any more than that  beaton did not find the humiliation of the man who had humiliated him so sweet as he could have fancied it might be he knew how it had come about and that it was an effect of love for his child it did not matter by what ungracious means she had brought him to know that he loved her better than his own will that his wish for her happiness was stronger than his pride it was enough that he was now somehow brought to give proof of it beaton could not be aware of all that dark coil of circumstance through which dryfooss present action evolved itself the worst of this was buried in the secret of the old mans heart a worm of perpetual torment what was apparent to another was that he was broken by the sorrow that had fallen upon him and it was this that beaton respected and pitied in his impulse to be frank and kind in his answer  no i had no right to keep coming to your house in the way i did unlessunless i meant more than i ever said beaton added i dont say that what you did was usualin this country at any rate but i cant say you were wrong since you speak to me about the matter its only fair to myself to say that a good deal goes on in life without much thinking of consequences thats the way i excuse myself  and you say mrs mandel done right asked dryfoos as if he wished simply to be assured of a point of etiquette  yes she did right ive nothing to complain of  thats all i wanted to know said dryfoos but apparently he had not finished and he did not go though the silence that beaton now kept gave him a chance to do so he began a series of questions which had no relation to the matter in hand though they were strictly personal to beaton what countryman are you he asked after a moment  what countryman beaton frowned back at him  yes are you an american by birth  yes i was born in syracuse  protestant  my father is a scotch seceder  what business is your father in  beaton faltered and blushed then he answered  hes in the monument business as he calls it hes a tombstone cutter now that he was launched beaton saw no reason for not declaring my fathers always been a poor man and worked with his own hands for his living he had too slight esteem socially for dryfoos to conceal a fact from him that he might have wished to blink with others  well thats right said dryfoos i used to farm it myself ive got a good pile of money together now at first it didnt come easy but now its got started it pours in and pours in it seems like there was no end to it ive got well on to three million but it couldnt keep me from losin my son it cant buy me back a minute of his life not all the money in the world can do it  he grieved this out as if to himself rather than to beaton who scarcely ventured to say i knowi am very sorry  how did you come dryfoos interrupted to take up paintin  well i dont know said beaton a little scornfully you dont take a thing of that kind up i fancy i always wanted to paint  father try to stop you  no it wouldnt have been of any use why  my son he wanted to be a preacher and i did stop him or i thought i did but i reckon he was a preacher all the same every minute of his life as you say it aint any use to try to stop a thing like that i reckon if a child has got any particular bent it was given to it and its goin against the grain its goin against the law to try to bend it some other way theres lots of good business men mr beaton twenty of em to every good preacher  i imagine more than twenty said beaton amused and touched through his curiosity as to what the old man was driving at by the quaint simplicity of his speculations  father ever come to the city  no he never has the time and my mothers an invalid  oh brothers and sisters  yes were a large family  i lost two little fellerstwins said dryfoos sadly but we haint ever had but just the five ever take portraits  yes said beaton meeting this zigzag in the queries as seriously as the rest i dont think i am good at it  dryfoos got to his feet i wish youd paint a likeness of my son youve seen him plenty of times we wont fight about the price dont you be afraid of that  beaton was astonished and in a mistaken way he was disgusted he saw that dryfoos was trying to undo mrs mandels work practically and get him to come again to his house that he now conceived of the offence given him as condoned and wished to restore the former situation he knew that he was attempting this for christines sake but he was not the man to imagine that dryfoos was trying not only to tolerate him but to like him and in fact dryfoos was not wholly conscious himself of this end what they both understood was that dryfoos was endeavoring to get at beaton through conrads memory but with one this was its dedication to a purpose of self sacrifice and with the other a vulgar and shameless use of it  i couldnt do it said beaton i couldnt think of attempting it  why not dryfoos persisted we got some photographs of him he didnt like to sit very well but his mother got him to and you know how he looked  i couldnt do iti couldnt i cant even consider it im very sorry i would if it were possible but it isnt possible  i reckon if you see the photographs once  it isnt that mr dryfoos but im not in the way of that kind of thing any more  id give any price youve a mind to name  oh it isnt the money cried beaton beginning to lose control of himself  the old man did not notice him he sat with his head fallen forward and his chin resting on his folded hands thinking of the portrait he saw conrads face before him reproachful astonished but all gentle as it looked when conrad caught his hand that day after he struck him he heard him say father and the sweat gathered on his forehead oh my god he groaned no there aint anything i can do now  beaton did not know whether dryfoos was speaking to him or not he started toward him are you ill  no there aint anything the matter said the old man but i guess ill lay down on your settee a minute he tottered with beatons help to the aesthetic couch covered with a tigerskin on which beaton had once thought of painting a cleopatra but he could never get the right model as the old man stretched himself out on it pale and suffering he did not look much like a cleopatra but beaton was struck with his effectiveness and the likeness between him and his daughter she would make a very good cleopatra in some ways all the time while these thoughts passed through his mind he was afraid dryfoos would die the old man fetched his breath in gasps which presently smoothed and lengthened into his normal breathing beaton got him a glass of wine and after tasting it he sat up  youve got to excuse me he said getting back to his characteristic grimness with surprising suddenness when once he began to recover himself ive been through a good deal lately and sometimes it ketches me round the heart like a pain  in his life of selfish immunity from grief beaton could not understand this experience that poignant sorrow brings he said to himself that dryfoos was going the way of angina pectoris as he began shuffling off the tigerskin he said had you better get up wouldnt you like me to call a doctor  im all right young man dryfoos took his hat and stick from him but he made for the door so uncertainly that beaton put his hand under his elbow and helped him out and down the stairs to his coupe  hadnt you better let me drive home with you he asked  what said dryfoos suspiciously  beaton repeated his question  i guess im able to go home alone said dryfoos in a surly tone and he put his head out of the window and called up home to the driver who immediately started off and left beaton standing beside the curbstone     xiv  beaton wasted the rest of the day in the emotions and speculations which dryfooss call inspired it was not that they continuously occupied him but they broke up the train of other thoughts and spoiled him for work a very little spoiled beaton for work he required just the right mood for work he comprehended perfectly well that dryfoos had made him that extraordinary embassy because he wished him to renew his visits and he easily imagined the means that had brought him to this pass from what he knew of that girl he did not envy her father his meeting with her when he must tell her his mission had failed but had it failed when beaton came to ask himself this question he could only perceive that he and dryfoos had failed to find any ground of sympathy and had parted in the same dislike with which they had met but as to any other failure it was certainly tacit and it still rested with him to give it effect he could go back to dryfooss house as freely as before and it was clear that he was very much desired to come back but if he went back it was also clear that he must go back with intentions more explicit than before and now he had to ask himself just how much or how little he had meant by going there his liking for christine had certainly not increased but the charm on the other hand of holding a leopardess in leash had not yet palled upon him in his life of inconstancies it was a pleasure to rest upon something fixed and the man who had no control over himself liked logically enough to feel his control of some one else the fact cannot other wise be put in terms and the attraction which christine dryfoos had for him apart from this escapes from all terms as anything purely and merely passional must he had seen from the first that she was a cat and so far as youth forecasts such things he felt that she would be a shrew but he had a perverse sense of her beauty and he knew a sort of life in which her power to molest him with her temper could be reduced to the smallest proportions and even broken to pieces then the consciousness of her money entered it was evident that the old man had mentioned his millions in the way of a hint to him of what he might reasonably expect if he would turn and be his soninlaw beaton did not put it to himself in those words and in fact his cogitations were not in words at all it was the play of cognitions of sensations formlessly tending to the effect which can only be very clumsily interpreted in language but when he got to this point in them beaton rose to magnanimity and in a flash of dramatic reverie disposed of a part of dryfooss riches in placing his father and mother and his brothers and sisters beyond all pecuniary anxiety forever he had no shame no scruple in this for he had been a pensioner upon others ever since a syracusan amateur of the arts had detected his talent and given him the money to go and study abroad beaton had always considered the money a loan to be repaid out of his future success but he now never dreamt of repaying it as the man was rich he had even a contempt for the notion of repaying him but this did not prevent him from feeling very keenly the hardships he put his father to in borrowing money from him though he never repaid his father either in this reverie he saw himself sacrificed in marriage with christine dryfoos in a kind of admiring selfpity and he was melted by the spectacle of the dignity with which he suffered all the lifelong trials ensuing from his unselfishness the fancy that alma leighton came bitterly to regret him contributed to soothe and flatter him and he was not sure that margaret vance did not suffer a like loss in him  there had been times when as he believed that beautiful girls high thoughts had tended toward him there had been looks gestures even words that had this effect to him or that seemed to have had it and beaton saw that he might easily construe mrs horns confidential appeal to him to get margaret interested in art again as something by no means necessarily offensive even though it had been made to him as to a master of illusion if mrs horn had to choose between him and the life of good works to which her niece was visibly abandoning herself beaton could not doubt which she would choose the only question was how real the danger of a life of good works was  as he thought of these two girls one so charming and the other so divine it became indefinitely difficult to renounce them for christine dryfoos with her sultry temper and her earthbound ideals life had been so flattering to beaton hitherto that he could not believe them both finally indifferent and if they were not indifferent perhaps he did not wish either of them to be very definite what he really longed for was their sympathy for a man who is able to walk round quite ruthlessly on the feelings of others often has very tender feelings of his own easily lacerated and eagerly responsive to the caresses of compassion in this frame beaton determined to go that afternoon though it was not mrs horns day and call upon her in the hope of possibly seeing miss vance alone as he continued in it he took this for a sign and actually went it did not fall out at once as he wished but he got mrs horn to talking again about her niece and mrs horn again regretted that nothing could be done by the fine arts to reclaim margaret from good works  is she at home will you let me see her asked beacon with something of the scientific interest of a physician inquiring for a patient whose symptoms have been rehearsed to him he had not asked for her before  yes certainly said mrs horn and she went herself to call margaret and she did not return with her the girl entered with the gentle grace peculiar to her and beaton bent as he was on his own consolation could not help being struck with the spiritual exaltation of her look at sight of her the vague hope he had never quite relinquished that they might be something more than aesthetic friends died in his heart she wore black as she often did but in spite of its fashion her dress received a nunlike effect from the pensive absence of her face decidedly thought beaton she is far gone in good works  but he rose all the same to meet her on the old level and he began at once to talk to her of the subject he had been discussing with her aunt he said frankly that they both felt she had unjustifiably turned her back upon possibilities which she ought not to neglect  you know very well she answered that i couldnt do anything in that way worth the time i should waste on it dont talk of it please i suppose my aunt has been asking you to say this but its no use im sorry its no use she wishes it so much but im not sorry otherwise you can find the pleasure at least of doing good work in it but i couldnt find anything in it but a barren amusement mr wetmore is right for me its like enjoying an opera or a ball  thats one of wetmores phrases hed sacrifice anything to them  she put aside the whole subject with a look you were not at mr dryfooss the other day have you seen them any of them lately  i havent been there for some time no said beaton evasively but he thought if he was to get on to anything he had better be candid mr dryfoos was at my studio this morning hes got a queer notion he wants me to paint his sons portrait  she started and will you  no i couldnt do such a thing it isnt in my way i told him so his son had a beautiful face an antique profile a sort of early christian type but im too much of a pagan for that sort of thing  yes  yes beaton continued not quite liking her assent after he had invited it he had his pride in being a pagan a greek but it failed him in her presence now and he wished that she had protested he was none he was a singular creature a kind of survival an exile in our time and place i dont know we dont quite expect a saint to be rustic but with all his goodness conrad dryfoos was a country person if he were not dying for a cause you could imagine him milking beaton intended a contempt that came from the bitterness of having himself once milked the family cow  his contempt did not reach miss vance he died for a cause she said the holiest  of labor  of peace he was there to persuade the strikers to be quiet and go home  i havent been quite sure said beaton but in any case he had no business there the police were on hand to do the persuading  i cant let you talk so cried the girl its shocking oh i know its the way people talk and the worst is that in the sight of the world its the right way but the blessing on the peacemakers is not for the policemen with their clubs  beaton saw that she was nervous he made his reflection that she was altogether too far gone in good works for the fine arts to reach her he began to think how he could turn her primitive christianity to the account of his modern heathenism he had no deeper design than to get flattered back into his own favor far enough to find courage for some sort of decisive step in his heart he was trying to will whether he should or should not go back to dryfooss house it could not be from the caprice that had formerly taken him it must be from a definite purpose again he realized this of course you are right he said i wish i could have answered that old man differently i fancy he was bound up in his son though he quarrelled with him and crossed him but i couldnt do it it wasnt possible he said to himself that if she said no now he would be ruled by her agreement with him and if she disagreed with him he would be ruled still by the chance and would go no more to the dryfooses he found himself embarrassed to the point of blushing when she said nothing and left him as it were on his own hands i should like to have given him that comfort i fancy he hasnt much comfort in life but there seems no comfort in me  he dropped his head in a fit attitude for compassion but she poured no pity upon it  there is no comfort for us in ourselves she said its hard to get outside but theres only despair within when we think we have done something for others by some great effort we find its all for our own vanity  yes said beaton if i could paint pictures for righteousness sake i should have been glad to do conrad dryfoos for his father i felt sorry for him did the rest seem very much broken up you saw them all  not all miss dryfoos was ill her sister said its hard to tell how much people suffer his mother seemed bewildered the younger sister is a simple creature she looks like him i think she must have something of his spirit  not much spirit of any kind i imagine said beaton but shes amiably material did they say miss dryfoos was seriously ill  no i supposed she might be prostrated by her brothers death  does she seem that kind of person to you miss vance asked beaton  i dont know i havent tried to see so much of them as i might the past winter i was not sure about her when i met her ive never seen much of people except in my own set and thevery poor i have been afraid i didnt understand her she may have a kind of pride that would not let her do herself justice  beaton felt the unconscious dislike in the endeavor of praise then she seems to you like a person whose lifeits trials its chanceswould make more of than she is now  i didnt say that i cant judge of her at all but where we dont know dont you think we ought to imagine the best  oh yes said beaton i didnt know but what i once said of them might have prejudiced you against them i have accused myself of it he always took a tone of conscientiousness of selfcensure in talking with miss vance he could not help it  oh no and i never allowed myself to form any judgment of her she is very pretty dont you think in a kind of way  very  she has a beautiful brunette coloring that floury white and the delicate pink in it her eyes are beautiful  shes graceful too said beaton ive tried her in color but i didnt make it out  ive wondered sometimes said miss vance whether that elusive quality you find in some people you try to paint doesnt characterize them all through miss dryfoos might be ever so much finer and better than we would find out in the society way that seems the only way  perhaps said beaton gloomily and he went away profoundly discouraged by this last analysis of christines character the angelic imperviousness of miss vance to properties of which his own wickedness was so keenly aware in christine might have made him laugh if it had not been such a serious affair with him as it was he smiled to think how very differently alma leighton would have judged her from miss vances premises he liked that clear vision of almas even when it pierced his own disguises yes that was the light he had let die out and it might have shone upon his path through life beaton never felt so poignantly the disadvantage of having on any given occasion been wanting to his own interests through his selflove as in this he had no one to blame but himself for what had happened but he blamed alma for what might happen in the future because she shut out the way of retrieval and return when be thought of the attitude she had taken toward him it seemed incredible and he was always longing to give her a final chance to reverse her final judgment it appeared to him that the time had come for this now if ever     xv  while we are still young we feel a kind of pride a sort of fierce pleasure in any important experience such as we have read of or heard of in the lives of others no matter how painful it was this pride this pleasure which beaton now felt in realizing that the toils of fate were about him that between him and a future of which christine dryfoos must be the genius there was nothing but the will the mood the fancy of a girl who had not given him the hope that either could ever again be in his favor he had nothing to trust to in fact but his knowledge that he had once had them all she did not deny that but neither did she conceal that he had flung away his power over them and she had told him that they never could be his again a man knows that he can love and wholly cease to love not once merely but several times he recognizes the fact in regard to himself both theoretically and practically but in regard to women he cherishes the superstition of the romances that love is once for all and forever it was because beaton would not believe that alma leighton being a woman could put him out of her heart after suffering him to steal into it that he now hoped anything from her and she had been so explicit when they last spoke of that affair that he did not hope much he said to himself that he was going to cast himself on her mercy to take whatever chance of life love and work there was in her having the smallest pity on him if she would have none then there was but one thing he could do marry christine and go abroad he did not see how he could bring this alternative to bear upon alma even if she knew what he would do in case of a final rejection he had grounds for fearing she would not care but he brought it to bear upon himself and it nerved him to a desperate courage he could hardly wait for evening to come before he went to see her when it came it seemed to have come too soon he had wrought himself thoroughly into the conviction that he was in earnest and that everything depended upon her answer to him but it was not till he found himself in her presence and alone with her that he realized the truth of his conviction then the influences of her grace her gayety her arch beauty above all her good sense penetrated his soul like a subtle intoxication and he said to himself that he was right he could not live without her these attributes of hers were what he needed to win him to cheer him to charm him to guide him he longed so to please her to ingratiate himself with her that he attempted to be light like her in his talk but lapsed into abysmal absences and gloomy recesses of introspection  what are you laughing at he asked suddenly starting from one of these  what you are thinking of  its nothing to laugh at do you know what im thinking of  dont tell if its dreadful  oh i dare say you wouldnt think its dreadful he said with bitterness its simply the case of a man who has made a fool of himself and sees no help of retrieval in himself  can any one else help a man unmake a fool of himself she asked with a smile  yes in a case like this  dear me this is very interesting  she did not ask him what the case was but he was launched now and he pressed on i am the man who has made a fool of himself  oh  and you can help me out if you will alma i wish you could see me as i really am  do you mr beacon perhaps i do  no you dont you formulated me in a certain way and you wont allow for the change that takes place in every one you have changed why shouldnt i  has this to do with your having made a fool of yourself  yes  oh then i dont see how you have changed  she laughed and he too ruefully youre cruel not but what i deserve your mockery but the change was not from the capacity of making a fool of myself i suppose i shall always do that more or lessunless you help me alma why cant you have a little compassion you know that i must always love you  nothing makes me doubt that like your saying it mr beaton but now youve broken your word  you are to blame for that you knew i couldnt keep it  yes im to blame i was wrong to let you comeafter that and so i forgive you for speaking to me in that way again but its perfectly impossible and perfectly useless for me to hear you any more on that subject and sogoodbye  she rose and he perforce with her and do you mean it he asked forever  forever this is truly the last time i will ever see you if i can help it oh i feel sorry enough for you she said with a glance at his face i do believe you are in earnest but its too late now dont let us talk about it any more but we shall if we meet and so  and so goodbye well ive nothing more to say and i might as well say that i think youve been very good to me it seems to me as if you had beenshall i say ittrying to give me a chance is that so she dropped her eyes and did not answer  you found it was no use well i thank you for trying its curious to think that i once had your trust your regard and now i havent it you dont mind my remembering that i had itll be some little consolation and i believe it will be some help i know i cant retrieve the past now it is too late it seems too preposterousperfectly luridthat i could have been going to tell you what a tangle id got myself in and to ask you to help untangle me i must choke in the infernal coil but id like to have the sweetness of your pity in itwhatever it is  she put out her hand whatever it is i do pity you i said that  thank you he kissed the band she gave him and went  he had gone on some such terms before was it now for the last time she believed it was she felt in herself a satiety a fatigue in which his good looks his invented airs and poses his real trouble were all alike repulsive she did not acquit herself of the wrong of having let him think she might yet have liked him as she once did but she had been honestly willing to see whether she could it had mystified her to find that when they first met in new york after their summer in st barnaby she cared nothing for him she had expected to punish him for his neglect and then fancy him as before but she did not more and more she saw him selfish and mean weakwilled narrowminded and hardhearted and aimless with all his talent she admired his talent in proportion as she learned more of artists and perceived how uncommon it was but she said to herself that if she were going to devote herself to art she would do it at firsthand she was perfectly serene and happy in her final rejection of beaton he had worn out not only her fancy but her sympathy too  this was what her mother would not believe when alma reported the interview to her she would not believe it was the last time they should meet death itself can hardly convince us that it is the last time of anything of everything between ourselves and the dead well alma she said i hope youll never regret what youve done  you may be sure i shall not regret it if ever im lowspirited about anything ill think of giving mr beaton his freedom and that will cheer me up  and dont you expect to get married do you intend to be an old maid demanded her mother in the bonds of the superstition women have so long been under to the effect that every woman must wish to get married if for no other purpose than to avoid being an old maid  well mamma said alma i intend being a young one for a few years yet and then ill see if i meet the right person all well and good if not not but i shall pick and choose as a man does i wont merely be picked and chosen  you cant help yourself you may be very glad if you are picked and chosen  what nonsense mamma a girl can get any man she wants if she goes about it the right way and when my fated fairy prince comes along i shall just simply make furious love to him and grab him of course i shall make a decent pretence of talking in my sleep i believe its done that way more than half the time the fated fairy prince wouldnt see the princess in nine cases out of ten if she didnt say something he would go mooning along after the maids of honor  mrs leighton tried to look unspeakable horror but she broke down and laughed well you are a strange girl alma  i dont know about that but one thing i do know mamma and that is that prince beaton isnt the f f p for me how strange you are mamma dont you think it would be perfectly disgusting to accept a person you didnt care for and let him go on and love you and marry you its sickening  why certainly alma its only because i know you did care for him once  and now i dont and he didnt care for me once and now he does and so were quits  if i could believe  you had better brace up and try mamma for as mr fulkerson says its as sure as guns from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot hes loathsome to me and he keeps getting loathsomer ugh goodnight     xvi  well i guess shes given him the grand bounce at last said fulkerson to march in one of their moments of confidence at the office thats mads inference from appearancesand disappearances and some little hints from alma leighton  well i dont know that i have any criticisms to offer said march it may be bad for beaton but its a very good thing for miss leighton upon the whole i believe i congratulate her  well i dont know i always kind of hoped it would turn out the other way you know i always had a sneaking fondness for the fellow  miss leighton seems not to have had  its a pity she hadnt i tell you march it aint so easy for a girl to get married here in the east that she can afford to despise any chance  isnt that rather a low view of it  its a commonsense view beaton has the making of a firstrate fellow in him hes the raw material of a great artist and a good citizen all he wants is somebody to take him in hand and keep him from makin an ass of himself and kickin over the traces generally and ridin two or three horses bareback at once  it seems a simple problem though the metaphor is rather complicated said march but talk to miss leighton about it i havent given beaton the grand bounce  he began to turn over the manuscripts on his table and fulkerson went away but march found himself thinking of the matter from time to time during the day and he spoke to his wife about it when he went home she surprised him by taking fulkersons view of it  yes its a pity she couldnt have made up her mind to have him its better for a woman to be married  i thought paul only went so far as to say it was well but what would become of miss leightons artistic career if she married  oh her artistic career said mrs march with matronly contempt of it  but look here cried her husband suppose she doesnt like him  how can a girl of that age tell whether she likes any one or not  it seems to me you were able to tell at that age isabel but lets examine this thing this thing i believe fulkerson is characterizing my whole parlance as well as your morals why shouldnt we rejoice as much at a nonmarriage as a marriage when we consider the enormous risks people take in linking their lives together after not half so much thought as goes to an ordinary horse trade i think we ought to be glad whenever they dont do it i believe that this popular demand for the matrimony of others comes from our novelreading we get to thinking that there is no other happiness or goodfortune in life except marriage and its offered in fiction as the highest premium for virtue courage beauty learning and saving human life we all know it isnt we know that in reality marriage is dog cheap and anybody can have it for the askingif he keeps asking enough people byandby some fellow will wake up and see that a firstclass story can be written from the antimarriage point of view and hell begin with an engaged couple and devote his novel to disengaging them and rendering them separately happy ever after in the denouement it will make his everlasting fortune  why dont you write it basil she asked its a delightful idea you could do it splendidly  he became fascinated with the notion he developed it in detail but at the end he sighed and said with this every other week work on my hands of course i cant attempt a novel but perhaps i shant have it long  she was instantly anxious to know what he meant and the novel and miss leightons affair were both dropped out of their thoughts what do you mean has mr fulkerson said anything yet  not a word he knows no more about it than i do dryfoos hasnt spoken and were both afraid to ask him of course i couldnt ask him  no  but its pretty uncomfortable to be kept hanging by the gills so as fulkerson says  yes we dont know what to do  march and fulkerson said the same to each other and fulkerson said that if the old man pulled out he did not know what would happen he had no capital to carry the thing on and the very fact that the old man had pulled out would damage it so that it would be hard to get anybody else to put it in the mean time fulkerson was running conrads officework when he ought to be looking after the outside interests of the thing and he could not see the day when he could get married  i dont know which its worse for march you or me i dont know under the circumstances whether its worse to have a family or to want to have one of courseof course we cant hurry the old man up it wouldnt be decent and it would be dangerous we got to wait  he almost decided to draw upon dryfoos for some money he did not need any but he said maybe the demand would act as a hint upon him one day about a week after almas final rejection of beaton dryfoos came into marchs office fulkerson was out but the old man seemed not to have tried to see him  he put his hat on the floor by his chair after he sat down and looked at march awhile with his old eyes which had the vitreous glitter of old eyes stimulated to sleeplessness then he said abruptly mr march how would you like to take this thing off my hands  i dont understand exactly march began but of course he understood that dryfoos was offering to let him have every other week on some terms or other and his heart leaped with hope  the old man knew he understood and so he did not explain he said i am going to europe to take my family there the doctor thinks it might do my wife some good and i aint very well myself and my girls both want to go and so were goin if you want to take this thing off my hands i reckon i can let you have it in most any shape you say youre all settled here in new york and i dont suppose you want to break up much at your time of life and ive been thinkin whether you wouldnt like to take the thing  the word which dryfoos had now used three times made march at last think of fulkerson he had been filled too full of himself to think of any one else till he had mastered the notion of such wonderful good fortune as seemed about falling to him but now he did think of fulkerson and with some shame and confusion for he remembered how when dryfoos had last approached him there on the business of his connection with every other week he had been very haughty with him and told him that he did not know him in this connection he blushed to find how far his thoughts had now run without encountering this obstacle of etiquette  have you spoken to mr fulkerson he asked  no i haint it aint a question of management its a question of buying and selling i offer the thing to you first i reckon fulkerson couldnt get on very well without you  march saw the real difference in the two cases and he was glad to see it because he could act more decisively if not hampered by an obligation to consistency i am gratified of course mr dryfoos extremely gratified and its no use pretending that i shouldnt be happy beyond bounds to get possession of every other week but i dont feel quite free to talk about it apart from mr fulkerson  oh all right said the old man with quick offence  march hastened to say i feel bound to mr fulkerson in every way he got me to come here and i couldnt even seem to act without him  he put it questioningly and the old man answered  yes i can see that when ll he be in i can wait but he looked impatient  very soon now said march looking at his watch he was only to be gone a moment and while he went on to talk with dryfoos he wondered why the old man should have come first to speak with him and whether it was from some obscure wish to make him reparation for displeasures in the past or from a distrust or dislike of fulkerson whichever light he looked at it in it was flattering  do you think of going abroad soon he asked  what yesi dont knowi reckon we got our passage engaged its on one of them french boats were goin to paris  oh that will be interesting to the young ladies  yes i reckon were goin for them taint likely my wife and me would want to pull up stakes at our age said the old man sorrowfully  but you may find it do you good mr dryfoos said march with a kindness that was real mixed as it was with the selfish interest he now had in the intended voyage  well maybe maybe sighed the old man and he dropped his head forward it dont make a great deal of difference what we do or we dont do for the few years left  i hope mrs dryfoos is as well as usual said march finding the ground delicate and difficult  middlin middlin said the old man my daughter christine she aint very well  oh said march it was quite impossible for him to affect a more explicit interest in the fact he and dryfoos sat silent for a few moments and he was vainly casting about in his thought for something else which would tide them over the interval till fulkerson came when he heard his step on the stairs  hello hello he said meeting of the clans it was always a meeting of the clans with fulkerson or a field day or an extra session or a regular conclave whenever he saw people of any common interest together haint seen you here for a good while mr dryfoos did think some of running away with every other week one while but couldnt seem to work march up to the point  he gave dryfoos his hand and pushed aside the papers on the corner of marchs desk and sat down there and went on briskly with the nonsense he could always talk while he was waiting for another to develop any matter of business he told march afterward that he scented business in the air as soon as he came into the room where he and dryfoos were sitting  dryfoos seemed determined to leave the word to march who said after an inquiring look at him mr dryfoos has been proposing to let us have every other week fulkerson  well thats good that suits yours truly march  fulkerson publishers and proprietors wont pretend it dont if the terms are all right  the terms said the old man are whatever you want em i havent got any more use for the concern he gulped and stopped they knew what he was thinking of and they looked down in pity he went on i wont put any more money in it but what ive put in aready can stay and you can pay me four per cent  he got upon his feet and march and fulkerson stood too  well i call that pretty white said fulkerson its a bargain as far as im concerned i suppose youll want to talk it over with your wife march  yes i shall said march i can see that its a great chance but i want to talk it over with my wife  well thats right said the old man let me hear from you tomorrow  he went out and fulkerson began to dance round the room he caught march about his stalwart girth and tried to make him waltz the officeboy came to the door and looked on with approval  come come you idiot said march rooting himself to the carpet  its just throwing the thing into our mouths said fulkerson the wedding will be this day week no cards teedlelumptydiddle teedlelumptydee what do you suppose he means by it march he asked bringing himself soberly up of a sudden what is his little game or is he crazy it dont seem like the dryfoos of my previous acquaintance  i suppose march suggested that hes got money enough so that he dont care for this  pshaw youre a poet dont you know that the more money that kind of man has got the more he cares for money its some fancy of hislike having lindaus funeral at his houseby jings march i believe youre his fancy  oh now dont you be a poet fulkerson  i do he seemed to take a kind of shine to you from the day you wouldnt turn off old lindau he did indeed it kind of shook him up it made him think you had something in you he was deceived by appearances look here im going round to see mrs march with you and explain the thing to her i know mrs march she wouldnt believe you knew what you were going in for she has a great respect for your mind but she dont think youve got any sense heigh  all right said march glad of the notion and it was really a comfort to have fulkerson with him to develop all the points and it was delightful to see how clearly and quickly she seized them it made march proud of her she was only angry that they had lost any time in coming to submit so plain a case to her  mr dryfoos might change his mind in the night and then everything would be lost they must go to him instantly and tell him that they accepted they must telegraph him  might as well send a district messenger hed get there next week said fulkerson no no it ll all keep till tomorrow and be the better for it if hes got this fancy for march as i say he aint agoing to change it in a single night people dont change their fancies for march in a lifetime heigh  when fulkerson turned up very early at the office next morning as march did he was less strenuous about dryfooss fancy for march it was as if miss woodburn might have blown cold upon that theory as something unjust to his own merit for which she would naturally be more jealous than he  march told him what he had forgotten to tell him the day before though he had been trying all through their excited talk to get it in that the dryfooses were going abroad  oh ho cried fulkerson thats the milk in the cocoanut is it well i thought there must be something  but this fact had not changed mrs march at all in her conviction that it was mr dryfooss fancy for her husband which had moved him to make him this extraordinary offer and she reminded him that it had first been made to him without regard to fulkerson and perhaps she went on mr dryfoos has been changedsoftened and doesnt find money all in all any more hes had enough to change him poor old man  does anything from without change us her husband mused aloud were brought up to think so by the novelists who really have the charge of peoples thinking nowadays but i doubt it especially if the thing outside is some great event something cataclysmal like this tremendous sorrow of dryfooss  then what is it that changes us demanded his wife almost angry with him for his heresy  well it wont do to say the holy spirit indwelling that would sound like cant at this day but the old fellows that used to say that had some glimpses of the truth they knew that it is the still small voice that the soul heeds not the deafening blasts of doom i suppose i should have to say that we didnt change at all we develop theres the making of several characters in each of us we are each several characters and sometimes this character has the lead in us and sometimes that from what fulkerson has told me of dryfoos i should say he had always had the potentiality of better things in him than he has ever been yet and perhaps the time has come for the good to have its chance the growth in one direction has stopped its begun in another thats all the man hasnt been changed by his sons death it stunned it benumbed him but it couldnt change him it was an event like any other and it had to happen as much as his being born it was forecast from the beginning of time and was as entirely an effect of his coming into the world  basil basil cried his wife this is fatalism  then you think he said that a sparrow falls to the ground without the will of god and he laughed provokingly but he went on more soberly i dont know what it all means isabel though i believe it means good what did christ himself say that if one rose from the dead it would not avail and yet we are always looking for the miraculous i believe that unhappy old man truly grieves for his son whom he treated cruelly without the final intention of cruelty for he loved him and wished to be proud of him but i dont think his death has changed him any more than the smallest event in the chain of events remotely working through his nature from the beginning but why do you think hes changed at all because he offers to sell me every other week on easy terms he says himself that he has no further use for the thing and he knows perfectly well that he couldnt get his money out of it now without an enormous shrinkage he couldnt appear at this late day as the owner and sell it to anybody but fulkerson and me for a fifth of what its cost him he can sell it to us for all its cost him and four per cent is no bad interest on his money till we can pay it back its a good thing for us but we have to ask whether dryfoos has done us the good or whether its the blessing of heaven if its merely the blessing of heaven i dont propose being grateful for it  march laughed again and his wife said its disgusting  its business he assented business is business but i dont say it isnt disgusting lindau had a low opinion of it  i think that with all his faults mr dryfoos is a better man than lindau she proclaimed  well hes certainly able to offer us a better thing in every other week said march  she knew he was enamoured of the literary finish of his cynicism and that at heart he was as humbly and truly grateful as she was for the goodfortune opening to them     xvii  beaton was at his best when he parted for the last time with alma leighton for he saw then that what had happened to him was the necessary consequence of what he had been if not what he had done afterward he lost this clear vision he began to deny the fact he drew upon his knowledge of life and in arguing himself into a different frame of mind he alleged the case of different people who had done and been much worse things than he and yet no such disagreeable consequence had befallen them then he saw that it was all the work of blind chance and he said to himself that it was this that made him desperate and willing to call evil his good and to take his own wherever he could find it there was a great deal that was literary and factitious and tawdry in the mood in which he went to see christine dryfoos the night when the marches sat talking their prospects over and nothing that was decided in his purpose he knew what the drift of his mind was but he had always preferred to let chance determine his events and now since chance had played him such an ill turn with alma he left it the whole responsibility not in terms but in effect this was his thought as he walked on uptown to pay the first of the visits which dryfoos had practically invited him to resume he had an insolent satisfaction in having delayed it so long if he was going back he was going back on his own conditions and these were to be as hard and humiliating as he could make them but this intention again was inchoate floating the stuff of an intention rather than intention an expression of temperament chiefly  he had been expected before that christine had got out of mela that her father had been at beatons studio and then she had gone at the old man and got from him every smallest fact of the interview there she had flung back in his teeth the goodwill toward herself with which he had gone to beaton she was furious with shame and resentment she told him he had made bad worse that he had made a fool of himself to no end she spared neither his age nor his griefbroken spirit in which his will could not rise against hers she filled the house with her rage screaming it out upon him but when her fury was once spent she began to have some hopes from what her father had done she no longer kept her bed every evening she dressed herself in the dress beaton admired the most and sat up till a certain hour to receive him she had fixed a day in her own mind before which if he came she would forgive him all he had made her suffer the mortification the suspense the despair beyond this she had the purpose of making her father go to europe she felt that she could no longer live in america with the double disgrace that had been put upon her  beaton rang and while the servant was coming the insolent caprice seized him to ask for the young ladies instead of the old man as he had supposed of course he should do the maid who answered the bell in the place of the reluctant irishman of other days had all his hesitation in admitting that the young ladies were at home  he found mela in the drawingroom at sight of him she looked scared but she seemed to be reassured by his calm he asked if he was not to have the pleasure of seeing miss dryfoos too and mela said she reckoned the girl had gone upstairs to tell her mela was in black and beaton noted how well the solid sable became her rich redblonde beauty he wondered what the effect would be with christine  but she when she appeared was not in mourning he fancied that she wore the lustrous black silk with the breadths of white venetian lace about the neck which he had praised because he praised it her cheeks burned with a jacqueminot crimson what should be white in her face was chalky white she carried a plumed ostrich fan black and soft and after giving him her hand sat down and waved it to and fro slowly as he remembered her doing the night they first met she had no ideas except such as related intimately to herself and she had no gabble like mela and she let him talk it was past the day when she promised herself she would forgive him but as he talked on she felt all her passion for him revive and the conflict of desires the desire to hate the desire to love made a dizzying whirl in her brain she looked at him half doubting whether he was really there or not he had never looked so handsome with his dreamy eyes floating under his heavy overhanging hair and his pointed brown beard defined against his lustrous shirtfront his mellowly modulated mysterious voice lulled her when mela made an errand out of the room and beaton crossed to her and sat down by her she shivered  are you cold he asked and she felt the cruel mockery and exultant consciousness of power in his tone as perhaps a wild thing feels captivity in the voice of its keeper but now she said she would still forgive him if he asked her  mela came back and the talk fell again to the former level but beaton had not said anything that really meant what she wished and she saw that he intended to say nothing her heart began to burn like a fire in her breast  you been tellun him about our goun to europe mela asked  no said christine briefly and looking at the fan spread out on her lap  beaton asked when and then he rose and said if it was so soon he supposed he should not see them again unless he saw them in paris he might very likely run over during the summer he said to himself that he had given it a fair trial with christine and he could not make it go  christine rose with a kind of gasp and mechanically followed him to the door of the drawingroom mela came too and while he was putting on his overcoat she gurgled and bubbled in goodhumor with all the world christine stood looking at him and thinking how still handsomer he was in his overcoat and that fire burned fiercer in her she felt him more than life to her and knew him lost and the frenzy that makes a woman kill the man she loves or fling vitriol to destroy the beauty she cannot have for all hers possessed her lawless soul he gave his hand to mela and said in his windharp stop goodbye  as he put out his hand to christine she pushed it aside with a scream of rage she flashed at him and with both hands made a feline pass at the face he bent toward her he sprang back and after an instant of stupefaction he pulled open the door behind him and ran out into the street  well christine dryfoos said mela sprang at him like a wildcat  i dont care christine shrieked ill tear his eyes out she flew upstairs to her own room and left the burden of the explanation to mela who did it justice  beaton found himself he did not know how in his studio reeking with perspiration and breathless he must almost have run he struck a match with a shaking hand and looked at his face in the glass he expected to see the bleeding marks of her nails on his cheeks but he could see nothing he grovelled inwardly it was all so low and coarse and vulgar it was all so just and apt to his deserts  there was a pistol among the dusty bricabrac on the mantel which he had kept loaded to fire at a cat in the area he took it and sat looking into the muzzle wishing it might go off by accident and kill him it slipped through his hand and struck the floor and there was a report he sprang into the air feeling that he had been shot but he found himself still alive with only a burning line along his cheek such as one of christines fingernails might have left  he laughed with cynical recognition of the fact that he had got his punishment in the right way and that his case was not to be dignified into tragedy     xviii  the marches with fulkerson went to see the dryfooses off on the french steamer there was no longer any business obligation on them to be civil and there was greater kindness for that reason in the attention they offered every other week had been made over to the joint ownership of march and fulkerson and the details arranged with a hardness on dryfooss side which certainly left mrs march with a sense of his incomplete regeneration yet when she saw him there on the steamer she pitied him he looked wearied and bewildered even his wife with her twitching head and her prophecies of evil croaked hoarsely out while she clung to mrs marchs hand where they sat together till the leavetakers were ordered ashore was less pathetic mela was looking after both of them and trying to cheer them in a joyful excitement i tell em its goun to add ten years to both their lives she said the voyage ll do their healths good and then were gittun away from that miserble pack o servants that was eatun us up there in new york i hate the place she said as if they had already left it yes mrs mandels goun too she added following the direction of mrs marchs eyes where they noted mrs mandel speaking to christine on the other side of the cabin her and christine had a kind of a spat and she was goun to leave but here only the other day christine offered to make it up with her and now theyre as thick as thieves well i reckon we couldnt very well a got along without her shes about the only one that speaks french in this family  mrs marchs eyes still dwelt upon christines face it was full of a furtive wildness she seemed to be keeping a watch to prevent herself from looking as if she were looking for some one do you know mrs march said to her husband as they jingled along homeward in the christopher street bobtail car i thought she was in love with that detestable mr beaton of yours at one time and that he was amusing himself with her  i can bear a good deal isabel said march but i wish you wouldnt attribute beaton to me hes the invention of that mr fulkerson of yours  well at any rate i hope now youll both get rid of him in the reforms youre going to carry out  these reforms were for a greater economy in the management of every other week but in their very nature they could not include the suppression of beaton he had always shown himself capable and loyal to the interests of the magazine and both the new owners were glad to keep him he was glad to stay though he made a gruff pretence of indifference when they came to look over the new arrangement with him in his heart he knew that he was a fraud but at least he could say to himself with truth that he had not now the shame of taking dryfooss money  march and fulkerson retrenched at several points where it had seemed indispensable to spend as long as they were not spending their own that was only human fulkerson absorbed conrads department into his and march found that he could dispense with kendricks in the place of assistant which he had lately filled since fulkerson had decided that march was overworked they reduced the number of illustrated articles and they systematized the payment of contributors strictly according to the sales of each number on their original plan of cooperation they had got to paying rather lavishly for material without reference to the sales  fulkerson took a little time to get married and went on his wedding journey out to niagara and down the st lawrence to quebec over the line of travel that the marches had taken on their wedding journey he had the pleasure of going from montreal to quebec on the same boat on which he first met march  they have continued very good friends and their wives are almost without the rivalry that usually embitters the wives of partners at first mrs march did not like mrs fulkersons speaking of her husband as the ownah and march as the edito but it appeared that this was only a convenient method of recognizing the predominant quality in each and was meant neither to affirm nor to deny anything colonel woodburn offered as his contribution to the celebration of the copartnership which fulkerson could not be prevented from dedicating with a little dinner the story of fulkersons magnanimous behavior in regard to dryfoos at that crucial moment when it was a question whether he should give up dryfoos or give up march fulkerson winced at it but mrs march told her husband that now whatever happened she should never have any misgivings of fulkerson again and she asked him if he did not think he ought to apologize to him for the doubts with which he had once inspired her march said that he did not think so  the fulkersons spent the summer at a seaside hotel in easy reach of the city but they returned early to mrs leightons with whom they are to board till spring when they are going to fit up fulkersons bachelor apartment for housekeeping mrs march with her boston scruple thinks it will be odd living over the every other week offices but there will be a separate street entrance to the apartment and besides in new york you may do anything  the future of the leightons promises no immediate change kendricks goes there a good deal to see the fulkersons and mrs fulkerson says he comes to see alma he has seemed taken with her ever since he first met her at dryfooss the day of lindaus funeral and though fulkerson objects to dating a fancy of that kind from an occasion of that kind he justly argues with march that there can be no harm in it and that we are liable to be struck by lightning any time in the mean while there is no proof that alma returns kendrickss interest if he feels any she has got a little bit of color into the fall exhibition but the fall exhibition is never so good as the spring exhibition wetmore is rather sorry she has succeeded in this though he promoted her success he says her real hope is in black and white and it is a pity for her to lose sight of her original aim of drawing for illustration  news has come from paris of the engagement of christine dryfoos there the dryfooses met with the success denied them in new york many american plutocrats must await their apotheosis in europe where society has them as it were in a translation shortly after their arrival they were celebrated in the news papers as the first millionaire american family of naturalgas extraction who had arrived in the capital of civilization and at a french wateringplace christine encountered her fatea nobleman full of present debts and of duels in the past fulkerson says the old man can manage the debtor and christine can look out for the duellist they say those fellows generally whip their wives hed better not try it with christine i reckon unless hes practised with a panther  one day shortly after their return to town in the autumn from the brief summer outing they permitted themselves the marches met margaret vance at first they did not know her in the dress of the sisterhood which she wore but she smiled joyfully almost gayly on seeing them and though she hurried by with the sister who accompanied her and did not stay to speak they felt that the peace that passeth understanding had looked at them from her eyes  well she is at rest there cant be any doubt of that he said as he glanced round at the drifting black robe which followed her free nunlike walk  yes now she can do all the good she likes sighed his wife i wonderi wonder if she ever told his father about her talk with poor conrad that day he was shot  i dont know i dont care in any event it would be right she did nothing wrong if she unwittingly sent him to his death she sent him to die for gods sake for mans sake  yesyes but still  well we must trust that look of hers   pg editors bookmarks      affected absence of mind     be good sweet man and let who will be clever     comfort of the critical

his best friend to a phrase        their silver wedding journey  by william dean howells     part i  note several chapter heading numerals are out of order or missing in this 1899 edition however the text is all present in the three volumes dw     i  you need the rest said the business end and your wife wants you to go as well as your doctor besides its your sabbatical year and you could send back a lot of stuff for the magazine  is that your notion of a sabbatical year asked the editor  no i throw that out as a bait to your conscience you neednt write a line while youre gone i wish you wouldnt for your own sake although every number that hasnt got you in it is a back number for me  thats very nice of you fulkerson said the editor i suppose you realize that its nine years since we took every other week from dryfoos  well that makes it all the more sabbatical said fulkerson the two extra years that youve put in here over and above the old style sabbatical seven are just so much more to your credit it was your right to go two years ago and now its your duty couldnt you look at it in that light  i dare say mrs march could the editor assented i dont believe she could be brought to regard it as a pleasure on any other terms  of course not said fulkerson if you wont take a year take three months and call it a sabbatical summer but go anyway you can make up half a dozen numbers ahead and tom here knows your ways so well that you neednt think about every other week from the time you start till the time you try to bribe the customs inspector when you get back i can take a hack at the editing myself if toms inspiration gives out and put a little of my advertising fire into the thing he laid his hand on the shoulder of the young fellow who stood smiling by and pushed and shook him in the liking there was between them now you go march mrs fulkerson feels just as i do about it we had our outing last year and we want mrs march and you to have yours you let me go down and engage your passage and  no no the editor rebelled ill think about it but as he turned to the work he was so fond of and so weary of he tried not to think of the question again till he closed his desk in the afternoon and started to walk home the doctor had said he ought to walk and he did so though he longed to ride and looked wistfully at the passing cars  he knew he was in a rut as his wife often said but if it was a rut it was a support too it kept him from wobbling she always talked as if the flowery fields of youth lay on either side of the dusty road he had been going so long and he had but to step aside from it to be among the butterflies and buttercups again he sometimes indulged this illusion himself in a certain ironical spirit which caressed while it mocked the notion they had a tacit agreement that their youth if they were ever to find it again was to be looked for in europe where they met when they were young and they had never been quite without the hope of going back there some day for a long sojourn they had not seen the time when they could do so they were dreamers but as they recognized even dreaming is not free from care and in his dream march had been obliged to work pretty steadily if not too intensely he had been forced to forego the distinctly literary ambition with which he had started in life because he had their common living to make and he could not make it by writing graceful verse or even graceful prose he had been many years in a sufficiently distasteful business and he had lost any thought of leaving it when it left him perhaps because his hold on it had always been rather lax and he had not been able to conceal that he disliked it at any rate he was supplanted in his insurance agency at boston by a subordinate in his office and though he was at the same time offered a place of nominal credit in the employ of the company he was able to decline it in grace of a chance which united the charm of congenial work with the solid advantage of a better salary than he had been getting for work he hated it was an incredible chance but it was rendered appreciably real by the necessity it involved that they should leave boston where they had lived all their married life where mrs march as well as their children was born and where all their tender and familiar ties were and come to new york where the literary enterprise which formed his chance was to be founded  it was then a magazine of a new sort which his business partner had imagined in such leisure as the management of a newspaper syndicate afforded him and had always thought of getting march to edit the magazine which is also a book has since been realized elsewhere on more or less prosperous terms but not for any long period and every other week was apparentlythe only periodical of the kind conditioned for survival it was at first backed by unlimited capital and it had the instant favor of a popular mood which has since changed but which did not change so soon that the magazine had not time to establish itself in a wide acceptance it was now no longer a novelty it was no longer in the maiden blush of its first success but it had entered upon its second youth with the reasonable hope of many years of prosperity before it in fact it was a very comfortable living for all concerned and the marches had the conditions almost dismayingly perfect in which they had often promised themselves to go and be young again in europe when they rebelled at finding themselves elderly in america their daughter was married and so very much to her mothers mind that she did not worry about her even though she lived so far away as chicago still a wild frontier town to her boston imagination and their son as soon as he left college had taken hold on every other week under his fathers instruction with a zeal and intelligence which won him fulkersons praise as a chip of the old block these two liked each other and worked into each others hands as cordially and aptly as fulkerson and march had ever done it amused the father to see his son offering fulkerson the same deference which the business end paid to seniority in march himself but in fact fulkersons forehead was getting as he said more intellectual every day and the years were pushing them all along together  still march had kept on in the old rut and one day he fell down in it he had a long sickness and when he was well of it he was so slow in getting his grip of work again that he was sometimes deeply discouraged his wife shared his depression whether he showed or whether he hid it and when the doctor advised his going abroad she abetted the doctor with all the strength of a womans hygienic intuitions march himself willingly consented at first but as soon as he got strength for his work he began to temporize and to demur he said that he believed it would do him just as much good to go to saratoga where they always had such a good time as to go to carlsbad and mrs march had been obliged several times to leave him to his own undoing she always took him more vigorously in hand afterwards     ii  when he got home from the every other week office the afternoon of that talk with the business end he wanted to laugh with his wife at fulkersons notion of a sabbatical year she did not think it was so very droll she even urged it seriously against him as if she had now the authority of holy writ for forcing him abroad she found no relish of absurdity in the idea that it was his duty to take this rest which had been his right before  he abandoned himself to a fancy which had been working to the surface of his thought we could call it our silver wedding journey and go round to all the old places and see them in the reflected light of the past  oh we could she responded passionately and he had now the delicate responsibility of persuading her that he was joking  he could think of nothing better than a return to fulkersons absurdity it would be our silver wedding journey just as it would be my sabbatical yeara good deal after date but i suppose that would make it all the more silvery  she faltered in her elation didnt you say a sabbatical year yourself she demanded  fulkerson said it but it was a figurative expression  and i suppose the silver wedding journey was a figurative expression too  it was a notion that tempted me i thought you would enjoy it dont you suppose i should be glad too if we could go over and find ourselves just as we were when we first met there  no i dont believe now that you care anything about it  well it couldnt be done anyway so that doesnt matter  it could be done if you were a mind to think so and it would be the greatest inspiration to you you are always longing for some chance to do original work to get away from your editing but youve let the time slip by without really trying to do anything i dont call those little studies of yours in the magazine anything and now you wont take the chance thats almost forcing itself upon you you could write an original book of the nicest kind mix up travel and fiction get some love in  oh thats the stalest kind of thing  well but you could see it from a perfectly new point of view you could look at it as a sort of dispassionate witness and treat it humorouslyof course it is ridiculousand do something entirely fresh  it wouldnt work it would be carrying water on both shoulders the fiction would kill the travel the travel would kill the fiction the love and the humor wouldnt mingle any more than oil and vinegar  well and what is better than a salad  but this would be all saladdressing and nothing to put it on she was silent and he yielded to another fancy we might imagine coming upon our former selves over there and travelling round with thema wedding journey en partie carree  something like that i call it a very poetical idea she said with a sort of provisionality as if distrusting another ambush  it isnt so bad he admitted how young we were in those days  too young to know what a good time we were having she said relaxing her doubt for the retrospect i dont feel as if i really saw europe then i was too inexperienced too ignorant too simple i would like to go just to make sure that i had been he was smiling again in the way he had when anything occurred to him that amused him and she demanded what is it  nothing i was wishing we could go in the consciousness of people who actually hadnt been beforecarry them all through europe and let them see it in the old simplehearted american way  she shook her head you couldnt theyve all been  all but about sixty or seventy millions said march  well those are just the millions you dont know and couldnt imagine  im not so sure of that  and even if you could imagine them you couldnt make them interesting all the interesting ones have been anyway  some of the uninteresting ones too i used to meet some of that sort over there i believe i would rather chance it for my pleasure with those that hadnt been  then why not do it i know you could get something out of it  it might be a good thing he mused to take a couple who had passed their whole life here in new york too poor and too busy ever to go and had a perfect famine for europe all the time i could have them spend their sunday afternoons going aboard the different boats and looking up their accommodations i could have them sail in imagination and discover an imaginary europe and give their grotesque misconceptions of it from travels and novels against a background of purely american experience we neednt go abroad to manage that i think it would be rather nice  i dont think it would be nice in the least said mrs march and if you dont want to talk seriously i would rather not talk at all  well then lets talk about our silver wedding journey  i see you merely want to tease and i am not in the humor for it  she said this in a great many different ways and then she was really silent he perceived that she was hurt and he tried to win her back to goodhumor he asked her if she would not like to go over to hoboken and look at one of the hanseatic league steamers some day and she refused when he sent the next day and got a permit to see the boat she consented to go     iii  he was one of those men who live from the inside outward he often took a hint for his actions from his fancies and now because he had fancied some people going to look at steamers on sundays he chose the next sunday himself for their visit to the hanseatic boat at hoboken to be sure it was a leisure day with him but he might have taken the afternoon of any other day for that matter and it was really that invisible thread of association which drew him  the colmannia had been in long enough to have made her toilet for the outward voyage and was looking her best she was tipped and edged with shining brass without and within and was redcarpeted and whitepainted as only a ship knows how to be a little uniformed steward ran before the visitors and showed them through the dim white corridors into typical staterooms on the different decks and then let them verify their first impression of the grandeur of the diningsaloon and the luxury of the ladies parlor and musicroom march made his wife observe that the tables and sofas and easychairs which seemed so carelessly scattered about were all suggestively screwed fast to the floor against rough weather and he amused himself with the heavy german browns and greens and coppers in the decorations which he said must have been studied in color from sausage beer and spinach to the effect of those large marchpanes in the roof she laughed with him at the tastelessness of the race which they were destined to marvel at more and more but she made him own that the stewardesses whom they saw were charmingly like servingmaids in the fliegende blatter when they went ashore she challenged his silence for some assent to her own conclusion that the colmannia was perfect  she has only one fault he assented shes a ship  yes said his wife and i shall want to look at the norumbia before i decide  then he saw that it was only a question which steamer they should take and not whether they should take any he explained at first gently and afterwards savagely that their visit to the colmannia was quite enough for him and that the vessel was not built that he would be willing to cross the atlantic in  when a man has gone so far as that he has committed himself to the opposite course in almost so many words and march was neither surprised nor abashed when he discovered himself before they reached home offering his wife many reasons why they should go to europe she answered to all no he had made her realize the horror of it so much that she was glad to give it up she gave it up with the best feeling all that she would ask of him was that he should never mention europe to her again she could imagine how much he disliked to go if such a ship as the colmannia did not make him want to go  at the bottom of his heart he knew that he had not used her very well he had kindled her fancy with those notions of a sabbatical year and a silver wedding journey and when she was willing to renounce both he had persisted in taking her to see the ship only to tell her afterwards that he would not go abroad on any account it was by a psychological juggle which some men will understand that he allowed himself the next day to get the sailings of the norumbia from the steamship office he also got a plan of the ship showing the most available staterooms so that they might be able to choose between her and the colmannia from all the facts     iv  from this time their decision to go was none the less explicit because so perfectly tacit  they began to amass maps and guides she got a baedeker for austria and he got a bradshaw for the continent which was never of the least use there but was for the present a mine of unavailable information he got a phrasebook too and tried to rub up his german he used to read german when he was a boy with a young enthusiasm for its romantic poetry and now for the sake of schiller and uhland and heine he held imaginary conversations with a barber a bootmaker and a banker and tried to taste the joy which he had not known in the language of those poets for a whole generation he perceived of course that unless the barber the bootmaker and the banker answered him in terms which the author of the phrasebook directed them to use he should not get on with them beyond his first question but he did not allow this to spoil his pleasure in it in fact it was with a tender emotion that he realized how little the world which had changed in everything else so greatly had changed in its ideal of a phrasebook  mrs march postponed the study of her baedeker to the time and place for it and addressed herself to the immediate business of ascertaining the respective merits of the colmannia and norumbia she carried on her researches solely among persons of her own sex its experiences were alone of that positive character which brings conviction and she valued them equally at first or second hand she heard of ladies who would not cross in any boat but the colmannia and who waited for months to get a room on her she talked with ladies who said that nothing would induce them to cross in her there were ladies who said she had twice the motion that the norumbia had and the vibration from her twin screws was frightful it always was on those twinscrew boats and it did not affect their testimony with mrs march that the norumbia was a twinscrew boat too it was repeated to her in the third or fourth degree of hearsay that the discipline on the colmannia was as perfect as that on the cunarders ladies whose friends had tried every line assured her that the table of the norumbia was almost as good as the table of the french boats to the best of the belief of lady witnesses still living who had friends on board the colmannia had once got aground and the norumbia had once had her bridge carried off by a tidal wave or it might be the colmannia they promised to ask and let her know their lightest word availed with her against the most solemn assurances of their husbands fathers or brothers who might be all very well on land but in navigation were not to be trusted they would say anything from a reckless and culpable optimism she obliged march all the same to ask among them but she recognized their guilty insincerity when he came home saying that one man had told him you could have played croquet on the deck of the colmannia the whole way over when he crossed and another that he never saw the racks on in three passages he had made in the norumbia  the weight of evidence was he thought in favor of the norumbia but when they went another sunday to hoboken and saw the ship mrs march liked her so much less than the colmannia that she could hardly wait for monday to come she felt sure all the good rooms on the colmannia would be gone before they could engage one  from a consensus of the nerves of all the ladies left in town so late in the season she knew that the only place on any steamer where your room ought to be was probably just where they could not get it if you went too high you felt the rolling terribly and people tramping up and down on the promenade under your window kept you awake the whole night if you went too low you felt the engine thump thump thump in your head the whole way over if you went too far forward you got the pitching if you went aft on the kitchen side you got the smell of the cooking the only place really was just back of the diningsaloon on the south side of the ship it was smooth there and it was quiet and you had the sun in your window all the way over he asked her if he must take their room there or nowhere and she answered that he must do his best but that she would not be satisfied with any other place  in his despair he went down to the steamer office and took a room which one of the clerks said was the best when he got home it appeared from reference to the ships plan that it was the very room his wife had wanted from the beginning and she praised him as if he had used a wisdom beyond his sex in getting it  he was in the enjoyment of his unmerited honor when a belated lady came with her husband for an evening call before going into the country at sight of the plans of steamers on the marches table she expressed the greatest wonder and delight that they were going to europe they had supposed everybody knew it by this time but she said she had not heard a word of it and she went on with some felicitations which march found rather unduly filial in getting a little past the prime of life he did not like to be used with too great consideration of his years and he did not think that he and his wife were so old that they need be treated as if they were going on a golden wedding journey and heaped with all sorts of impertinent prophecies of their enjoying it so much and being so much the better for the little outing under his breath he confounded this lady for her impudence but he schooled himself to let her rejoice at their going on a hanseatic boat because the germans were always so careful of you she made her husband agree with her and it came out that he had crossed several times on both the colmannia and the norumbia he volunteered to say that the colmannia was a capital seaboat she did not have her nose under water all the time she was steady as a rock and the captain and the kitchen were simply out of sight some people did call her unlucky  unlucky mrs march echoed faintly why do they call her unlucky  oh i dont know people will say anything about any boat you know she broke her shaft once and once she got caught in the ice  mrs march joined him in deriding the superstition of people and she parted gayly with this overgood young couple as soon as they were gone march knew that she would say you must change that ticket my dear we will go in the norumbia  suppose i cant get as good a room on the norumbia  then we must stay  in the morning after a night so bad that it was worse than no night at all she said she would go to the steamship office with him and question them up about the colmannia the people there had never heard she was called an unlucky boat they knew of nothing disastrous in her history they were so frank and so full in their denials and so kindly patient of mrs marchs anxieties that he saw every word was carrying conviction of their insincerity to her at the end she asked what rooms were left on the norumbia and the clerk whom they had fallen to looked through his passenger list with a shaking head he was afraid there was nothing they would like  but we would take anything she entreated and march smiled to think of his innocence in supposing for a moment that she had ever dreamed of not going  we merely want the best he put in one flight up no noise or dust with sun in all the windows and a place for fire on rainy days  they must be used to a good deal of american joking which they do not understand in the foreign steamship offices the clerk turned unsmilingly to one of his superiors and asked him some question in german which march could not catch perhaps because it formed no part of a conversation with a barber a bootmaker or a banker a brief drama followed and then the clerk pointed to a room on the plan of the norumbia and said it had just been given up and they could have it if they decided to take it at once  they looked and it was in the very place of their room on the colmannia it was within one of being the same number it was so providential if it was providential at all that they were both humbly silent a moment even mrs march was silent in this supreme moment she would not prompt her husband by a word a glance and it was from his own free will that he said we will take it  he thought it was his free will but perhaps ones will is never free and this may have been an instance of pure determinism from all the events before it no event that followed affected it though the day after they had taken their passage on the norumbia he heard that she had once been in the worst sort of storm in the month of august he felt obliged to impart the fact to his wife but she said that it proved nothing for or against the ship and confounded him more by her reason than by all her previous unreason reason is what a man is never prepared for in women perhaps because he finds it so seldom in men     v  during nearly the whole month that now passed before the date of sailing it seemed to march that in some familiar aspects new york had never been so interesting he had not easily reconciled himself to the place after his many years of boston but he had got used to the ugly grandeur to the noise and the rush and he had divined more and more the careless goodnature and friendly indifference of the vast sprawling ungainly metropolis there were happy moments when he felt a poetry unintentional and unconscious in it and he thought there was no point more favorable for the sense of this than stuyvesant square where they had a flat their windows looked down into its treetops and across them to the truncated towers of st georges and to the plain redbrick whitetrimmed front of the friends meeting house he came and went between his dwelling and his office through the two places that form the square and after dinner his wife and he had a habit of finding seats by one of the fountains in livingston place among the fathers and mothers of the hybrid east side children swarming there at play the elders read their english or italian or german or yiddish journals or gossiped or merely sat still and stared away the days fatigue while the little ones raced in and out among them crying and laughing quarrelling and kissing sometimes a mother darted forward and caught her child from the brink of the basin another taught hers to walk holding it tightly up behind by its short skirts another publicly nursed her baby to sleep  while they still dreamed but never thought of going to europe the marches often said how european all this was if these women had brought their knitting or sewing it would have been quite european but as soon as they had decided to go it all began to seem poignantly american in like manner before the conditions of their exile changed and they still pined for the old world they contrived a very agreeable illusion of it by dining now and then at an austrian restaurant in union square but later when they began to be homesick for the american scenes they had not yet left they had a keener retrospective joy in the strictly new york sunset they were bowed out into  the sunsets were uncommonly characteristic that may in union square they were the color of the red stripes in the american flag and when they were seen through the delirious architecture of the broadway side or down the perspective of the crossstreets where the elevated trains silhouetted themselves against their pink they imparted a feeling of pervasive americanism in which all impression of alien savors and civilities was lost one evening a fire flamed up in hoboken and burned for hours against the west in the lurid crimson tones of a conflagration as memorably and appealingly native as the colors of the sunset  the weather for nearly the whole month was of a mood familiar enough in our early summer and it was this which gave the sunsets their vitreous pink a thrilling coolness followed a first blaze of heat and in the long respite the thoughts almost went back to winter flannels but at last a hot wave was telegraphed from the west and the week before the norumbia sailed was an anguish of burning days and breathless nights which fused all regrets and reluctances in the hope of escape and made the exiles of two continents long for the sea with no care for either shore     vi  their steamer was to sail early they were up at dawn because they had scarcely lain down and march crept out into the square for a last breath of its morning air before breakfast he was now eager to be gone he had broken with habit and he wished to put all traces of the past out of sight but this was curiously like all other early mornings in his consciousness and he could not alienate himself from the wonted environment he stood talking on everyday terms of idle speculation with the familiar policeman about a stray parrot in the top of one of the trees where it screamed and clawed at the dead branch to which it clung then he went carelessly indoors again as if he were secure of reading the reporters story of it in that next days paper which he should not see  the sense of an inseverable continuity persisted through the breakfast which was like other breakfasts in the place they would be leaving in summer shrouds just as they always left it at the end of june the illusion was even heightened by the fact that their son was to be in the apartment all summer and it would not be so much shut up as usual the heavy trunks had been sent to the ship by express the afternoon before and they had only themselves and their stateroom baggage to transport to hoboken they came down to a carriage sent from a neighboring liverystable and exchanged goodmornings with a driver they knew by name  march had often fancied it a chief advantage of living in new york that you could drive to the steamer and start for europe as if you were starting for albany he was in the enjoyment of this advantage now but somehow it was not the consolation he had expected he knew of course that if they had been coming from boston for instance to sail in the norumbia they would probably have gone on board the night before and sweltered through its heat among the strange smells and noises of the dock and wharf instead of breakfasting at their own table and smoothly bowling down the asphalt on to the ferryboat and so to the very foot of the gangway at the ships side all in the cool of the early morning but though he had now the cool of the early morning on these conditions there was by no means enough of it  the sun was already burning the life out of the air with the threat of another day of the terrible heat that had prevailed for a week past and that last breakfast at home had not been gay though it had been lively in a fashion through mrs marchs efforts to convince her son that she did not want him to come and see them off of her daughters coming all the way from chicago there was no question and she reasoned that if he did not come to say goodby on board it would be the same as if they were not going  dont you want to go march asked with an obscure resentment  i dont want to seem to go she said with the calm of those who have logic on their side  as she drove away with her husband she was not so sure of her satisfaction in the feint she had arranged though when she saw the ghastly partings of people on board she was glad she had not allowed her son to come she kept saying this to herself and when they climbed to the ship from the wharf and found themselves in the crowd that choked the saloons and promenades and passages and stairways and landings she said it more than once to her husband  she heard weary elders pattering empty politenesses of farewell with friends who had come to see them off as they stood withdrawn in such refuges as the ships architecture afforded or submitted to be pushed and twirled about by the surging throng when they got in its way she pitied these in their affliction which she perceived that they could not lighten or shorten but she had no patience with the young girls who broke into shrieks of nervous laughter at the coming of certain young men and kept laughing and beckoning till they made the young men see them and then stretched their hands to them and stood screaming and shouting to them across the intervening heads and shoulders some girls of those whom no one had come to bid goodby made themselves merry or at least noisy by rushing off to the diningroom and looking at the cards on the bouquets heaping the tables to find whether any one had sent them flowers others whom young men had brought bunches of violets hid their noses in them and dropped their fans and handkerchiefs and cardcases and thanked the young men for picking them up others had got places in the musicroom and sat there with open boxes of longstemmed roses in their laps and talked up into the faces of the men with becoming lifts and slants of their eyes and chins in the midst of the turmoil children struggled against peoples feet and knees and bewildered mothers flew at the ships officers and battered them with questions alien to their respective functions as they amiably stifled about in their thick uniforms  sailors slung over the ships side on swinging seats were placidly smearing it with paint at that last moment the bulwarks were thickly set with the heads and arms of passengers who were making signs to friends on shore or calling messages to them that lost themselves in louder noises midway some of the women in the steerage were crying they were probably not going to europe for pleasure like the firstcabin passengers or even for their health on the wharf below march saw the face of one young girl twisted with weeping and he wished he had not seen it he turned from it and looked into the eyes of his son who was laughing at his shoulder he said that he had to come down with a goodby letter from his sister which he made an excuse for following them but he had always meant to see them off he owned the letter had just come with a special delivery stamp and it warned them that she had sent another goodby letter with some flowers on board mrs march scolded at them both but with tears in her eyes and in the renewed stress of parting which he thought he had put from him march went on taking note as with alien senses of the scene before him while they all talked on together and repeated the nothings they had said already  a rank odor of beetroot sugar rose from the farbranching sheds where some freight steamers of the line lay and seemed to mingle chemically with the noise which came up from the wharf next to the norumbia the mass of spectators deepened and dimmed away into the shadow of the roofs and along their front came files of carriages and trucks and carts and discharged the arriving passengers and their baggage and were lost in the crowd which they penetrated like slow currents becoming clogged and arrested from time to time and then beginning to move again  the passengers incessantly mounted by the canvasdraped galleries leading fore and aft into the ship bareheaded bluejacketed brassbuttoned stewards dodged skillfully in and out among them with their handbags holdalls hatboxes and stateroom trunks and ran before them into the different depths and heights where they hid these burdens and then ran back for more some of the passengers followed them and made sure that their things were put in the right places most of them remained wedged among the earlier comers or pushed aimlessly in and out of the doors of the promenades  the baggage for the hold continually rose in huge blocks from the wharf with a loud clucking of the tackle and sank into the open maw of the ship momently gathering herself for her long race seaward with harsh hissings and rattlings and gurglings there was no apparent reason why it should all or any of it end but there came a moment when there began to be warnings that were almost threats of the end the ships whistle sounded as if marking a certain interval and mrs march humbly entreated sternly commanded her son to go ashore or else be carried to europe they disputed whether that was the last signal or not she was sure it was and she appealed to march who was moved against his reason he affected to talk calmly with his son and gave him some last charges about every other week  some people now interrupted their leavetaking but the arriving passengers only arrived more rapidly at the gangways the bulks of baggage swung more swiftly into the air a bell rang and there rose womens cries oh that is the shorebell and mens protests it is only the first bell more and more began to descend the gangways fore and aft and soon outnumbered those who were coming aboard  march tried not to be nervous about his sons lingering he was ashamed of his anxiety but he said in a low voice better be off tom  his mother now said she did not care if tom were really carried to europe and at last he said well he guessed he must go ashore as if there had been no question of that before and then she clung to him and would not let him go but she acquired merit with herself at last by pushing him into the gangway with her own hands he nodded and waved his hat from its foot and mixed with the crowd  presently there was hardly any one coming aboard and the sailors began to undo the lashings of the gangways from the ships side files of men on the wharf laid hold of their rails the stewards guarding their approach looked up for the signal to come aboard and in vivid pantomime forbade some belated leavetakers to ascend these stood aside exchanging bows and grins with the friends whom they could not reach they all tried to make one another hear some last words the moment came when the saloon gangway was detached then it was pulled ashore and the section of the bulwarks opening to it was locked not to be unlocked on this side of the world an indefinable impulse communicated itself to the steamer while it still seemed motionless it moved the thick spread of faces on the wharf which had looked at times like some sort of strange flowers in a level field broke into a universal tremor and the air above them was filled with hats and handkerchiefs as if with the flight of birds rising from the field  the marches tried to make out their sons face they believed that they did but they decided that they had not seen him and his mother said that she was glad it would only have made it harder to bear though she was glad he had come over to say goodby it had seemed so unnatural that he should not when everybody else was saying goodby  on the wharf color was now taking the place of form the scene ceased to have the effect of an instantaneous photograph it was like an impressionistic study as the ship swung free of the shed and got into the stream the shore lost reality up to a certain moment all was still new york all was even hoboken then amidst the grotesque and monstrous shows of the architecture on either shore march felt himself at sea and on the way to europe  the fact was accented by the trouble people were already making with the decksteward about their steamer chairs which they all wanted put in the best places and march with a certain heartache was involuntarily verifying the instant in which he ceased to be of his native shores while still in full sight of them when he suddenly reverted to them and as it were landed on them again in an incident that held him breathless a man bareheaded and with his arms flung wildly abroad came flying down the promenade from the steerage capitan capitan there is a woman he shouted in nondescript english she must go hout she must go hout some vital fact imparted itself to the ships command and seemed to penetrate to the ships heart she stopped as if with a sort of majestic relenting a tug panted to her side and lifted a ladder to it the bareheaded man and a woman gripping a baby in her arms sprawled safely down its rungs to the deck of the tug and the steamer moved seaward again  what is it oh what is it his wife demanded of marchs share of their common ignorance a young fellow passing stopped as if arrested by the tragic note in her voice and explained that the woman had left three little children locked up in her tenement while she came to bid some friends on board goodby  he passed on and mrs march said what a charming face he had even before she began to wreak upon that wretched mother the overwrought sympathy which makes good women desire the punishment of people who have escaped danger she would not hear any excuse for her her children oughtnt to have been out of her mind for an instant  dont you want to send back a line to ours by the pilot march asked  she started from him oh was i really beginning to forget them  in the saloon where people were scattered about writing pilots letters she made him join her in an impassioned epistle of farewell which once more left none of the nothings unsaid that they had many times reiterated she would not let him put the stamp on for fear it would not stick and she had an agonizing moment of doubt whether it ought not to be a german stamp she was not pacified till the steward in charge of the mail decided  i shouldnt have forgiven myself march said if we hadnt let tom know that twenty minutes after he left us we were still alive and well  its to bella too she reasoned  he found her making their stateroom look homelike with their familiar things when he came with their daughters steamer letter and the flowers and fruit she had sent she said very well they would all keep and went on with her unpacking he asked her if she did not think these home things made it rather ghastly and she said if he kept on in that way she should certainly go back on the pilotboat he perceived that her nerves were spent he had resisted the impulse to an illtimed joke about the lifepreservers under their berths when the sound of the breakfasthorn wavering first in the distance found its way nearer and clearer down their corridor     vii  in one of the many visits to the steamship office which his wifes anxieties obliged him to make march had discussed the question of seats in the diningsaloon at first he had his ambition for the captains table but they convinced him more easily than he afterwards convinced mrs march that the captains table had become a superstition of the past and conferred no special honor it proved in the event that the captain of the norumbia had the good feeling to dine in a lower saloon among the passengers who paid least for their rooms but while the marches were still in their ignorance of this they decided to get what adventure they could out of letting the head steward put them where he liked and they came in to breakfast with a careless curiosity to see what he had done for them  there seemed scarcely a vacant place in the huge saloon through the oval openings in the centre they looked down into the lower saloon and up into the musicroom as thickly thronged with breakfasters the tables were brightened with the bouquets and the floral designs of ships anchors harps and doves sent to the lady passengers and at one time the marches thought they were going to be put before a steamyacht realized to the last detail in blue and white violets the ports of the saloon were open and showed the level sea the ship rode with no motion except the tremor from her screws the sound of talking and laughing rose with the clatter of knives and forks and the clash of crockery the homely smell of the coffee and steak and fish mixed with the spice of the roses and carnations the stewards ran hither and thither and a young foolish joy of travel welled up in the elderly hearts of the pair when the head steward turned out the swivelchairs where they were to sit they both made an inclination toward the people already at table as if it had been a company at some farforgotten table dhote in the later sixties the head steward seemed to understand as well as speak english but the tablestewards had only an effect of english which they eked out with bleace for all occasions of inquiry apology or reassurance as the equivalent of their native bitte otherwise there was no reason to suppose that they did not speak german which was the language of a good half of the passengers the stewards looked english however in conformity to what seems the ideal of every kind of foreign seafaring people and that went a good way toward making them intelligible  march to whom his wife mainly left their obeisance made it so tentative that if it should meet no response he could feel that it had been nothing more than a forward stoop such as was natural in sitting down he need not really have taken this precaution those whose eyes he caught more or less nodded in return  a nicelooking boy of thirteen or fourteen who had the place on the left of the lady in the sofa seat under the port bowed with almost magisterial gravity and made the lady on the sofa smile as if she were his mother and understood him march decided that she had been some time a widow and he easily divined that the young couple on her right had been so little time husband and wife that they would rather not have it known next them was a young lady whom he did not at first think so goodlooking as she proved later to be though she had at once a pretty nose with a slight upward slant at the point long eyes under fallen lashes a straight forehead not too high and a mouth which perhaps the exigencies of breakfasting did not allow all its characteristic charm she had what mrs march thought interesting hair of a dull black roughly rolled away from her forehead and temples in a fashion not particularly becoming to her and she had the air of not looking so well as she might if she had chosen the elderly man on her right it was easy to see was her father they had a family likeness though his fair hair now ashen with age was so different from hers he wore his beard cut in the fashion of the second empire with a louis napoleonic mustache imperial and chin tuft his neat head was cropt close and there was something gallic in its effect and something remotely military he had blue eyes really less severe than he meant though be frowned a good deal and managed them with glances of a staccato quickness as if challenging a potential disagreement with his opinions  the gentleman on his right who sat at the head of the table was of the humorous subironical american expression and a smile at the corner of his kindly mouth under an irongray full beard cut short at once questioned and tolerated the newcomers as he glanced at them he responded to marchs bow almost as decidedly as the nice boy whose mother he confronted at the other end of the table and with his comely bulk formed an interesting contrast to her vivid slightness she was brilliantly dark behind the gleam of the goldrimmed glasses perched on her pretty nose  if the talk had been general before the marches came it did not at once renew itself in that form nothing was said while they were having their first struggle with the tablestewards who repeated the order as if to show how fully they had misunderstood it the gentleman at the head of the table intervened at last and then im obliged to you march said for your german i left mine in a phrasebook in my other coat pocket  oh i wasnt speaking german said the other it was merely their kind of english  the company were in the excitement of a novel situation which disposes people to acquaintance and this exchange of small pleasantries made every one laugh except the father and daughter but they had the effect of being tacitly amused  the mother of the nice boy said to mrs march you may not get what you ordered but it will be good  even if you dont know what it is said the young bride and then blushed as if she had been too bold  mrs march liked the blush and the young bride for it and she asked have you ever been on one of these german boats before they seem very comfortable  oh dear no weve never been on any boat before she made a little petted mouth of deprecation and added simpleheartedly my husband was going out on business and he thought he might as well take me along  the husband seemed to feel himself brought in by this and said he did not see why they should not make it a pleasuretrip too they put themselves in a position to be patronized by their deference and in the pauses of his talk with the gentleman at the head of the table march heard his wife abusing their inexperience to be unsparingly instructive about european travel he wondered whether she would be afraid to own that it was nearly thirty years since she had crossed the ocean though that might seem recent to people who had never crossed at all  they listened with respect as she boasted in what an anguish of wisdom she had decided between the colmannia and the norumbia the wife said she did not know there was such a difference in steamers but when mrs march perfervidly assured her that there was all the difference in the world she submitted and said she supposed she ought to be thankful that they had hit upon the right one they had telegraphed for berths and taken what was given them their room seemed to be very nice  oh said mrs march and her husband knew that she was saying it to reconcile them to the inevitable all the rooms on the norumbia are nice the only difference is that if they are on the south side you have the sun  im not sure which is the south side said the bride we seem to have been going west ever since we started and i feel as if we should reach home in the morning if we had a good night is the ocean always so smooth as this  oh dear no said mrs march its never so smooth as this and she began to be outrageously authoritative about the ocean weather she ended by declaring that the june passages were always good and that if the ship kept a southerly course they would have no fogs and no icebergs she looked round and caught her husbands eye what is it have i been bragging well you understand she added to the bride ive only been over once a great while ago and i dont really know anything about it and they laughed together but i talked so much with people after we decided to go that i feel as if i had been a hundred times  i know said the other lady with caressing intelligence that is just the way with she stopped and looked at the young man whom the head steward was bringing up to take the vacant place next to march he came forward stuffing his cap into the pocket of his blue serge sack and smiled down on the company with such happiness in his gay eyes that march wondered what chance at this late day could have given any human creature his content so absolute and what calamity could be lurking round the corner to take it out of him the newcomer looked at march as if he knew him and march saw at a second glance that he was the young fellow who had told him about the mother put off after the start he asked him whether there was any change in the weather yet outside and he answered eagerly as if the chance to put his happiness into the mere sound of words were a favor done him that their ship had just spoken one of the big hanseatic mailboats and she had signalled back that she had met ice so that they would probably keep a southerly course and not have it cooler till they were off the banks  the mother of the boy said i thought we must be off the banks when i came out of my room but it was only the electric fan at the foot of the stairs  that was what i thought said mrs march i almost sent my husband back for my shawl both the ladies laughed and liked each other for their common experience  the gentleman at the head of the table said they ought to have fans going there by that pillar or else close the ports they only let in heat  they easily conformed to the american convention of jocosity in their talk it perhaps no more represents the individual mood than the convention of dulness among other people but it seemed to make the young man feel at home  why do you think its uncomfortably warm he asked from what march perceived to be a meteorology of his own he laughed and added it is pretty summerlike as if he had not thought of it before he talked of the big mailboat and said he would like to cross on such a boat as that and then he glanced at the possible advantage of having your own steamyacht like the one which he said they had just passed so near that you could see what a good time the people were having on board he began to speak to the marches his talk spread to the young couple across the table it visited the mother on the sofa in a remark which she might ignore without apparent rejection and without really avoiding the boy it glanced off toward the father and daughter from whom it fell to rest with the gentleman at the head of the table  it was not that the father and daughter had slighted his overture if it was so much as that but that they were tacitly preoccupied or were of some philosophy concerning their fellowbreakfasters which did not suffer them for the present at least to share in the common friendliness this is an attitude sometimes produced in people by a sense of just or even unjust superiority sometimes by serious trouble sometimes by transient annoyance the cause was not so deepseated but mrs march before she rose from her place believed that she had detected a slant of the young ladys eyes from under her lashes toward the young man and she leaped to a conclusion concerning them in a matter where all logical steps are impertinent she did not announce her arrival at this point till the young man had overtaken her before she got out of the saloon and presented the handkerchief she had dropped under the table  he went away with her thanks and then she said to her husband well hes perfectly charming and i dont wonder shes taken with him that kind of cold girl would be though im not sure that she is cold shes interesting and you could see that he thought so the more he looked at her i could see him looking at her from the very first instant he couldnt keep his eyes off her she piqued his curiosity and made him wonder about her  now look here isabel this wont do i can stand a good deal but i sat between you and that young fellow and you couldnt tell whether he was looking at that girl or not  i could i could tell by the expression of her face  oh well if its gone as far as that with you i give it up when are you going to have them married  nonsense i want you to find out who all those people are how are you going to do it  perhaps the passenger list will say he suggested     viii  the list did not say of itself but with the help of the head stewards diagram it said that the gentleman at the head of the table was mr r m kenby the father and the daughter were mr e b triscoe and miss triscoe the bridal pair were mr and mrs leffers the mother and her son were mrs adding and mr roswell adding the young man who came in last was mr l j burnamy march carried the list with these names carefully checked and rearranged on a neat plan of the table to his wife in her steamer chair and left her to make out the history and the character of the people from it in this sort of conjecture long experience had taught him his futility and he strolled up and down and looked at the life about him with no wish to penetrate it deeply  long island was now a low yellow line on the left some fishingboats flickered off the shore they met a few sail and left more behind but already and so near one of the greatest ports of the world the spacious solitude of the ocean was beginning there was no swell the sea lay quite flat with a fine mesh of wrinkles on its surface and the sun flamed down upon it from a sky without a cloud with the light fair wind there was no resistance in the sultry air the thin dun smoke from the smokestack fell about the decks like a stifling veil  the promenades were as uncomfortably crowded as the sidewalk of fourteenth street on a summers day and showed much the social average of a new york shopping thoroughfare distinction is something that does not always reveal itself at first sight on land and at sea it is still more retrusive a certain democracy of looks and clothes was the most notable thing to march in the apathetic groups and detached figures his criticism disabled the saloon passengers of even so much personal appeal as he imagined in some of the secondcabin passengers whom he saw across their barrier they had at least the pathos of their exclusion and he could wonder if they felt it or envied him at hoboken he had seen certain people coming on board who looked like swells but they had now either retired from the crowd or they had already conformed to the prevailing type it was very well as a type he was of it himself but he wished that beauty as well as distinction had not been so lost in it  in fact he no longer saw so much beauty anywhere as he once did it might be that he saw life more truly than when he was young and that his glasses were better than his eyes had been but there were analogies that forbade his thinking so and he sometimes had his misgivings that the trouble was with his glasses he made what he could of a pretty girl who had the air of not meaning to lose a moment from flirtation and was luring her fellowpassengers from under her sailor hat she had already attached one of them and she was hooking out for more she kept moving herself from the waist up as if she worked there on a pivot showing now this side and now that side of her face and visiting the admirer she had secured with a smile as from the lamp of a revolving light as she turned  while he was dwelling upon this folly with a sense of impersonal pleasure in it as complete through his years as if he were already a disembodied spirit the pulse of the engines suddenly ceased and he joined the general rush to the rail with a fantastic expectation of seeing another distracted mother put off but it was only the pilot leaving the ship he was climbing down the ladder which hung over the boat rising and sinking on the sea below while the two men in her held her from the ships side with their oars in the offing lay the white steamyacht which now replaces the picturesque pilotsloop of other times the norumbias screws turned again under half a head of steam the pilot dropped from the last rung of the ladder into the boat and caught the bundle of letters tossed after him then his men let go the line that was towing their craft and the incident of the steamers departure was finally closed it had been dramatically heightened perhaps by her final impatience to be off at some added risks to the pilot and his men but not painfully so and march smiled to think how men whose lives are all of dangerous chances seem always to take as many of them as they can  he heard a girls fresh voice saying at his shoulder well now we are off and i suppose youre glad papa  im glad were not taking the pilot on at least answered the elderly man whom the girl had spoken to and march turned to see the father and daughter whose reticence at the breakfast table had interested him he wondered that he had left her out of the account in estimating the beauty of the ships passengers he saw now that she was not only extremely pretty but as she moved away she was very graceful she even had distinction he had fancied a tone of tolerance and at the same time of reproach in her voice when she spoke and a tone of defiance and not very successful denial in her fathers and he went back with these impressions to his wife whom he thought he ought to tell why the ship had stopped  she had not noticed the ships stopping in her study of the passenger list and she did not care for the pilots leaving but she seemed to think his having overheard those words of the father and daughter an event of prime importance with a womans willingness to adapt the means to the end she suggested that he should follow them up and try to overhear something more she only partially realized the infamy of her suggestion when he laughed in scornful refusal  of course i dont want you to eavesdrop but i do want you to find out about them and about mr burnamy too i can wait about the others or manage for myself but these are driving me to distraction now will you  he said he would do anything he could with honor and at one of the earliest turns he made on the other side of the ship he was smilingly halted by mr burnamy who asked to be excused and then asked if he were not mr march of every other week he had seen the name on the passenger list and felt sure it must be the editors he seemed so trustfully to expect march to remember his own name as that of a writer from whom he had accepted a short poem yet unprinted that the editor feigned to do so until he really did dimly recall it he even recalled the short poem and some civil words he said about it caused burnamy to overrun in confidences that at once touched and amused him     ix  burnamy it seemed had taken passage on the norumbia because he found when he arrived in new york the day before that she was the first boat out his train was so much behind time that when he reached the office of the hanseatic league it was nominally shut but he pushed in by sufferance of the janitor and found a berth which had just been given up in one of the saloondeck rooms it was that or nothing and he felt rich enough to pay for it himself if the bird of prey who had cabled him to come out to carlsbad as his secretary would not stand the difference between the price and that of the lowerdeck sixinaroom berth which he would have taken if he had been allowed a choice  with the three hundred dollars he had got for his book less the price of his passage changed into german banknotes and gold pieces and safely buttoned in the breast pocket of his waistcoat he felt as safe from pillage as from poverty when he came out from buying his ticket he covertly pressed his arm against his breast from time to time for the joy of feeling his money there and not from any fear of finding it gone he wanted to sing he wanted to dance he could not believe it was he as he rode up the lonely length of broadway in the cablecar between the wild irregular walls of the canyon which the cablecars have all to themselves at the end of a summer afternoon  he went and dined and he thought he dined well at a spanishamerican restaurant for fifty cents with a halfbottle of california claret included when he came back to broadway he was aware that it was stiflingly hot in the pinkish twilight but he took a cablecar again in lack of other pastime and the motion served the purpose of a breeze which he made the most of by keeping his hat off it did not really matter to him whether it was hot or cool he was imparadised in weather which had nothing to do with the temperature partly because he was born to such weather in the gayety of soul which amused some people with him and partly because the world was behaving as he had always expected he was opulently content with the present moment but he thought very tolerantly of the future and he confirmed himself in the decision he had already made to stick to chicago when he came back to america new york was very well and he had no sentiment about chicago but he had got a foothold there he had done better with an eastern publisher he believed by hailing from the west and he did not believe it would hurt him with the eastern public to keep on hailing from the west  he was glad of a chance to see europe but he did not mean to come home so dazzled as to see nothing else against the american sky he fancied for he really knew nothing that it was the light of europe not its glare that he wanted and he wanted it chiefly on his material so as to see it more and more objectively it was his power of detachment from this that had enabled him to do his sketches in the paper with such charm as to lure a cash proposition from a publisher when he put them together for a book but he believed that his business faculty had much to do with his success and he was as proud of that as of the book itself perhaps he was not so very proud of the book he was at least not vain of it he could detach himself from his art as well as his material  like all literary temperaments he was of a certain hardness in spite of the susceptibilities that could be used to give coloring to his work he knew this well enough but he believed that there were depths of unprofessional tenderness in his nature he was good to his mother and he sent her money and wrote to her in the little indiana town where he had left her when he came to chicago after he got that invitation from the bird of prey he explored his heart for some affection that he had not felt for him before and he found a wish that his employer should not know it was he who had invented that nickname for him he promptly avowed this in the newspaper office which formed one of the eyries of the bird of prey and made the fellows promise not to give him away he failed to move their imagination when he brought up as a reason for softening toward him that he was from burnamys own part of indiana and was a benefactor of tippecanoe university from which burnamy was graduated but they relished the cynicism of his attempt and they were glad of his good luck which he was getting square and not rhomboid as most people seem to get their luck they liked him and some of them liked him for his clean young life as well as for his cleverness his life was known to be as clean as a girls and he looked like a girl with his sweet eyes though he had rather more chin than most girls  the conductor came to reverse his seat and burnamy told him he guessed he would ride back with him as far as the cars to the hoboken ferry if the conductor would put him off at the right place it was nearly nine oclock and he thought he might as well be going over to the ship where he had decided to pass the night after he found her and went on board he was glad he had not gone sooner a queasy odor of drainage stole up from the waters of the dock and mixed with the rank gross sweetness of the bags of beetroot sugar from the freightsteamers there was a coming and going of carts and trucks on the wharf and on the ship a rattling of chains and a clucking of pulleys with sudden outbreaks and then sudden silences of trampling seaboots burnamy looked into the diningsaloon and the musicroom with the notion of trying for some naps there then he went to his stateroom his roommate whoever he was to be had not come and he kicked off his shoes and threw off his coat and tumbled into his berth  he meant to rest awhile and then get up and spend the night in receiving impressions he could not think of any one who had done the facts of the eve of sailing on an atlantic liner he thought he would use the material first in a letter to the paper and afterwards in a poem but he found himself unable to grasp the notion of its essential relation to the choice between chicken croquettes and sweetbreads as entrees of the restaurant dinner where he had been offered neither he knew that he had begun to dream and that he must get up he was just going to get up when he woke to a sense of freshness in the air penetrating from the new day outside he looked at his watch and found it was quarter past six he glanced round the stateroom and saw that he had passed the night alone in it then he splashed himself hastily at the basin next his berth and jumped into his clothes and went on deck anxious to lose no feature or emotion of the ships departure  when she was fairly off he returned to his room to change the thick coat he had put on at the instigation of the early morning air his roommate was still absent but he was now represented by his stateroom baggage and burnamy tried to infer him from it he perceived a social quality in his dresscoat case capacious gladstone hatbox rug umbrella and soleleather steamer trunk which he could not attribute to his own equipment the things were not so new as his they had an effect of polite experience with a foreign registry and customs label on them here and there they had been chosen with both taste and knowledge and burnamy would have said that they were certainly english things if it had not been for the initials u s a which followed the name of e b triscoe on the end of the steamer trunk showing itself under the foot of the lower berth  the lower berth had fallen to burnamy through the default of the passenger whose ticket he had got at the last hour the clerk in the steamer office had been careful to impress him with this advantage and he now imagined a trespass on his property but he reassured himself by a glance at his ticket and went out to watch the ships passage down the stream and through the narrows after breakfast he came to his room again to see what could be done from his valise to make him look better in the eyes of a girl whom he had seen across the table of course he professed a much more general purpose he blamed himself for not having got at least a pair of the white tennisshoes which so many of the passengers were wearing his russet shoes had turned shabby on his feet but there was a pair of enamelled leather boots in his bag which he thought might do  his room was in the group of cabins on the upper deck he had already missed his way to it once by mistaking the corridor which it opened into and he was not sure that he was not blundering again when he peered down the narrow passage where he supposed it was a lady was standing at an open stateroom door resting her hands against the jambs and leaning forward with her head within and talking to some one there before he could draw back and try another corridor he heard her say perhaps hes some young man and wouldnt care  burnamy could not make out the answer that came from within the lady spoke again in a tone of reluctant assent no i dont suppose you could but if he understood perhaps he would offer  she drew her head out of the room stepping back a pace and lingering a moment at the threshold she looked round over her shoulder and discovered burnamy where he stood hesitating at the head of the passage she ebbed before him and then flowed round him in her instant escape with some murmured incoherencies about speaking to her father she vanished in a corridor on the other side of the ship while he stood staring into the doorway of his room  he had seen that she was the young lady for whom he had come to put on his enamelled shoes and he saw that the person within was the elderly gentleman who had sat next her at breakfast he begged his pardon as he entered and said he hoped he should not disturb him im afraid i left my things all over the place when i got up this morning  the other entreated him not to mention it and went on taking from his handbag a variety of toilet appliances which the sight of made burnamy vow to keep his own simple combs and brushes shut in his valise all the way over you slept on board then he suggested arresting himself with a pair of low shoes in his hand he decided to put them in a certain pocket of his steamer bag  oh yes burnamy laughed nervously i came near oversleeping and getting off to sea without knowing it and i rushed out to save myself and so  he began to gather up his belongings while he followed the movements of mr triscoe with a wistful eye he would have liked to offer his lower berth to this senior of his when he saw him arranging to take possession of the upper but he did not quite know how to manage it he noticed that as the other moved about he limped slightly unless it were rather a weary easing of his person from one limb to the other he stooped to pull his trunk out from under the berth and burnamy sprang to help him  let me get that out for you he caught it up and put it on the sofa under the port is that where you want it  why yes the other assented youre very good and as he took out his key to unlock the trunk he relented a little farther to the intimacies of the situation have you arranged with the bathsteward yet its such a full boat  no i havent said burnamy as if he had tried and failed till then he had not known that there was a bathsteward shall i get him for you  no no our bedroomsteward will send him i dare say thank you  mr triscoe had got his trunk open and burnamy had no longer an excuse for lingering in his defeat concerning the bathsteward as he felt it to be he had not the courage now to offer the lower berth he went away forgetting to change his shoes but he came back and as soon as he got the enamelled shoes on and shut the shabby russet pair in his bag he said abruptly mr triscoe i wish youd take the lower berth i got it at the eleventh hour by some fellows giving it up and it isnt as if id bargained for it a month ago  the elder man gave him one of his staccato glances in which burnamy fancied suspicion and even resentment but he said after the moment of reflection which he gave himself why thank you if you dont mind really  not at all cried the young man i should like the upper berth better well have the steward change the sheets  oh ill see that he does that said mr triscoe i couldnt allow you to take any trouble about it he now looked as if he wished burnamy would go and leave him to his domestic arrangements     x  in telling about himself burnamy touched only upon the points which he believed would take his listeners intelligent fancy and he stopped so long before he had tired him that march said he would like to introduce him to his wife he saw in the agreeable young fellow an image of his own youth with some differences which he was willing to own were to the young fellows advantage but they were both from the middle west in their native accent and their local tradition they were the same they were the same in their aspirations they were of one blood in their literary impulse to externate their thoughts and emotions  burnamy answered with a glance at his enamelled shoes that he would be delighted and when her husband brought him up to her mrs march said she was always glad to meet the contributors to the magazine and asked him whether he knew mr kendricks who was her favorite without giving him time to reply to a question that seemed to depress him she said that she had a son who must be nearly his own age and whom his father had left in charge of every other week for the few months they were to be gone that they had a daughter married and living in chicago she made him sit down by her in marchs chair and before he left them march heard him magnanimously asking whether mr kendricks was going to do something more for the magazine soon he sauntered away and did not know how quickly burnamy left this question to say with the laugh and blush which became him in her eyes  mrs march there is something i should like to tell you about if you will let me  why certainly mr burnamy she began but she saw that he did not wish her to continue  because he went on its a little matter that i shouldnt like to go wrong in  he told her of his having overheard what miss triscoe had said to her father and his belief that she was talking about the lower berth he said he would have wished to offer it of course but now he was afraid they might think he had overheard them and felt obliged to do it  i see said mrs march and she added thoughtfully she looks like rather a proud girl  yes the young fellow sighed  she is very charming she continued thoughtfully but not so judicially  well burnamy owned that is certainly one of the complications and they laughed together  she stopped herself after saying i see what you mean and suggested i think i should be guided by circumstances it neednt be done at once i suppose  well burnamy began and then he broke out with a laugh of embarrassment ive done it already  oh then it wasnt my advice exactly that you wanted  no  and how did he take it  he said he should be glad to make the exchange if i really didnt mind burnamy had risen restlessly and she did not ask him to stay she merely said  oh well im glad it turned out so nicely  im so glad you think it was the thing to do he managed to laugh again but he could not hide from her that he was not feeling altogether satisfied would you like me to send mr march if i see him he asked as if he did not know on what other terms to get away  do please she entreated and it seemed to her that he had hardly left her when her husband came up why where in the world did he find you so soon  did you send him for me i was just hanging round for him to go march sank into the chair at her side well is he going to marry her  oh you may laugh but there is something very exciting she told him what had happened and of her belief that burnamys handsome behavior had somehow not been met in kind  march gave himself the pleasure of an immense laugh it seems to me that this mr burnamy of yours wanted a little more gratitude than he was entitled to why shouldnt he have offered him the lower berth and why shouldnt the old gentleman have taken it just as he did did you want him to make a counteroffer of his daughters hand if he does i hope mr burnamy wont come for your advice till after hes accepted her  he wasnt very candid i hoped you would speak about that dont you think it was rather natural though  for him very likely but i think you would call it sinuous in some one you hadnt taken a fancy to  no no i wish to be just i dont see how he could have come straight at it and he did own up at last she asked him what burnamy had done for the magazine and he could remember nothing but that one small poem yet unprinted he was rather vague about its value but said it had temperament  he has temperament too she commented and she had made him tell her everything he knew or could be forced to imagine about burnamy before she let the talk turn to other things  the life of the promenade had already settled into seafaring form the steamer chairs were full and people were reading or dozing in them with an effect of long habit those who would be walking up and down had begun their walks some had begun going in and out of the smokingroom ladies who were easily affected by the motion were lying down in the musicroom groups of both sexes were standing at intervals along the rail and the promenaders were obliged to double on a briefer course or work slowly round them shuffleboard parties at one point and ringtoss parties at another were forming among the young people it was as lively and it was as dull as it would be two thousand miles at sea it was not the least cooler yet but if you sat still you did not suffer  in the prompt monotony the time was already passing swiftly the decksteward seemed hardly to have been round with tea and bouillon and he had not yet gathered up all the empty cups when the horn for lunch sounded it was the youngest of the tablestewards who gave the summons to meals and whenever the pretty boy appeared with his bugle funny passengers gathered round him to make him laugh and stop him from winding it his part of the joke was to fulfill his duty with gravity and only to give way to a smile of triumph as he walked off     xi  at lunch in the faded excitement of their first meeting the people at the marches table did not renew the premature intimacy of their breakfast talk mrs march went to lie down in her berth afterwards and march went on deck without her he began to walk to and from the barrier between the first and second cabin promenades lingering near it and musing pensively for some of the people beyond it looked as intelligent and as socially acceptable even to their clothes as their pecuniary betters of the saloon  there were two women a mother and daughter whom he fancied to be teachers by their looks going out for a little rest or perhaps for a little further study to fit them more perfectly for their work they gazed wistfully across at him whenever he came up to the barrier and he feigned a conversation with them and tried to convince them that the stamp of inferiority which their poverty put upon them was just or if not just then inevitable he argued with them that the sort of barrier which here prevented their being friends with him if they wished it ran invisibly through society everywhere but he felt ashamed before their kind patient intelligent faces and found himself wishing to excuse the fact he was defending was it any worse he asked them than their not being invited to the entertainments of people in upper fifth avenue he made them own that if they were let across that barrier the whole second cabin would have a logical right to follow and they were silenced but they continued to gape at him with their sincere gentle eyes whenever he returned to the barrier in his walk till he could bear it no longer and strolled off toward the steerage  there was more reason why the passengers there should be penned into a little space of their own in the sort of pit made by the narrowing deck at the bow they seemed to be all foreigners and if any had made their fortunes in our country they were hiding their prosperity in the return to their own they could hardly have come to us more shabby and squalid than they were going away but he thought their average less apathetic than that of the saloon passengers as he leaned over the rail and looked down at them some one had brought out an electric battery and the lumpish boys and slattern girls were shouting and laughing as they writhed with the current a young mother seated flat on the deck with her bare feet stuck out inattentively nursed her babe while she laughed and shouted with the rest a man with his head tied in a shawl walked about the pen and smiled grotesquely with the well side of his toothacheswollen face the owner of the battery carried it away and a group of little children with blue eyes and yellow hair gathered in the space he had left and looked up at a passenger near march who was eating some plums and cherries which he had brought from the luncheon table he began to throw the fruit down to them and the children scrambled for it  an elderly man with a thin grave aquiline face said i shouldnt want a child of mine down there  no march responded it isnt quite what one would choose for ones own its astonishing though how we reconcile ourselves to it in the case of others  i suppose its something well have to get used to on the other side suggested the stranger  well answered march you have some opportunities to get used to it on this side if you happen to live in new york and he went on to speak of the raggedness which often penetrated the frontier of comfort where he lived in stuyvesant square and which seemed as glad of alms in food or money as this poverty of the steerage  the other listened restively like a man whose ideals are disturbed i dont believe i should like to live in new york much he said and march fancied that he wished to be asked where he did live it appeared that he lived in ohio and he named his town he did not brag of it but he said it suited him he added that he had never expected to go to europe but that he had begun to run down lately and his doctor thought he had better go out and try carlsbad  march said to invite his further confidence that this was exactly his own case the ohio man met the overture from a common invalidism as if it detracted from his own distinction and he turned to speak of the difficulty he had in arranging his affairs for leaving home his heart opened a little with the word and he said how comfortable he and his wife were in their house and how much they both hated to shut it up when march offered him his card he said he had none of his own with him but that his name was eltwin he betrayed a simple wish to have march realize the local importance he had left behind him and it was not hard to comply march saw a grand army button in the lapel of his coat and he knew that he was in the presence of a veteran  he tried to guess his rank in telling his wife about him when he went down to find her just before dinner but he ended with a certain sense of affliction there are too many elderly invalids on this ship i knock against people of my own age everywhere why arent your youthful lovers more in evidence my dear i dont believe they are lovers and i begin to doubt if theyre young even  it wasnt very satisfactory at lunch certainly she owned but i know it will be different at dinner she was putting herself together after a nap that had made up for the lost sleep of the night before i want you to look very nice dear shall you dress for dinner she asked her husbands image in the stateroom glass which she was preoccupying  i shall dress in my peajacket and seaboots it answered  i have heard that they always dress for dinner on the big cunard and white star boats when its good weather she went on placidly i shouldnt want those people to think you were not up in the convenances  they both knew that she meant the reticent father and daughter and march flung out i shouldnt want them to think you werent theres such a thing as overdoing  she attacked him at another point what has annoyed you what else have you been doing  nothing ive been reading most of the afternoon  the maiden knight  this was the book which nearly everybody had brought on board it was just out and had caught an instant favor which swelled later to a tidal wave it depicted a heroic girl in every trying circumstance of mediaeval life and gratified the perennial passion of both sexes for historical romance while it flattered womans instinct of superiority by the celebration of her unintermitted triumphs ending in a preposterous and wholly superfluous selfsacrifice  march laughed for pleasure in her guess and she pursued i suppose you didnt waste time looking if anybody had brought the last copy of every other week  yes i did and i found the one you had left in your steamer chairfor advertising purposes probably  mr burnamy has another she said i saw it sticking out of his pocket this morning  oh yes he told me he had got it on the train from chicago to see if it had his poem in it hes an ingenuous soulin some ways  well that is the very reason why you ought to find out whether the men are going to dress and let him know he would never think of it himself  neither would i said her husband  very well if you wish to spoil his chance at the outset she sighed  she did not quite know whether to be glad or not that the men were all in sacks and cutaways at dinner it saved her from shame for her husband and mr burnamy but it put her in the wrong every one talked even the father and daughter talked with each other and at one moment mrs march could not be quite sure that the daughter had not looked at her when she spoke she could not be mistaken in the remark which the father addressed to burnamy though it led to nothing     xii  the dinner was uncommonly good as the first dinner out is apt to be and it went gayly on from soup to fruit which was of the american abundance and variety and as yet not of the veteran freshness imparted by the icecloset everybody was eating it when by a common consciousness they were aware of alien witnesses they looked up as by a single impulse and saw at the port the gaunt face of a steerage passenger staring down upon their luxury he held on his arm a child that shared his regard with yet hungrier eyes a boys nose showed itself as if tiptoed to the height of the mans elbow a young girl peered over his other arm  the passengers glanced at one another the two tablestewards with their napkins in their hands smiled vaguely and made some indefinite movements  the bachelor at the head of the table broke the spell im glad it didnt begin with the little neck clams  probably they only let those people come for the dessert march suggested  the widow now followed the direction of the other eyes and looked up over her shoulder she gave a little cry and shrank down the young bride made her petted mouth in appeal to the company her husband looked severe as if he were going to do something but refrained not to make a scene the reticent father threw one of his staccato glances at the port and mrs march was sure that she saw the daughter steal a look at burnamy  the young fellow laughed i dont suppose theres anything to be done about it unless we pass out a plate  mr kenby shook his head it wouldnt do we might send for the captain or the chief steward  the faces at the port vanished at other ports profiles passed and repassed as if the steerage passengers had their promenade under them but they paused no more  the marches went up to their steamer chairs and from her exasperated nerves mrs march denounced the arrangement of the ship which had made such a cruel thing possible  oh he mocked they had probably had a good substantial meal of their own and the scene of our banquet was of the quality of a picture a purely aesthetic treat but supposing it wasnt were doing something like it every day and every moment of our lives the norumbia is a piece of the whole worlds civilization set afloat and passing from shore to shore with unchanged classes and conditions a ships merely a small stage where were brought to close quarters with the daily drama of humanity  well then she protested i dont like being brought to close quarters with the daily drama of humanity as you call it and i dont believe that the large english ships are built so that the steerage passengers can stare in at the saloon windows while one is eating and im sorry we came on the norumbia  ah you think the norumbia doesnt hide anything he began and he was going to speak of the men in the furnace pits of the steamer how they fed the fires in a welding heat and as if they had perished in it crept out on the forecastle like blanched phantasms of toil but she interposed in time  if theres anything worse for pitys sake dont tell me she entreated and he forebore  he sat thinking how once the world had not seemed to have even death in it and then how as he had grown older death had come into it more and more and suffering was lurking everywhere and could hardly be kept out of sight he wondered if that young burnamy now saw the world as he used to see it a place for making verse and making love and full of beauty of all kinds waiting to be fitted with phrases he had lived a happy life burnamy would be lucky if he should live one half as happy and yet if he could show him his whole happy life just as it had truly been must not the young man shrink from such a picture of his future  say something said his wife what are you thinking about  oh burnamy he answered honestly enough  i was thinking about the children she said i am glad bella didnt try to come from chicago to see us off it would have been too silly she is getting to be very sensible i hope tom wont take the covers off the furniture when he has the fellows in to see him  well i want him to get all the comfort he can out of the place even if the moths eat up every stick of furniture  yes so do i and of course youre wishing that you were there with him march laughed guiltily well perhaps it was a crazy thing for us to start off alone for europe at our age  nothing of the kind he retorted in the necessity he perceived for staying her drooping spirits i wouldnt be anywhere else on any account isnt it perfectly delicious it puts me in mind of that night on the lake ontario boat when we were starting for montreal there was the same sort of red sunset and the air wasnt a bit softer than this  he spoke of a night on their weddingjourney when they were sill new enough from europe to be comparing everything at home with things there  well perhaps we shall get into the spirit of it again she said and they talked a long time of the past  all the mechanical noises were muffled in the dull air and the wash of the ships course through the waveless sea made itself pleasantly heard in the offing a steamer homeward bound swam smoothly by so close that her lights outlined her to the eye she sent up some signal rockets that soared against the purple heaven in green and crimson and spoke to the norumbia in the mysterious mute phrases of ships that meet in the dark  mrs march wondered what had become of burnamy the promenades were much freer now than they had been since the ship sailed when she rose to go below she caught sight of burnamy walking the deck transversely with some lady she clutched her husbands arm and stayed him in rich conjecture  do you suppose he can have got her to walking with him already  they waited till burnamy and his companion came in sight again she was tilting forward and turning from the waist now to him and now from him  no its that pivotal girl said march and his wife said well im glad he wont be put down by them  in the musicroom sat the people she meant and at the instant she passed on down the stairs the daughter was saying to the father i dont see why you didnt tell me sooner papa  it was such an unimportant matter that i didnt think to mention it he offered it and i took it that was all what difference could it have made to you  none but one doesnt like to do any one an injustice  i didnt know you were thinking anything about it  no of course not     xiii  the voyage of the norumbia was one of those which passengers say they have never seen anything like though for the first two or three days out neither the doctor nor the decksteward could be got to prophesy when the ship would be in there was only a day or two when it could really be called rough and the seasickness was confined to those who seemed wilful sufferers they lay on the cushioned benching around the stairslanding and subsisted on biscuit and beef tea without qualifying the monotonous wellbeing of the other passengers who passed without noticing them  the second morning there was rain and the air freshened but the leaden sea lay level as before the sun shone in the afternoon with the sunset the fog came thick and white the ship lowed dismally through the night from the dense folds of the mist answering noises called back to her just before dark two men in a dory shouted up to her close under her bows and then melted out of sight when the dark fell the lights of fishingschooners were seen and their bells pealed once loud cries from a vessel near at hand made themselves heard some people in the diningsaloon sang hymns the smokingroom was dense with cigar fumes and the cardplayers dealt their hands in an atmosphere emulous of the fog without  the norumbia was off the banks and the second day of fog was cold as if icebergs were haunting the opaque pallor around her in the ranks of steamer chairs people lay like mummies in their dense wrappings in the musicroom the little children of travel discussed the different lines of steamers on which they had crossed and babes of five and seven disputed about the motion on the cunarders and white stars their nurses tried in vain to still them in behalf of older passengers trying to write letters there  by the next morning the ship had run out of the fog and people who could keep their feet said they were glad of the greater motion which they found beyond the banks they now talked of the heat of the first days out and how much they had suffered some who had passed the night on board before sailing tried to impart a sense of their misery in trying to sleep  a day or two later a storm struck the ship and the sailors stretched canvas along the weather promenade and put up a sheathing of boards across the bow end to keep off the rain yet a day or two more and the sea had fallen again and there was dancing on the widest space of the lee promenade  the little events of the sea outside the steamer offered themselves in their poor variety once a ship in the offing with all its square sails set lifted them like three white towers from the deep on the rim of the ocean the length of some westward liner blocked itself out against the horizon and swiftly trailed its smoke out of sight a few tramp steamers lounging and lunging through the trough of the sea were overtaken and left behind an old brigantine passed so close that her rusty iron sides showed plain and one could discern the faces of the people on board  the steamer was oftenest without the sign of any life beyond her one day a small bird beat the air with its little wings under the roof of the promenade and then flittered from sight over the surface of the waste a school of porpoises stiff and wooden in their rise plunged clumsily from wave to wave the deep itself had sometimes the unreality the artificiality of the canvas sea of the theatre commonly it was livid and cold in color but there was a morning when it was delicately misted and where the mist left it clear it was blue and exquisitely iridescent under the pale sun the wrinkled waves were finely pitted by the falling spray these were rare moments mostly when it was not like painted canvas is was hard like black rock with surfaces of smooth cleavage where it met the sky it lay flat and motionless or in the rougher weather carved itself along the horizon in successions of surges  if the sun rose clear it was overcast in a few hours then the clouds broke and let a little sunshine through to close again before the dim evening thickened over the waters sometimes the moon looked through the ragged curtain of vapors one night it seemed to shine till morning and shook a path of quicksilver from the horizon to the ship through every change after she had left the fog behind the steamer drove on with the pulse of her engines that stopped no more than a mans heart stops in a course which had nothing to mark it but the spread of the furrows from her sides and the wake that foamed from her stern to the western verge of the sea  the life of the ship like the life of the sea was a sodden monotony with certain events which were part of the monotony in the morning the little stewards bugle called the passengers from their dreams and half an hour later called them to their breakfast after such as chose had been served with coffee by their bedroomstewards then they went on deck where they read or dozed in their chairs or walked up and down or stood in the way of those who were walking or played shuffleboard and ringtoss or smoked and drank whiskey and aerated waters over their cards and papers in the smokingroom or wrote letters in the saloon or the musicroom at eleven oclock they spoiled their appetites for lunch with tea or bouillon to the music of a band of secondcabin stewards at one a single blast of the bugle called them to lunch where they glutted themselves to the torpor from which they afterwards drowsed in their berths or chairs they did the same things in the afternoon that they had done in the forenoon and at four oclock the deckstewards came round with their cups and saucers and their plates of sandwiches again to the music of the band there were two buglecalls for dinner and after dinner some went early to bed and some sat up late and had grills and toast at twelve the lights were put out in the saloons and the smokingrooms  there were various smells which stored themselves up in the consciousness to remain lastingly relative to certain moments and places a whiff of whiskey and tobacco that exhaled from the door of the smokingroom the odor of oil and steam rising from the open skylights over the engineroom the scent of stale bread about the doors of the diningsaloon  the life was like the life at a seaside hotel only more monotonous the walking was limited the talk was the tentative talk of people aware that there was no refuge if they got tired of one another the flirting itself such as there was of it must be carried on in the glare of the pervasive publicity it must be crude and bold or not be at all  there seemed to be very little of it there were not many young people on board of saloon quality and these were mostly girls the young men were mainly of the smokingroom sort they seldom risked themselves among the steamer chairs it was gayer in the second cabin and gayer yet in the steerage where robuster emotions were operated by the accordion the passengers there danced to its music they sang to it and laughed to it unabashed under the eyes of the firstcabin witnesses clustered along the rail above the pit where they took their rude pleasures  with march it came to his spending many hours of each long swift day in his berth with a book under the convenient electric light he was safe there from the acquaintances which constantly formed themselves only to fall into disintegration and cling to him afterwards as inorganic particles of weatherguessing and smokingroom gossip about the ships run  in the earliest hours of the voyage he thought that he saw some faces of the great world the world of wealth and fashion but these afterward vanished and left him to wonder where they hid themselves he did not meet them even in going to and from his meals he could only imagine them served in those palatial staterooms whose interiors the stewards now and then rather obtruded upon the public there were people whom he encountered in the promenades when he got up for the sunrise and whom he never saw at other times at midnight he met men prowling in the dark whom he never met by day but none of these were people of the great world before six oclock they were sometimes secondcabin passengers whose barrier was then lifted for a little while to give them the freedom of the saloon promenade  from time to time he thought he would look up his ohioan and revive from a closer study of him his interest in the rare american who had never been to europe but he kept with his elderly wife who had the effect of withholding him from marchs advances young mr and mrs leffers threw off more and more their disguise of a longmarried pair and became frankly bride and groom they seldom talked with any one else except at table they walked up and down together smiling into each others faces they sat side by side in their steamer chairs one shawl covered them both and there was reason to believe that they were holding each others hands under it  mrs adding often took the chair beside mrs march when her husband was straying about the ship or reading in his berth and the two ladies must have exchanged autobiographies for mrs march was able to tell him just how long mrs adding had been a widow what her husband died of and what had been done to save him how she was now perfectly wrapt up in her boy and was taking him abroad with some notion of going to switzerland after the summers travel and settling down with him at school there she and mrs march became great friends and rose as his mother called him attached himself reverently to march not only as a celebrity of the first grade in his quality of editor of every other week but as a sage of wisdom and goodness with whom he must not lose the chance of counsel upon almost every hypothesis and exigency of life  march could not bring himself to place burnamy quite where he belonged in contemporary literature when rose put him very high in virtue of the poem which he heard burnamy was going to have printed in every other week and of the book which he was going to have published and he let the boy bring to the young fellow the flattery which can come to any author but once in the first request for his autograph that burnamy confessed to have had they were so near in age though they were ten years apart that rose stood much more in awe of burnamy than of others much more his seniors he was often in the company of kenby whom he valued next to march as a person acquainted with men he consulted march upon kenbys practice of always taking up the language of the country he visited if it were only for a fortnight and he conceived a higher opinion of him from marchs approval  burnamy was most with mrs march who made him talk about himself when he supposed he was talking about literature in the hope that she could get him to talk about the triscoes but she listened in vain as he poured outhis soul in theories of literary art and in histories of what he had written and what he meant to write when he passed them where they sat together march heard the young fellows perpetually recurring i i i my my my me me me and smiled to think how she was suffering under the dripdrip of his innocent egotism  she bore in a sort of scientific patience his attentions to the pivotal girl and miss triscoes indifference to him in which a less penetrating scrutiny could have detected no change from meal to meal it was only at table that she could see them together or that she could note any break in the reserve of the father and daughter the signs of this were so fine that when she reported them march laughed in scornful incredulity but at breakfast the third day out the triscoes with the authority of people accustomed to social consideration suddenly turned to the marches and began to make themselves agreeable the father spoke to march of every other week which he seemed to know of in its relation to him and the young girl addressed herself to mrs marchs motherly sense not the less acceptably because indirectly she spoke of going out with her father for an indefinite time as if it were rather his wish than hers and she made some inquiries about places in germany they had never been in germany they had some idea of dresden but the idea of dresden with its american colony seemed rather tiresome and did mrs march know anything about weimar  mrs march was obliged to say that she knew nothing about anyplace in germany and she explained perhaps too fully where and why she was going with her husband she fancied a boston note in that scorn for the tiresomeness of dresden but the girls style was of new york rather than of boston and her accent was not quite of either place mrs march began to try the triscoes in this place and in that to divine them and to class them she had decided from the first that they were society people but they were cultivated beyond the average of the few swells whom she had met and there had been nothing offensive in their manner of holding themselves aloof from the other people at the table they had a right to do that if they chose  when the young lefferses came in to breakfast the talk went on between these and the marches the triscoes presently left the table and mrs march rose soon after eager for that discussion of their behavior which march knew he should not be able to postpone  he agreed with her that they were society people but she could not at once accept his theory that they had themselves been the objects of an advance from them because of their neutral literary quality through which they were of no social world but potentially common to any later she admitted this as she said for the sake of argument though what she wanted him to see now was that this was all a step of the girls toward finding out something about burnamy  the same afternoon about the time the decksteward was making his round with his cups miss triscoe abruptly advanced upon her from a neighboring corner of the bulkhead and asked with the air of one accustomed to have her advances gratefully received if she might sit by her the girl took marchs vacant chair where she had her cup of bouillon which she continued to hold untasted in her hand after the first sip mrs march did the same with hers and at the moment she had got very tired of doing it burnamy came by for the hundredth time that day and gave her a hundredth bow with a hundredth smile he perceived that she wished to get rid of her cup and he sprang to her relief  may i take yours too he said very passively to miss triscoe  you are very good she answered and gave it  mrs march with a casual air suggested do you know mr burnamy miss triscoe the girl said a few civil things but burnamy did not try to make talk with her while he remained a few moments before mrs march the pivotal girl came in sight tilting and turning in a rare moment of isolation at the corner of the musicroom and he bowed abruptly and hurried off to join her  miss triscoe did not linger she alleged the necessity of looking up her father and went away with a smile so friendly that mrs march might easily have construed it to mean that no blame attached itself to her in miss triscoes mind  then you dont feel that it was a very distinct success her husband asked on his return  not on the surface she said  better let ill enough alone he advised  she did not heed him all the same she cares for him the very fact that she was so cold shows that  and do you think her being cold will make him care for her  if she wants it to     xiv  at dinner that day the question of the maiden knight was debated among the noises and silences of the band young mrs leffers had brought the book to the table with her she said she had not been able to lay it down before the last horn sounded in fact she could have been seen reading it to her husband where he sat under the same shawl the whole afternoon  dont you think its perfectly fascinating she asked mrs adding with her petted mouth  well said the widow doubtfully its nearly a week since i read it and ive had time to get over the glow  oh i could just read it forever the bride exclaimed  i like a book said her husband that takes me out of myself i dont want to think when im reading  march was going to attack this ideal but he reflected in time that mr leffers had really stated his own motive in reading he compromised well i like the author to do my thinking for me  yes said the other that is what i mean  the question is whether the maiden knight fellow does it said kenby taking duck and pease from the steward at his shoulder  what my wife likes in it is to see what one woman can do and be singlehanded said march  no his wife corrected him what a man thinks she can  i suppose said mr triscoe unexpectedly that were like the english in our habit of going off about a book like a train of powder  if youll say a row of bricks march assented ill agree with you its certainly anglosaxon to fall over one another as we do when we get going it would be interesting to know just how much liking there is in the popularity of a given book  its like the run of a song isnt it kenby suggested you cant stand either when it reaches a given point  he spoke to march and ignored triscoe who had hitherto ignored the rest of the table  its very curious march said the book or the song catches a mood or feeds a craving and when one passes or the other is glutted  the discouraging part is triscoe put in still limiting himself to the marches that its never a question of real taste the things that go down with us are so crude so coarsely spiced they tickle such a vulgar palatenow in france for instance he suggested  well i dont know returned the editor after all we eat a good deal of bread and we drink more pure water than any other people even when we drink it iced i fancy it isnt so bad as absinthe  the young bride looked at him gratefully but she said if we cant get icewater in europe i dont know what mr leffers will do and the talk threatened to pass among the ladies into a comparison of american and european customs  burnamy could not bear to let it i dont pretend to be very well up in french literature he began but i think such a book as the maiden knight isnt such a bad piece of work people are liking a pretty wellbuilt story when they like it of course its sentimental and it begs the question a good deal but it imagines something heroic in character and it makes the reader imagine it too the man who wrote that book may be a donkey half the time but hes a genius the other half byandby hell do somethingafter hes come to see that his maiden knight was a foolthat i believe even you wont be down on mr march if he paints a heroic type as powerfully as he does in this book  he spoke with the authority of a journalist and though he deferred to march in the end he deferred with authority still march liked him for coming to the defence of a young writer whom he had not himself learned to like yet yes he said if he has the power you say and can keep it after he comes to his artistic consciousness  mrs leffers as if she thought things were going her way smiled rose adding listened with shining eyes expectantly fixed on march his mother viewed his rapture with tender amusement the steward was at kenbys shoulder with the salad and his entreating bleace and triscoe seemed to be questioning whether he should take any notice of burnamys general disagreement he said at last im afraid we havent the documents you dont seem to have cared much for french books and i havent read the maiden knight he added to march but i dont defend absinthe icewater is better what i object to is our indiscriminate taste both for raw whiskeyand for milkandwater  no one took up the question again and it was kenby who spoke next the doctor thinks if this weather holds that we shall be into plymouth wednesday morning i always like to get a professional opinion on the ships run  in the evening as mrs march was putting away in her portfolio the journalletter which she was writing to send back from plymouth to her children miss triscoe drifted to the place where she sat at their table in the diningroom by a coincidence which they both respected as casual  we had quite a literary dinner she remarked hovering for a moment near the chair which she later sank into it must have made you feel very much at home or perhaps youre so tired of it at home that you dont talk about books  we always talk shop in some form or other said mrs march my husband never tires of it a good many of the contributors come to us you know  it must be delightful said the girl she added as if she ought to excuse herself for neglecting an advantage that might have been hers if she had chosen im sorry one sees so little of the artistic and literary set but new york is such a big place  new york people seem to be very fond of it said mrs march those who have always lived there  we havent always lived there said the girl but i think one has a good time therethe best time a girl can have its all very well coming over for the summer one has to spend the summer somewhere are you going out for a long time  only for the summer first to carlsbad  oh yes i suppose we shall travel about through germany and then go to paris we always do my father is very fond of it  you must know it very well said mrs march aimlessly  i was born thereif that means knowing it i lived theretill i was eleven years old we came home after my mother died  oh said mrs march  the girl did not go further into her family history but by one of those leaps which seem to women as logical as other progressions she arrived at asking is mr burnamy one of the contributors  mrs march laughed he is going to be as soon as his poem is printed  poem  yes mr march thinks its very good  i thought he spoke very nicely about the maiden knight and he has been very nice to papa you know they have the same room  i think mr burnamy told me mrs march said  the girl went on he had the lower berth and he gave it up to papa hes done everything but turn himself out of doors  im sure hes been very glad mrs march ventured on burnamys behalf but very softly lest if she breathed upon these budding confidences they should shrink and wither away  i always tell papa that theres no country like america for real unselfishness and if theyre all like that in chicago the girl stopped and added with a laugh but im always quarrelling with papa about america  we have a daughter living in chicago said mrs march alluringly  but miss triscoe refused the bait either because she had said all she meant or because she had said all she would about chicago which mrs march felt for the present to be one with burnamy she gave another of her leaps i dont see why people are so anxious to get it like europe at home they say that there was a time when there were no chaperons before hoops you know she looked suggestively at mrs march resting one slim hand on the table and controlling her skirt with the other as if she were getting ready to rise at any moment when they used to sit on their steps  it was very pleasant before hoopsin every way said mrs march i was young then and i lived in boston where i suppose it was always simpler than in new york i used to sit on our steps it was delightful for girlsthe freedom  i wish i had lived before hoops said miss triscoe  well there must be places where its before hoops yet seattle and portland oregon for all i know mrs march suggested and there must be people in that epoch everywhere  like that young lady who twists and turns said miss triscoe giving first one side of her face and then the other they have a good time i suppose if europe came to us in one way it had to come in another if it came in galleries and all that sort of thing it had to come in chaperons youll think im a great extremist mrs march but sometimes i wish there was more america instead of less i dont believe its as bad as people say does mr march she asked taking hold of the chair with one hand to secure her footing from any caprice of the sea while she gathered her skirt more firmly into the other as she rose does he think that america is goingall wrong  all wrong how  oh in politics dont you know and government and all that and bribing and the lower classes having everything their own way and the horrid newspapers and everything getting so expensive and no regard for family or anything of that kind  mrs march thought she saw what miss triscoe meant but she answered still cautiously i dont believe he does always though there are times when he is very much disgusted then he says that he is getting too oldand we always quarrel about thatto see things as they really are he says that if the world had been going the way that people over fifty have always thought it was going it would have gone to smash in the time of the anthropoidal apes  oh yes darwin said miss triscoe vaguely well im glad he doesnt give it up i didnt know but i was holding out just because i had argued so much and was doing it out ofopposition goodnight she called her salutation gayly over her shoulder and mrs march watched her gliding out of the saloon with a graceful tilt to humor the slight roll of the ship and a little lurch to correct it once or twice and wondered if burnamy was afraid of her it seemed to her that if she were a young man she should not be afraid of miss triscoe  the next morning just after she had arranged herself in her steamer chair he approached her bowing and smiling with the first of his many bows and smiles for the day and at the same time miss triscoe came toward her from the opposite direction she nodded brightly to him and he gave her a bow and smile too he always had so many of them to spare  here is your chair mrs march called to her drawing the shawl out of the chair next her own mr march is wandering about the ship somewhere  ill keep it for him said miss triscoe and as burnamy offered to take the shawl that hung in the hollow of her arm she let it slip into his hand with an oh thank you which seemed also a permission for him to wrap it about her in the chair  he stood talking before the ladies but he looked up and down the promenade the pivotal girl showed herself at the corner of the musicroom as she had done the day before at first she revolved there as if she were shedding her light on some one hidden round the corner then she moved a few paces farther out and showed herself more obviously alone clearly she was there for burnamy to come and walk with her mrs march could see that and she felt that miss triscoe saw it too she waited for her to dismiss him to his flirtation but miss triscoe kept chatting on and he kept answering and making no motion to get away mrs march began to be as sorry for her as she was ashamed for him then she heard him saying would you like a turn or two and miss triscoe answering why yes thank you and promptly getting out of her chair as if the pains they had both been at to get her settled in it were all nothing  she had the composure to say you can leave your shawl with me miss triscoe and to receive her fervent oh thank you before they sailed off together with inhuman indifference to the girl at the corner of the musicroom then she sank into a kind of triumphal collapse from which she roused herself to point her husband to the chair beside her when he happened along  he chose to be perverse about her romance well now you had better let them alone remember kendricks he meant one of their young friends whose loveaffair they had promoted till his happy marriage left them in lasting doubt of what they had done my sympathies are all with the pivotal girl hadnt she as much right to him for the time being or for good and all as miss triscoe  that depends upon what you think of burnamy  well i dont like to see a girl have a young man snatched away from her just when shes made sure of him how do you suppose she is feeling now  she isnt feeling at all shes letting her revolving light fall upon half a dozen other young men by this time collectively or consecutively all that she wants to make sure of is that theyre young menor old ones even  march laughed but not altogether at what his wife said ive been having a little talk with papa triscoe in the smokingroom  you smell like it said his wife not to seem too eager well  well papa triscoe seems to be in a pout he doesnt think things are going as they should in america he hasnt been consulted or if he has his opinion hasnt been acted upon  i think hes horrid said mrs march who are they  i couldnt make out and i couldnt ask but ill tell you what i think  what  that theres no chance for burnamy hes taking his daughter out to marry her to a crowned head     xv  it was this afternoon that the dance took place on the south promenade everybody came and looked and the circle around the waltzers was three or four deep between the surrounding heads and shoulders the hats of the young ladies wheeling and whirling and the faces of the men who were wheeling and whirling them rose and sank with the rhythm of their steps the space allotted to the dancing was walled to seaward with canvas and was prettily treated with german and american flags it was hard to go wrong with flags miss triscoe said securing herself under mrs marchs wing  where they stood they could see burnamys face flashing and flushing in the dance at the end of the first piece he came to them and remained talking and laughing till the music began again  dont you want to try it he asked abruptly of miss triscoe  isnt it ratherpublic she asked back  mrs march could feel the hand which the girl had put through her arm thrill with temptation but burnamy could not  perhaps it is rather obvious he said and he made a long glide over the deck to the feet of the pivotal girl anticipating another young man who was rapidly advancing from the opposite quarter the next moment her hat and his face showed themselves in the necessary proximity to each other within the circle  how well she dances said miss triscoe  do you think so she looks as if she had been wound up and set going  shes very graceful the girl persisted  the day ended with an entertainment in the saloon for one of the marine charities which address themselves to the hearts and pockets of passengers on all steamers there were recitations in english and german and songs from several people who had kindly consented and ever more piano performance most of those who took part were of the race gifted in art and finance its children excelled in the music and its fathers counted the gatemoney during the last half of the programme with an audible clinking of the silver on the table before them  miss triscoe was with her father and mrs march was herself chaperoned by mr burnamy her husband had refused to come to the entertainment she hoped to leave burnamy and miss triscoe together before the evening ended but miss triscoe merely stopped with her father in quitting the saloon to laugh at some features of the entertainment as people who take no part in such things do burnamy stood up to exchange some unimpassioned words with her and then they said goodnight  the next morning at five oclock the norumbia came to anchor in the pretty harbor of plymouth in the cool early light the town lay distinct along the shore quaint with its small english houses and stately with come public edifices of unknown function on the uplands a countryseat of aristocratic aspect showed itself on one of the heights on another the tower of a country church peered over the treetops there were lines of fortifications as peaceful at their distance as the stone walls dividing the green fields the very ironclads in the harbor close at hand contributed to the amiable gayety of the scene under the pale blue english sky already broken with clouds from which the flush of the sunrise had not quite faded the breath of the land came freshly out over the water one could almost smell the grass and the leaves gulls wheeled and darted over the crisp water the tones of the english voices on the tender were pleasant to the ear as it fussed and scuffled to the ships side a few score of the passengers left her with their baggage they formed picturesque groups on the tenders deck and they set out for the shore waving their hands and their handkerchiefs to the friends they left clustering along the rail of the norumbia mr and mrs leffers bade march farewell in the final fondness inspired by his having coffee with them before they left the ship they said they hated to leave  the stop had roused everybody and the breakfast tables were promptly filled except such as the passengers landing at plymouth had vacated these were stripped of their cloths and the remaining commensals placed at others the seats of the lefferses were given to marchs old ohio friend and his wife he tried to engage them in the tally which began to be general in the excitement of having touched land but they shyly held aloof  some english newspapers had come aboard from the tug and there was the usual goodnatured adjustment of the american selfsatisfaction among those who had seen them to the eversurprising fact that our continent is apparently of no interest to europe there were some meagre new york stockmarket quotations in the papers a paragraph in fine print announced the lynching of a negro in alabama another recorded a coalmining strike in pennsylvania  i always have to get used to it over again said kenby this is the twentieth time i have been across and im just as much astonished as i was the first to find out that they dont want to know anything about us here  oh said march curiosity and the weather both come from the west san francisco wants to know about denver denver about chicago chicago about new york and new york about london but curiosity never travels the other way any more than a hot wave or a cold wave  ah but london doesnt care a rap about vienna said kenby  well some pressures give out before they reach the coast on our own side it isnt an infallible analogy  triscoe was fiercely chewing a morsel as if in haste to take part in the discussion he gulped it and broke out why should they care about us anyway  march lightly ventured oh men and brothers you know  that isnt sufficient ground the chinese are men and brothers so are the southamericans and centralafricans and hawaiians but were not impatient for the latest news about them its civilization that interests civilization  i hope that fact doesnt leave us out in the cold with the barbarians burnamy put in with a smile  do you think we are civilized retorted the other  we have that superstition in chicago said burnamy he added still smiling about the newyorkers i mean  youre more superstitious in chicago than i supposed new york is an anarchy tempered by vigilance committees  oh i dont think you can say that kenby cheerfully protested since the reformers came in look at our streets  yes our streets are clean for the time being and when we look at them we think we have made a clean sweep in our manners and morals but how long do you think it will be before tammany will be in the saddle again  oh never in the world said the optimistic head of the table  i wish i had your faith or i should if i didnt feel that it is one of the things that help to establish tammanys with us you will see our tammany in power after the next election kenby laughed in a largehearted incredulity and his laugh was like fuel to the others flame new york is politically a mediaeval italian republic and its morally a frontier miningtown socially its he stopped as if he could not say what  i think its a place where you have a very nice time papa said his daughter and burnamy smiled with her not because he knew anything about it  her father went on as if he had not heard her its as vulgar and crude as money can make it nothing counts but money and as soon as theres enough it counts for everything in less than a year youll have tammany in power it wont be more than a year till youll have it in society  oh no oh no came from kenby he did not care much for society but he vaguely respected it as the stronghold of the proprieties and the amenities  isnt society a good place for tammany to be in asked march in the pause triscoe let follow upon kenbys laugh  theres no reason why it shouldnt be society is as bad as all the rest of it and what new york is politically morally and socially the whole country wishes to be and tries to be  there was that measure of truth in the words which silences no one could find just the terms of refutation  well said kenby at last its a good thing there are so many lines to europe weve still got the right to emigrate  yes but even there we dont escape the abuse of our infamous newspapers for exercising a mans right to live where he chooses and there is no country in europeexcept turkey or spainthat isnt a better home for an honest man than the united states  the ohioan had once before cleared his throat as if he were going to speak now he leaned far enough forward to catch triscoes eye and said slowly and distinctly i dont know just what reason you have to feel as you do about the country i feel differently about it myselfperhaps because i fought for it  at first the others were glad of this arrogance it even seemed an answer but burnamy saw miss triscoes cheek flush and then he doubted its validity  triscoe nervously crushed a biscuit in his hand as if to expend a violent impulse upon it he said coldly i was speaking from that standpoint  the ohioan shrank back in his seat and march felt sorry for him though he had put himself in the wrong his old hand trembled beside his plate and his head shook while his lips formed silent words and his shy wife was sharing his pain and shame  kenby began to talk about the stop which the norumbia was to make at cherbourg and about what hour the next day they should all be in cuxhaven miss triscoe said they had never come on the hanseatic line before and asked several questions her father did not speak again and after a little while he rose without waiting for her to make the move from table he had punctiliously deferred to her hitherto eltwin rose at the same time and march feared that he might be going to provoke another defeat in some way  eltwin lifted his voice and said trying to catch triscoes eye i think i ought to beg your pardon sir i do beg your pardon  march perceived that eltwin wished to make the offer of his reparation as distinct as his aggression had been and now he quaked for triscoe whose daughter he saw glance apprehensively at her father as she swayed aside to let the two men come together  that is all right colonel  major eltwin conscientiously interposed  major triscoe bowed and he put out his hand and grasped the hand which had been tremulously rising toward him there cant be any doubt of what we did no matter what weve got  no no said the other eagerly that was what i meant sir i dont think as you do but i believe that a man who helped to save the country has a right to think what he pleases about it  triscoe said that is all right my dear sir may i ask your regiment  the marches let the old fellows walk away together followed by the wife of the one and the daughter of the other they saw the young girl making some graceful overtures of speech to the elder woman as they went  that was rather fine my dear said mrs march  well i dont know it was a little too dramatic wasnt it it wasnt what i should have expected of real life  oh you spoil everything if thats the spirit youre going through europe in  it isnt as soon as i touch european soil i shall reform     xvi  that was not the first time general triscoe had silenced question of his opinions with the argument he had used upon eltwin though he was seldom able to use it so aptly he always found that people suffered his belief in our national degeneration much more readily when they knew that he had left a diplomatic position in europe he had gone abroad as secretary of a minor legation to come home and fight for the union some millions of other men had gone into the war from the varied motives which impelled men at that time but he was aware that he had distinction as a man of property and a man of family in doing so his family had improved as time passed and it was now so old that back of his grandfather it was lost in antiquity this ancestor had retired from the sea and become a merchant in his native rhode island port where his son established himself as a physician and married the daughter of a former slavetrader whose social position was the highest in the place triscoe liked to mention his maternal grandfather when he wished a listener to realize just how anomalous his part in a war against slavery was it heightened the effect of his pose  he fought gallantly through the war and he was brevetted brigadiergeneral at the close with this honor and with the wound which caused an almost imperceptible limp in his gait he won the heart of a rich new york girl and her father set him up in a business which was not long in going to pieces in his hands then the young couple went to live in paris where their daughter was born and where the mother died when the child was ten years old a little later his fatherinlaw died and triscoe returned to new york where he found the fortune which his daughter had inherited was much less than he somehow thought he had a right to expect  the income from her fortune was enough to live on and he did not go back to paris where in fact things were not so much to his mind under the republic as they had been under the second empire he was still willing to do something for his country however and he allowed his name to be used on a citizens ticket in his district but his provisionman was sent to congress instead then he retired to rhode island and attempted to convert his shore property into a wateringplace but after being attractively plotted and laid out with streets and sidewalks it allured no one to build on it except the birds and the chipmonks and he came back to new york where his daughter had remained in school  one of her maternal aunts made her a comingout tea after she left school and she entered upon a series of dinners dances theatre parties and receptions of all kinds but the tide of fairy gold pouring through her fingers left no engagementring on them she had no duties but she seldom got out of humor with her pleasures she had some odd tastes of her own and in a society where none but the most serious books were ever seriously mentioned she was rather fond of good ones and had romantic ideas of a life that she vaguely called bohemian her character was never tested by anything more trying than the fear that her father might take her abroad to live he had taken her abroad several times for the summer  the dreaded trial did not approach for several years after she had ceased to be a bud and then it came when her father was again willing to serve his country in diplomacy either at the hague or at brussels or even at berne reasons of political geography prevented his appointment anywhere but general triscoe having arranged his affairs for going abroad on the mission he had expected decided to go without it he was really very fit for both of the offices he had sought and so far as a man can deserve public place by public service he had deserved it his pessimism was uncommonly well grounded and if it did not go very deep it might well have reached the bottom of his nature  his daughter had begun to divine him at the early age when parents suppose themselves still to be mysteries to their children she did not think it necessary ever to explain him to others perhaps she would not have found it possible and now after she parted from mrs eltwin and went to sit down beside mrs march she did not refer to her father she said how sweet she had found the old lady from ohio and what sort of place did mrs march suppose it was where mrs eltwin lived they seemed to have everything there like any place she had wanted to ask mrs eltwin if they sat on their steps but she had not quite dared  burnamy came by slowly and at mrs marchs suggestion he took one of the chairs on her other side to help her and miss triscoe look at the channel islands and watch the approach of the steamer to cherbourg where the norumbia was to land again the young people talked across mrs march to each other and said how charming the islands were in their graygreen insubstantiality with valleys furrowing them far inward like airy clefts in low banks of clouds it seemed all the nicer not to know just which was which but when the ship drew nearer to cherbourg he suggested that they could see better by going round to the other side of the ship miss triscoe as at the other times when she had gone off with burnamy marked her allegiance to mrs march by leaving a wrap with her  every one was restless in breaking with the old life at sea there had been an equal unrest when the ship first sailed people had first come aboard in the demoralization of severing their ties with home and they shrank from forming others then the charm of the idle eventless life grew upon them and united them in a fond reluctance from the inevitable end  now that the beginning of the end had come the pangs of disintegration were felt in all the oncemorerepellant particles burnamy and miss triscoe as they hung upon the rail owned to each other that they hated to have the voyage over they had liked leaving plymouth and being at sea again they wished that they need not be reminded of another debarkation by the energy of the crane in hoisting the cherbourg baggage from the hold  they approved of the picturesqueness of three french vessels of war that passed dragging their kraken shapes low through the level water at cherbourg an emotional french tender came out to the ship very different in her clamorous voices and excited figures from the steady selfcontrol of the english tender at plymouth and they thought the french fortifications much more on show than the english had been nothing marked their youthful date so much to the marches who presently joined them as their failure to realize that in this peaceful sea the great battle between the kearsarge and the alabama was fought the elder couple tried to affect their imaginations with the fact which reanimated the spectre of a dreadful war for themselves but they had to pass on and leave the young people unmoved  mrs march wondered if they noticed the debarkation of the pivotal girl whom she saw standing on the deck of the tender with her hands at her waist and giving now this side and now that side of her face to the young men waving their hats to her from the rail of the ship burnamy was not of their number and he seemed not to know that the girl was leaving him finally to miss triscoe if miss triscoe knew it she did nothing the whole of that long last afternoon to profit by the fact burnamy spent a great part of it in the chair beside mrs march and he showed an intolerable resignation to the girls absence  yes said march taking the place burnamy left at last that terrible patience of youth  patience folly stupidity they ought to be together every instant do they suppose that life is full of such chances do they think that fate has nothing to do but  she stopped for a fit climax and he suggested hang round and wait on them  yes its their one chance in a lifetime probably  then youve quite decided that theyre in love he sank comfortably back and put up his weary legs on the chairs extension with the conviction that love had no such joy as that to offer  ive decided that theyre intensely interested in each other  then what more can we ask of them and why do you care what they do or dont do with their chance why do you wish their love well if its that is marriage such a very certain good  it isnt all that it might be but its all that there is what would our lives have been without it she retorted  oh we should have got on its such a tremendous risk that we ought to go round begging people to think twice to count a hundred or a nonillion before they fall in love to the marryingpoint i dont mind their flirting that amuses them but marrying is a different thing i doubt if papa triscoe would take kindly to the notion of a soninlaw he hadnt selected himself and his daughter doesnt strike me as a young lady who has any wisdom to throw away on a choice she has her little charm her little gift of beauty of grace of spirit and the other things that go with her age and sex but what could she do for a fellow like burnamy who has his way to make who has the ladder of fame to climb with an old mother at the bottom of it to look after you wouldnt want him to have an eye on miss triscoes money even if she had money and i doubt if she has much its all very pretty to have a girl like her fascinated with a youth of his simple traditions though burnamy isnt altogether pastoral in his ideals and he looks forward to a place in the very world she belongs to i dont think its for us to promote the affair  well perhaps youre right she sighed i will let them alone from this out thank goodness i shall not have them under my eyes very long  oh i dont think theres any harm done yet said her husband with a laugh  at dinner there seemed so little harm of the kind he meant that she suffered from an illogical disappointment the young people got through the meal with no talk that seemed inductive burnamy left the table first and miss triscoe bore his going without apparent discouragement she kept on chatting with march till his wife took him away to their chairs on deck  there were a few more ships in sight than there were in midocean but the late twilight thickened over the north sea quite like the night after they left new york except that it was colder and their hearts turned to their children who had been in abeyance for the week past with a remorseful pang well she said i wish we were going to be in new york tomorrow instead of hamburg  oh no oh no he protested not so bad as that my dear this is the last night and its hard to manage as the last night always is i suppose the last night on earth  basil she implored  well i wont then but what i want is to see a dutch lugger ive never seen a dutch lugger and  she suddenly pressed his arm and in obedience to the signal he was silent though it seemed afterwards that he ought to have gone on talking as if he did not see burnamy and miss triscoe swinging slowly by they were walking close together and she was leaning forward and looking up into his face while he talked  now mrs march whispered long after they were out of hearing let us go instantly i wouldnt for worlds have them see us here when they get found again they would feel that they had to stop and speak and that would spoil everything come     xvii  burnamy paused in a flow of autobiography and modestly waited for miss triscoes prompting he had not to wait long  and then how soon did you think of printing your things in a book  oh about as soon as they began to take with the public  how could you tell that they weretaking  they were copied into other papers and people talked about them  and that was what made mr stoller want you to be his secretary  i dont believe it was the theory in the office was that he didnt think much of them but he knows i can write shorthand and put things into shape  what things  ohideas he has a notion of trying to come forward in politics he owns shares in everything but the united states senategas electricity railroads aldermen newspapersand now he would like some senate thats what i think  she did not quite understand and she was far from knowing that this cynic humor expressed a deadlier pessimism than her fathers fiercest accusals of the country how fascinating it is she said innocently  and i suppose they all envy your coming out  in the office  yes i should envy themstaying  burnamy laughed i dont believe they envy me it wont be all roses for methey know that but they know that i can take care of myself if it isnt he remembered something one of his friends in the office had said of the painful surprise the bird of prey would feel if he ever tried his beak on him in the belief that he was soft  she abruptly left the mere personal question and which would you rather write poems or those kind of sketches  i dont know said burnamy willing to talk of himself on any terms i suppose that prose is the thing for our time rather more but there are things you cant say in prose i used to write a great deal of verse in college but i didnt have much luck with editors till mr march took this little piece for every other week  little i thought it was a long poem  burnamy laughed at the notion its only eight lines  oh said the girl what is it about  he yielded to the temptation with a weakness which he found incredible in a person of his make i can repeat it if you wont give me away to mrs march  oh no indeed he said the lines over to her very simply and well they are beautifulbeautiful  do you think so he gasped in his joy at her praise  yes lovely do you know you are the first literary manthe only literary mani ever talked with they must go outsomewhere papa must meet them at his clubs but i never do and so im making the most of you  you cant make too much of me miss triscoe said burnamy  she would not mind his mocking that day you spoke about the maiden knight dont you know i had never heard any talk about books in that way i didnt know you were an author then  well im not much of an author now he said cynically to retrieve his folly in repeating his poem to her  oh that will do for you to say but i know what mrs march thinks  he wished very much to know what mrs march thought too every other week was such a very good place that he could not conscientiously neglect any means of having his work favorably considered there if mrs marchs interest in it would act upon her husband ought not he to know just how much she thought of him as a writer did she like the poem  miss triscoe could not recall that mrs march had said anything about the poem but she launched herself upon the general current of mrs marchs liking for burnamy but it wouldnt do to tell you all she said this was not what he hoped but he was richly content when she returned to his personal history and you didnt know any one when you went up to chicago from  tippecanoe not exactly that i wasnt acquainted with any one in the office but they had printed somethings of mine and they were willing to let me try my hand that was all i could ask  of course you knew you could do the rest well it is like a romance a woman couldnt have such an adventure as that sighed the girl  but women do burnamy retorted there is a girl writing on the paper nowshes going to do the literary notices while im gonewho came to chicago from ann arbor with no more chance than i had and whos made her way singlehanded from interviewing up  oh said miss triscoe with a distinct drop in her enthusiasm is she nice  shes mighty clever and shes nice enough too though the kind of journalism that women do isnt the most dignified and shes one of the best girls i know with lots of sense  it must be very interesting said miss triscoe with little interest in the way she said it i suppose youre quite a little community by yourselves  on the paper  yes  well some of us know one another in the office but most of us dont theres quite a regiment of people on a big paper if youd like to come out burnamy ventured perhaps you could get the womans page to do  whats that  oh fashion and personal gossip about society leaders and recipes for dishes and diseases and correspondence on points of etiquette  he expected her to shudder at the notion but she merely asked do women write it  he laughed reminiscently well not always we had one man who used to do it beautifullywhen he was sober the department hasnt had any permanent head since  he was sorry he had said this but it did not seem to shock her and no doubt she had not taken it in fully she abruptly left the subject do you know what time we really get in tomorrow  about one i believetheres a consensus of stewards to that effect anyway after a pause he asked are you likely to be in carlsbad  we are going to dresden first i believe then we may go on down to vienna but nothing is settled yet  are you going direct to dresden  i dont know we may stay in hamburg a day or two  ive got to go straight to carlsbad theres a sleepingcar that will get me there by morning mr stoller likes zeal but i hope youll let me be of use to you any way i can before we part tomorrow  youre very kind youve been very good alreadyto papa he protested that he had not been at all good but hes used to taking care of himself on the other side oh its this side now  so it is how strange that seems its actually europe but as long as were at sea we cant realize it dont you hate to have experiences slip through your fingers  i dont know a girl doesnt have many experiences of her own theyre always other peoples  this affected burnamy as so profound that he did not question its truth he only suggested well sometimes they make other people have the experiences  whether miss triscoe decided that this was too intimate or not she left the question do you understand german  a little i studied it at college and ive cultivated a sort of beergarden german in chicago i can ask for things  i cant except in french and thats worse than english in germany i hear  then you must let me be your interpreter up to the last moment will you  she did not answer it must be rather late isnt it she asked he let her see his watch and she said yes its very late and led the way within i must look after my packing papas always so prompt and i must justify myself for making him let me give up my maid when we left home we expect to get one in dresden goodnight  burnamy looked after her drifting down their corridor and wondered whether it would have been a fit return for her expression of a sense of novelty in him as a literary man if he had told her that she was the first young lady he had known who had a maid the fact awed him miss triscoe herself did not awe him so much     xviii  the next morning was merely a transitional period full of turmoil and disorder between the broken life of the sea and the untried life of the shore no one attempted to resume the routine of the voyage people went and came between their rooms and the saloons and the decks and were no longer careful to take their own steamer chairs when they sat down for a moment  in the cabins the berths were not made up and those who remained below had to sit on their hard edges or on the sofas which were cumbered with handbags and rolls of shawls at an early hour after breakfast the bedroom stewards began to get the steamer trunks out and pile them in the corridors the servants all became more caressingly attentive and people who had left off settling the amount of the fees they were going to give anxiously conferred together the question whether you ought ever to give the head steward anything pressed crucially at the early lunch and kenby brought only a partial relief by saying that he always regarded the head steward as an officer of the ship march made the experiment of offering him six marks and the head steward took them quite as if he were not an officer of the ship he also collected a handsome fee for the music which is the tax levied on all german ships beyond the tolls exacted on the steamers of other nations  after lunch the flat shore at cuxhaven was so near that the summer cottages of the little wateringplace showed through the warm drizzle much like the summer cottages of our own shore and if it had not been for the strange low sky the americans might easily have fancied themselves at home again  every one waited on foot while the tender came out into the stream where the norumbia had dropped anchor people who had brought their handbaggage with them from their rooms looked so much safer with it that people who had left theirs to their stewards had to go back and pledge them afresh not to forget it the tender came alongside and the transfer of the heavy trunks began but it seemed such an endless work that every one sat down in some others chair at last the trunks were all on the tender and the bareheaded stewards began to run down the gangways with the handbaggage is this hoboken march murmured in his wifes ear with a bewildered sense of something in the scene like the reversed action of the kinematograph  on the deck of the tender there was a brief moment of reunion among the companions of the voyage the more intimate for their being crowded together under cover from the drizzle which now turned into a dashing rain burnamys smile appeared and then mrs march recognized miss triscoe and her father in their travel dress they were not far from burnamys smile but he seemed rather to have charge of the eltwins whom he was helping look after their bags and bundles rose adding was talking with kenby and apparently asking his opinion of something mrs adding sat near them tranquilly enjoying her son  mrs march made her husband identify their baggage large and small and after he had satisfied her he furtively satisfied himself by a fresh count that it was all there but he need not have taken the trouble their long calm bedroomsteward was keeping guard over it his eyes expressed a contemptuous pity for their anxiety whose like he must have been very tired of he brought their handbags into the customsroom at the station where they landed and there took a last leave and a last fee with unexpected cordiality  again their companionship suffered eclipse in the distraction which the customs inspectors of all countries bring to travellers and again they were united during the long delay in the waitingroom which was also the restaurant it was full of strange noises and figures and odorsthe shuffling of feet the clash of crockery the explosion of nervous german voices mixed with the smell of beer and ham and the smoke of cigars through it all pierced the wail of a postman standing at the door with a letter in his hand and calling out at regular intervals krahnay krahnay when march could bear it no longer he went up to him and shouted crane crane and the man bowed gratefully and began to cry kren kren but whether mr crane got his letter or not he never knew  people were swarming at the window of the telegraphoffice and sending home cablegrams to announce their safe arrival march could not forbear cabling to his son though he felt it absurd there was a great deal of talking but no laughing except among the americans and the girls behind the bar who tried to understand what they wanted and then served them with what they chose for them otherwise the germans though voluble were unsmiling and here on the threshold of their empire the travellers had their first hint of the anxious mood which seems habitual with these amiable people  mrs adding came screaming with glee to march where he sat with his wife and leaned over her son to ask do you know what lesemajesty is rose is afraid ive committed it  no i dont said march but its the unpardonable sin what have you been doing  i asked the official at the door when our train would start and when he said at half past three i said how tiresome rose says the railroads belong to the state here and that if i find fault with the timetable its constructive censure of the emperor and thats lesemajesty she gave way to her mirth while the boy studied marchs face with an appealing smile  well i dont think youll be arrested this time mrs adding but i hope it will be a warning to mrs march shes been complaining of the coffee  indeed i shall say what i like said mrs march im an american  well youll find youre a german if you like to say anything disagreeable about the coffee in the restaurant of the emperors railroad station the first thing you know i shall be given three months on your account  mrs adding asked then they wont punish ladies there rose im safe you see and youre still a minor though you are so wise for your years  she went back to her table where kenby came and sat down by her  i dont know that i quite like her playing on that sensitive child said mrs march and youve joined with her in her joking go and speak to him  the boy was slowly following his mother with his head fallen march overtook him and he started nervously at the touch of a hand on his shoulder and then looked gratefully up into the mans face march tried to tell him what the crime of lesemajesty was and he said oh yes i understood that but i got to thinking and i dont want my mother to take any risks  i dont believe she will really rose but ill speak to her and tell her she cant be too cautious  not now please the boy entreated  well ill find another chance march assented he looked round and caught a smiling nod from burnamy who was still with the eltwins the triscoes were at a table by themselves miss triseoe nodded too but her father appeared not to see march its all right with rose he said when he sat down again by his wife but i guess its all over with burnamy and he told her what he had seen do you think it came to any displeasure between them last night do you suppose he offered himself and she  what nonsense said mrs march but she was not at peace its her father whos keeping her away from him  i shouldnt mind that hes keeping her away from us too but at that moment miss triscoe as if she had followed his return from afar came over to speak to his wife she said they were going on to dresden that evening and she was afraid they might have no chance to see each other on the train or in hamburg march at this advance went to speak with her father he found him no more reconciled to europe than america  theyre goths he said of the germans i could hardly get that stupid brute in the telegraphoffice to take my despatch  on his way back to his wife march met miss triscoe he was not altogether surprised to meet burnamy with her now the young fellow asked if he could be of any use to him and then he said he would look him up in the train he seemed in a hurry but when he walked away with miss triscoe he did not seem in a hurry  march remarked upon the change to his wife and she sighed yes you can see that as far as theyre concerned  its a great pity that there should be parents to complicate these affairs he said how simple it would be if there were no parties to them but the lovers but nature is always insisting upon fathers and mothers and families on both sides     xix  the long train which they took at last was for the norumbias people alone and it was of several transitional and tentative types of cars some were still the old coachbody carriages but most were of a strange corridor arrangement with the aide at the aide and the seats crossing from it with compartments sometimes rising to the roof and sometimes rising halfway no two cars seemed quite alike but all were very comfortable and when the train began to run out through the little seaside town into the country the old delight of foreign travel began most of the houses were little and low and gray with ivy or flowering vines covering their walls to their browntiled roofs there was here and there a touch of northern gothic in the architecture but usually where it was pretentious it was in the mansard taste which was so bad with us a generation ago and is still very bad in cuxhaven  the fields flat and wide were dotted with familiar shapes of holstein cattle herded by little girls with their hair in yellow pigtails the gray stormy sky hung low and broke in fitful rains but perhaps for the inclement season of midsummer it was not very cold flowers were blooming along the embankments and in the rank green fields with a dogged energy in the various distances were groups of trees embowering cottages and even villages and always along the ditches and watercourses were double lines of low willows at the first stop the train made the passengers flocked to the refreshmentbooth prettily arranged beside the station where the abundance of the cherries and strawberries gave proof that vegetation was in other respects superior to the elements but it was not of the profusion of the sausages and the ham which openly in slices or covertly in sandwiches claimed its primacy in the german affections every form of this was flanked by tall glasses of beer  a number of the natives stood by and stared unsmiling at the train which had broken out in a rash of little american flags at every window this boyish display which must have made the americans themselves laugh if their sense of humor had not been lost in their impassioned patriotism was the last expression of unity among the norumbias passengers and they met no more in their seasolidarity of their table acquaintance the marches saw no one except burnamy who came through the train looking for them he said he was in one of the rear cars with the eltwins and was going to carlsbad with them in the sleepingcar train leaving hamburg at seven he owned to having seen the triscoes since they had left cuxhaven mrs march would not suffer herself to ask him whether they were in the same carriage with the eltwins he had got a letter from mr stoller at cuxhaven and he begged the marches to let him engage rooms for them at the hotel where he was going to stay with him  after they reached hamburg they had flying glimpses of him and of others in the odious rivalry to get their baggage examined first which seized upon all and in which they no longer knew one another but selfishly struggled for the goodwill of porters and inspectors there was really no such haste but none could govern themselves against the general frenzy with the porter he secured march conspired and perspired to win the attention of a cold but not unkindly inspector the officer opened one trunk and after a glance at it marked all as passed and then there ensued a heroic strife with the porter as to the pieces which were to go to the berlin station for their journey next day and the pieces which were to go to the hotel overnight at last the division was made the marches got into a cab of the first class and the porter crimson and steaming at every pore from the physical and intellectual strain went back into the station  they had got the number of their cab from the policeman who stands at the door of all large german stations and supplies the traveller with a metallic check for the sort of vehicle he demands they were not proud but it seemed best not to risk a secondclass cab in a strange city and when their firstclass cab came creaking and limping out of the rank they saw how wise they had been if one of the second class could have been worse  as they rattled away from the station they saw yet another kind of turnout which they were destined to see more and more in the german lands it was that team of a woman harnessed with a dog to a cart which the women of no other country can see without a sense of personal insult march tried to take the humorous view and complained that they had not been offered the choice of such an equipage by the policeman but his wife would not be amused she said that no country which suffered such a thing could be truly civilized though he made her observe that no city in the world except boston or brooklyn was probably so thoroughly trolleyed as hamburg the hum of the electric car was everywhere and everywhere the shriek of the wires overhead batlike flights of connecting plates traversed all the perspectives through which they drove to the pleasant little hotel they had chosen     xx  on one hand their windows looked toward a basin of the elbe where stately white swans were sailing and on the other to the new rathhaus over the trees that deeply shaded the perennial mud of a cold dim public garden where waterproof old women and impervious nurses sat and children played in the long twilight of the sour rainsoaked summer of the fatherland it was all picturesque and withindoors there was the novelty of the meagre carpets and stalwart furniture of the germans and their beds which after so many ages of anglosaxon satire remain immutably preposterous they are apparently imagined for the stature of sleepers who have shortened as they broadened their pillows are triangularly shaped to bring the chin tight upon the breast under the bloated feather bulk which is meant for covering and which rises over the sleeper from a thick substratum of cotton coverlet neatly buttoned into the upper sheet with the effect of a portly waistcoat  the hotel was illumined by the kindly splendor of the uniformed portier who had met the travellers at the door like a glowing vision of the past and a friendly air diffused itself through the whole house at the dinner which if not so cheap as they had somehow hoped was by no means bad they took counsel with the englishspeaking waiter as to what entertainment hamburg could offer for the evening and by the time they had drunk their coffee they had courage for the circus renz which seemed to be all there was  the conductor of the trolleycar which they hailed at the street corner stopped it and got off the platform and stood in the street until they were safely aboard without telling them to step lively or pulling them up the steps or knuckling them in the back to make them move forward he let them get fairly seated before he started the car and so lost the fun of seeing them lurch and stagger violently and wildly clutch each other for support the germans have so little sense of humor that probably no one in the car would have been amused to see the strangers flung upon the floor no one apparently found it droll that the conductor should touch his cap to them when he asked for their fare no one smiled at their efforts to make him understand where they wished to go and he did not wink at the other passengers in trying to find out whenever the car stopped he descended first and did not remount till the dismounting passenger had taken time to get well away from it when the marches got into the wrong car in coming home and were carried beyond their street the conductor would not take their fare  the kindly civility which environed them went far to alleviate the inclemency of the climate it began to rain as soon as they left the shelter of the car but a citizen of whom they asked the nearest way to the circus renz was so anxious to have them go aright that they did not mind the wet and the thought of his goodness embittered marchs selfreproach for undertipping the sort of gorgeous heyduk with a staff like a drummajors who left his place at the circus door to get their tickets he brought them back with a magnificent bow and was then as visibly disappointed with the share of the change returned to him as a child would have been  they went to their places with the sting of his disappointment rankling in their hearts one ought always to overpay them march sighed and i will do it from this time forth we shall not be much the poorer for it that heyduk is not going to get off with less than a mark when we come out as an earnest of his good faith he gave the old man who showed them to their box a tip that made him bow double and he bought every conceivable libretto and playbill offered him at prices fixed by his remorse  one ought to do it he said we are of the quality of good geniuses to these poor souls we are fortune in disguise we are money found in the road it is an accursed system but they are more its victims than we his wife quite agreed with him and with the same good conscience between them they gave themselves up to the pure joy which the circus of all modern entertainments seems alone to inspire the house was full from floor to roof when they came ins and every one was intent upon the two spanish clowns luilui and soltamontes whose drolleries spoke the universal language of circus humor and needed no translation into either german or english they had missed by an event or two the more patriotic attraction of miss darlings the american star as she was billed in english but they were in time for one of those equestrian performances which leave the spectator almost exanimate from their prolixity and the pantomimic piece which closed the evening  this was not given until nearly the whole house had gone out and stayed itself with beer and cheese and ham and sausage in the restaurant which purveys these light refreshments in the summer theatres all over germany when the people came back gorged to the throat they sat down in the right mood to enjoy the allegory of the enchanted mountains fantasy the mountain episodes the highinteresting sledgescourses on the steep acclivities the amazinguprush of the thence plungingfour trains which arrive with lightningsswiftness at the top of the over40feethigh mountainthe highest triumph of the todays circusart the sledgejourney in the wizardmountain and the fairy ballet in the realm of the ghostprince with gold and silver jewel bloomghosts gnomes gnomesses and dwarfs in nevertillnowseen splendor of costume the marches were happy in this allegory and happier in the ballet which is everywhere delightfully innocent and which here appealed with the large flat feet and the plain good faces of the coryphees to all that was simplest and sweetest in their natures they could not have resisted if they had wished that environment of goodwill and if it had not been for the disappointed heyduk they would have got home from their evening at the circus renz without a pang  they looked for him everywhere when they came out but he had vanished and they were left with a regret which if unavailing was not too poignant in spite of it they had still an exhilaration in their release from the companionship of their fellowvoyagers which they analyzed as the psychical revulsion from the strain of too great interest in them mrs march declared that for the present at least she wanted europe quite to themselves and she said that not even for the pleasure of seeing burnamy and miss triscoe come into their box together world she have suffered an american trespass upon their exclusive possession of the circus renz  in the audience she had seen german officers for the first time in hamburg and she meant if unremitting question could bring out the truth to know why she had not met any others she had read much of the prevalence and prepotence of the german officers who would try to push her off the sidewalk till they realized that she was an american woman and would then submit to her inflexible purpose of holding it but she had been some seven or eight hours in hamburg and nothing of the kind had happened to her perhaps because she had hardly yet walked a block in the city streets but perhaps also because there seemed to be very few officers or military of any kind in hamburg     xxi  their absence was plausibly explained the next morning by the young german friend who came in to see the marches at breakfast he said hamburg had been so long a free republic that the presence of a large imperial garrison was distasteful to the people and as a matter of fact there were very few soldiers quartered there whether the authorities chose to indulge the popular grudge or not he was himself in a joyful flutter of spirits for he had just the day before got his release from military service he gave them a notion of what the rapture of a man reprieved from death might be and he was as radiantly happy in the ill health which had got him his release as if it had been the greatest blessing of heaven he bubbled over with smiling regrets that he should be leaving his home for the first stage of the journey which he was to take in search of strength just as they had come and he pressed them to say if there were not something that he could do for them  yes said mrs march with a promptness surprising to her husband who could think of nothing tell us where heinrich heine lived when he was in hamburg my husband has always had a great passion for him and wants to look him up everywhere  march had forgotten that heine ever lived in hamburg and the young man had apparently never known it his face fell he wished to make mrs march believe that it was only heines uncle who had lived there but she was firm and when he had asked among the hotel people he came back gladly owning that he was wrong and that the poet used to live in konigstrasse which was very near by and where they could easily know the house by his bust set in its front the portier and the head waiter shared his ecstasy in so easily obliging the friendly american pair and joined him in minutely instructing the driver when they shut them into their carriage  they did not know that his was almost the only laughing face they should see in the serious german empire just as they did not know that it rained there every day as they drove off in the gray drizzle with the unfounded hope that sooner or later the weather would be fine they bade their driver be very slow in taking them through konigstrasse so that he should by no means miss heines dwelling and he duly stopped in front of a house bearing the promised bust they dismounted in order to revere it more at their ease but the bust proved by an irony bitterer than the sick heartbreaking brilliant jew could have imagined in his cruelest moment to be that of the german milton the respectable poet klopstock whom heine abhorred and mocked so pitilessly  in fact it was here that the good muchforgotten klopstock dwelt when he came home to live with a comfortable pension from the danish government and the pilgrims to the mistaken shrine went asking about among the neighbors in konigstrasse for some manner of house where heine might have lived they would have been willing to accept a flat or any sort of twopair back the neighbors were somewhat moved by the anxiety of the strangers but they were not so much moved as neighbors in italy would have been there was no eager and smiling sympathy in the little crowd that gathered to see what was going on they were patient of question and kind in their helpless response but they were not gay to a man they had not heard of heine even the owner of a sausage and bloodpudding shop across the way had not heard of him the clerk of a stationerandbooksellers next to the butchers had heard of him but he had never heard that he lived in konigstrasse he never had heard where he lived in hamburg  the pilgrims to the fraudulent shrine got back into their carriage and drove sadly away instructing their driver with the rigidity which their limited german favored not to let any house with a bust in its front escape him he promised and took his course out through konigstrasse and suddenly they found themselves in a world of such eld and quaintness that they forgot heine as completely as any of his countrymen had done they were in steep and narrow streets that crooked and turned with no apparent purpose of leading anywhere among houses that looked down upon them with an astonished stare from the leadensashed windows of their timberlaced gables the facades with their lattices stretching in bands quite across them and with their steep roofs climbing high in successions of blinking dormers were more richly mediaeval than anything the travellers had ever dreamt of before and they feasted themselves upon the unimagined picturesqueness with a leisurely minuteness which brought responsive gazers everywhere to the windows windows were set ajar shop doors were darkened by curious figures from within and the traffic of the tortuous alleys was interrupted by their progress they could not have said which delighted them morethe houses in the immediate foreground or the sharp high gables in the perspectives and the background but all were like the painted scenes of the stage and they had a pleasant difficulty in realizing that they were not persons in some romantic drama  the illusion remained with them and qualified the impression which hamburg made by her muchtrolleyed bostonian effect by the decorous activity and parisian architecture of her business streets by the turmoil of her quays and the innumerable masts and chimneys of her shipping at the heart of all was that quaintness that picturesqueness of the past which embodied the spirit of the old hanseatic city and seemed the expression of the homeside of her history the sense of this gained strength from such slight study of her annals as they afterwards made and assisted the digestion of some morsels of tough statistics in the shadow of those gothic houses the fact that hamburg was one of the greatest coffee marts and money marts of the world had a romantic glamour and the fact that in the four years from 1870 till 1874 a quarter of a million emigrants sailed on her ships for the united states seemed to stretch a nerve of kindred feeling from those mediaeval streets through the whole shabby length of third avenue  it was perhaps in this glamour or this feeling of commercial solidarity that march went to have a look at the hamburg bourse in the beautiful new rathhaus it was not undergoing repairs it was too new for that but it was in construction and so it fulfilled the function of a public edifice in withholding its entire interest from the stranger he could not get into the senate chamber but the bourse was free to him and when he stepped within it rose at him with a roar of voices and of feet like the new york stock exchange the spectacle was not so frantic people were not shaking their fists or fingers in each others noses but they were all wild in the tamer german way and he was glad to mount from the bourse to the poor little art gallery upstairs and to shut out its clamor he was not so glad when he looked round on these his first examples of modern german art the custodian led him gently about and said which things were for sale and it made his heart ache to see how bad they were and to think that bad as they were he could not buy any of them     xxii  in the start from cuxhaven the passengers had the irresponsible ease of people ticketed through and the steamship company had still the charge of their baggage but when the marches left hamburg for leipsic where they had decided to break the long pull to carlsbad all the anxieties of european travel dimly remembered from former european days offered themselves for recognition a porter vanished with their handbaggage before they could note any trait in him for identification other porters made away with their trunks and the interpreter who helped march buy his tickets with a vocabulary of strictly railroad english had to help him find the pieces in the baggageroom curiously estranged in a mountain of alien boxes one official weighed them another obliged him to pay as much in freight as for a third passenger and gave him an illegible scrap of paper which recorded their number and destination the interpreter and the porters took their fees with a professional effect of dissatisfaction and he went to wait with his wife amidst the smoking and eating and drinking in the restaurant they burst through with the rest when the doors were opened to the train and followed a glimpse of the porter with their handbags as he ran down the platform still bent upon escaping them and brought him to bay at last in a car where he had got very good seats for them and sank into their places hot and humiliated by their needless tumult  as they cooled they recovered their selfrespect and renewed a youthful joy in some of the longestranged facts the road was rougher than the roads at home but for much less money they had the comfort without the unavailing splendor of a pullman in their secondclass carriage mrs march had expected to be used with the severity on the imperial railroads which she had failed to experience from the military on the hamburg sidewalks but nothing could be kindlier than the whole management toward her her fellowtravellers were not lavish of their rights as americans are what they got that they kept and in the run from hamburg to leipsic she had several occasions to observe that no german however young or robust dreams of offering a better place if he has one to a lady in grace to her sex or age if they got into a carriage too late to secure a forwardlooking seat she rode backward to the end of that stage but if they appealed to their fellowtravellers for information about changes or stops or any of the little facts that they wished to make sure of they were enlightened past possibility of error at the point where they might have gone wrong the explanations were renewed with a thoughtfulness which showed that their anxieties had not been forgotten she said she could not see how any people could be both so selfish and so sweet and her husband seized the advantage of saying something offensive  you women are so pampered in america that you are astonished when you are treated in europe like the mere human beings you are  she answered with unexpected reasonableness  yes theres something in that but when the germans have taught us how despicable we are as women why do they treat us so well as human beings  this was at ten oclock after she had ridden backward a long way and at last within an hour of leipsic had got a seat confronting him the darkness had now hidden the landscape but the impression of its few simple elements lingered pleasantly in their sense long levels densely wooded with the precise severely disciplined german forests and checkered with fields of grain and grass soaking under the thin rain that from time to time varied the thin sunshine  the villages and peasants cottages were notably few but there was here and there a classic or a gothic villa which at one point an englishspeaking young lady turned from her tauchnitz novel to explain as the seat of some country gentleman the land was in large holdings and this accounted for the sparsity of villages and cottages  she then said that she was a german teacher of english in hamburg and was going home to potsdam for a visit she seemed like a german girl out of the initials and in return for this favor mrs march tried to invest herself with some romantic interest as an american she failed to move the girls fancy even after she had bestowed on her an immense bunch of roses which the young german friend in hamburg had sent to them just before they left their hotel she failed later on the same ground with the pleasantlooking english woman who got into their carriage at magdeburg and talked over the london illustrated news with an englishspeaking fraulein in her company she readily accepted the fact of mrs marchs nationality but found nothing wonderful in it apparently and when she left the train she left mrs march to recall with fond regret the old days in italy when she first came abroad and could make a whole carriage full of italians break into ohs and ahs by saying that she was an american and telling how far she had come across the sea  yes march assented but that was a great while ago and americans were much rarer than they are now in europe the italians are so much more sympathetic than the germans and english and they saw that you wanted to impress them heaven knows how little they cared and then you were a very pretty young girl in those days or at least i thought so  yes she sighed and now im a plain old woman  oh not quite so bad as that  yes i am do you think they would have cared more if it had been miss triscoe  not so much as if it had been the pivotal girl they would have found her much more their ideal of the american woman and even she would have had to have been here thirty years ago  she laughed a little ruefully well at any rate i should like to know how miss triscoe would have affected them  i should much rather know what sort of life that english woman is living here with her german husband i fancied she had married rank i could imagine how dull it must be in her little saxon town from the way she clung to her illustrated news and explained the pictures of the royalties to her friend there is romance for you  they arrived at leipsic fresh and cheerful after their five hours journey and as in a spell of their travelled youth they drove up through the academic old town asleep under its dimly clouded sky and silent except for the trolleycars that prowled its streets with their feline purr and broke at times into a long shrill caterwaul a sense of the past imparted itself to the wellknown encounter with the portier and the head waiter at the hotel door to the payment of the driver to the endeavor of the secretary to have them take the most expensive rooms in the house and to his compromise upon the next most where they found themselves in great comfort with electric lights and bells and a quick succession of feetaking callboys in dresscoats too large for them the spell was deepened by the fact which march kept at the bottom of his consciousness for the present that one of their trunks was missing this linked him more closely to the travel of other days and he spent the next forenoon in a telegraphic search for the estray with emotions tinged by the melancholy of recollection but in the security that since it was somewhere in the keeping of the state railway it would be finally restored to him     xxiii  their windows as they saw in the morning looked into a large square of aristocratic physiognomy and of a parisian effect in architecture which afterwards proved characteristic of the town if not quite so characteristic as to justify the passion of leipsic for calling itself little paris the prevailing tone was of a gray tending to the pale yellow of the tauchnitz editions with which the place is more familiarly associated in the minds of englishspeaking travellers it was rather more sombre than it might have been if the weather had been fair but a quiet rain was falling dreamily that morning and the square was provided with a fountain which continued to dribble in the rare moments when the rain forgot itself the place was better shaded than need be in that sunless land by the german elms that look like ours and it was sufficiently stocked with german statues that look like no others it had a monument too of the sort with which german art has everywhere disfigured the kindly fatherland since the war with france these monuments though they are so very ugly have a sort of pathos as records of the only war in which germany unaided has triumphed against a foreign foe but they are as tiresome as all such memorial pomps must be it is not for the victories of a people that any other people can care the wars come and go in blood and tears but whether they are bad wars or what are comically called good wars they are of one effect in death and sorrow and their fame is an offence to all men not concerned in them till time has softened it to a memory    of old unhappy faroff things    and battles long ago  it was for some such reason that while the marches turned with instant satiety from the swelling and strutting sculpture which celebrated the leipsic heroes of the war of 1870 they had heart for those of the war of 1813 and after their noonday dinner they drove willingly in a pause of the rain out between yellowing harvests of wheat and oats to the field where napoleon was beaten by the russians austrians and prussians it always took at least three nations to beat the little wretch fourscore years before yet even there mrs march was really more concerned for the sparsity of cornflowers in the grain which in their modern character of kaiserblumen she found strangely absent from their loyal function and march was more taken with the notion of the little gardens which his guide told him the citizens could have in the suburbs of leipsic and enjoy at any trolleycar distance from their homes he saw certain of these gardens in groups divided by low unenvious fences and sometimes furnished with summerhouses where the tenant could take his pleasure in the evening air with his family the guide said he had such a garden himself at a rent of seven dollars a year where he raised vegetables and flowers and spent his peaceful leisure and march fancied that on the simple domestic side of their life which this fact gave him a glimpse of the germans were much more engaging than in their character of victors over either the first or the third napoleon but probably they would not have agreed with him and probably nations will go on making themselves cruel and tiresome till humanity at last prevails over nationality  he could have put the case to the guide himself but though the guide was imaginably liberated to a cosmopolitan conception of things by three years service as waiter in english hotels where he learned the language he might not have risen to this he would have tried for he was a willing and kindly soul though he was not a valet de place by profession there seemed in fact but one of that useless and amusing race which is everywhere falling into decay through the rivalry of the perfected baedeker left in leipsic and this one was engaged so that the marches had to devolve upon their exwaiter who was now the keeper of a small restaurant he gladly abandoned his business to the care of his wife in order to drive handsomely about in his best clothes with strangers who did not exact too much knowledge from him in his zeal to do something he possessed himself of marchs overcoat when they dismounted at their first gallery and let fall from its pocket his prophylactic flask of brandy which broke with a loud crash on the marble floor in the presence of several masterpieces and perfumed the whole place the masterpieces were some excellent works of luke kranach who seemed the only german painter worth looking at when there were any dutch or italian pictures near but the travellers forgot the name and nature of the kranachs and remembered afterwards only the shattered fragments of the brandyflask just how they looked on the floor and the fumes how they smelt that rose from the ruin  it might have been a warning protest of the veracities against what they were doing but the madness of sightseeing which spoils travel was on them and they delivered themselves up to it as they used in their ignorant youth though now they knew its futility so well they spared themselves nothing that they had time for that day and they felt falsely guilty for their omissions as if they really had been duties to art and history which must be discharged like obligations to ones maker and ones neighbor  they had a touch of genuine joy in the presence of the beautiful old rathhaus and they were sensible of something like a genuine emotion in passing the famous and venerable university the very air of leipsic is redolent of printing and publication which appealed to march in his quality of editor and they could not fail of an impression of the quiet beauty of the town with its regular streets of houses breaking into suburban villas of an american sort and intersected with many canals which in the intervals of the rain were eagerly navigated by pleasure boats and contributed to the general picturesqueness by their frequent bridges even during the drizzle there seemed to be no churches to do and as it was a sunday the galleries were so early closed against them that they were making a virtue as well as a pleasure of the famous scene of napoleons first great defeat  by a concert between their guide and driver their carriage drew up at the little inn by the roadside which is also a museum stocked with relics from the battlefield and with objects of interest relating to it old muskets old swords old shoes and old coats trumpets drums guncarriages wheels helmets cannon balls grapeshot and all the murderous rubbish which battles come to at last with proclamations autographs caricatures and likenesses of napoleon and effigies of all the other generals engaged and miniatures and jewels of their womenkind filled room after room through which their owner vaunted his way with a loud pounding voice and a bad breath when he wished them to enjoy some gross british satire or clumsy german gibe at bonapartes expense and put his face close to begin the laugh he was something so terrible that march left the place with a profound if not a reasoned regret that the french had not won the battle of leipsic he walked away musing pensively upon the travellers inadequacy to the ethics of history when a breath could so sway him against his convictions but even after he had cleansed his lungs with some deep respirations he found himself still a bonapartist in the presence of that stone on the rising ground where napoleon sat to watch the struggle on the vast plain and see his empire slipping through his bloodstained fingers it was with difficulty that he could keep from revering the hat and coat which are sculptured on the stone but it was well that he succeeded for he could not make out then or afterwards whether the habiliments represented were really napoleons or not and they might have turned out to be barclay de tollys  while he stood trying to solve this question of clothes he was startled by the apparition of a man climbing the little slope from the opposite quarter and advancing toward them he wore the imperial crossed by the pointed mustache once so familiar to a world much the worse for them and march had the shiver of a fine moment in which he fancied the third napoleon rising to view the scene where the first had looked his coming ruin in the face  why its miss triscoe cried his wife and before march had noticed the approach of another figure the elder and the younger lady had rushed upon each other and encountered with a kiss at the same time the visage of the last emperor resolved itself into the face of general triscoe who gave march his hand in a more tempered greeting  the ladies began asking each other of their lives since their parting two days before and the men strolled a few paces away toward the distant prospect of leipsic which at that point silhouettes itself in a noble stretch of roofs and spires and towers against the horizon  general triscoe seemed no better satisfied with germany than he had been on first stepping ashore at cuxhaven he might still have been in a pout with his own country but as yet he had not made up with any other and he said what a pity napoleon didnt thrash the whole dunderheaded lot his empire would have been a blessing to them and they would have had some chance of being civilized under the french all this unification of nationalities is the great humbug of the century every stupid race thinks its happy because its united and civilization has been set back a hundred years by the wars that were fought to bring the unions about and more wars will have to be fought to keep them up what a farce it is whats become of the nationality of the danes in schleswigholstein or the french in the rhine provinces or the italians in savoy  march had thought something like this himself but to have it put by general triscoe made it offensive i dont know isnt it rather quarrelling with the course of human events to oppose accomplished facts the unifications were bound to be just as the separations before them were and so far they have made for peace in europe at least and peace is civilization perhaps after a great many ages people will come together through their real interests the human interests but at present it seems as if nothing but a romantic sentiment of patriotism can unite them byandby they may find that there is nothing in it  perhaps said the general discontentedly i dont see much promise of any kind in the future  well i dont know when you think of the solid militarism of germany you seem remanded to the most hopeless moment of the roman empire you think nothing can break such a force but my guide says that even in leipsic the socialists outnumber all the other parties and the army is the great field of the socialist propaganda the army itself may be shaped into the means of democracyeven of peace  youre very optimistic said triscoe curtly as i read the signs we are not far from universal war in less than a year we shall make the break ourselves in a war with spain he looked very fierce as he prophesied and he dotted march over with his staccato glances  well ill allow that if tammany comes in this year we shall have war with spain you cant ask more than that general triscoe  mrs march and miss triscoe had not said a word of the battle of leipsic or of the impersonal interests which it suggested to the men for all these they might still have been sitting in their steamer chairs on the promenade of the norumbia at a period which seemed now of geological remoteness the girl accounted for not being in dresden by her fathers having decided not to go through berlin but to come by way of leipsic which he thought they had better see they had come without stopping in hamburg they had not enjoyed leipsic much it had rained the whole day before and they had not gone out she asked when mrs march was going on to carlsbad and mrs march answered the next morning her husband wished to begin his cure at once  then miss triscoe pensively wondered if carlsbad would do her father any good and mrs march discreetly inquired general triscoes symptoms  oh he hasnt any but i know he cant be wellwith his gloomy opinions  they may come from his liver said mrs march nearly everything of that kind does i know that mr march has been terribly depressed at times and the doctor said it was nothing but his liver and carlsbad is the great place for that you know  perhaps i can get papa to run over some day if he doesnt like dresden it isnt very far is it  they referred to mrs marchs baedeker together and found that it was five hours  yes that is what i thought said miss triscoe with a carelessness which convinced mrs march she had looked up the fact already  if you decide to come you must let us get rooms for you at our hotel were going to pupps most of the english and americans go to the hotels on the hill but pupps is in the thick of it in the lower town and its very gay mr kenby says hes been there often mr burnamy is to get our rooms  i dont suppose i can get papa to go said miss triscoe so insincerely that mrs march was sure she had talked over the different routes to carlsbad with burnamyprobably on the way from cuxhaven she looked up from digging the point of her umbrella in the ground you didnt meet him here this morning  mrs march governed herself to a calm which she respected in asking has mr burnamy been here  he came on with mr and mrs eltwin when we did and they all decided to stop over a day they left on the twelveoclock train today  mrs march perceived that the girl had decided not to let the facts betray themselves by chance and she treated them as of no significance  no we didnt see him she said carelessly  the two men came walking slowly towards them and miss triscoe said were going to dresden this evening but i hope we shall meet somewhere mrs march  oh people never lose sight of each other in europe they cant its so little  agatha said the girls father mr march tells me that the museum over there is worth seeing  well the girl assented and she took a winning leave of the marches and moved gracefully away with her father  i should have thought it was agnes said mrs march following them with her eyes before she turned upon her husband did he tell you burnamy had been here well he has he has just gone on to carlsbad he made those poor old eltwins stop over with him so he could be with her  did she say that  no but of course he did  then its all settled  no it isnt settled its at the most interesting point  well dont read ahead you always want to look at the last page  you were trying to look at the last page yourself she retorted and she would have liked to punish him for his complex dishonesty toward the affair but upon the whole she kept her temper with him and she made him agree that miss triscoes getting her father to carlsbad was only a question of time  they parted heartsfriends with their ineffectual guide who was affectionately grateful for the few marks they gave him at the hotel door and they were in just the mood to hear men singing in a farther room when they went down to supper the waiter much distracted from their own service by his duties to it told them it was the breakfast party of students which they had heard beginning there about noon the revellers had now been some six hours at table and he said they might not rise before midnight they had just got to the toasts which were apparently set to music  the students of right remained a vivid color in the impression of the university town they pervaded the place and decorated it with their fantastic personal taste in coats and trousers as well as their corps caps of green white red and blue but above all blue they were not easily distinguishable from the bicyclers who were holding one of the dull festivals of their kind in leipsic that day and perhaps they were sometimes both students and bicyclers as bicyclers they kept about in the rain which they seemed not to mind so far from being disheartened they had spirits enough to take one another by the waist at times and waltz in the square before the hotel at one moment of the holiday some chiefs among them drove away in carriages at supper a winner of prizes sat covered with badges and medals another who went by the hotel streamed with ribbons and an elderly man at his side was bespattered with small knots and ends of them as if he had been in an explosion of ribbons somewhere it seemed all to be as exciting for them and it was as tedious for the witnesses as any gala of students and bicyclers at home  mrs march remained with an unrequited curiosity concerning their different colors and different caps and she tried to make her husband find out what they severally meant he pretended a superior interest in the nature of a people who had such a passion for uniforms that they were not content with its gratification in their immense army but indulged it in every pleasure and employment of civil life he estimated perhaps not very accurately that only one man out of ten in germany wore citizens dress and of all functionaries he found that the dogs of the womenanddog teams alone had no distinctive dress even the women had their peasant costume  there was an industrial fair open at leipsic which they went out of the city to see after supper along with a throng of leipsickers whom an hours interval of fine weather tempted forth on the trolley and with the help of a little corporal who took a fee for his service with the eagerness of a civilian they got wheeled chairs and renewed their associations with the great chicago fair in seeing the exposition from them this was not march said quite the same as being drawn by a womananddog team which would have been the right means of doing a german fair but it was something to have his chair pushed by a slender young girl whose stalwart brother applied his strength to the chair of the lighter traveller and it was fit that the girl should reckon the common hire while the man took the common tip they made haste to leave the useful aspects of the fair and had themselves trundled away to the colonial exhibit where they vaguely expected something like the agreeable corruptions of the midway plaisance the idea of her colonial progress with which germany is trying to affect the homekeeping imagination of her people was illustrated by an encampment of savages from her centralafrican possessions they were getting their supper at the moment the marches saw them and were crouching half naked around the fires under the kettles and shivering from the cold but they were not very characteristic of the imperial expansion unless perhaps when an old man in a red blanket suddenly sprang up with a knife in his hand and began to chase a boy round the camp the boy was lighterfooted and easily outran the sage who tripped at times on his blanket none of the other central africans seemed to care for the race and without waiting for the event the american spectators ordered themselves trundled away to another idle feature of the fair where they hoped to amuse themselves with the image of old leipsic  this was so faithfully studied from the past in its narrow streets and gothic houses that it was almost as picturesque as the present epoch in the old streets of hamburg a drama had just begun to be represented on a platform of the public square in front of a fourteenthcentury beerhouse with people talking from the windows round and revellers in the costume of the period drinking beer and eating sausages at tables in the open air their eating and drinking were genuine and in the midst of it a real rain began to pour down upon them without affecting them any more than if they had been germans of the nineteenth century but it drove the americans to a shelter from which they could not see the play and when it held up they made their way back to their hotel  their car was full of returning pleasurers some of whom were happy beyond the sober wont of the fatherland the conductor took a special interest in his tipsy passengers trying to keep them in order and genially entreating them to be quiet when they were too obstreperous from time to time he got some of them off and then when he remounted the car he appealed to the remaining passengers for their sympathy with an innocent smile which the americans still strange to the unjoyous physiognomy of the german empire failed to value at its rare worth  before he slept that night march tried to assemble from the experiences and impressions of the day some facts which he would not be ashamed of as a serious observer of life in leipsic and he remembered that their guide had said houserent was very low he generalized from the guides content with his fee that the germans were not very rapacious and he became quite irrelevantly aware that in germany no mans clothes fitted him or seemed expected to fit him that the women dressed somewhat better and were rather pretty sometimes and that they had feet as large as the kind hearts of the germans of every age and sex he was able to note rather more freshly that with all their kindness the germans were a very nervous people if not irritable and at the least cause gave way to an agitation which indeed quickly passed but was violent while it lasted several times that day he had seen encounters between the portier and guests at the hotel which promised violence but which ended peacefully as soon as some simple question of traintime was solved the encounters always left the portier purple and perspiring as any agitation must with a man so tight in his livery he bemoaned himself after one of them as the victim of an unhappy calling in which he could take no exercise it is a life of excitements but not of movements he explained to march and when he learned where he was going he regretted that he could not go to carlsbad too for sugar he asked as if there were overmuch of it in his own make  march felt the tribute but he had to say no liver  ah said the portier with the air of failing to get on common ground with him     xxv  the next morning was so fine that it would have been a fine morning in america its beauty was scarcely sullied even subjectively by the telegram which the portier sent after the marches from the hotel saying that their missing trunk had not yet been found and their spirits were as light as the gay little clouds which blew about in the sky when their train drew out in the sunshine brilliant on the charming landscape all the way to carlsbad a fatherly traeger had done his best to get them the worst places in a nonsmoking compartment but had succeeded so poorly that they were very comfortable with no companions but a mother and daughter who spoke german in soft low tones together their compartment was pervaded by tobacco fumes from the smokers but as these were twice as many as the nonsmokers it was only fair and after march had got a window open it did not matter really  he asked leave of the strangers in his german and they consented in theirs but he could not master the secret of the windowcatch and the elder lady said in english let me show you and came to his help  the occasion for explaining that they were americans and accustomed to different car windows was so tempting that mrs march could not forbear and the other ladies were affected as deeply as she could wish perhaps they were the more affected because it presently appeared that they had cousins in new york whom she knew of and that they were acquainted with an american family that had passed the winter in berlin life likes to do these things handsomely and it easily turned out that this was a family of intimate friendship with the marches the names familiarly spoken abolished all strangeness between the travellers and they entered into a comparison of tastes opinions and experiences from which it seemed that the objects and interests of cultivated people in berlin were quite the same as those of cultivated people in new york each of the parties to the discovery disclaimed any superiority for their respective civilizations they wished rather to ascribe a greater charm and virtue to the alien conditions and they acquired such merit with one another that when the german ladies got out of the train at franzensbad the mother offered mrs march an ingenious folding footstool which she had admired in fact she left her with it clasped to her breast and bowing speechless toward the giver in a vain wish to express her gratitude  that was very pretty of her my dear said march you couldnt have done that  no she confessed i shouldnt have had the courage the courage of my emotions she added thoughtfully  ah thats the difference a berliner could do it and a bostonian couldnt do you think it so much better to have the courage of your convictions  i dont know it seems to me that im less and less certain of everything that i used to be sure of  he laughed and then he said i was thinking how on our wedding journey long ago that gray sister at the hotel dieu in quebec offered you a rose  well  that was to your pretty youth now the gracious stranger gives you a folding stool  to rest my poor old feet well i would rather have it than a rose now  you bent toward her at just the slant you had when you took the flower that time i noticed it i didnt see that you looked so very different to be sure the roses in your cheeks have turned into rosettes but rosettes are very nice and theyre much more permanent i prefer them they will keep in any climate  she suffered his mockery with an appreciative sigh yes our age caricatures our youth doesnt it  i dont think it gets much fun out of it he assented  no but it cant help it i used to rebel against it when it first began i did enjoy being young  you did my dear he said taking her hand tenderly she withdrew it because though she could bear his sympathy her new england nature could not bear its expression and so did i and we were both young a long time travelling brings the past back dont you think there at that restaurant where we stopped for dinner  yes it was charming just as it used to be with that white cloth and those tall shining bottles of wine and the fruit in the centre and the dinner in courses and that young waiter who spoke english and was so nice im never going home you may if you like  you bragged to those ladies about our diningcars and you said that our railroad restaurants were quite as good as the european  i had to do that but i knew better they dont begin to be  perhaps not but ive been thinking that travel is a good deal alike everywhere its the expression of the common civilization of the world when i came out of that restaurant and ran the train down and then found that it didnt start for fifteen minutes i wasnt sure whether i was at home or abroad and when we changed cars at eger and got into this train which had been baking in the sun for us outside the station i didnt know but i was back in the good old fitchburg depot to be sure wallenstein wasnt assassinated at boston but i forgot his murder at eger and so that came to the same thing its these confounded fiftyodd years i used to recollect everything  he had got up and was looking out of the window at the landscape which had not grown less amiable in growing rather more slovenly since they had crossed the saxon bolder into bohemia all the morning and early afternoon they had run through lovely levels of harvest where men were cradling the wheat and women were binding it into sheaves in the narrow fields between black spaces of forest after they left eger there was something more picturesque and less thrifty in the farming among the low hills which they gradually mounted to uplands where they tasted a mountain quality in the thin pure air the railroad stations were shabbier there was an indefinable touch of something southern in the scenery and the people lilies were rocking on the sluggish reaches of the streams and where the current quickened tall wheels were lifting water for the fields in circles of brimming and spilling pockets along the embankments where a new track was being laid barefooted women were at work with pick and spade and barrow and little yellowhaired girls were lugging large whiteheaded babies and watching the train go by at an up grade where it slowed in the ascent he began to throw out to the children the pfennigs which had been left over from the passage in germany and he pleased himself with his bounty till the question whether the children could spend the money forced itself upon him he sat down feeling less like a good genius than a cruel magician who had tricked them with false wealth but he kept his remorse to himself and tried to interest his wife in the difference of social and civic ideal expressed in the change of the inhibitory notices at the car windows which in germany had strongliest forbidden him to outlean himself and now in austria entreated him not to outbow himself she refused to share in the speculation or to debate the yet nicer problem involved by the placarded prayer in the washroom to the messrs travellers not to take away the soap and suddenly he felt himself as tired as she looked with that sense of the futility of travel which lies in wait for every one who profits by travel   pg editors bookmarks      bad wars or what are comically called good wars     calm of those who have logic on their side     decided not to let the facts betray themselves by chance     explained perhaps too fully     futility of travel     humanity may at last prevail over nationality     impertinent prophecies of their enjoying it so much     less certain of everything that i used to be sure of     life of the ship like the life of the sea a sodden monotony     life was like the life at a seaside hotel but more monotonous     madness of sightseeing which spoils travel     night so bad that it was worse than no night at all     our age caricatures our youth     prices fixed by his remorse     recipes for dishes and diseases     reckless and culpable optimism     repeated the nothings they had said already     she cares for him that she was so cold shows that     she could bear his sympathy but not its expression     suffering under the dripdrip of his innocent egotism     they were so near in age though they were ten years apart     unfounded hope that sooner or later the weather would be fine     wilful sufferers     woman harnessed with a dog to a cart     wooded with the precise severely disciplined german forests     work he was so fond of and so weary of     part ii     xxvi  they found burnamy expecting them at the station in carlsbad and she scolded him like a mother for taking the trouble to meet them while she kept back for the present any sign of knowing that he had staid over a day with the triscoes in leipsic he was as affectionately glad to see her and her husband as she could have wished but she would have liked it better if he had owned up at once about leipsic he did not and it seemed to her that he was holding her at armslength in his answers about his employer he would not say how he liked his work or how he liked mr stoller he merely said that they were at pupps together and that he had got in a good days work already and since he would say no more she contented herself with that  the long drive from the station to the hotel was by streets that wound down the hillside like those of an italian mountain town between gay stuccoed houses of southern rather than of northern architecture and the impression of a latin country was heightened at a turn of the road which brought into view a colossal crucifix planted against a curtain of dark green foliage on the brow of one of the wooded heights that surrounded carlsbad when they reached the level of the tepl the hillfed torrent that brawls through the little city under pretty bridges within walls of solid masonry they found themselves in almost the only vehicle on a brilliant promenade thronged with a cosmopolitan world germans in every manner of misfit polish jews in long black gabardines with tight corkscrew curls on their temples under their black velvet derbys austrian officers in tight corsets greek priests in flowing robes and brimless high hats russians in caftans and cossacks in astrakhan caps accented the more homogeneous masses of western europeans in which it would have been hard to say which were english french or italians among the vividly dressed ladies some were imaginably parisian from their chic costumes but they might easily have been hungarians or levantines of taste some americans who might have passed unknown in the perfection of their dress gave their nationality away in the flat wooden tones of their voices which made themselves heard above the low hum of talk and the whisper of the innumerable feet  the omnibus worked its way at a slow walk among the promenaders going and coming between the rows of pollard locusts on one side and the bright walls of the houses on the other under the trees were tables served by pretty bareheaded girls who ran to and from the restaurants across the way on both sides flashed and glittered the little shops full of silver glass jewelry terracotta figurines woodcarvings and all the idle frippery of wateringplace traffic they suggested paris and they suggested saratoga and then they were of carlsbad and of no place else in the world as the crowd which might have been that of other cities at certain moments could only have been of carlsbad in its habitual effect  do you like it asked burnamy as if he owned the place and mrs march saw how simplehearted he was in his reticence after all she was ready to bless him when they reached the hotel and found that his interest had got them the only rooms left in the house this satisfied in her the passion for size which is at the bottom of every american heart and which perhaps above all else marks us the youngest of the peoples we pride ourselves on the bigness of our own things but we are not ungenerous and when we go to europe and find things bigger than ours we are magnanimously happy in them pupps in its altogether different way was larger than any hotel at saratoga or at niagara and when burnamy told her that it sometimes fed fifteen thousand people a day in the height of the season she was personally proud of it  she waited with him in the rotunda of the hotel while the secretary led march off to look at the rooms reserved for them and burnamy hospitably turned the revolving octagonal case in the centre of the rotunda where the names of the guests were put up they were of all nations but there were so many new yorkers whose names ended in berg and thal and stern and baum that she seemed to be gazing upon a cyclorama of the signs on broadway a large man of unmistakable american make but with so little that was of new england or new york in his presence that she might not at once have thought him american lounged toward them with a quill toothpick in the corner of his mouth he had a jealous blue eye into which he seemed trying to put a friendly light his straight mouth stretched into an involuntary smile above his tawny chinbeard and he wore his soft hat so far back from his high forehead it showed to the crown when he took his hat off that he had the effect of being uncovered  at his approach burnamy turned and with a flush said oh let me introduce mr stoller mrs march  stoller took his toothpick out of his mouth and bowed then he seemed to remember and took off his hat you see jews enough here to make you feel at home he asked and he added well we got some of em in chicago too i guess this young manhe twisted his head toward burnamyfound you easy enough  it was very good of him to meet us mrs march began we didnt expect  oh thats all right said stoller putting his toothpick back and his hat on wed got through for the day my doctor wont let me work all i want to here your husbands going to take the cure they tell me well he wants to go to a good doctor first you cant go and drink these waters hit or miss i found that out before i came  oh no said mrs march and she wished to explain how they had been advised but he said to burnamy  i shant want you again till ten tomorrow morning dont let me interrupt you he added patronizingly to mrs march he put his hand up toward his hat and sauntered away out of the door  burnamy did not speak and she only asked at last to relieve the silence is mr stoller an american  why i suppose so he answered with an uneasy laugh his people were german emigrants who settled in southern indiana that makes him as much american as any of us doesnt it  burnamy spoke with his mind on his frenchcanadian grandfather who had come down through detroit when their name was bonami but mrs march answered from her eight generations of new england ancestry oh for the west yes perhaps and they neither of them said anything more about stoller  in their room where she found march waiting for her amidst their arriving baggage she was so full of her pentup opinions of burnamys patron that she would scarcely speak of the view from their windows of the wooded hills up and down the tepl yes yes very nice and i know i shall enjoy it ever so much but i dont know what you will think of that poor young burnamy  why whats happened to him  happened stollers happened  oh have you seen him already well  well if you had been going to pick out that type of man youd have rejected him because youd have said he was too pat hes like an actor made up for a western millionaire do you remember that american in letranger which bernhardt did in boston when she first came he looks exactly like that and he has the worst manners he stood talking to me with his hat on and a toothpick in his mouth and he made me feel as if he had bought me along with burnamy and had paid too much if you dont give him a setting down basil i shall never speak to you thats all im sure burnamy is in some trouble with him hes got some sort of hold upon him what it could be in such a short time i cant imagine but if ever a man seemed to be in a mans power he does in his  now said march your pronouns have got so far beyond me that i think wed better let it all go till after supper perhaps i shall see stoller myself by that time  she had been deeply stirred by her encounter with stoller but she entered with impartial intensity into the fact that the elevator at pupps had the characteristic of always coming up and never going down with passengers it was locked into its closet with a solid door and there was no bell to summon it or any place to take it except on the groundfloor but the stairs by which she could descend were abundant and stately and on one landing there was the lithograph of one of the largest and ugliest hotels in new york how ugly it was she said she should never have known if she had not seen it there  the diningroom was divided into the grand saloon where they supped amid rococo sculptures and frescoes and the glazed veranda opening by vast windows on a spread of tables without which were already filling up for the evening concert around them at the different tables there were groups of faces and figures fascinating in their strangeness with that distinction which abashes our american level in the presence of european inequality  how simple and unimpressive we are basil she said beside all these people i used to feel it in europe when i was young and now im certain that we must seem like two fadedin old village photographs we dont even look intellectual i hope we look good  i know i do said march the waiter went for their supper and they joined in guessing the different nationalities in the room a french party was easy enough a spanish mother and daughter were not difficult though whether they were not southamerican remained uncertain two elderly maiden ladies were unmistakably of central massachusetts and were obviously of a bookclub culture that had left no leaf unturned some triestines gave themselves away by their venetian accent but a large group at a farther table were unassignable in the strange language which they clattered loudly together with bursts of laughter they were a family party of old and young they were having a good time with a freedom which she called baronial the ladies wore white satin or black lace but the men were in sackcoats she chose to attribute them for no reason but their outlandishness to transylvania march pretended to prefer a table full of germans who were unmistakably bourgeois and yet of intellectual effect he chose as his favorite a middleaged man of learned aspect and they both decided to think of him as the herr professor but they did not imagine how perfectly the title fitted him till he drew a long comb from his waistcoat pocket and combed his hair and beard with it above the table  the wine wrought with the transylvanians and they all jargoned together at once and laughed at the jokes passing among them one old gentleman had a peculiar fascination from the infantile innocence of his gums when he threw his head back to laugh and showed an upper jaw toothless except for two incisors standing guard over the chasm between suddenly he choked coughed to relieve himself hawked held his napkin up before him and  noblesse oblige said march with the tone of irony which he reserved for his wifes preoccupations with aristocracies of all sorts i think i prefer my hair professor bourgeois as he is  the ladies attributively of central massachusetts had risen from their table and were making for the door without having paid for their supper the head waiter ran after them with a real delicacy for their mistake he explained that though in most places the meals were charged in the bill it was the custom in carlsbad to pay for them at the table one could see that he was making their error a pleasant adventure to them which they could laugh over together and write home about without a pang  and i said mrs march shamelessly abandoning the party of the aristocracy prefer the manners of the lower classes  oh yes he admitted the only manners we have at home are black ones but you mustnt lose courage perhaps the nobility are not always so baronial  i dont know whether we have manners at home she said and i dont believe i care at least we have decencies  dont be a jingo said her husband     xxvii  though stoller had formally discharged burnamy from duty for the day he was not so full of resources in himself and he had not so general an acquaintance in the hotel but he was glad to have the young fellow make up to him in the readingroom that night he laid down a new york paper ten days old in despair of having left any american news in it and pushed several continental angloamerican papers aside with his elbow as he gave a contemptuous glance at the foreign journals in bohemian hungarian german french and italian which littered the large table  i wonder he said how long itll takeem over here to catch on to our way of having pictures  burnamy had come to his newspaper work since illustrated journalism was established and he had never had any shock from it at home but so sensitive is youth to environment that after four days in europe the new york paper stoller had laid down was already hideous to him from the politic side of his nature however he temporized with stollers preference i suppose it will be some time yet  i wish said stoller with a savage disregard of expressed sequences and relevancies i could ha got some pictures to send home with that letter this afternoon something to show how they do things here and be a kind of objectlesson this term had come up in a recent campaign when some employers by shutting down their works were showing their employees what would happen if the employees voted their political opinions into effect and stoller had then mastered its meaning and was fond of using it id like em to see the woods around here that the city owns and the springs and the donkeycarts and the theatre and everything and give em some practical ideas  burnamy made an uneasy movement  id a liked to put em alongside of some of our improvements and show how a town can be carried on when its managed on business principles  why didnt you think of it  really i dont know said burnamy with a touch of impatience  they had not met the evening before on the best of terms stoller had expected burnamy twentyfour hours earlier and had shown his displeasure with him for loitering a day at leipsic which he might have spent at carlsbad and burnamy had been unsatisfactory in accounting for the delay but he had taken hold so promptly and so intelligently that by working far into the night and through the whole forenoon he had got stollers crude mass of notes into shape and had sent off in time for the first steamer the letter which was to appear over the proprietors name in his paper it was a sort of rough but very full study of the carlsbad city government the methods of taxation the municipal ownership of the springs and the lands and the public control in everything it condemned the aristocratic constitution of the municipality but it charged heavily in favor of the purity beneficence and wisdom of the administration under which there was no poverty and no idleness and which was managed like any large business  stoller had sulkily recurred to his displeasure once or twice and burnamy suffered it submissively until now but now at the change in burnamys tone he changed his manner a little  seen your friends since supper he asked  only a moment they are rather tired and theyve gone to bed  that the fellow that edits that book you write for  yes he owns it too  the notion of any sort of ownership moved stollers respect and he asked more deferentially makin a good thing out of it  a living i suppose some of the highclass weeklies feel the competition of the tencent monthlies but every other week is about the best thing weve got in the literary way and i guess its holding its own  have to to let the editor come to carlsbad stoller said with a return to the sourness of his earlier mood i dont know as i care much for his looks i seen him when he came in with you no snap to him he clicked shut the penknife he had been paring his nails with and started up with the abruptness which marked all his motions mental and physical as he walked heavily out of the room he said without looking at burnamy you want to be ready by half past ten at the latest  stollers father and mother were poor emigrants who made their way to the west with the instinct for sordid prosperity native to their race and class and they set up a small butcher shop in the little indiana town where their son was born and throve in it from the start he could remember his mother helping his father make the sausage and headcheese and pickle the pigs feet which they took turns in selling at as great a price as they could extort from the townspeople she was a good and tender mother and when her little yawcup as the boys called jacob in mimicry after her had grown to the schoolgoing age she taught him to fight the americans who stoned him when he came out of his gate and mobbed his homecoming and mocked and tormented him at playtime till they wore themselves into a kindlier mind toward him through the exhaustion of their invention no one so far as the gloomy stocky rather dense little boy could make out ever interfered in his behalf and he grew up in bitter shame for his german origin which entailed upon him the hard fate of being dutch among the americans he hated his native speech so much that he cried when he was forced to use it with his father and mother at home he furiously denied it with the boys who proposed to parley with him in it on such terms as nix come arouce in de dytchmans house he disused it so thoroughly that after his father took him out of school when he was old enough to help in the shop he could not get back to it he regarded his fathers business as part of his national disgrace and at the cost of leaving his home he broke away from it and informally apprenticed himself to the village blacksmith and wagonmaker when it came to his setting up for himself in the business he had chosen he had no help from his father who had gone on adding dollar to dollar till he was one of the richest men in the place  jacob prospered too his old playmates who had used him so cruelly had many of them come to like him but as a dutchman they never dreamt of asking him to their houses when they were young people any more than when they were children he was long deeply in love with an american girl whom he had never spoken to and the dream of his life was to marry an american he ended by marrying the daughter of pferd the brewer who had been at an american school in indianapolis and had come home as fragilely and nasally american as anybody she made him a good sickly fretful wife and bore him five children of whom two survived with no visible taint of their german origin  in the mean time jacobs father had died and left his money to his son with the understanding that he was to provide for his mother who would gladly have given every cent to him and been no burden to him if she could he took her home and cared tenderly for her as long as she lived and she meekly did her best to abolish herself in a household trying so hard to be american she could not help her native accent but she kept silence when her sons wife had company and when her eldest granddaughter began very early to have american callers she went out of the room they would not have noticed her if she had staid  before this jacob had come forward publicly in proportion to his financial importance in the community he first commended himself to the better element by crushing out a strike in his buggy works which were now the largest business interest of the place and he rose on a wave of municipal reform to such a height of favor with the respectable classes that he was elected on a citizens ticket to the legislature in the reaction which followed he was barely defeated for congress and was talked of as a dark horse who might be put up for the governorship some day but those who knew him best predicted that he would not get far in politics where his bullheaded business ways would bring him to ruin sooner or later they said you cant swing a bolt like you can a strike  when his mother died he surprised his old neighbors by going to live in chicago though he kept his works in the place where he and they had grown up together his wife died shortly after and within four years he lost his three eldest children his son it was said had begun to go wrong first but the rumor of his increasing wealth drifted back from chicago he was heard of in different enterprises and speculations at last it was said that he had bought a newspaper and then his boyhood friends decided that jake was going into politics again  in the wider horizons and opener atmosphere of the great city he came to understand better that to be an american in all respects was not the best his mounting sense of importance began to be retroactive in the direction of his ancestral home he wrote back to the little town near wurzburg which his people had come from and found that he had relatives still living there some of whom had become people of substance and about the time his health gave way from lifelong gluttony and he was ordered to carlsbad he had pretty much made up his mind to take his younger daughters and put them in school for a year or two in wurzburg for a little discipline if not education he had now left them there to learn the language which he had forgotten with such heartburning and shame and music for which they had some taste  the twins loudly lamented their fate and they parted from their father with open threats of running away and in his heart he did not altogether blame them he came away from wurzburg raging at the disrespect for his money and his standing in business which had brought him a more galling humiliation there than anything he had suffered in his boyhood at des vaches it intensified him in his dearbought americanism to the point of wishing to commit lese majesty in the teeth of some local dignitaries who had snubbed him and who seemed to enjoy putting our eagle to shame in his person there was something like the bird of his stepcountry in stollers pale eyes and huge beak     xxviii  march sat with a company of other patients in the anteroom of the doctor and when it came his turn to be prodded and kneaded he was ashamed at being told he was not so bad a case as he had dreaded the doctor wrote out a careful dietary for him with a prescription of a certain number of glasses of water at a certain spring and a certain number of baths and a rule for the walks he was to take before and after eating then the doctor patted him on the shoulder and pushed him caressingly out of his inner office it was too late to begin his treatment that day but he went with his wife to buy a cup with a strap for hanging it over his shoulder and he put it on so as to be an invalid with the others at once he came near forgetting the small napkin of turkish towelling which they stuffed into their cups but happily the shopman called him back in time to sell it to him  at five the next morning he rose and on his way to the street exchanged with the servants cleaning the hotel stairs the first of the gloomy guten morgens which usher in the day at carlsbad they cannot be so finally hopeless as they sound they are probably expressive only of the popular despair of getting through with them before night but march heard the salutations sorrowfully groaned out on every hand as he joined the straggling current of invalids which swelled on the way past the silent shops and cafes in the alte wiese till it filled the street and poured its thousands upon the promenade before the classic colonnade of the muhlbrunn on the other bank of the tepl the sprudel flings its steaming waters by irregular impulses into the air under a pavilion of iron and glass but the muhlbrunn is the source of most resort there is an instrumental concert somewhere in carlsbad from early rising till bedtime and now at the muhlbrunn there was an orchestra already playing and under the pillared porch as well as before it the multitude shuffled up and down draining their cups by slow sips and then taking each his place in the interminable line moving on to replenish them at the spring  a picturesque majority of polish jews whom some vice of their climate is said peculiarly to fit for the healing effects of carlsbad most took his eye in their long gabardines of rusty black and their derby hats of plush or velvet with their corkscrew curls coming down before their ears they were old and young they were grizzled and red and black but they seemed all welltodo and what impresses one first and last at carlsbad is that its waters are mainly for the healing of the rich after the polish jews the greek priests of russian race were the most striking figures there were types of latin ecclesiastics who were striking in their way too and the uniforms of certain austrian officers and soldiers brightened the picture here and there a southern face italian or spanish or levantine looked passionately out of the mass of dull german visages for at carlsbad the germans more than any other gentile nation are to the fore their misfits their absence of style imparted the prevalent effect though now and then among the women a hungarian or pole or parisian or american relieved the eye which seeks beauty and grace rather than the domestic virtues there were certain faces types of discomfort and disease which appealed from the beginning to the end a young austrian yellow as gold and a livid southamerican were of a lasting fascination to march  what most troubled him in his scrutiny of the crowd was the difficulty of assigning people to their respective nations and he accused his years of having dulled his perceptions but perhaps it was from their long disuse in his homogeneous american world the americans themselves fused with the european races who were often so hard to make out his fellowcitizens would not be identified till their bad voices gave them away he thought the womens voices the worst  at the springs a line of young girls with a steady mechanical action dipped the cups into the steaming source and passed them impersonally up to their owners with the patients at the muhlbrunn it was often a halfhour before ones turn came and at all a strict etiquette forbade any attempt to anticipate it the water was merely warm and flat and after the first repulsion one could forget it march formed a childish habit of counting ten between the sips and of finishing the cup with a gulp which ended it quickly he varied his walks between cups by going sometimes to a bridge at the end of the colonnade where a group of triestines were talking venetian and sometimes to the little park beyond the kurhaus where some old women were sweeping up from the close sward the yellow leaves which the trees had untidily dropped overnight he liked to sit there and look at the city beyond the tepl where it climbed the wooded heights in terraces till it lost its houses in the skirts and folds of the forest most mornings it rained quietly absentmindedly and this with the chili in the air deepened a pleasant illusion of quebec offered by the upper town across the stream but there were sunny mornings when the mountains shone softly through a lustrous mist and the air was almost warm  once in his walk he found himself the companion of burnamys employer whom he had sometimes noted in the line at the muhlbrunn waiting his turn cup in hand with a face of sullen impatience stoller explained that though you could have the water brought to you at your hotel he chose to go to the spring for the sake of the air it was something you had got to live through before he had that young burnamy to help him he did not know what to do with his time but now every minute he was not eating or sleeping he was working his cure did not oblige him to walk much he examined march with a certain mixture of respect and contempt upon the nature of the literary life and how it differed from the life of a journalist he asked if he thought burnamy would amount to anything as a literary man he so far assented to marchs faith in him as to say hes smart he told of leaving his daughters in school at wurzburg and upon the whole he moved march with a sense of his pathetic loneliness without moving his liking as he passed lumberingly on dangling his cup  march gave his own cup to the little maid at his spring and while she gave it to a second who dipped it and handed it to a third for its return to him he heard an unmistakable fellowcountryman saying good morning to them all in english are you going to teach them united states he asked of a face with which he knew such an appeal would not fail  well the man admitted i try to teach them that much they like it you are an american i am glad of it i have most lost the use of my lungs here im a great talker and i talk to my wife till shes about dead then im out of it for the rest of the day i cant speak german  his manner was the free friendly manner of the west he must be that sort of untravelled american whom march had so seldom met but he was afraid to ask him if this was his first time at carlsbad lest it should prove the third or fourth are you taking the cure he asked instead  oh no my wife is shell be along directly i come down here and drink the waters to encourage her doctor said to that gets me in for the diet too ive et more cooked fruit since i been here than i ever did in my life before prunes my lord im full o prunes well it does me good to see an american to know him i couldnt a told you it you hadnt have spoken  well said march i shouldnt have been so sure of you either by your looks  yes we cant always tell ourselves from these dutch but they know us and they dont want us except just for one thing and thats our money i tell you the americans are the chumps over here soons they got all our money or think they have they say here you americans this is my country you get off and we got to get ever been over before  a great while ago so long that i can hardly believe it  its my first time my names otterson im from out in iowa  march gave him his name and added that he was from new york  yes i thought you was eastern but that wasnt an eastern man you was just with  no hes from chicago hes a mr stoller  not the buggy man  i believe he makes buggies  well you do meet everybody here the iowan was silent for a moment as if hushed by the weighty thought i wish my wife could have seen him i just want her to see the man that made our buggy i dont know whats keeping her this morning he added apologetically look at that fellow will you tryin to get away from those women a young officer was doing his best to take leave of two ladies who seemed to be mother and daughter they detained him by their united arts and clung to him with caressing words and looks he was red in the face with his polite struggles when he broke from them at last how they do hang on to a man over here the iowa man continued and the americans are as bad as any why theres one ratty little englishman up at our place and our girls just swarm after him their mothers are worse well its so jenny he said to the lady who had joined them and whom march turned round to see when he spoke to her if i wanted a foreigner i should go in for a man and these officers put their mustaches up at night in curlpapers they tell me introduce you to mrs otterson mr march well had your first glass yet jenny im just going for my second tumbler  he took his wife back to the spring and began to tell her about stoller she made no sign of caring for him and march felt inculpated she relented a little toward him as they drank together when he said he must be going to breakfast with his wife she asked where he breakfasted and said why we go to the posthof too he answered that then they should be sure some time to meet there he did not venture further he reflected that mrs march had her reluctances too she distrusted people who had amused or interested him before she met them     xxix  burnamy had found the posthof for them as he had found most of the other agreeable things in carlsbad which he brought to their knowledge one by one with such forethought that march said he hoped he should be cared for in his declining years as an editor rather than as a father there was no tenderness like a young contributors  many people from the hotels on the hill found at pupps just the time and space between their last cup of water and their first cup of coffee which are prescribed at carlsbad but the marches were aware somehow from the beginning that pupps had not the hold upon the world at breakfast which it had at the midday dinner or at supper on the evenings when the concert was there still it was amusing and they were patient of burnamys delay till he could get a morning off from stoller and go with them to the posthof he met mrs march in the readingroom where march was to join them on his way from the springs with his bag of bread the earlier usage of buying the delicate pink slices of westphalia ham which form the chief motive of a carlsbad breakfast at a certain shop in the town and carrying them to the cafe with you is no longer of such binding force as the custom of getting your bread at the swiss bakery you choose it yourself at the counter which begins to be crowded by half past seven and when you have collected the prescribed loaves into the basket of metallic filigree given you by one of the bakers maids she puts it into a tissuepaper bag of a gay red color and you join the other invalids streaming away from the bakery their paper bags making a festive rustling as they go  two roads lead out of the town into the lovely meadowlands a good mile up the brawling tepl before they join on the right side of the torrent where the posthof lurks nestled under trees whose boughs let the sun and rain impartially through upon its army of little tables by this time the slow omnibus plying between carlsbad and some villages in the valley beyond has crossed from the left bank to the right and keeps on past half a dozen other cafes where patients whose prescriptions marshal them beyond the posthof drop off by the dozens and scores  the road on the left bank of the tepl is wild and overhung at points with wooded steeps when it leaves the town but on the right it is bordered with shops and restaurants a great part of its length in leafy nooks between these uphill walks begin their climb of the mountains from the foot of votive shrines set round with tablets commemorating in german french russian hebrew magyar and czech the cure of highwellborns of all those races and languages booths glittering with the lapidarys work in the cheaper gems or full of the ingenious figures of the toymakers alternate with the shrines and the cafes on the way to the posthof and with their shoulders against the overhanging cliff spread for the passing crowd a lure of viennese jewelry in garnets opals amethysts and the like and of such bohemian playthings as carroteating rabbits worstedworking cats dancingbears and peacocks that strut about the feet of the passers and expand their iridescent tails in mimic pride  burnamy got his charges with difficulty by the shrines in which they felt the farreflected charm of the crucifixes of the whitehot italian highways of their early travel and by the toyshops where they had a mechanical outdated impulse to get something for the children ending in a pang for the fact that they were children no longer he waited politely while mrs march made up her mind that she would not buy any laces of the motherly old women who showed them under pentroofs on wayside tables and he waited patiently at the gate of the flowergardens beyond the shops where march bought lavishly of sweetpease from the businesslike flowerwoman and feigned a grateful joy in her because she knew no english and gave him a chance of speaking his german  youll find he said as they crossed the road again that its well to trifle a good deal it makes the time pass i should still be lagging along in my thirties if it hadnt been for fooling and here i am well on in my fifties and mrs march is younger than ever  they were at the gate of the garden and grounds of the cafe at last and a turn of the path brought them to the prospect of its tables under the trees between the two long glazed galleries where the breakfasters take refuge at other tables when it rains it rains nearly always and the trunks of the trees are as green with damp as if painted but that morning the sun was shining at the verge of the open space a group of pretty servingmaids each with her name on a silver band pinned upon her breast met them and bade them a guten morgen of almost cheerful note but gave way to an eager little smiling blonde who came pushing down the path at sight of burnamy and claimed him for her own  ah lili we want an extra good table this morning these are some american excellencies and you must do your best for them  oh yes the girl answered in english after a radiant salutation of the marches i get you one  you are a little more formerly today and i didnt had one already  she ran among the tables along the edge of the western edge of the gallery and was far beyond hearing his protest that he was not earlier than usual when she beckoned him to the table she had found she had crowded it in between two belonging to other girls and by the time her breakfasters came up she was ready for their order with the pouting pretence that the girls always tried to rob her of the best places burnamy explained proudly when she went that none of the other girls ever got an advantage of her she had more custom than any three of them and she had hired a man to help her carry her orders the girls were all from the neighboring villages he said and they lived at home in the winter on their summer tips their wages were nothing or less for sometimes they paid for their places  what a mass of information said march how did you come by it  newspaper habit of interviewing the universe  its not a bad habit if one doesnt carry it too far how did lili learn her english  she takes lessons in the winter shes a perfect little electric motor i dont believe any yankee girl could equal her  she would expect to marry a millionaire if she did what astonishes one over here is to see how contentedly people prosper along on their own level and the women do twice the work of the men without expecting to equal them in any other way at pupps if we go to one end of the outdoor restaurant it takes three men to wait on us one to bring our coffee or tea another to bring our bread and meat and another to make out our bill and i have to tip all three of them if we go to the other end one girl serves us and i have to give only one fee i make it less than the least i give any three of the men waiters  you ought to be ashamed of that said his wife  im not im simply proud of your sex my dear  women do nearly everything here said burnamy impartially they built that big new kaiserbad building mixed the mortar carried the hods and laid the stone  that makes me prouder of the sex than ever but come mr burnamy isnt there anybody of polite interest that you know of in this crowd  well i cant say burnamy hesitated  the breakfasters had been thronging into the grove and the galleries the tables were already filled and men were bringing other tables on their heads and making places for them with entreaties for pardon everywhere the proprietor was anxiously directing them the pretty servinggirls were running to and from the kitchen in a building apart with shrill sweet promises of haste the morning sun fell broken through the leaves on the gay hats and dresses of the ladies and dappled the figures of the men with harlequin patches of light and shade a tall woman with a sort of sharpened beauty and an artificial permanency of tint in her cheeks and yellow hair came trailing herself up the sunshot path and found with hardy insistence upon the publicity places for the surlylooking downfaced young man behind her and for her maid and her black poodle the dog was like the black poodle out of faust burnamy had heard her history in fact he had already roughed out a poem on it which he called europa not after the old fable but because it seemed to him that she expressed europe on one side of its civilization and had an authorized place in its order as she would not have had in ours she was where she was by a toleration of certain social facts which corresponds in europe to our reverence for the vested interests in her history there had been officers and bankers even foreign dignitaries now there was this sullen young fellow burnamy had wondered if it would do to offer his poem to march but the presence of the original abashed him and in his mind he had torn the poem up with a heartache for its aptness  i dont believe he said that i recognizeany celebrities here  im sorry said march mrs march would have been glad of some hoheits some grafs and grafins or a few excellenzes or even some mere wellborns but we must try to get along with the picturesqueness  im satisfied with the picturesqueness said his wife dont worry about me mr burnamy  why cant we have this sort of thing at home  were getting something like it in the roofgardens said march we couldnt have it naturally because the climate is against it with us at this time in the morning over there the sun would be burning the life out of the air and the flies would be swarming on every table at nine a m the mosquitoes would be eating us up in such a grove as this so we have to use artifice and lift our posthof above the flyline and the mosquitoline into the night air i havent seen a fly since i came to europe i really miss them it makes me homesick  there are plenty in italy his wife suggested  we must get down there before we go home  but why did nobody ever tell us that there were no flies in germany why did no traveller ever put it in his book when your stewardess said so on the steamer i remember that you regarded it as a bluff he turned to burnamy who was listening with the deference of a contributor isnt lili rather long i mean for such a very prompt person oh no  but burnamy got to his feet and shouted fraulein to lili with her hireling at her heels she was flying down a distant aisle between the tables she called back with a face laughing over her shoulder in a minute and vanished in the crowd  does that mean anything in particular theres really no hurry  oh i think shell come now said burnamy march protested that he had only been amused at lilis delay but his wife scolded him for his impatience she begged burnamys pardon and repeated civilities passed between them she asked if he did not think some of the young ladies were pretty beyond the european average a very few had style the mothers were mostly fat and not stylish it was well not to regard the fathers too closely several old gentlemen were clearing their throats behind their newspapers with noises that made her quail there was no one so effective as the austrian officers who put themselves a good deal on show bowing from their hips to favored groups with the sun glinting from their eyeglasses and their hands pressing their swordhilts they moved between the tables with the gait of tightlaced women  they all wear corsets burnamy explained  how much you know already said mrs march i can see that europe wont be lost on you in anything oh whos that a lady whose costume expressed saris at every point glided up the middle aisle of the grove with a graceful tilt burnamy was silent she must be an american do you know who she is  yes he hesitated a little to name a woman whose tragedy had once filled the newspapers  mrs march gazed after her with the fascination which such tragedies inspire what grace is she beautiful  very burnamy had not obtruded his knowledge but somehow mrs march did not like his knowing who she was and how beautiful she asked march to look but he refused  those things are too squalid he said and she liked him for saying it she hoped it would not be lost upon burnamy  one of the waitresses tripped on the steps near them and flung the burden off her tray on the stone floor before her some of the dishes broke and the breakfast was lost tears came into the girls eyes and rolled down her hot cheeks there that is what i call tragedy said march shell have to pay for those things  oh give her the money dearest  how can i  the girl had just got away with the ruin when lili and her hireling behind her came bearing down upon them with their three substantial breakfasts on two wellladen trays she forestalled burnamys reproaches for her delay laughing and bridling while she set down the dishes of ham and tongue and egg and the little pots of coffee and frothed milk  i could not so soon i wanted because i was to serve an american princess  mrs march started with proud conjecture of one of those noble international marriages which fill our women with vainglory for such of their compatriots as make them  oh come now lili said burnamy we have queens in america but nothing so low as princesses this was a queen wasnt it  she referred the case to her hireling who confirmed her all people say it is princess she insisted  well if shes a princess we must look her up after breakfast said burnamy where is she sitting  she pointed at a corner so far off on the other side that no one could be distinguished and then was gone with a smile flashed over her shoulder and her hireling trying to keep up with her  were all very proud of lilis having a hired man said burnamy we think it reflects credit on her customers  march had begun his breakfast withthe voracious appetite of an earlyrising invalid what coffee  he drew a long sigh after the first draught  its said to be made of burnt figs said burnamy from the inexhaustible advantage of his few days priority in carlsbad  then lets have burnt figs introduced at home as soon as possible but why burnt figs that seems one of those doubts which are much more difficult than faith  its not only burnt figs said burnamy with amiable superiority if it is burnt figs but its made after a formula invented by a consensus of physicians and enforced by the municipality every cafe in carlsbad makes the same kind of coffee and charges the same price  you are leaving us very little to find out for ourselves sighed march  oh i know a lot more things are you fond of fishing  not very  you can get a permit to catch trout in the tepl but they send an official with you who keeps count and when you have had your sport the trout belong to the municipality just as they did before you caught them  i dont see why that isnt a good notion the last thing i should want to do would be to eat a fish that i had caught and that i was personally acquainted with well im never going away from carlsbad i dont wonder people get their doctors to tell them to come back  burnamy told them a number of facts he said stoller had got together about the place and had given him to put in shape it was run in the interest of people who had got out of order so that they would keep coming to get themselves in order again you could hardly buy an unwholesome meal in the town all the cooking was kurgemass he won such favor with his facts that he could not stop in time he said to march but if you ever should have a fancy for a fish of your personal acquaintance theres a restaurant up the tepl where they let you pick out your trout in the water then they catch him and broil him for you and you know what you are eating  is it a municipal restaurant  semimunicipal said burnamy laughing  well take mrs march said her husband and in her gravity burnamy felt the limitations of a womans sense of humor which always define themselves for men so unexpectedly  he did what he could to get back into her good graces by telling her what he knew about distinctions and dignities that he now saw among the breakfasters the crowd had now grown denser till the tables were set together in such labyrinths that any one who left the central aisle was lost in them the servinggirls ran more swiftly to and fro responding with a more nervous shrillness to the calls of fraulein fraulein that followed them the proprietor in his bare head stood like one paralyzed by his prosperity which sent up all round him the clash of knives and crockery and the confusion of tongues it was more than an hour before burnamy caught lilis eye and three times she promised to come and be paid before she came then she said it is so nice when you stay a little and when he told her of the poor fraulein who had broken the dishes in her fall near them she almost wept with tenderness she almost winked with wickedness when he asked if the american princess was still in her place  do go and see who it can be mrs march entreated well wait here and he obeyed i am not sure that i like him she said as soon as he was out of hearing i dont know but hes coarse after all do you approve of his knowing so many peoples taches already  would it be any better later he asked in tern he seemed to find you interested  its very different with us were not young she urged only half seriously  her husband laughed i see you want me to defend him oh hello he cried and she saw burnamy coming toward them with a young lady who was nodding to them from as far as she could see them this is the easy kind of thing that makes you blush for the author if you find it in a novel     xxx  mrs march fairly took miss triscoe in her arms to kiss her do you know i felt it must be you all the time when did you come where is your father what hotel are you staying at  it appeared while miss triscoe was shaking hands with march that it was last night and her father was finishing his breakfast and it was one of the hotels on the hill on the way back to her father it appeared that he wished to consult marchs doctor not that there was anything the matter  the general himself was not much softened by the reunion with his fellowamericans he confided to them that his coffee was poisonous but he seemed standing up with the parisnew york chronicle folded in his hand to have drunk it all was march going off on his forenoon tramp he believed that was part of the treatment which was probably all humbug though he thought of trying it now he was there he was told the walks were fine he looked at burnamy as if he had been praising them and burnamy said he had been wondering if march would not like to try a mountain path back to his hotel he said not so sincerely that he thought mrs march would like it  i shall like your account of it she answered but ill walk back on a level if you please  oh yes miss triscoe pleaded come with us  she played a little comedy of meaning to go back with her father so gracefully that mrs march herself could scarcely have told just where the girls real purpose of going with burnamy began to be evident or just how she managed to make general triscoe beg to have the pleasure of seeing mrs march back to her hotel  march went with the young people across the meadow behind the posthof and up into the forest which began at the base of the mountain at first they tried to keep him in the range of their talk but he fell behind more and more and as the talk narrowed to themselves it was less and less possible to include him in it when it began to concern their common appreciation of the marches they even tried to get out of his hearing  theyre so young in their thoughts said burnamy and they seem as much interested in everything as they could have been thirty years ago they belong to a time when the world was a good deal fresher than it is now dont you think i mean in the eighteensixties  oh yes i can see that  i dont know why we shouldnt be born older in each generation than people were in the last perhaps we are he suggested  i dont know how you mean said the girl keeping vigorously up with him she let him take the jacket she threw off but she would not have his hand at the little steeps where he wanted to give it  i dont believe i can quite make it out myself but fancy a man that began to act at twenty quite unconsciously of course from the past experience of the whole race  he would be rather a dreadful person wouldnt he  rather monstrous yes he owned with a laugh but thats where the psychological interest would come in  as if she did not feel the notion quite pleasant she turned from it i suppose youve been writing all sorts of things since you came here  well it hasnt been such a great while as its seemed and ive had mr stollers psychological interests to look after  oh yes do you like him  i dont know hes a lump of honest selfishness he isnt bad you know where to have him hes simple too  you mean like mr march  i didnt mean that but why not theyre not of the same generation but stoller isnt modern  im very curious to see him said the girl  do you want me to introduce him  you can introduce him to papa  they stopped and looked across the curve of the mounting path down on march who had sunk on a wayside seat and was mopping his forehead he saw them and called up dont wait for me ill join you gradually  i dont want to lose you burnamy called back but he kept on with miss triscoe i want to get the hirschensprung in he explained its the cliff where a hunted deer leaped down several hundred feet to get away from an emperor who was after him  oh yes they have them everywhere  do they well anyway theres a noble view up there  there was no view on the way up the germans notion of a woodland is everywhere that of a dense forest such as their barbarous tribes primevally herded in it means the closeset stems of trees with their tops interwoven in a roof of boughs and leaves so densely that you may walk dry through it almost as long as a german shower lasts when the sun shines there is a pleasant greenish light in the aisles shot here and there with the gold that trickles through there is nothing of the accident of an american wood in these forests which have been watched and weeded by man ever since they burst the soil they remain nurseries but they have the charm which no human care can alienate the smell of their bark and their leaves and of the moist flowerless earth about their roots came to march where he sat rich with the memories of his countrybred youth and drugged all consciousness of his long life in cities since and made him a part of nature with dulled interests and dimmed perspectives so that for the moment he had the enjoyment of exemption from care there was no wild life to penetrate his isolation no birds not a squirrel not an insect an old man who had bidden him goodmorning as he came up kept fumbling at the path with his hoe and was less intrusive than if he had not been there  march thought of the impassioned existence of these young people playing the inevitable comedy of hide and seek which the youth of the race has played from the beginning of time the other invalids who haunted the forest and passed up and down before him in fulfilment of their several prescriptions had a thin unreality in spite of the physical bulk that prevailed among them and they heightened the relief that the forestspirit brought him from the strenuous contact of that young drama he had been almost painfully aware that the persons in it had met however little they knew it with an eagerness intensified by their brief separation and he fancied it was the girl who had unconsciously operated their reunion in response to the young mans longing her will making itself electrically felt through space by that sort of wireless telegraphy which love has long employed and science has just begun to imagine  he would have been willing that they should get home alone but he knew that his wife would require an account of them from him and though he could have invented something of the kind if it came to the worst he was aware that it would not do for him to arrive without them the thought goaded him from his seat and he joined the upward procession of his fellowsick as it met another procession straggling downward the ways branched in all directions with people on them everywhere bent upon building up in a month the health which they would spend the rest of the year in demolishing  he came upon his charges unexpectedly at a turn of the path and miss triscoe told him that he ought to have been with them for the view from the hirschensprung it was magnificent she said and she made burnamy corroborate her praise of it and agree with her that it was worth the climb a thousand times he modestly accepted the credit she appeared willing to give him of inventing the hirschensprung     xxxi  between his work for stoller and what sometimes seemed the obstructiveness of general triscoe burnamy was not very much with miss triscoe he was not devout but he went every sunday to the pretty english church on the hill where he contributed beyond his means to the support of the english clergy on the continent for the sake of looking at her back hair during the service and losing himself in the graceful lines which defined the girls figure from the slant of her flowery hat to the point where the pewtop crossed her elastic waist one happy morning the general did not come to church and he had the fortune to walk home with her to her pension where she lingered with him a moment and almost made him believe she might be going to ask him to come in  the next evening when he was sauntering down the row of glittering shops beside the tepl with mrs march they overtook the general and his daughter at a place where the girl was admiring some storkscissors in the window she said she wished she were still little so that she could get them they walked home with the triscoes and then he hurried mrs march back to the shop the man had already put up his shutters and was just closing his door but burnamy pushed in and asked to look at the storkscissors they had seen in the window the gas was out and the shopman lighted a very dim candle to show them  i knew you wanted to get them for her after what she said mrs march he laughed nervously and you must let me lend you the money  why of course she answered joyfully humoring his feint shall i put my card in for the man to send home to her with them  wellno no not your cardexactly or yes yes you must i suppose  they made the hushing street gay with their laughter the next evening miss triscoe came upon the marches and burnamy where they sat after supper listening to the concert at pupps and thanked mrs march for the scissors then she and burnamy had their laugh again and miss triscoe joined them to her fathers frowning mystification he stared round for a table they were all taken and he could not refuse the interest burnamy made with the waiters to bring them one and crowd it in he had to ask him to sup with them and burnamy sat down and heard the concert through beside miss triscoe  what is so tremendously amusing in a pair of storkscissors march demanded when his wife and he were alone  why i was wanting to tell you dearest she began in a tone which he felt to be wheedling and she told the story of the scissors  look here my dear didnt you promise to let this loveaffair alone  that was on the ship and besides what would you have done i should like to know would you have refused to let him buy them for her she added carelessly he wants us to go to the kurhaus ball with him  oh does he  yes he says he knows that she can get her father to let her go if we will chaperon them and i promised that you would  that i would  it will do just as well if you go and it will be very amusing you can see something of carlsbad society  but im not going he declared it would interfere with my cure the sitting up late would be bad enough but i should get very hungry and i should eat potato salad and sausages and drink beer and do all sorts of unwholesome things  nonsense the refreshments will be kurgemass of course  you can go yourself he said  a ball is not the same thing for a woman after fifty as it is before twenty but still it has claims upon the imagination and the novel circumstance of a ball in the kurhaus in carlsbad enhanced these for mrs march it was the annual reunion which is given by municipal authority in the large hall above the bathrooms it is frequented with safety and pleasure by curious strangers and now upon reflection it began to have for mrs march the charm of duty she believed that she could finally have made march go in her place but she felt that she ought really to go in his and save him from the late hours and the late supper  very well then she said at last i will go  it appeared that any civil person might go to the reunion who chose to pay two florins and a half there must have been some sort of restriction and the ladies of burnamys party went with a good deal of amused curiosity to see what the distinctions were but they saw none unless it was the advantages which the military had the long hall over the bathrooms shaped itself into a space for the dancing at one end and all the rest of it was filled with tables which at half past eight were crowded with people eating drinking and smoking the military enjoyed the monopoly of a table next the rail dividing the dancing from the dining space there the tightlaced herr hauptmanns and herr lieutenants sat at their sausage and beer and cigars in the intervals of the waltzes and strengthened themselves for a foray among the gracious fraus and frauleins on the benches lining three sides of the dancingspace from the gallery above many civilian spectators looked down upon the gayety and the dresscoats of a few citizens figured among the uniforms  as the evening wore on some ladies of greater fashion found their way to the dancingfloor and toward ten oclock it became rather crowded a party of american girls showed their paris dresses in the transatlantic versions of the waltz at first they danced with the young men who came with them but after a while they yielded to the custom of the place and danced with any of the officers who asked them  i know its the custom said mrs march to miss triscoe who was at her side in one of the waltzes she had decided to sit out so as not to be dancing all the time with burnamy but i never can like it without an introduction  no said the girl with the air of putting temptation decidedly away i dont believe papa would either  a young officer came up and drooped in mute supplication before her she glanced at mrs march who turned her face away and she excused herself with the pretence that she had promised the dance and by good fortune burnamy who had been unscrupulously waltzing with a lady he did not know came up at the moment she rose and put her hand on his arm and they both bowed to the officer before they whirled away the officer looked after them with amiable admiration then he turned to mrs march with a light of banter in his friendly eyes and was unmistakably asking her to dance she liked his ironical daring she liked it so much that she forgot her objection to partners without introductions she forgot her fiftyodd years she forgot that she was a mother of grown children and even a motherinlaw she remembered only the step of her outdated waltz  it seemed to be modern enough for the cheerful young officer and they were suddenly revolving with the rest a tide of longforgotten girlhood welled up in her heart and she laughed as she floated off on it past the astonished eyes of miss triscoe and burnamy she saw them falter as if they had lost their step in their astonishment then they seemed both to vanish and her partner had released her and was helping miss triscoe up from the floor burnamy was brushing the dust from his knees and the citizen who had bowled them over was boisterously apologizing and incessantly bowing  oh are you hurt mrs march implored im sure you must be killed and i did it i dont know what i was thinking of  the girl laughed im not hurt a bit  they had one impulse to escape from the place and from the sympathy and congratulation in the dressingroom she declared again that she was all right how beautifully you waltz mrs march she said and she laughed again and would not agree with her that she had been ridiculous but im glad those american girls didnt see me and i cant be too thankful papa didnt come  mrs marchs heart sank at the thought of what general triscoe would think of her you must tell him i did it i can never lift up my head  no i shall not no one did it said the girl magnanimously she looked down sidelong at her draperies i was so afraid i had torn my dress i certainly heard something rip  it was one of the skirts of burnamys coat which he had caught into his hand and held in place till he could escape to the mens dressingroom where he had it pinned up so skillfully that the damage was not suspected by the ladies he had banged his knee abominably too but they did not suspect that either as he limped home on the air beside them first to miss triscoes pension and then to mrs marchs hotel  it was quite eleven oclock which at carlsbad is as late as three in the morning anywhere else when she let herself into her room she decided not to tell her husband then and even at breakfast which they had at the posthof she had not got to her confession though she had told him everything else about the ball when the young officer with whom she had danced passed between the tables near her he caught her eye and bowed with a smile of so much meaning that march asked whos your pretty young friend  oh that she answered carelessly that was one of the officers at the ball and she laughed  you seem to be in the joke too he said what is it  oh something ill tell you some time or perhaps youll find out  im afraid you wont let me wait  no i wont and now she told him she had expected teasing ridicule sarcasm anything but the psychological interest mixed with a sort of retrospective tenderness which he showed i wish i could have seen you i always thought you danced well he added it seems that you need a chaperon too  the next morning after march and general triscoe had started off upon one of the hill climbs the young people made her go with them for a walk up the tepl as far as the cafe of the freundschaftsaal in the grounds an artist in silhouettes was cutting out the likenesses of people who supposed themselves to have profiles and they begged mrs march to sit for hers it was so good that she insisted on miss triscoes sitting in turn and then burnamy then he had the inspiration to propose that they should all three sit together and it appeared that such a group was within the scope of the silhouettists art he posed them in his little bower and while he was mounting the picture they took turns at five kreutzers each in listening to american tunes played by his edison phonograph  mrs march felt that all this was weakening her moral fibre but she tried to draw the line at letting burnamy keep the group why not he pleaded  you oughtnt to ask she returned youve no business to have miss triscoes picture if you must know  but youre there to chaperon us he persisted  he began to laugh and they all laughed when she said you need a chaperon who doesnt lose her head in a silhouette but it seemed useless to hold out after that and she heard herself asking shall we let him keep it miss triscoe  burnamy went off to his work with stoller carrying the silhouette with him and she kept on with miss triscoe to her hotel in turning from the gate after she parted with the girl she found herself confronted with mrs adding and rose the ladies exclaimed at each other in an astonishment from which they had to recover before they could begin to talk but from the first moment mrs march perceived that mrs adding had something to say the more freely to say it she asked mrs march into her hotel which was in the same street with the pension of the triscoes and she let her boy go off about the exploration of carlsbad he promised to be back in an hour  well now what scrape are you in march asked when his wife came home and began to put off her things with signs of excitement which he could not fail to note he was lying down after a long tramp and he seemed very comfortable  his question suggested something of anterior import and she told him about the silhouettes and the advantage the young people had taken of their power over her through their knowledge of her foolish behavior at the ball  he said lazily they seem to be working you for all youre worth is that it  no there is something worse somethings happened which throws all that quite in the shade mrs adding is here  mrs adding he repeated with a dimness for names which she would not allow was growing on him  dont be stupid dear mrs adding who sat opposite mr kenby on the norumbia the mother of the nice boy  oh yes well thats good  no it isnt dont say such a thingtill you know she cried with a certain shrillness which warned him of an unfathomed seriousness in the fact he sat up as if better to confront the mystery i have been at her hotel and she has been telling me that shes just come from berlin and that mr kenbys been there andnow i wont have you making a joke of it or breaking out about it as if it were not a thing to be looked for though of course with the others on our hands youre not to blame for not thinking of it but you can see yourself that shes young and goodlooking she did speak beautifully of her son and if it were not for him i dont believe she would hesitate  for heavens sake what are you driving at march broke in and she answered him as vehemently  hes asked her to marry him  kenby mrs adding  yes  well now isabel this wont do they ought to be ashamed of themselves with that morbid sensitive boy its shocking  will you listen or do you want me to stop he arrested himself at her threat and she resumed after giving her contempt of his turbulence time to sink in she refused him of course  oh all right then  you take it in such a way that ive a great mind not to tell you anything more about it  i know you have he said stretching himself out again but youll do it all the same youd have been awfully disappointed if i had been calm and collected  she refused him she began again although she respects him because she feels that she ought to devote herself to her son of course shes very young still she was married when she was only nineteen to a man twice her age and shes not thirtyfive yet i dont think she ever cared much for her husband and she wants you to find out something about him  i never heard of him i  mrs march made a tchck that would have recalled the most consequent of men from the most logical and coherent interpretation to the true intent of her words he perceived his mistake and said resolutely well i wont do it if shes refused him thats the end of it she neednt know anything about him and she has no right to  now i think differently said mrs march with an inductive air of course she has to know about him now she stopped and march turned his head and looked expectantly at her he said he would not consider her answer final but would hope to see her again andshes afraid he may follow herwhat are you looking at me so for  is he coming here  am i to blame if he is he said he was going to write to her  march burst into a laugh well they havent been beating about the bush when i think how miss triscoe has been pursuing burnamy from the first moment she set eyes on him with the settled belief that she was running from him and he imagines that he has been boldly following her without the least hope from her i cant help admiring the simple directness of these elders  and if kenby wants to talk with you what will you say she cut in eagerly  ill say i dont like the subject what am i in carlsbad for i came for the cure and im spending time and money on it i might as well go and take my three cups of felsenquelle on a full stomach as to listen to kenby  i know its bad for you and i wish we had never seen those people said mrs march i dont believe hell want to talk with you but if  is mrs adding in this hotel im not going to have them round in my breadtrough  she isnt shes at one of the hotels on the hill  very well let her stay there then they can manage their loveaffairs in their own way the only one i care the least for is the boy  yes it is forlorn for him but he likes mr kenby andno its horrid and you cant make it anything else  well im not trying to he turned his face away i must get my nap now after she thought he must have fallen asleep he said the first thing you know those old eltwins will be coming round and telling us that theyre going to get divorced then he really slept     xxxii  the midday dinner at pupps was the time to see the carlsbad world and the marches had the habit of sitting long at table to watch it  there was one family in whom they fancied a sort of literary quality as if they had come out of some pleasant german story but they never knew anything about them the father by his dress must have been a protestant clergyman the mother had been a beauty and was still very handsome the daughter was goodlooking and of a goodbreeding which was both girlish and ladylike they commended themselves by always taking the table dhote dinner as the marches did and eating through from the soup and the rank freshwater fish to the sweet upon the same principle the husband ate all the compote and gave the others his dessert which was not good for him a young girl of a different fascination remained as much a mystery she was small and of an extreme tenuity which became more bewildering as she advanced through her meal especially at supper which she made of a long cucumber pickle a frankfort sausage of twice the pickles length and a towering goblet of beer in her lap she held a shivering little hound she was in the decorous keeping of an elderly maid and had every effect of being a gracious fraulein a curious contrast to her teutonic voracity was the temperance of a young latin swell imaginably from trieste who sat long over his small coffee and cigarette and tranquilly mused upon the pages of an italian newspaper at another table there was a very noisy lady short and fat in flowing draperies of white who commanded a sallow family of southamericans and loudly harangued them in southamerican spanish she flared out in a picture which nowhere lacked strong effects and in her background lurked a mysterious black face and figure ironically subservient to the old man the mild boy and the pretty young girl in the middle distance of the family group  amidst the shows of a hardened worldliness there were touching glimpses of domesticity and heart a young bride fed her husband soup from her own plate with her spoon unabashed by the publicity a mother and her two pretty daughters hung about a handsome officer who must have been newly betrothed to one of the girls and the whole family showed a helpless fondness for him which he did not despise though he held it in check the girls dressed alike and seemed to have for their whole change of costume a difference from time to time in the color of their sleeves the marches believed they had seen the growth of the romance which had eventuated so happily and they saw other romances which did not in any wise eventuate carlsbad was evidently one of the great marriage marts of middle europe where mothers brought their daughters to be admired and everywhere the flower of life was blooming for the hand of love it blew by on all the promenades in dresses and hats as pretty as they could be bought or imagined but it was chiefly at pupps that it flourished for the most part it seemed to flourish in vain and to be destined to be put by for another season to dream bulblike of the coming summer in the quiet of moldavian and transylvanian homes  perhaps it was oftener of fortunate effect than the spectators knew but for their own pleasure they would not have had their pang for it less and march objected to having a more explicit demand upon his sympathy we could have managed he said at the close of their dinner as he looked compassionately round upon the parterre of young girls we could have managed with burnamy and miss triscoe but to have mrs adding and kenby launched upon us is too much of course i like kenby and if the widow alone were concerned i would give him my blessing a wife more or a widow less is not going to disturb the equilibrium of the universe but he stopped and then he went on men and women are well enough they complement each other very agreeably and they have very good times together but why should they get in loveit is sure to make them uncomfortable to themselves and annoying to others he broke off and stared about him my dear this is really charmingalmost as charming as the posthof the crowd spread from the open vestibule of the hotel and the shelter of its branching pavilion roofs until it was dimmed in the obscurity of the low grove across the way in an ultimate depth where the musicians were giving the afternoon concert between its two stationary divisions moved a current of promenaders with some such effect as if the colors of a lovely garden should have liquefied and flowed in mingled rose and lilac pink and yellow and white and orange and all the middle tints of modern millinery above on one side were the agreeable bulks of architecture in the buff and gray of carlsbad and far beyond on the other were the upland slopes with villas and long curves of country roads belted in with miles of wall it would be about as offensive to have a loveinterest that one personally knew about intruded here he said as to have a twospanner carriage driven through this crowd it ought to be forbidden by the municipality  mrs march listened with her ears but not with her eyes and she answered see that handsome young greek priest isnt he an archimandrite the portier said he was  then let him pass for an archimandrite now he recurred to his grievance again dreamily i have got to take papa triscoe in hand and poison his mind against burnamy and i shall have to instil a few drops of venomous suspicion against kenby into the heart of poor little rose adding oh he broke out they will spoil everything theyll be with us morning noon and night and he went on to work the joke of repining at his lot the worst thing he said would be the lovers pretence of being interested in something besides themselves which they were no more capable of than so many lunatics how could they care for pretty girls playing tennis on an upland level in the waning afternoon or a cartful of peasant women stopping to cross themselves at a wayside shrine or a whistling boy with holes in his trousers pausing from some wayside raspberries to touch his hat and say goodmorning or those preposterous maidens sprinkling linen on the grass from wateringpots while the skies were full of rain or that blacksmith shop where peter the great made a horseshoe or the monument of the young warriorpoet koerner with a gentlelooking girl and her mother reading and knitting on a bench before it these simple pleasures sufficed them but what could lovers really care for them a peasant girl flung down on the grassy roadside fast asleep while her yokefellow the gray old dog lay in his harness near her with one drowsy eye half open for her and the other for the contents of their cart a boy chasing a red squirrel in the old upper town beyond the tepl and enlisting the interest of all the neighbors the negro doorkeeper at the golden shield who ought to have spoken our southern english but who spoke bad german and was from cairo the sweet afternoon stillness in the woods the good german mothers crocheting at the posthof concerts burnamy as a young poet might hate felt the precious quality of these things if his senses had not been holden by miss triscoe and she might have felt it if only he had done so but as it was it would be lost upon their preoccupation with mrs adding and kenby it would be hopeless  a day or two after mrs march had met mrs adding she went with her husband to revere a certain magnificent blackamoor whom he had discovered at the entrance of one of the aristocratic hotels on the schlossberg where he performed the function of a kind of caryatid and looked in the black of his skin and the white of his flowing costume like a colossal figure carved in ebony and ivory they took a roundabout way through a street entirely of villapensions every house in carlsbad but one is a pension if it is not a hotel but these were of a sort of sentimental prettiness with each a little garden before it and a bower with an iron table in it for breakfasting and supping outdoors and he said that they would be the very places for bridal couples who wished to spend the honeymoon in getting well of the wedding surfeit she denounced him for saying such a thing as that and for his inconsistency in complaining of lovers while he was willing to think of young married people he contended that there was a great difference in the sort of demand that young married people made upon the interest of witnesses and that they were at least on their way to sanity and before they agreed they had come to the hotel with the blackamoor at the door while they lingered sharing the splendid creatures hospitable pleasure in the spectacle he formed they were aware of a carriage with liveried coachman and footman at the steps of the hotel the liveries were very quiet and distinguished and they learned that the equipage was waiting for the prince of coburg or the princess of montenegro or prince henry of prussia there were differing opinions among the twenty or thirty bystanders mrs march said she did not care which it was and she was patient of the denouement which began to postpone itself with delicate delays after repeated agitations at the door among portiers proprietors and waiters whose fluttered spirits imparted their thrill to the spectators while the coachman and footman remained sculpturesquely impassive in their places the carriage moved aside and let an energetic american lady and her family drive up to the steps the hotel people paid her a tempered devotion but she marred the effect by rushing out and sitting on a balcony to wait for the delaying royalties there began to be more promises of their early appearance a footman got down and placed himself at the carriage door the coachman stiffened himself on his box then he relaxed the footman drooped and even wandered aside there came a moment when at some signal the carriage drove quite away from the portal and waited near the gate of the stableyard it drove back and the spectators redoubled their attention nothing happened and some of them dropped off at last an indescribable significance expressed itself in the official group at the door a man in a high hat and dresscoat hurried out a footman hurried to meet him they spoke inaudibly together the footman mounted to his place the coachman gathered up his reins and drove rapidly out of the hotelyard down the street round the corner out of sight the man in the tall hat and dresscoat went in the official group at the threshold dissolved the statue in ivory and ebony resumed its place evidently the hoheit of coburg or montenegro or prussia was not going to take the air  my dear this is humiliating  not at all i wouldnt have missed it for anything think how near we came to seeing them  i shouldnt feel so shabby if we had seen them but to hang round here in this plebeian abeyance and then to be defeated and defrauded at last i wonder how long this sort of thing is going on  what thing  this base subjection of the imagination to the tom foolery of the ages  i dont know what you mean im sure its very natural to want to see a prince  only too natural its so deeply founded in nature that after denying royalty by word and deed for a hundred years we americans are hungrier for it than anybody else perhaps we may come back to it  nonsense  they looked up at the austrian flag on the tower of the hotel languidly curling and uncurling in the bland evening air as it had over a thousand years of stupid and selfish monarchy while all the generous republics of the middle ages had perished and the commonwealths of later times had passed like fever dreams that dull inglorious empire had antedated or outlived venice and genoa florence and siena the england of cromwell the holland of the stadtholders and the france of many revolutions and all the fleeting democracies which sprang from these  march began to ask himself how his curiosity differed from that of the europeans about him then he became aware that these had detached themselves and left him exposed to the presence of a fellow countryman it was otterson with mrs otterson he turned upon march with hilarious recognition hello most of the americans in carlsbad seem to be hanging round here for a sight of these kings well we dont have a great many of em and its natural we shouldnt want to miss any but now you eastern fellows you go to europe every summer and yet you dont seem to get enough of em think its human nature or did it get so ground into us in the old times that we cant get it out no difference what we say  thats very much what ive been asking myself said march perhaps its any kind of show wed wait nearly as long for the president to come out wouldnt we  i reckon we would but we wouldnt for his nephew or his second cousin  well they wouldnt be in the way of the succession  i guess youre right the iowan seemed better satisfied with marchs philosophy than march felt himself and he could not forbear adding  but i dont deny that we should wait for the president because hes a kind of king too i dont know that we shall ever get over wanting to see kings of some kind or at least my wife wont may i present you to mrs march  happy to meet you mrs march said the iowan introduce you to mrs otterson im the fool in my family and i know just how you feel about a chance like this i dont mean that youre  they all laughed at the hopeless case and mrs march said with one of her unexpected likings i understand mr otterson and i would rather be our kind of fool than the kind that pretends not to care for the sight of a king  like you and me mrs otterson said march  indeed indeed said the lady id like to see a king too if it didnt take all night goodevening she said turning her husband about with her as if she suspected a purpose of patronage in mrs march and was not going to have it  otterson looked over his shoulder to explain despairingly the trouble with me is that when i do get a chance to talk english theres such a flow of language it carries me away and i dont know just where im landing     xxxiii  there were several kings and their kindred at carlsbad that summer one day the duchess of orleans drove over from marienbad attended by the duke on his bicycle after luncheon they reappeared for a moment before mounting to her carriage with their secretaries two young french gentlemen whose dress and bearing better satisfied mrs marchs exacting passion for an aristocratic air in their order the duke was fat and fair as a bourbon should be and the duchess fatter though not so fair as became a hapsburg but they were both more plebeianlooking than their retainers who were slender as well as young and as perfectly appointed as english tailors could imagine them  it wouldnt do for the very highest sort of highhotes march declared to look their own consequence personally they have to leave that like everything else to their inferiors  by a happy heterophemy of mrs marchs the german hoheit had now become highhote which was so much more descriptive that they had permanently adopted it and found comfort to their republican pride in the mockery which it poured upon the feudal structure of society they applied it with a certain compunction however to the king of servia who came a few days after the duke and duchess he was such a young king and of such a little country they watched for him from the windows of the readingroom while the crowd outside stood six deep on the three sides of the square before the hotel and the two plain public carriages which brought the king and his suite drew tamely up at the portal where the proprietor and some civic dignitaries received him his moderated approach so little like that of royalty on the stage to which americans are used allowed mrs march to make sure of the pale slight insignificant amiablelooking youth in spectacles as the sovereign she was ambuscading then no appeal to her principles could keep her from peeping through the readingroom door into the rotunda where the king graciously but speedily dismissed the civic gentlemen and the proprietor and vanished into the elevator she was destined to see him so often afterwards that she scarcely took the trouble to time her dining and supping by that of the simple potentate who had his meals in one of the public rooms with three gentlemen of his suite in sackcoats like himself after the informal manner of the place  still another potentate who happened that summer to be sojourning abroad in the interval of a successful rebellion was at the opera one night with some of his faithful followers burnamy had offered mrs march who supposed that he merely wanted her and her husband with him places in a box but after she eagerly accepted it seemed that he wished her to advise him whether it would do to ask miss triscoe and her father to join them  why not she returned with an arching of the eyebrows  why he said perhaps i had better make a clean breast of it  perhaps you had she said and they both laughed though he laughed with a knot between his eyes  the fact is you know this isnt my treat exactly its mr stollers at the surprise in her face he hurried on hes got back his first letter in the paper and hes so much pleased with the way he reads in print that he wants to celebrate  yes said mrs march noncommittally  burnamy laughed again but hes bashful and he isnt sure that you would all take it in the right way he wants you as friends of mine and he hasnt quite the courage to ask you himself  this seemed to mrs march so far from bad that she said thats very nice of him then hes satisfied withwith your help im glad of that  thank you hes met the triscoes and he thought it would be pleasant to you if they went too  oh certainly  he thought burnamy went on with the air of feeling his way that we might all go to the opera and thenthen go for a little supper afterwards at schwarzkopfs  he named the only place in carlsbad where you can sup so late as ten oclock as the opera begins at six and is over at half past eight none but the wildest roisterers frequent the place  oh said mrs march i dont know how a late supper would agree with my husbands cure i should have to ask him  we could make it very hygienic burnamy explained  in repeating his invitation she blamed burnamys uncandor so much that march took his part as perhaps she intended and said oh nonsense and that he should like to go in for the whole thing and general triscoe accepted as promptly for himself and his daughter that made six people burnamy counted up and he feigned a decent regret that there was not room for mrs adding and her son he would have liked to ask them  mrs march did not enjoy it so much as coming with her husband alone when they took two florin seats in the orchestra for the comedy the comedy always began half an hour earlier than the opera and they had a fiveoclock supper at the theatrecafe before they went and they got to sleep by nine oclock now they would be up till half past ten at least and that orgy at schwarzkopfs might not be at all good for him but still she liked being there and miss triscoe made her take the best seat burnamy and stoller made the older men take the other seats beside the ladies while they sat behind or stood up when they wished to see as people do in the back of a box stoller was not much at ease in evening dress but he bore himself with a dignity which was not perhaps so gloomy as it looked mrs march thought him handsome in his way and required miss triscoe to admire him as for burnamys beauty it was not necessary to insist upon that he had the distinction of slender youth and she liked to think that no highhote there was of a more patrician presence than this yet unprinted contributor to every other week he and stoller seemed on perfect terms or else in his joy he was able to hide the uneasiness which she had fancied in him from the first time she saw them together and which had never been quite absent from his manner in stollers presence her husband always denied that it existed or if it did that it was anything but burnamys effort to get on common ground with an inferior whom fortune had put over him  the young fellow talked with stoller and tried to bring him into the range of the general conversation he leaned over the ladies from time to time and pointed out the notables whom he saw in the house she was glad for his sake that he did not lean less over her than over miss triscoe he explained certain military figures in the boxes opposite and certain ladies of rank who did not look their rank miss triscoe to mrs marchs thinking looked their united ranks and more her dress was very simple but of a touch which saved it from being insipidly girlish her beauty was dazzling  do you see that old fellow in the corner chair just behind the orchestra asked burnamy hes ninetysix years old and he comes to the theatre every night and falls asleep as soon as the curtain rises and sleeps through till the end of the act  how dear said the girl leaning forward to fix the nonagenarian with her glasses while many other glasses converged upon her oh wouldnt you like to know him mr march  i should consider it a liberal education they have brought these things to a perfect system in europe there is nothing to make life pass smoothly like inflexible constancy to an entirely simple custom my dear he added to his wife i wish wed seen this sage before hed have helped us through a good many hours of unintelligible comedy im always coming as burnamys guest after this  the young fellow swelled with pleasure in his triumph and casting an eye about the theatre to cap it he caught sight of that other potentate he whispered joyfully ah weve got two kings here tonight and he indicated in a box of their tier just across from that where the king of servia sat the wellknown face of the king of new york  he isnt badlooking said march handing his glass to general triscoe ive not seen many kings in exile a matter of a few carlist princes and exsovereign dukes and the good henry v of france once when i was staying a month in venice but i dont think they any of them looked the part better i suppose he has his dream of recurring power like the rest  dream said general triscoe with the glass at his eyes hes dead sure of it  oh you dont really mean that  i dont know why i should have changed my mind  then its as if we were in the presence of charles ii just before he was called back to england or napoleon in the last moments of elba its better than that the thing is almost unique its a new situation in history heres a sovereign who has no recognized function no legal status no objective existence he has no sort of public being except in the affection of his subjects it took an upheaval little short of an earthquake to unseat him his rule as we understand it was bad for all classes the poor suffered more than the rich the people have now had three years of selfgovernment and yet this wonderful man has such a hold upon the masses that he is going home to win the cause of oppression at the head of the oppressed when hes in power again he will be as subjective as ever with the power of civic life and death and an idolatrous following perfectly ruthless in the execution of his will  weve only begun said the general this kind of king is municipal now but hes going to be national and then goodby republic  the only thing like it march resumed too incredulous of the evil future to deny himself the aesthetic pleasure of the parallel is the rise of the medici in florence but even the medici were not mere manipulators of pulls they had some sort of public office with some sort of legislated tenure of it the king of new york is sovereign by force of will alone and he will reign in the voluntary submission of the majority is our national dictator to be of the same nature and quality  it would be the scientific evolution wouldnt it  the ladies listened with the perfunctory attention which women pay to any sort of inquiry which is not personal stoller had scarcely spoken yet he now startled them all by demanding with a sort of vindictive force why shouldnt he have the power if theyre willing to let him  yes said general triscoe with a tilt of his head towards march thats what we must ask ourselves more and more  march leaned back in his chair and looked up over his shoulder at stoller well i dont know do you think its quite right for a man to use an unjust power even if others are willing that he should  stoller stopped with an air of bewilderment as if surprised on the point of saying that he thought just this he asked instead whats wrong about it  well thats one of those things that have to be felt i suppose but if a man came to you and offered to be your slave for a certain considerationsay a comfortable house and a steady job that wasnt too hardshould you feel it morally right to accept the offer i dont say think it right for there might be a kind of logic for it  stoller seemed about to answer he hesitated and before he had made any response the curtain rose     xxxiv  there are few prettier things than carlsbad by night from one of the many bridges which span the tepl in its course through the town if it is a starry night the torrent glides swiftly away with an inverted firmament in its bosom to which the lamps along its shores and in the houses on either side contribute a planetary splendor of their own by nine oclock everything is hushed not a wheel is heard at that dead hour the few feet shuffling stealthily through the alte wiese whisper a caution of silence to those issuing with a less guarded tread from the opera the little bowers that overhang the stream are as dark and mute as the restaurants across the way which serve meals in them by day the whole place is as forsaken as other cities at midnight people get quickly home to bed or if they have a mind to snatch a belated joy they slip into the theatercafe where the sleepy frauleins serve them in an exemplary drowse with plates of cold ham and bottles of the gently gaseous waters of giesshubl few are of the bold badness which delights in a supper at schwarzkopfs and even these are glad of the drawn curtains which hide their orgy from the chance passer  the invalids of burnamys party kept together strengthening themselves in a mutual purpose not to be tempted to eat anything which was not strictly kurgemass mrs march played upon the interest which each of them felt in his own case so artfully that she kept them talking of their cure and left burnamy and miss triscoe to a moment on the bridge by which they profited while the others strolled on to lean against the parapet and watch the lights in the skies and the water and be alone together the stream shone above and below and found its way out of and into the darkness under the successive bridges the town climbed into the night with lamplit windows here and there till the woods of the hillsides darkened down to meet it and fold it in an embrace from which some white edifice showed palely in the farthest gloom  he tried to make her think they could see that great iron crucifix which watches over it day and night from its piny cliff he had a fancy for a poem very impressionistic which should convey the notion of the crucifixs vigil he submitted it to her and they remained talking till the others had got out of sight and hearing and she was letting him keep the hand on her arm which he had put there to hold her from falling over the parapet when they were both startled by approaching steps and a voice calling look here whos running this supper party anyway  his wife had detached march from her group for the mission as soon as she felt that the young people were abusing her kindness they answered him with hysterical laughter and burnamy said why its mr stollers treat you know  at the restaurant where the proprietor obsequiously met the party on the threshold and bowed them into a pretty inner room with a table set for their supper stoller had gained courage to play the host openly he appointed general triscoe to the chief seat he would have put his daughter next to him if the girl had not insisted upon mrs marchs having the place and going herself to sit next to march whom she said she had not been able to speak a word to the whole evening but she did not talk a great deal to him he smiled to find how soon he dropped out of the conversation and burnamy from his greater remoteness across the table dropped into it he really preferred the study of stoller whose instinct of a greater worldly quality in the triscoes interested him he could see him listening now to what general triscoe was saying to mrs march and now to what burnamy was saying to miss triscoe his strong selfish face as he turned it on the young people expressed a mingled grudge and greed that was very curious  stollers courage which had come and gone at moments throughout rose at the end and while they lingered at the table well on to the hour of ten he said in the sort of helpless offence he had with burnamy whats the reason we cant all go out tomorrow to that old castle you was talking about  to engelhaus i dont know any reason as far as im concerned answered burnamy but he refused the initiative offered him and stoller was obliged to ask march  you heard about it  yes general triscoe was listening and march added for him it was the hold of an old robber baron gustavus adolphus knocked it down and its very picturesque i believe  it sounds promising said the general where is it  isnt tomorrow our mineral bath mrs march interposed between her husband and temptation  no the day after why its about ten or twelve miles out on the old postroad that napoleon took for prague  napoleon knew a good road when he saw it said the general and he alone of the company lighted a cigar he was decidedly in favor of the excursion and he arranged for it with stoller whom he had the effect of using for his pleasure as if he were doing him a favor they were six and two carriages would take them a twospanner for four and a onespanner for two they could start directly after dinners and get home in time for supper  stoller asserted himself to say thats all right then i want you to be my guests and ill see about the carriages he turned to burnamy will you order them  oh said the young fellow with a sort of dryness the portier will get them  i dont understand why general triscoe was so willing to accept surely he cant like that man said mrs march to her husband in their own room  oh i fancy that wouldnt be essential the general seems to me capable of letting even an enemy serve his turn why didnt you speak if you didnt want to go  why didnt you  i wanted to go  and i knew it wouldnt do to let miss triscoe go alone i could see that she wished to go  do you think burnamy did  he seemed rather indifferent and yet he must have realized that he would be with miss triscoe the whole afternoon     xxxv  if burnamy and miss triscoe took the lead in the onespanner and the others followed in the twospanner it was not from want of politeness on the part of the young people in offering to give up their places to each of their elders in turn it would have been grotesque for either march or stoller to drive with the girl for her father it was apparently no question after a glance at the more rigid uprightness of the seat in the onespanner and he accepted the place beside mrs march on the back seat of the twospanner without demur he asked her leave to smoke and then he scarcely spoke to her but he talked to the two men in front of him almost incessantly haranguing them upon the inferiority of our conditions and the futility of our hopes as a people with the effect of bewildering the cruder arrogance of stoller who could have got on with triscoes contempt for the worthlessness of our workingclasses but did not know what to do with his scorn of the vulgarity and venality of their employers he accused some of stollers most honored and envied capitalists of being the source of our worst corruptions and guiltier than the votingcattle whom they bought and sold  i think we can get rid of the whole trouble if we go at it the right way stoller said diverging for the sake of the point he wished to bring in i believe in having the government run on business principles theyve got it here in carlsbad already just the right sort of thing and it works i been lookin into it and i got this young man yonderhe twisted his hand in the direction of the onespanner to help me put it in shape i believe its going to make our folks think the best ones among them here he drew a newspaper out of his pocket folded to show two columns in their full length and handed it to triscoe who took it with no great eagerness and began to run his eye over it you tell me what you think of that ive put it out for a kind of a feeler i got some money in that paper and i just thought id let our people see how a city can be managed on business principles  he kept his eye eagerly upon triscoe as if to follow his thought while he read and keep him up to the work and he ignored the marches so entirely that they began in selfdefence to talk with each other  their carriage had climbed from carlsbad in long irregular curves to the breezy upland where the great highroad to prague ran through fields of harvest they had come by heights and slopes of forest where the serried stems of the tall firs showed brown and whitishblue and grew straight as stalks of grain and now on either side the farms opened under a sky of unwonted cloudlessness narrow strips of wheat and rye which the men were cutting with sickles and the women in red bodices were binding alternated with ribands of yellowing oats and grass and breadths of beets and turnips with now and then lengths of ploughed land in the meadows the peasants were piling their carts with heavy rowen the girls lifting the hay on the forks and the men giving themselves the lighter labor of ordering the load from the upturned earth where there ought to have been troops of strutting crows a few sombre ravens rose but they could not rob the scene of its gayety it smiled in the sunshine with colors which vividly followed the slope of the land till they were dimmed in the forests on the faroff mountains nearer and farther the cottages and villages shone in the valleys or glimmered through the veils of the distant haze over all breathed the keen pure air of the hills with a sentiment of changeless eld which charmed march back to his boyhood where he lost the sense of his wifes presence and answered her vaguely she talked contentedly on in the monologue to which the wives of absentminded men learn to resign themselves they were both roused from their vagary by the voice of general triscoe he was handing back the folded newspaper to stoller and saying with a queer look at him over his glasses i should like to see what your contemporaries have to say to all that  well sir stoller returned maybe ill have the chance to show you they got my instructions over there to send everything to me  burnamy and miss triscoe gave little heed to the landscape as landscape they agreed that the human interest was the great thing on a landscape after all but they ignored the peasants in the fields and meadows who were no more to them than the driver on the box or the people in the twospanner behind they were talking of the hero and heroine of a novel they had both read and he was saying i suppose you think he was justly punished  punished she repeated why they got married after all  yes but you could see that they were not going to be happy  then it seems to me that she was punished too  well yes you might say that the author couldnt help that  miss triscoe was silent a moment before she said  i always thought the author was rather hard on the hero the girl was very exacting  why said burnamy i supposed that women hated anything like deception in men too much to tolerate it at all of course in this case he didnt deceive her he let her deceive herself but wasnt that worse  yes that was worse she could have forgiven him for deceiving her  oh  he might have had to do that she wouldnt have minded his fibbing outright so much for then it wouldnt have seemed to come from his nature but if he just let her believe what wasnt true and didnt say a word to prevent her of course it was worse it showed something weak something cowardly in him  burnamy gave a little cynical laugh i suppose it did but dont you think its rather rough expecting us to have all the kinds of courage  yes it is she assented that is why i say she was too exacting but a man oughnt to defend him  burnamys laugh had more pleasure in it now another woman might  no she might excuse him  he turned to look back at the twospanner it was rather far behind and he spoke to their driver bidding him go slowly till it caught up with them by the time it did so they were so close to it that they could distinguish the lines of its wandering and broken walls ever since they had climbed from the wooded depths of the hills above carlsbad to the open plateau it had shown itself in greater and greater detail the detached mound of rock on which it stood rose like an island in the midst of the plain and commanded the highways in every direction  i believe burnamy broke out with a bitterness apparently relevant to the ruin alone that if you hadnt required any quarterings of nobility from him stoller would have made a good sort of robber baron hes a robber baron by nature now and he wouldnt have any scruple in levying tribute on us here in our onespanner if his castle was in good repair and his crossbowmen were not on a strike but they would be on a strike probably and then he would lock them out and employ none but nonunion crossbowmen  if miss triscoe understood that he arraigned the morality as well as the civility of his employer she did not take him more seriously than he meant apparently for she smiled as she said i dont see how you can have anything to do with him if you feel so about him  oh burnamy replied in kind he buys my poverty and not my will and perhaps if i thought better of myself i should respect him more  have you been doing something very wicked  what should you have to say to me if i had he bantered  oh i should have nothing at all to say to you she mocked back  they turned a corner of the highway and drove rattling through a village street up a long slope to the rounded hill which it crowned a church at its base looked out upon an irregular square  a gaunt figure of a man with a staring mask which seemed to hide a darkling mind within came out of the church and locked it behind him he proved to be the sacristan and the keeper of all the villages claims upon the visitors interest he mastered after a moment their wishes in respect to the castle and showed the path that led to it at the top he said they would find a custodian of the ruins who would admit them     xxxvi  the path to the castle slanted upward across the shoulder of the hill to a certain point and there some rude stone steps mounted more directly wilding lilacbushes as if from some forgotten garden bordered the ascent the chickory opened its blue flower the clean bitter odor of vermouth rose from the trodden turf but nature spreads no such lavish feast in wood or field in the old world as she spoils us with in the new a few kinds repeated again and again seem to be all her store and man must make the most of them miss triscoe seemed to find flowers enough in the simple bouquet which burnamy put together for her she took it and then gave it back to him that she might have both hands for her skirt and so did him two favors  a superannuated forester of the nobleman who owns the ruin opened a gate for the party at the top and levied a tax of thirty kreutzers each upon them for its maintenance the castle by his story had descended from robber sire to robber son till gustavus knocked it to pieces in the sixteenth century three hundred years later the present owner restored it and now its broken walls and arches built of rubble mixed with brick and neatly pointed up with cement form a ruin satisfyingly permanent the walls were not of great extent but such as they were they enclosed several dungeons and a chapel all underground and a cistern which once enabled the barons and their retainers to water their wine in time of siege  from that height they could overlook the neighboring highways in every direction and could bring a merchant train to with a shaft from a crossbow or a shot from an arquebuse at pleasure with general triscoes leave march praised the strategic strength of the unique position which he found expressive of the past and yet suggestive of the present it was more a difference in method than anything else that distinguished the levy of customs by the authorities then and now what was the essential difference between taking tribute of travellers passing on horseback and collecting dues from travellers arriving by steamer they did not pay voluntarily in either case but it might be proof of progress that they no longer fought the customs officials  then you believe in free trade said stoller severely  no i am just inquiring which is the best way of enforcing the tariff laws  i saw in the paris chronicle last night said miss triscoe that people are kept on the docks now for hours and ladies cry at the way their things are tumbled over by the inspectors  its shocking said mrs march magisterially  it seems to be a return to the scenes of feudal times her husband resumed but im glad the travellers make no resistance im opposed to private war as much as i am to free trade  it all comes round to the same thing at last said general triscoe your precious humanity  oh i dont claim it exclusively march protested  well then our precious humanity is like a man that has lost his road he thinks he is finding his way out but he is merely rounding on his course and coming back to where he started  stoller said i think we ought to make it so rough for them over here that they will come to america and set up if they cant stand the duties  oh we ought to make it rough for them anyway march consented  if stoller felt his irony he did not know what to answer he followed with his eyes the manoeuvre by which burnamy and miss triscoe eliminated themselves from the discussion and strayed off to another corner of the ruin where they sat down on the turf in the shadow of the wall a thin upland breeze drew across them but the sun was hot the land fell away from the height and then rose again on every side in carpetlike fields and in long curving bands whose parallel colors passed unblended into the distance i dont suppose burnamy said that life ever does much better than this do you i feel like knocking on a piece of wood and saying unberufen i might knock on your bouquet thats wood  it would spoil the flowers she said looking down at them in her belt she looked up and their eyes met  i wonder he said presently what makes us always have a feeling of dread when we are happy  do you have that too she asked  yes perhaps its because we know that change must come and it must be for the worse  that must be it i never thought of it before though  if we had got so far in science that we could predict psychological weather and could know twentyfour hours ahead when a warm wave of bliss or a cold wave of misery was coming and prepare for smiles and tears beforehandit may come to that  i hope it wont id rather not know when i was to be happy it would spoil the pleasure and wouldnt be any compensation when it was the other way  a shadow fell across them and burnamy glanced round to see stoller looking down at them with a slant of the face that brought his aquiline profile into relief oh have a turf mr stoller he called gayly up to him  i guess weve seen about all there is he answered hadnt we better be going he probably did not mean to be mandatory  all right said burnamy and he turned to speak to miss triscoe again without further notice of him  they all descended to the church at the foot of the hill where the weird sacristan was waiting to show them the cold bare interior and to account for its newness with the fact that the old church had been burnt and this one built only a few years before then he locked the doors after them and ran forward to open against their coming the chapel of the village cemetery which they were to visit after they had fortified themselves for it at the village cafe  they were served by a little hunchback maid and she told them who lived in the chief house of the village it was uncommonly pretty where all the houses were picturesque and she spoke of it with respect as the dwelling of a rich magistrate who was clearly the great man of the place march admired the cat which rubbed against her skirt while she stood and talked and she took his praises modestly for the cat but they wrought upon the envy of her brother so that he ran off to the garden and came back with two fat sleepyeyed puppies which he held up with an arm across each of their stomachs for the acclaim of the spectators  oh give him something mrs march entreated hes such a dear  no no i am not going to have my little hunchback and her cat outdone he refused and then he was about to yield  hold on said stoller assuming the host i got the change  he gave the boy a few kreutzers when mrs march had meant her husband to reward his naivete with half a florin at least but he seemed to feel that he had now ingratiated himself with the ladies and he put himself in charge of them for the walk to the cemetery chapel he made miss triscoe let him carry her jacket when she found it warm  the chapel is dedicated to the holy trinity and the jesuit brother who designed it two or three centuries ago indulged a devotional fancy in the triangular form of the structure and the decorative details everything is threecornered the whole chapel to begin with and then the ark of the high altar in the middle of it and each of the three sidealtars the clumsy baroque taste of the architecture is a german version of the impulse that was making italy fantastic at the time the carving is coarse and the color harsh and unsoftened by years though it is broken and obliterated in places  the sacristan said that the chapel was never used for anything but funeral services and he led the way out into the cemetery where he wished to display the sepultural devices the graves here were planted with flowers and some were in a mourning of black pansies but a space fenced apart from the rest held a few neglected mounds overgrown with weeds and brambles this space he said was for suicides but to march it was not so ghastly as the dapper grief of certain tombs in consecrated ground where the stones had photographs of the dead on porcelain let into them one was the picture of a beautiful young woman who had been the wife of the local magnate an eternal love was vowed to her in the inscription but now the sacristan said with nothing of irony the magnate was married again and lived in that prettiest house of the village he seemed proud of the monument as the thing worthiest the attention of the strangers and he led them with less apparent hopefulness to the unfinished chapel representing a gethsemane with the figure of christ praying and his apostles sleeping it is a subject much celebrated in terracotta about carlsbad and it was not a novelty to his party still from its surroundings it had a fresh pathos and march tried to make him understand that they appreciated it he knew that his wife wished the poor man to think he had done them a great favor in showing it he had been touched with all the vain shows of grief in the poor ugly little place most of all he had felt the exile of those who had taken their own lives and were parted in death from the more patient sufferers who had waited for god to take them with a curious unpainful selfanalysis he noted that the older members of the party who in the course of nature were so much nearer death did not shrink from its shows but the young girl and the young man had not borne to look on them and had quickly escaped from the place somewhere outside the gate was it the beginning the promise of that reconciliation with death which nature brings to life at last or was it merely the effect or defect of ossified sensibilities of toughened nerves  that is all he asked of the spectral sacristan  that is all the man said and march felt in his pocket for a coin commensurate to the service he had done them it ought to be something handsome  no no said stoller detecting his gesture your money ant good  he put twenty or thirty kreutzers into the hand of the man who regarded them with a disappointment none the less cruel because it was so patient in france he would have been insolent in italy he would have frankly said it was too little here he merely looked at the money and whispered a sad danke  burnamy and miss triscoe rose from the grassy bank outside where they were sitting and waited for the elders to get into their twospanner  oh have i lost my glove in there said mrs march looking at her hands and such parts of her dress as a glove might cling to  let me go and find it for you burnamy entreated  well she consented and she added if the sacristan has found it give him something for me something really handsome poor fellow  as burnamy passed her she let him see that she had both her gloves and her heart yearned upon him for his instant smile of intelligence some men would have blundered out that she had the lost glove in her hand he came back directly saying no he didnt find it  she laughed and held both gloves up no wonder i had it all the time thank you ever so much  how are we going to ride back asked stoller  burnamy almost turned pale miss triscoe smiled impenetrably no one else spoke and mrs march said with placid authority oh i think the way we came is best  did that absurd creature she apostrophized her husband as soon as she got him alone after their arrival at pupps think i was going to let him drive back with agatha  i wonder said march if thats what burnamy calls her now  i shall despise him if it isnt     xxxvii  burnamy took up his mail to stoller after the supper which they had eaten in a silence natural with two men who have been off on a picnic together he did not rise from his writingdesk when burnamy came in and the young man did not sit down after putting his letters before him he said with an effort of forcing himself to speak at once i have looked through the papers and there is something that i think you ought to see  what do you mean said stoller  burnamy laid down three or four papers opened to pages where certain articles were strongly circumscribed in ink the papers varied but their editorials did not in purport at least some were grave and some were gay one indignantly denounced another affected an ironical bewilderment the third simply had fun with the hon jacob stoller they all however treated his letter on the city government of carlsbad as the praise of municipal socialism and the paper which had fun with him gleefully congratulated the dangerous classes on the accession of the honorable jacob to their ranks  stoller read the articles one after another with parted lips and gathering drops of perspiration on his upper lip while burnamy waited on foot he flung the papers all down at last why theyre a pack of fools they dont know what theyre talking about i want city government carried on on business principles by the people for the people i dont care what they say i know im right and im going ahead on this line if it takes all the note of defiance died out of his voice at the sight of burnamys pale face whats the matter with you  theres nothing the matter with me  do you mean to tell me it ishe could not bring himself to use the wordwhat they say  i suppose said burnamy with a dry mouth its what you may call municipal socialism  stoller jumped from his seat and you knew it when you let me do it  i supposed you knew what you were about  its a lie stoller advanced upon him wildly and burnamy took a step backward  look out shouted burnamy you never asked me anything about it you told me what you wanted done and i did it how could i believe you were such an ignoramus as not to know the a b c of the thing you were talking about he added in cynical contempt but you neednt worry you can make it right with the managers by spending a little more money than you expected to spend  stoller started as if the word money reminded him of something i can take care of myself young man how much do i owe you  nothing said burnamy with an effort for grandeur which failed him  the next morning as the marches sat over their coffee at the posthof he came dragging himself toward them with such a haggard air that mrs march called before he reached their table why mr burnamy whats the matter  he smiled miserably oh i havent slept very well may i have my coffee with you i want to tell you something i want you to make me but i cant speak till the coffee comes fraulein he besought a waitress going off with a tray near them tell lili please to bring me some coffeeonly coffee  he tried to make some talk about the weather which was rainy and the marches helped him but the poor endeavor lagged wretchedly in the interval between the ordering and the coming of the coffee ah thank you lili he said with a humility which confirmed mrs march in her instant belief that he had been offering himself to miss triscoe and been rejected after gulping his coffee he turned to her i want to say goodby im going away  from carlsbad asked mrs march with a keen distress  the water came into his eyes dont dont be good to me mrs march i cant stand it but you wont when you know  he began to speak of stoller first to her but addressing himself more and more to the intelligence of march who let him go on without question and laid a restraining hand upon his wife when he saw her about to prompt him at the end thats all he said huskily and then he seemed to be waiting for marchs comment he made none and the young fellow was forced to ask well what do you think mr march  what do you think yourself  i think i behaved badly said burnamy and a movement of protest from mrs march nerved him to add i could make out that it was not my business to tell him what he was doing but i guess it was i guess i ought to have stopped him or given him a chance to stop himself i suppose i might have done it if he had treated me decently when i turned up a day late here or hadnt acted toward me as if i were a hand in his buggyworks that had come in an hour after the whistle sounded  he set his teeth and an indignant sympathy shone in mrs marchs eyes but her husband only looked the more serious  he asked gently do you offer that fact as an explanation or as a justification  burnamy laughed forlornly it certainly wouldnt justify me you might say that it made the case all the worse for me march forbore to say and burnamy went on but i didnt suppose they would be onto him so quick or perhaps at all i thoughtif i thought anythingthat it would amuse some of the fellows in the office who know about those things he paused and in marchs continued silence he went on the chance was one in a hundred that anybody else would know where he had brought up  but you let him take that chance march suggested  yes i let him take it oh you know how mixed all these things are  yes  of course i didnt think it out at the time but i dont deny that i had a satisfaction in the notion of the hornets nest he was poking his thick head into it makes me sick now to think i had i oughtnt to have let him he was perfectly innocent in it after the letter went i wanted to tell him but i couldnt and then i took the chances too i dont believe he could have ever got forward in politics hes too honestor he isnt dishonest in the right way but that doesnt let me out i dont defend myself i did wrong i behaved badly but ive suffered for it  ive had a foreboding all the time that it would come to the worst and felt like a murderer with his victim when ive been alone with stoller when i could get away from him i could shake it off and even believe that it hadnt happened you cant think what a nightmare its been well ive ruined stoller politically but ive ruined myself too ive spoiled my own life ive done what i can never explain toto the people i want to have believe in me ive got to steal away like the thief i am goodby he jumped to his feet and put out his hand to march and then to mrs march  why youre not going away now she cried in a daze  yes i am i shall leave carlsbad on the elevenoclock train i dont think i shall see you again he clung to her hand if you see general triscoei wish youd tell them i couldntthat i had tothat i was called away suddenlygoodby he pressed her hand and dropped it and mixed with the crowd then he came suddenly back with a final appeal to march should youdo you think i ought to see stoller andand tell him i dont think i used him fairly  you ought to know march began  but before he could say more burnamy said youre right and was off again  oh how hard you were with him my dear mrs march lamented  i wish he said if our boy ever went wrong that some one would be as true to him as i was to that poor fellow he condemned himself and he was right he has behaved very badly  you always overdo things so when you act righteously  now isabel  oh yes i know what you will say but i should have tempered justice with mercy  her nerves tingled with pity for burnamy but in her heart she was glad that her husband had had strength to side with him against himself and she was proud of the forbearance with which he had done it in their earlier married life she would have confidently taken the initiative on all moral questions she still believed that she was better fitted for their decision by her puritan tradition and her new england birth but once in a great crisis when it seemed a question of their living she had weakened before it and he with no such advantages had somehow met the issue with courage and conscience she could not believe he did so by inspiration but she had since let him take the brunt of all such issues and the responsibility he made no reply and she said i suppose youll admit now there was always something peculiar in the poor boys manner to stoller  he would confess no more than that there ought to have been i dont see how he could stagger through with that load on his conscience im not sure i like his being able to do so  she was silent in the misgiving which she shared with him but she said i wonder how far it has gone with him and miss triscoe  well from his wanting you to give his message to the general in the plural  dont laugh its wicked to laugh its heartless she cried hysterically what will he do poor fellow  ive an idea that he will light on his feet somehow but at any rate hes doing the right thing in going to own up to stoller  oh stoller i care nothing for stoller dont speak to me of stoller  burnamy fond the bird of prey as he no longer had the heart to call him walking up and down in his room like an eagle caught in a trap he erected his crest fiercely enough though when the young fellow came in at his loudly shouted herein  what do you want he demanded brutally  this simplified burnamys task while it made it more loathsome he answered not much less brutally i want to tell you that i think i used you badly that i let you betray yourself that i feel myself to blame he could have added curse you without change of tone  stoller sneered in a derision that showed his lower teeth like a dogs when he snarls you want to get back  no said burnamy mildly and with increasing sadness as he spoke i dont want to get back nothing would induce me im going away on the first train  well youre not shouted stoller youve lied me into this  look out burnamy turned white  didnt you lie me into it if you let me fool myself as you say stoller pursued and burnamy felt himself weaken through his wrath well then you got to lie me out of it i been going over the damn thing all nightand you can do it for me i know you can do it he gave way in a plea that was almost a whimper look here you see if you cant ill make it all right with you ill pay you whatever you think is rightwhatever you say  oh said burnamy in otherwise unutterable disgust  you kin stoller went on breaking down more and more into his adopted hoosier in the stress of his anxiety i know you kin mr burnamy he pushed the paper containing his letter into burnamys hands and pointed out a succession of marked passages there and here and this place dont you see how you could make out that it meant something else or was just ironical he went on to prove how the text might be given the complexion he wished and burnamy saw that he had really thought it not impossibly out i cant put it in writing as well as you but ive done all the work and all youve got to do is to give it some of them turns of yours ill cable the fellows in our office to say ive been misrepresented and that my correction is coming well get it into shape here together and then ill cable that i dont care for the money and ill get our countingroom to see this scoundrelhe picked up the paper that had had fun with himand fix him all right so that hell ask for a suspension of public opinion andyou see dont you  the thing did appeal to burnamy if it could be done it would enable him to make stoller the reparation he longed to make him more than anything else in the world but he heard himself saying very gently almost tenderly it might be done mr stoller but i couldnt do it it wouldnt be honestfor me  yah yelled stoller and he crushed the paper into a wad and flung it into burnamys face honest you damn humbug you let me in for this when you knew i didnt mean it and now you wont help me out because it ant honest get out of my room and get out quick before i  he hurled himself toward burnamy who straightened himself with if you dare he knew that he was right in refusing but he knew that stoller was right too and that he had not meant the logic of what he had said in his letter and of what burnamy had let him imply he braved stollers onset and he left his presence untouched but feeling as little a moral hero as he well could     xxxviii  general triscoe woke in the bad humor of an elderly man after a days pleasure and in the selfreproach of a pessimist who has lost his point of view for a time and has to work back to it he began at the belated breakfast with his daughter when she said after kissing him gayly in the small twoseated bower where they breakfasted at their hotel when they did not go to the posthof didnt you have a nice time yesterday papa  she sank into the chair opposite and beamed at him across the little iron table as she lifted the pot to pour out his coffee  what do you call a nice time he temporized not quite able to resist her gayety  well the kind of time i had  did you get rheumatism from sitting on the grass i took cold in that old church and the tea at that restaurant must have been brewed in a brass kettle i suffered all night from it and that ass from illinois  oh poor papa i couldnt go with mr stoller alone but i might have gone in the twospanner with him and let you have mr or mrs march in the onespanner  i dont know their interest in each other isnt so interesting to other people as they seem to think  do you feel that way really papa dont you like their being so much in love still  at their time of life thank you its bad enough in young people  the girl did not answer she appeared altogether occupied in pouring out her fathers coffee  he tasted it and then he drank pretty well all of it but he said as he put his cup down i dont know what they make this stuff of i wish i had a cup of good honest american coffee  oh theres nothing like american food said his daughter with so much conciliation that he looked up sharply  but whatever he might have been going to say was at least postponed by the approach of a servingmaid who brought a note to his daughter she blushed a little at sight of it and then tore it open and read  i am going away from carlsbad for a fault of my own which forbids me to look you in the face if you wish to know the worst of me ask mrs march i have no heart to tell you  agatha read these mystifying words of burnamys several times over in a silent absorption with them which left her father to look after himself and he had poured out a second cup of coffee with his own hand and was reaching for the bread beside her before she came slowly back to a sense of his presence  oh excuse me papa she said and she gave him the butter heres a very strange letter from mr burnamy which i think youd better see she held the note across the table to him and watched his face as he read it  after he had read it twice he turned the sheet over as people do with letters that puzzle them in the vain hope of something explanatory on the back then he looked up and asked what do you suppose hes been doing  i dont believe hes been doing anything its something that mr stollers been doing to him  i shouldnt infer that from his own words what makes you think the trouble is with stoller  he saidhe said yesterdaysomething about being glad to be through with him because he disliked him so much he was always afraid of wronging him and that proves that now mr stoller has made him believe that hes done wrong and has worked upon him till he does believe it  it proves nothing of the kind said the general recurring to the note after reading it again he looked keenly at her am i to understand that you have given him the right to suppose you would want to know the worstor the best of him  the girls eyes fell and she pushed her knife against her plate she began no  then confound his impudence the general broke out what business has he to write to you at all about this  because he couldnt go away without it she returned and she met her fathers eye courageously he had a right to think we were his friends and if he has done wrong or is in disgrace any way isnt it manly of him to wish to tell us first himself  her father could not say that it was not but he could and did say very sceptically stuff now see here agatha what are you going to do  im going to see mrs march and then  you mustnt do anything of the kind my dear said her father gently youve no right to give yourself away to that romantic old goose he put up his hand to interrupt her protest this thing has got to be gone to the bottom of but youre not to do it i will see march myself we must consider your dignity in this matterand mine and you may as well understand that im not going to have any nonsense its got to be managed so that it cant be supposed were anxious about it one way or the other or that he was authorized to write to you in this way  no no he oughtnt to have done so he was to blame he couldnt have written to you though papa  well i dont know why but thats no reason why we should let it be understood that he has written to you i will see march and i will manage to see his wife too i shall probably find them in the readingroom at pupps and  the marches were in fact just coming in from their breakfast at the posthof and he met them at the door of pupps where they all sat down on one of the iron settees of the piazza and began to ask one another questions of their minds about the pleasure of the day before and to beat about the bush where burnamy lurked in their common consciousness  mrs march was not able to keep long from starting him you knew she said that mr burnamy had left us  left why asked the general  she was a woman of resource but in a case like this she found it best to trust her husbands poverty of invention she looked at him and he answered for her with a promptness that made her quake at first but finally seemed the only thing if not the best thing hes had some trouble with stoller he went on to tell the general just what the trouble was  at the end the general grunted as from an uncertain mind you think hes behaved badly  i think hes behaved foolishlyyouthfully but i can understand how strongly he was tempted he could say that he was not authorized to stop stoller in his mad career  at this mrs march put her hand through her husbands arm  im not so sure about that said the general  march added since i saw him this morning ive heard something that disposes me to look at his performance in a friendlier light its something that stoller told me himself to heighten my sense of burnamys wickedness he seems to have felt that i ought to know what a serpent i was cherishing in my bosom and he gave triscoe the facts of burnamys injurious refusal to help stoller put a false complexion on the opinions he had allowed him ignorantly to express  the general grunted again of course he had to refuse and he has behaved like a gentleman so far but that doesnt justify him in having let stoller get himself into the scrape  no said march its a tough nut for the casuist to try his tooth on and i must say i feel sorry for stoller  mrs march plucked her hand from his arm i dont one bit he was thoroughly selfish from first to last he has got just what he deserved  ah very likely said her husband the question is about burnamys part in giving him his deserts he had to leave him to them of course  the general fixed her with the impenetrable glitter of his eyeglasses and left the subject as of no concern to him i believe he said rising ill have a look at some of your papers and he went into the readingroom  now said mrs march he will go home and poison that poor girls mind and you will have yourself to thank for prejudicing him against burnamy  then why didnt you do it yourself my dear he teased but he was really too sorry for the whole affair which he nevertheless enjoyed as an ethical problem  the general looked so little at the papers that before march went off for his morning walk he saw him come out of the readingroom and take his way down the alte wiese he went directly back to his daughter and reported burnamys behavior with entire exactness he dwelt upon his making the best of a bad business in refusing to help stoller out of it dishonorably and mendaciously but he did not conceal that it was a bad business  now you know all about it he said at the end and i leave the whole thing to you if you prefer you can see mrs march i dont know but id rather youd satisfy yourself  i will not see mrs march do you think i would go back of you in that way i am satisfied now     xxxix  instead of burnamy mrs adding and her son now breakfasted with the marches at the posthof and the boy was with march throughout the day a good deal he rectified his impressions of life in carlsbad by marchs greater wisdom and experience and did his best to anticipate his opinions and conform to his conclusions this was not easy for sometimes he could not conceal from himself that marchs opinions were whimsical and his conclusions fantastic and he could not always conceal from march that he was matching them with kenbys on some points and suffering from their divergence he came to join the sage in his early visit to the springs and they walked up and down talking and they went off together on long strolls in which rose was proud to bear him company he was patient of the absences from which he was often answered and he learned to distinguish between the earnest and the irony of which marchs replies seemed to be mixed he examined him upon many features of german civilization but chiefly upon the treatment of women in it and upon this his philosopher was less satisfactory than he could have wished him to be he tried to excuse his trifling as an escape from the painful stress of questions which he found so afflicting himself but in the matter of the womananddog teams this was not easy march owned that the notion of their being yokemates was shocking but he urged that it was a stage of evolution and a distinct advance upon the time when women dragged the carts without the help of the dogs and that the time might not be far distant when the dogs would drag the carts without the help of the women  rose surmised a joke and he tried to enjoy it but inwardly he was troubled by his friends apparent acceptance of unjust things on their picturesque side once as they were sauntering homeward by the brink of the turbid eger they came to a man lying on the grass with a pipe in his mouth and lazily watching from under his fallen lids the cows grazing by the riverside while in a field of scraggy wheat a file of women were reaping a belated harvest with sickles bending wearily over to clutch the stems together and cut them with their hooked blades ah delightful march took off his hat as if to salute the pleasant sight  but dont you think mr march the boy ventured that the man had better be cutting the wheat and letting the women watch the cows  well i dont know there are more of them and he wouldnt be half so graceful as they are with that flow of their garments and the sway of their aching backs the boy smiled sadly and march put his hand on his shoulder as they walked on you find a lot of things in europe that need putting right dont you rose  yes i know its silly  well im not sure but im afraid its useless you see these old customs go such a way back and are so grounded in conditions we think they might be changed if those who rule could be got to see how cruel and ugly they are but probably they couldnt im afraid that the emperor of austria himself couldnt change them in his sovereign plenitude of power the emperor is only an old custom too and hes as much grounded in the conditions as any this was the serious way rose felt that march ought always to talk and he was too much grieved to laugh when he went on the women have so much of the hard work to do over here because the emperors need the men for their armies they couldnt let their men cut wheat unless it was for their officers horses in the field of some peasant whom it would ruin  if mrs march was by she would not allow him to work these paradoxes for the boys confusion she said the child adored him and it was a sacrilege to play with his veneration she always interfered to save him but with so little logic though so much justice that rose suffered a humiliation from her championship and was obliged from a sense of selfrespect to side with the mocker she understood this and magnanimously urged it as another reason why her husband should not trifle with roses ideal of him to make his mother laugh at him was wicked  oh im not his only ideal march protested he adores kenby too and every now and then he brings me to book with a text from kenbys gospel  mrs march caught her breath kenby do you really think then that she  oh hold on now it isnt a question of mrs adding and i dont say rose had an eye on poor old kenby as a stepfather i merely want you to understand that im the object of a divided worship and that when im off duty as an ideal i dont see why i shouldnt have the fun of making mrs adding laugh you cant pretend she isnt wrapped up in the boy youve said that yourself  yes shes wrapped up in him shed give her life for him but she is so light i didnt suppose she was so light but its borne in upon me more and more  they were constantly seeing rose and his mother in the sort of abeyance the triscoes had fallen into one afternoon the addings came to mrs marchs room to look from her windows at a parade of bicyclers clubs from the neighboring towns the spectacle prospered through its first halfhour with the charm which german sentiment and ingenuity are able to lend even a bicycle parade the wheelmen and wheelwomen filed by on machines wreathed with flowers and ribbons and decked with streaming banners here and there one sat under a moving arch of blossoms or in a bower of leaves and petals and they were all gay with their club costumes and insignia in the height of the display a sudden mountain shower gathered and broke upon them they braved it till it became a drenching downpour then they leaped from their machines and fled to any shelter they could find under trees and in doorways the men used their greater agility to get the best places and kept them the women made no appeal for them by word or look but took the rain in the open as if they expected nothing else  rose watched the scene with a silent intensity which march interpreted theres your chance rose why dont you go down and rebuke those fellows  rose blushed and shrank away without answer and mrs march promptly attacked her husband in his behalf why dont you go and rebuke them yourself  well for one thing there isnt any conversation in my phrasebook between an indignant american herr and a party of german wheelmen who have taken shelter from the rain and are keeping the wheelwomen out in the wet mrs adding shrieked her delight and he was flattered into going on for another thing i think its very well for you ladies to realize from an objectlesson of this sort what spoiled children of our civilization you are it ought to make you grateful for your privileges  there is something in that mrs adding joyfully consented  oh there is no civilization but ours said mrs march in a burst of vindictive patriotism i am more and more convinced of it the longer i stay in europe  perhaps thats why we like to stay so long in europe it strengthens us in the conviction that america is the only civilized country in the world said march  the shower passed as quickly as it had gathered and the band which it had silenced for a moment burst forth again in the music which fills the carlsbad day from dawn till dusk just now it began to play a pot pourri of american airs at the end some unseen americans under the trees below clapped and cheered  that was opportune of the band said march it must have been a telepathic impulse from our patriotism in the director but a pot pourri of american airs is like that tablet dedicating the american park up here on the schlossberg which is signed by six jews and one irishman the only thing in this medley thats the least characteristic or original is dixie and im glad the south has brought us back into the union  you dont know one note from another my dear said his wife  i know the washington post  and dont you call that american  yes if sousa is an american name i should have thought it was portuguese  now that sounds a little too much like general triscoes pessimism said mrs march and she added but whether we have any national melodies or not we dont poke women out in the rain and keep them soaking  no we certainly dont he assented with such a wellstudied effect of yielding to superior logic that mrs adding screamed for joy  the boy had stolen out of the room and he said i hope rose isnt acting on my suggestion  i hate to have you tease him dearest his wife interposed  oh no the mother said laughing still but with a note of tenderness in her laugh which dropped at last to a sigh hes too much afraid of lesemajesty for that but i dare say he couldnt stand the sight hes queer  hes beautiful said mrs march  hes good the mother admitted as good as the days long hes never given me a moments troublebut he troubles me if you can understand  oh i do understand mrs march returned by his innocence you mean that is the worst of children their innocence breaks our hearts and makes us feel ourselves such dreadful old things  his innocence yes pursued mrs adding and his ideals she began to laugh again he may have gone off for a season of meditation and prayer over the misbehavior of these bicyclers his mind is turning that way a good deal lately its only fair to tell you mr march that he seems to be giving up his notion of being an editor you mustnt be disappointed  i shall be sorry said the editor but now that you mention it i think i have noticed that rose seems rather more indifferent to periodical literature i supposed he might simply have exhausted his questionsor my answers  no it goes deeper than that i think its europe thats turned his mind in the direction of reform at any rate he thinks now he will be a reformer  really what kind of one not religious i hope  no his reform has a religious basis but its objects are social i dont make it out exactly but i shall as soon as rose does he tells me everything and sometimes i dont feel equal to it spiritually or even intellectually  dont laugh at him mrs adding mrs march entreated  oh he doesnt mind my laughing said the mother gayly rose came shyly back into the room and she said well did you rebuke those bad bicyclers and she laughed again  theyre only a custom too rose said march tenderly like the man resting while the women worked and the emperor and all the rest of it  oh yes i know the boy returned  they ride modern machines but they live in the tenth century thats what were always forgetting when we come to europe and see these barbarians enjoying all our uptodate improvements  there doesnt that console you asked his mother and she took him away with her laughing back from the door i dont believe it does a bit  i dont believe she understands the child said mrs march she is very light dont you think i dont know after all whether it wouldnt be a good thing for her to marry kenby she is very easygoing and she will be sure to marry somebody  she had fallen into a tone of musing censure and he said you might put these ideas to her     xl  with the passage of the days and weeks the strange faces which had familiarized themselves at the springs disappeared even some of those which had become the faces of acquaintance began to go in the diminishing crowd the smile of otterson was no longer to be seen the sad severe visage of major eltwin who seemed never to have quite got his bearings after his error with general triscoe seldom showed itself the triscoes themselves kept out of the marches way or they fancied so mrs adding and rose alone remained of their daily encounter  it was full summer as it is everywhere in midaugust but at carlsbad the sun was so late getting up over the hills that as people went to their breakfasts at the cafes up the valley of the tepl they found him looking very obliquely into it at eight oclock in the morning the yellow leaves were thicker about the feet of the trees and the grass was silvery gray with the belated dews the breakfasters were fewer than they had been and there were more little barefooted boys and girls with cups of red raspberries which they offered to the passers with cries of himbeeren himbeeren plaintive as the notes of birds left songless by the receding summer  march was forbidden the fruit but his wife and mrs adding bought recklessly of it and ate it under his eyes with their coffee and bread pouring over it pots of clotted cream that the schone lili brought them rose pretended an indifference to it which his mother betrayed was a sacrifice in behalf of marchs inability  lilis delays in coming to be paid had been such that the marches now tried to pay her when she brought their breakfast but they sometimes forgot and then they caught her whenever she came near them in this event she liked to coquet with their impatience she would lean against their table and say oh no you stay a little it is so nice one day after such an entreaty she said the queen is here this morning  mrs march started in the hope of highhotes the queen  yes the young lady mr burnamy was saying she was a queen she is there with her father she nodded in the direction of a distant corner and the marches knew that she meant miss triscoe and the general she is not seeming so gayly as she was being  march smiled we are none of us so gayly as we were being lili the summer is going  but mr burnamy will be returning not true the girl asked resting her tray on the corner of the table  no im afraid he wont march returned sadly  he was very good he was paying the proprietor for the dishes that augusta did break when she was falling down he was paying before he went away when he was knowing that the proprietor would make augusta to pay  ah said march and his wife said that was like him and she eagerly explained to mrs adding how good and great burnamy had been in this characteristic instance while lili waited with the tray to add some pathetic facts about augustas poverty and gratitude i think miss triscoe ought to know it there goes the wretch now she broke off dont look at him she set her husband the example of averting his face from the sight of stoller sullenly pacing up the middle aisle of the grove and looking to the right and left for a vacant table ugh i hope he wont be able to find a single place  mrs adding gave one of her pealing laughs while rose watched marchs face with grave sympathy he certainly doesnt deserve one dont let us keep you from offering miss triscoe any consolation you can they got up and the boy gathered up the gloves umbrella and handkerchief which the ladies let drop from their laps  have you been telling march asked his wife  have i told you anything she demanded of mrs adding in turn anything that you didnt as good as know already  not a syllable mrs adding replied in high delight come rose  well i suppose theres no use saying anything said march after she left them  she had guessed everything without my telling her said his wife  about stoller  wellno i did tell her that part but that was nothing it was about burnamy and agatha that she knew she saw it from the first  i should have thought she would have enough to do to look after poor old kenby  im not sure after all that she cares for him if she doesnt she oughtnt to let him write to her arent you going over to speak to the triscoes  no certainly not im going back to the hotel there ought to be some steamer letters this morning here we are worrying about these strangers all the time and we never give a thought to our own children on the other side of the ocean  i worry about them too said the mother fondly though there is nothing to worry about she added  its our duty to worry he insisted  at the hotel the portier gave them four letters there was one from each of their children one very buoyant not to say boisterous from the daughter celebrating her happiness in her husband and the loveliness of chicago as a summer city you would think she was born out there sighed her mother and one from the son boasting his wellbeing in spite of the heat they were having and just think how cool it is here his mother upbraided herself and the prosperity of every other week there was a line from fulkerson praising the boys editorial instinct and ironically proposing marchs resignation in his favor  i do believe we could stay all winter just as well as not said mrs march proudly what does burnamy say  how do you know its from him  because youve been keeping your hand on it give it here  when ive read it  the letter was dated at ansbach in germany and dealt except for some messages of affection to mrs march with a scheme for a paper which burnamy wished to write on kaspar hauser if march thought he could use it in every other week he had come upon a book about that hapless foundling in nuremberg and after looking up all his traces there he had gone on to ansbach where kaspar hauser met his death so pathetically burnamy said he could not give any notion of the enchantment of nuremberg but he besought march if he was going to the tyrol for his aftercure not to fail staying a day or so in the wonderful place he thought march would enjoy ansbach too in its way  and not a wordnot a syllableabout miss triscoe cried mrs march shall you take his paper  it would be serving him right if i refused it wouldnt it  they never knew what it cost burnamy to keep her name out of his letter or by what an effort of the will he forbade himself even to tell of his parting interview with stoller he had recovered from his remorse for letting stoller give himself away he was still sorry for that but he no longer suffered yet he had not reached the psychological moment when he could celebrate his final virtue in the matter he was glad he had been able to hold out against the temptation to retrieve himself by another wrong but he was humbly glad and he felt that until happier chance brought him and his friends together he must leave them to their merciful conjectures he was young and he took the chance with an aching heart if he had been older he might not have taken it     xli  the birthday of the emperor comes conveniently in late august in the good weather which is pretty sure to fall then if ever in the austrian summer for a week past at carlsbad the workmen had been building a scaffolding for the illumination in the woods on a height overlooking the town and making unobtrusive preparations at points within it  the day was important as the last of marchs cure and its pleasures began for him by a renewal of his acquaintance in its first kindliness with the eltwins he had met them so seldom that at one time he thought they must have gone away but now after his first cup he saw the quiet sad old pair sitting together on a bench in the stadt park and he asked leave to sit down with them till it was time for the next eltwin said that this was their last day too and explained that his wife always came with him to the springs while he took the waters  well he apologized were all thats left and i suppose we like to keep together he paused and at the look in marchs face he suddenly went on i havent been well for three or four years but i always fought against coming out here when the doctors wanted me to i said i couldnt leave home and i dont suppose i ever should but my home left me  as he spoke his wife shrank tenderly near him and march saw her steal her withered hand into his  wed had a large family but theyd all died off with one thing or another and here in the spring we lost our last daughter seemed perfectly well and all at once she died heartfailure they called it it broke me up and mother here got at me to go and so were here his voice trembled and his eyes softened then they flashed up and march heard him add in a tone that astonished him less when he looked round and saw general triscoe advancing toward them i dont know what it is always makes me want to kick that man  the general lifted his hat to their group and hoped that mrs eltwin was well and major eltwin better he did not notice their replies but said to march the ladies are waiting for you in pupps readingroom to go with them to the posthof for breakfast  arent you going too asked march  no thank you said the general as if it were much finer not i shall breakfast at our pension he strolled off with the air of a man who has done more than his duty  i dont suppose i ought to feel that way said eltwin with a remorse which march suspected a reproachful pressure of his wifes hand had prompted in him i reckon he means well  well i dont know march said with a candor he could not wholly excuse  on his way to the hotel he fancied mocking his wife for her interest in the romantic woes of her lovers in a world where there was such real pathos as these poor old peoples but in the company of miss triscoe he could not give himself this pleasure he tried to amuse her on the way from pupps with the doubt he always felt in passing the cafe sanssouci whether he should live to reach the posthof where he meant to breakfast she said poor mr march and laughed inattentively when he went on to philosophize the commonness of the sparse company always observable at the sanssouci as a just effect of its laodicean situation between pupps and the posthof the girl sighed absently and his wife frowned at him  the flowerwoman at the gate of her garden had now only autumnal blooms for sale in the vases which flanked the entrance the windrows of the rowen left steeping in the dews overnight exhaled a faint fragrance a poor remnant of the midsummer multitudes trailed itself along to the various cafes of the valley its pink paper bags of bread rustling like sere foliage as it moved  at the posthof the schone lili alone was as gay as in the prime of july she played archly about the guests she welcomed to a table in a sunny spot in the gallery you are tired of carlsbad she said caressingly to miss triscoe as she put her breakfast before her  not of the posthof said the girl listlessly  posthof and very little lili she showed with one forefinger on another how very little she was  miss triscoe laughed not cheerily and lili said to mrs march with abrupt seriousness augusta was finding a handkerchief under the table and she was washing it and ironing it before she did bring it i have scolded her and i have made her give it to me  she took from under her apron a mans handkerchief which she offered to mrs march it bore as she saw miss triscoe saw the initials l j b but whose can it be they asked each other  why burnamys said march and lilis eyes danced give it here  his wife caught it farther away no im going to see whose it is first if its his ill send it to him myself  she tried to put it into the pocket which was not in her dress by sliding it down her lap then she handed it to the girl who took it with a careless air but kept it after a like failure to pocket it  mrs march had come out in her indiarubber sandals but for once in carlsbad the weather was too dry for them and she had taken them off and was holding them in her lap they fell to the ground when she now rose from breakfast and she stooped to pick them up miss triscoe was too quick for her  oh let me carry them for you she entreated and after a tender struggle she succeed in enslaving herself to them and went away wearing them through the heelbands like manacles on her wrist she was not the kind of girl to offer such pretty devotions and mrs march was not the kind of woman to suffer them but they played the comedy through and let march go off for his last hillclimb with the promise to meet him in the stadt park when he came to the kurhaus for his last mineral bath  mrs march in the mean time went about some final shopping and invited the girls advice with a fondness which did not prevent her rejecting it in every case with miss triscoes eager approval in the stadt park they sat down and talked from time to time mrs march made polite feints of recovering her sandals but the girl kept them with increased effusion  when they rose and strolled away from the bench where they had been sitting they seemed to be followed they looked round and saw no one more alarming than a very severelooking old gentleman whose hat brim in spite of his severity was limp with much lifting as all austrian hat brims are he touched it and saying haughtily in german something left lying passed on  they stared at each other then as women do they glanced down at their skirts to see if there was anything amiss with them and miss triscoe perceived her hands empty of mrs marchs sandals and of burnamys handkerchief  oh i put it in one of the toes she lamented and she fled back to their bench alarming in her course the fears of a gendarme for the public security and putting a baby in its nurses arms into such doubts of its personal safety that it burst into a desolate cry she laughed breathlessly as she rejoined mrs march that comes of having no pocket i didnt suppose i could forget your sandals mrs march wasnt it absurd  its one of those things mrs march said to her husband afterwards that they can always laugh over together  they and what about burnamys behavior to stoller  oh i dont call that anything but what will come right of course he can make it up to him somehow and i regard his refusal to do wrong when stoller wanted him to as quite wiping out the first offence  well my dear you have burnt your ships behind you my only hope is that when we leave here tomorrow her pessimistic papas poison will neutralize yours somehow     xlii  one of the pleasantest incidents of marchs sojourn in carlsbad was his introduction to the manager of the municipal theatre by a common friend who explained the editor in such terms to the manager that he conceived of him as a brother artist this led to much bowing and smiling from the manager when the marches met him in the street or in their frequent visits to the theatre with which march felt that it might well have ended and still been far beyond his desert he had not thought of going to the opera on the emperors birthnight but after dinner a box came from the manager and mrs march agreed with him that they could not in decency accept so great a favor at the same time she argued that they could not in decency refuse it and that to show their sense of the pleasure done them they must adorn their box with all the beauty and distinction possible in other words she said they must ask miss triscoe and her father  and why not major eltwin and his wife or mrs adding and rose  she begged him simply in his own interest not to be foolish and they went early so as to be in their box when their guests came the foyer of the theatre was banked with flowers and against a curtain of evergreens stood a highpedestalled bust of the paternal caesar with whose sidewhiskers a laurel crown comported itself as well as it could at the foot of the grand staircase leading to the boxes the manager stood in evening dress receiving his friends and their felicitations upon the honor which the theatre was sure to do itself on an occasion so august the marches were so cordial in their prophecies that the manager yielded to an artists impulse and begged his fellowartist to do him the pleasure of coming behind the scenes between the acts of the opera he bowed a heartfelt regret to mrs march that he could not make the invitation include her and hoped that she would not be too lonely while her husband was gone  she explained that they had asked friends and she should not be alone and then he entreated march to bring any gentleman who was his guest with him on the way up to their box she pressed his arm as she used in their young married days and asked him if it was not perfect i wish we were going to have it all to ourselves no one else can appreciate the whole situation do you think we have made a mistake in having the triscoes  we he retorted oh thats good im going to shirk him when it comes to going behind the scenes  no no dearest she entreated snubbing will only make it worse we must stand it to the bitter end now  the curtain rose upon another laurelled bust of the emperor with a chorus of men formed on either side who broke into the grave and noble strains of the austrian hymn while every one stood then the curtain fell again and in the interval before the opera could begin general triscoe and his daughter came in  mrs march took the splendor in which the girl appeared as a tribute to her hospitality she had hitherto been a little disappointed of the open homage to american girlhood which her readings of international romance had taught her to expect in europe but now her patriotic vanity feasted full fat highhotes of her own sex levelled their lorgnettes at miss triscoe all around the horseshoe with critical glances which fell blunted from her complexion and costume the house was brilliant with the military uniforms which we have not yet to mingle with our unrivalled millinery and the ardent gaze of the young officers dwelt on the perfect mould of her girlish arms and neck and the winning lines of her face the girls eyes shone with a joyful excitement and her little head defined by its dark hair trembled as she slowly turned it from side to side after she removed the airy scarf which had covered it her father in evening dress looked the third emperor complaisant to a civil occasion and took a chair in the front of the box without resistance and the ladies disputed which should yield the best place to the other till miss triscoe forced mrs march fondly into it for the first act at least  the piece had to be cut a good deal to give people time for the illuminations afterwards but as it was it gave scope to the actress who als gast from a viennese theatre was the chief figure in it she merited the distinction by the art which still lingered deeply embedded in her massive balk but never wholly obscured  that is grand isnt it said march following one of the tremendous strokes by which she overcame her physical disadvantages its fine to see how her art can undo for one splendid instant the work of all those steins of beer those illimitable licks of sausage those boundless fields of cabbage but its rather pathetic  its disgusting said his wife and at this general triscoe who had been watching the actress through his lorgnette said as if his contrarymindedness were irresistibly invoked  well i dont know its amusing do you suppose we shall see her when we go behind march  he still professed a desire to do so when the curtain fell and they hurried to the rear door of the theatre it was slightly ajar and they pulled it wide open with the eagerness of their age and nation and began to mount the stairs leading up from it between rows of painted dancinggirls who had come out for a breath of air and who pressed themselves against the walls to make room for the intruders with their rouged faces and the stare of their glassy eyes intensified by the coloring of their brows and lashes they were like painted statues as they stood there with their crimsoned lips parted in astonished smiles  this is rather weird said march faltering at the sight i wonder if we might ask these young ladies where to go general triscoe made no answer and was apparently no more prepared than himself to accost the files of danseuses when they were themselves accosted by an angry voice from the head of the stairs with a demand for their business the voice belonged to a gendarme who descended toward them and seemed as deeply scandalized at their appearance as they could have been at that of the young ladies  march explained in his ineffective german with every effect of improbability that they were there by appointment of the manager and wished to find his room  the gendarme would not or could not make anything out of it he pressed down upon them and laying a rude hand on a shoulder of either began to force them back to the door the mild nature of the editor might have yielded to his violence but the martial spirit of general triscoe was roused he shrugged the gendarmes hand from his shoulder and with a voice as furious as his own required him in english to say what the devil he meant the gendarme rejoined with equal heat in german the generals tone rose in anger the dancinggirls emitted some little shrieks of alarm and fled noisily up the stairs from time to time march interposed with a word of the german which had mostly deserted him in his hour of need but if it had been a flow of intelligible expostulation it would have had no effect upon the disputants they grew more outrageous till the manager himself appeared at the head of the stairs and extended an arresting hand over the hubbub as soon as the situation clarified itself he hurried down to his visitors with a polite roar of apology and rescued them from the gendarme and led them up to his room and forced them into armchairs with a rapidity of reparation which did not exhaust itself till he had entreated them with every circumstance of civility to excuse an incident so mortifying to him but with all his haste he lost so much time in this that he had little left to show them through the theatre and their presentation to the prima donna was reduced to the obeisances with which they met and parted as she went upon the stage at the lifting of the curtain in the lack of a common language this was perhaps as well as a longer interview and nothing could have been more honorable than their dismissal at the hands of the gendarme who had received them so stormily he opened the door for them and stood with his fingers to his cap saluting in the effect of being a whole file of grenadiers     xliii  at the same moment burnamy bowed himself out of the box where he had been sitting with the ladies during the absence of the gentlemen he had knocked at the door almost as soon as they disappeared and if he did not fully share the consternation which his presence caused he looked so frightened that mrs march reserved the censure which the sight of him inspired and in default of other inspiration treated his coming simply as a surprise she shook hands with him and then she asked him to sit down and listened to his explanation that he had come back to carlsbad to write up the birthnight festivities on an order from the parisnew york chronicle that he had seen them in the box and had ventured to took in he was pale and so discomposed that the heart of justice was softened more and more in mrs marchs breast and she left him to the talk that sprang up by an admirable effect of tact in the young lady between him and miss triscoe  after all she decided there was nothing criminal in his being in carlsbad and possibly in the last analysis there was nothing so very wicked in his being in her box one might say that it was not very nice of him after he had gone away under such a cloud but on the other hand it was nice though in a different way if he longed so much to see miss triscoe that he could not help coming it was altogether in his favor that he was so agitated though he was momently becoming less agitated the young people were beginning to laugh at the notion of mr march and general triscoe going behind the scenes burnamy said he envied them the chance and added not very relevantly that he had come from baireuth where he had seen the last of the wagner performances he said he was going back to baireuth but not to ansbach again where he had finished looking up that kaspar hauser business he seemed to think mrs march would know about it and she could not help saying oh yes mr march was so much interested she wondered if she ought to tell him about his handkerchief but she remembered in time that she had left it in miss triscoes keeping she wondered if the girl realized how handsome he was he was extremely handsome in his black evening dress with his tuxedo and the pallor of his face repeated in his expanse of shirt front  at the bell for the rising of the curtain he rose too and took their offered hands in offering hers mrs march asked if he would not stay and speak with mr march and the general and now for the first time he recognized anything clandestine in his visit he laughed nervously and said no thank you and shut himself out  we must tell them said mrs march rather interrogatively and she was glad that the girl answered with a note of indignation  why certainly mrs march  they could not tell them at once for the second act had begun when march and the general came back and after the opera was over and they got out into the crowded street there was no chance for the general was obliged to offer his arm to mrs march while her husband followed with his daughter  the facades of the theatre and of the hotels were outlined with thickly set little lamps which beaded the arches of the bridges spanning the tepl and lighted the casements and portals of the shops high above all against the curtain of black woodland on the mountain where its skeleton had been growing for days glittered the colossal effigy of the doubleheaded eagle of austria crowned with the tiara of the holy roman empire in the reflected splendor of its myriad lamps the pale christ looked down from the mountain opposite upon the surging multitudes in the streets and on the bridges  they were most amiable multitudes march thought and they responded docilely to the entreaties of the policemen who stood on the steps of the bridges and divided their encountering currents with patient appeals of bitte schon bitte schon he laughed to think of a new york cop saying please prettily please prettily to a new york crowd which he wished to have go this way or that and then he burned with shame to think how far our manners were from civilization wherever our heads and hearts might be when he heard a voice at his elbow  a punch with a club would start some of these fellows along quicker  it was stoller and march turned from him to lose his disgust in the sudden terror of perceiving that miss triscoe was no longer at his side neither could he see his wife and general triscoe and he began to push frantically about in the crowd looking for the girl he had an interminable five or ten minutes in his vain search and he was going to call out to her by name when burnamy saved him from the hopeless absurdity by elbowing his way to him with miss triscoe on his arm  here she is mr march he said as if there were nothing strange in his having been there to find her in fact he had followed them all from the theatre and at the moment he saw the party separated and miss triscoe carried off helpless in the human stream had plunged in and rescued her before march could formulate any question in his bewilderment burnamy was gone again the girl offered no explanation for him and march had not yet decided to ask any when he caught sight of his wife and general triscoe standing tiptoe in a doorway and craning their necks upward and forward to scan the crowd in search of him and his charge then he looked round at her and opened his lips to express the astonishment that filled him when he was aware of an ominous shining of her eyes and trembling of her hand on his arm  she pressed his arm nervously and he understood her to beg him to forbear at once all question of her and all comment on burnamys presence to her father  it would not have been just the time for either not only mrs march was with the general but mrs adding also she had called to them from that place where she was safe with rose when she saw them eddying about in the crowd the general was still expressing a gratitude which became more pressing the more it was disclaimed he said casually at sight of his daughter ah youve found us have you and went on talking to mrs adding who nodded to them laughingly and asked did you see me beckoning  look here my dear march said to his wife as soon as they parted from the rest the general gallantly promising that his daughter and he would see mrs adding safe to her hotel and were making their way slowly home alone did you know that burnamy was in carlsbad  hes going away on the twelveoclock train tonight she answered firmly  what has that got to do with it where did you see him  in the box while you were behind the scenes  she told him all about it and he listened in silent endeavor for the ground of censure from which a sense of his own guilt forced him she asked suddenly where did you see him and he told her in turn  he added severely her father ought to know why didnt you tell him  why didnt you she retorted with great reason  because i didnt think he was just in the humor for it he began to laugh as he sketched their encounter with the gendarme but she did not seem to think it amusing and he became serious again besides i was afraid she was going to blubber any way  she wouldnt have blubbered as you call it i dont know why you need be so disgusting it would have given her just the moral support she needed now she will have to tell him herself and he will blame us you ought to have spoken you could have done it easily and naturally when you came up with her you will have yourself to thank for all the trouble that comes of it now my dear  he shouted in admiration of her skill in shifting the blame on him all right i should have had to stand it even if you hadnt behaved with angelic wisdom  why she said after reflection i dont see what either of us has done we didnt get burnamy to come here or connive at his presence in any way  oh make triscoe believe that he knows youve done all you could to help the affair on  well what if i have he began making up to mrs adding himself as soon as he saw her tonight she looked very pretty  well thank heaven were off tomorrow morning and i hope weve seen the last of them theyve done what they could to spoil my cure but im not going to have them spoil my aftercure     xliv  mrs march had decided not to go to the posthof for breakfast where they had already taken a lavish leave of the schone lili with a sense of being promptly superseded in her affections they found a place in the redtablecloth end of the pavilion at pupps and were served by the pretty girl with the rosebud mouth whom they had known only as einundzwanzig and whose promise of komm gleich bitte schon was like a birds note never had the coffee been so good the bread so aerially light the westphalian ham so tenderly pink a young married couple whom they knew came by arm in arm in their morning walk and sat down with them like their own youth for a moment  if you had told them we were going dear said mrs march when the couple were themselves gone we should have been as old as ever dont let us tell anybody this morning that were going i couldnt bear it  they had been obliged to take the secretary of the hotel into their confidence in the process of paying their bill he put on his high hat and came out to see them off the portier was already there standing at the step of the lordly twospanner which they had ordered for the long drive to the station the swiss elevatorman came to the door to offer them a fellowrepublicans good wishes for their journey herr pupp himself appeared at the last moment to hope for their return another summer mrs march bent a last look of interest upon the proprietor as their twospanner whirled away  they say that he is going to be made a count  well i dont object said march a man who can feed fourteen thousand people mostly germans in a day ought to be made an archduke  at the station something happened which touched them even more than these last attentions of the hotel they were in their compartment and were in the act of possessing themselves of the best places by putting their bundles and bags on them when they heard mrs marchs name called  they turned and saw rose adding at the door his thin face flushed with excitement and his eyes glowing i was afraid i shouldnt get here in time he panted and he held up to her a huge bunch of flowers  why rose from your mother  from me he said timidly and he was slipping out into the corridor when she caught him and his flowers to her in one embrace i want to kiss you she said and presently when he had waved his hand to them from the platform outside and the train had started she fumbled for her handkerchief i suppose you call it blubbering but he is the sweetest child  hes about the only one of our carlsbad compatriots that im sorry to leave behind march assented hes the only unmarried one that wasnt in danger of turning up a lover on my hands if there had been some rather old girl or some rather light matron in our acquaintance im not sure that i should have been safe even from rose carlsbad has been an interruption to our silver wedding journey my dear but i hope now that it will begin again  yes said his wife now we can have each other all to ourselves  yes its been very different from our first wedding journey in that it isnt that were not so young now as we were but that we dont seem so much our own property we used to be the sole proprietors and now we seem to be mere tenants at will and any interloping lover may come in and set our dearest interests on the sidewalk the disadvantage of living along is that we get too much into the hands of other people  yes it is i shall be glad to be rid of them all too  i dont know that the drawback is serious enough to make us wish we had died youngor younger he suggested  no i dont know that it is she assented she added from an absence where he was sufficiently able to locate her meaning i hope shell write and tell me what her father says and does when she tells him that he was there  there were many things in the weather the landscape their sole occupancy of an unsmoking compartment while all the smoking compartments round overflowed with smokers which conspired to offer them a pleasing illusion of the past it was sometimes so perfect that they almost held each others hands in later life there are such moments when the youthful emotions come back as certain birds do in winter and the elderly heart chirps and twitters to itself as if it were young but it is best to discourage this fondness and mrs march joined her husband in mocking it when he made her observe how fit it was that their silver wedding journey should be resumed as part of his aftercure if he had found the fountain of youth in the warm flat faintly nauseous water of the felsenquelle he was not going to call himself twentyeight again till his second month of the carlsbad regimen was out and he had got back to salad and fruit  at eger they had a memorable dinner with so much leisure for it that they could form a lifelong friendship for the old englishspeaking waiter who served them and would not suffer them to hurry themselves the hills had already fallen away and they ran along through a cheerful country with tracts of forest under white clouds blowing about in a blue sky and gayly flinging their shadows down upon the brown ploughed land and upon the yellow oatfields where women were cutting the leisurely harvest with sickles and where once a great girl with swarthy bare arms unbent herself from her toil and rose a statue of rude vigor and beauty to watch them go by hedges of evergreen enclosed the yellow oatfields where slow wagons paused to gather the sheaves of the week before and then loitered away with them flocks of geese waddled in sculpturesque relief against the closecropt pastures herded by little girls with flaxen pigtails whose eyes blue as cornflowers followed the flying train there were stretches of wild thyme purpling long barren acreages and growing up the railroad banks almost to the rails themselves from the meadows the rowen tossed in long loose windrows sent into their car a sad autumnal fragrance which mingled with the tobacco smoke when two fat smokers emerged into the narrow corridor outside their compartments and tried to pass each other their vast stomachs beat together in a vain encounter  zu enge said one and ja zu enge said the other and they laughed innocently in each others faces with a joy in their recognition of the corridors narrowness as great as if it had been a stroke of the finest wit  all the way the land was lovely and as they drew near nuremberg it grew enchanting with a fairy quaintness the scenery was alpine but the scale was toylike as befitted the region and the mimic peaks and valleys with green brooks gushing between them and strange rock forms recurring in endless caprice seemed the home of childrens story all the gnomes and elves might have dwelt there in peaceful fellowship with the peasants who ploughed the little fields and gathered the garlanded hops and lived in the farmsteads and village houses with those high timberlaced gables  we ought to have come here long ago with the children when they were children said march  no his wife returned it would have been too much for them nobody but grown people could bear it  the spell which began here was not really broken by anything that afterwards happened in nuremberg though the old toycapital was trolleywired through all its quaintness and they were lodged in a hotel lighted by electricity and heated by steam and equipped with an elevator which was so modern that it came down with them as well as went up all the things that assumed to be of recent structure or invention were as nothing against the dense past which overwhelmed them with the sense of a world elsewhere outlived in nuremberg it is not the quaint or the picturesque that is exceptional it is the matteroffact and the commonplace here more than anywhere else you are steeped in the gothic spirit which expresses itself in a teutonic dialect of homely sweetness of endearing caprice of rude grotesqueness but of positive grace and beauty almost never it is the architectural speech of a strenuous gross kindly honest peoples fancy such as it is it was inexhaustible and such as it is it was bewitching for the travellers  they could hardly wait till they had supper before plunging into the ancient town and they took the first tramcar at a venture it was a sort of transfer drawn by horses which delivered them a little inside of the city gate to a trolleycar the conductor with their fare demanded their destination march frankly owned that they did not know where they wanted to go they wanted to go anywhere the conductor chose and the conductor after reflection decided to put them down at the public garden which as one of the newest things in the city would make the most favorable impression upon strangers it was in fact so like all other city gardens with the foliage of its trimly planted alleys that it sheltered them effectually from the picturesqueness of nuremberg and they had a long peaceful hour on one of its benches where they rested from their journey and repented their hasty attempt to appropriate the charm of the city  the next morning it rained according to a custom which the elevatorboy flown with the insolent recollection of a sunny summer in milan said was invariable in nuremberg but after the oneoclock table dhote they took a noble twospanner carriage and drove all round the city everywhere the ancient moat thickly turfed and planted with trees and shrubs stretched a girdle of garden between their course and the wall beautifully old with knots of dead ivy clinging to its crevices or broad meshes of the shining foliage mantling its blackened masonry a tileroofed open gallery ran along the top where so many centuries of sentries had paced and arched the massive gates with heavily moulded piers where so countlessly the fierce burgher troops had sallied forth against their besiegers and so often the leaguer hosts had dashed themselves in assault the blood shed in forgotten battles would have flooded the moat where now the grass and flowers grew or here and there a peaceful stretch of water stagnated  the drive ended in a visit to the old burg where the hapsburg kaisers dwelt when they visited their faithful imperial city from its ramparts the incredible picturesqueness of nuremberg best shows itself and if one has any love for the distinctive quality of teutonic architecture it is here that more than anywhere else one may feast it the prospect of tower and spire and gable is of such a mediaeval richness of such an abounding fulness that all incidents are lost in it the multitudinous roofs of redbrown tiles blinking browsily from their low dormers press upon one another in endless succession they cluster together on a rise of ground and sink away where the street falls but they nowhere disperse or scatter and they end abruptly at the other rim of the city beyond which looms the green country merging in the remoter blue of misty uplands  a pretty young girl waited at the door of the tower for the visitors to gather in sufficient number and then led them through the terrible museum discanting in the same gay voice and with the same smiling air on all the murderous engines and implements of torture first in german and then in english she explained the fearful uses of the iron maiden she winningly illustrated the action of the racks and wheels on which men had been stretched and broken and she sweetly vaunted a sword which had beheaded eight hundred persons when she took the established fee from march she suggested with a demure glance and what more you please for saying it in english  can you say it in russian demanded a young man whose eyes he had seen dwelling on her from the beginning she laughed archly and responded with some slavic words and then delivered her train of sightseers over to the custodian who was to show them through the halls and chambers of the burg these were undergoing the repairs which the monuments of the past are perpetually suffering in the present and there was some special painting and varnishing for the reception of the kaiser who was coming to nuremberg for the military manoeuvres then at hand but if they had been in the unmolested discomfort of their unlivable magnificence their splendor was such as might well reconcile the witness to the superior comfort of a private station in our snugger day the marches came out owning that the youth which might once have found the romantic glories of the place enough was gone from them but so much of it was left to her that she wished to make him stop and look at the flirtation which had blossomed out between that pretty young girl and the russian whom they had scarcely missed from their party in the burg he had apparently never parted from the girl and now as they sat together on the threshold of the gloomy tower he most have been teaching her more slavic words for they were both laughing as if they understood each other perfectly  in his security from having the affair in any wise on his hands march would have willingly lingered to see how her education got on but it began to rain the rain did not disturb the lovers but it obliged the elderly spectators to take refuge in their carriage and they drove off to find the famous little goose man this is what every one does at nuremberg it would be difficult to say why when they found the little goose man he was only a mediaeval fancy in bronze who stood on his pedestal in the marketplace and contributed from the bill of the goose under his arm a small stream to the rainfall drenching the wet wares of the wet marketwomen round the fountain and soaking their cauliflowers and lettuce their grapes and pears their carrots and turnips to the watery flavor of all fruits and vegetables in germany  the air was very raw and chill but after supper the clouds cleared away and a pleasant evening tempted the travellers out the portier dissembled any slight which their eagerness for the only amusement he could think of inspired and directed them to a popular theatre which was giving a summer season at low prices to the lower classes and which they surprised after some search trying to hide itself in a sort of back square they got the best places at a price which ought to have been mortifyingly cheap and found themselves with a thousand other harmless bourgeois folk in a sort of spacious agreeable barn of a decoration by no means ugly and of a certain artless comfort each seat fronted a shelf at the back of the seat before it where the spectator could put his hat there was a smaller shelf for his stein of the beer passed constantly throughout the evening and there was a buffet where he could stay himself with cold ham and other robust german refreshments  it was the wedding journey to nuremberg upon which they had oddly chanced and they accepted as a national tribute the character of an american girl in it she was an american girl of the advanced pattern and she came and went at a picnic on the arm of a head waiter she seemed to have no office in the drama except to illustrate a german conception of american girlhood but even in this simple function she seemed rather to puzzle the german audience perhaps because of the occasional english words which she used  to the astonishment of her compatriots when they came out of the theatre it was not raining the night was as brilliantly starlit as a night could be in germany and they sauntered home richly content through the narrow streets and through the beautiful old damenthor beyond which their hotel lay how pretty they said to call that charming port the ladies gate they promised each other to find out why and they never did so but satisfied themselves by assigning it to the exclusive use of the slim maidens and massive matrons of the old nuremberg patriciate whom they imagined trailing their silken splendors under its arch in perpetual procession     xlv  the life of the nuremberg patriciate now extinct in the control of the city which it builded so strenuously and maintained so heroically is still insistent in all its art this expresses their pride at once and their simplicity with a childish literality at its best it is never so good as the good italian art whose influence is always present in its best the coloring of the great canvases is venetian but there is no such democracy of greatness as in the painting at venice in decoration the art of nuremberg is at best quaint and at the worst puerile wherever it had obeyed an academic intention it seemed to march poor and coarse as in the bronze fountain beside the church of st lawrence the water spins from the pouted breasts of the beautiful figures in streams that cross and interlace after a fancy trivial and gross but in the base of the church there is a timeworn gethsemane exquisitely affecting in its simplehearted truth the long ages have made it even more affecting than the sculptor imagined it they have blurred the faces and figures in passing till their features are scarcely distinguishable and the sleeping apostles seem to have dreamed themselves back into the mothermarble it is of the same tradition and impulse with that supreme glory of the native sculpture the ineffable tabernacle of adam krafft which climbs a column of the church within a miracle of richly carven story and no doubt if there were a nuremberg sculptor doing great things today his work would be of kindred inspiration  the descendants of the old patrician who ordered the tabernacle at rather a hard bargain from the artist still worship on the floor below and the descendants of his neighbor patricians have their seats in the pews about and their names cut in the proprietary plates on the pewtops the vergeress who showed the marches through the church was devout in the praise of these aristocratic fellowcitizens of hers so simple and yet so noble she said she was a very romantic vergeress and she told them at unsparing length the legend of the tabernacle how the artist fell asleep in despair of winning his patrons daughter and saw in a vision the masterwork with the lilylike droop at top which gained him her hand they did not realize till too late that it was all out of a novel of georg eberss but added to the regular fee for the church a gift worthy of an inedited legend  even then they had a pleasure in her enthusiasm rarely imparted by the nuremberg manner they missed there the constant sweet civility of carlsbad and found themselves falling flat in their endeavors for a little cordiality they indeed inspired with some kindness the old woman who showed them through that cemetery where albert durer and hans sachs and many other illustrious citizens lie buried under monumental brasses of such beauty     that kings to have the like might wish to die  but this must have been because they abandoned themselves so willingly to the fascination of the bronze skull on the tomb of a fourteenthcentury patrician which had the uncommon advantage of a lower jaw hinged to the upper she proudly clapped it up and down for their astonishment and waited with a toothless smile to let them discover the bead of a nail artfully figured in the skull then she gave a shrill cackle of joy and gleefully explained that the wife of this patrician had killed him by driving a nail into his temple and had been fitly beheaded for the murder  she cared so much for nothing else in the cemetery but she consented to let them wonder at the richness of the sculpture in the level tombs with their escutcheons and memorial tablets overrun by the long grass and the matted ivy she even consented to share their indignation at the destruction of some of the brasses and the theft of others she suffered more reluctantly their tenderness for the old old crucifixion figured in sculpture at one corner of the cemetery where the anguish of the christ had long since faded into the stone from which it had been evoked and the thieves were no longer distinguishable in their penitence or impenitence but she parted friends with them when she saw how much they seemed taken with the votive chapel of the noble holzschuh family where a line of wooden shoes puns upon the name in the frieze like the line of dogs which chase one another with bones in their mouths around the canossa palace at verona a sense of the beautiful house by the adige was part of the pleasing confusion which possessed them in nuremberg whenever they came upon the expression of the gothic spirit common both to the german and northern italian art they knew that it was an effect which had passed from germany into italy but in the liberal air of the older land it had come to so much more beauty that now when they found it in its home it seemed something fetched from over the alps and coarsened in the attempt to naturalize it to an alien air  in the germanic museum they fled to the italian painters from the german pictures they had inspired in the great hall of the rathhaus the noble processional of durer was the more precious because his triumph of maximilian somehow suggested mantegnas triumph of caesar there was to be a banquet in the hall under the mighty fresco to welcome the german emperor coming the next week and the rathhaus was full of workpeople furbishing it up against his arrival and making it difficult for the custodian who had it in charge to show it properly to strangers she was of the same enthusiastic sisterhood as the vergeress of st lawrence and the guardian of the old cemetery and by a mighty effort she prevailed over the workmen so far as to lead her charges out through the corridor where the literal conscience of the brothers kuhn has wrought in the roof to an exact image of a tournament as it was in nuremberg four hundred years ago in this relief thronged with men and horses the galalife of the past survives in unexampled fulness and march blamed himself after enjoying it for having felt in it that toyfigure quality which seems the final effect of the german gothicism in sculpture     xlvi  on sunday mrs march partially conformed to an earlier new england ideal of the day by ceasing from sightseeing she could not have understood the sermon if she had gone to church but she appeased the lingering conscience she had on this point by not going out till afternoon then she found nothing of the gayety which sunday afternoon wears in catholic lands the people were resting from their weekday labors but they were not playing and the old churches long since converted to lutheran uses were locked against tourist curiosity  it was as it should be it was as it would be at home and yet in this ancient city where the past was so much alive in the perpetual picturesqueness the marches felt an incongruity in it and they were fain to escape from the protestant silence and seriousness of the streets to the shade of the public garden they had involuntarily visited the evening of their arrival  on a bench sat a quiet rather dejected man whom march asked some question of their way he answered in english and in the parley that followed they discovered that they were all americans the stranger proved to be an american of the sort commonest in germany and he said he had returned to his native country to get rid of the ague which he had taken on staten island he had been seventeen years in new york and now a talk of tammany and its chances in the next election of pulls and deals of bosses and heelers grew up between the civic stepbrothers and joined them is a common interest the germanamerican said he was bookkeeper in some glassworks which had been closed by our tariff and he confessed that he did not mean to return to us though he spoke of german affairs with the impartiality of an outsider he said that the socialist party was increasing faster than any other and that this tacitly meant the suppression of rank and the abolition of monarchy he warned march against the appearance of industrial prosperity in germany beggary was severely repressed and if poverty was better clad than with us it was as hungry and as hopeless in nuremberg as in new york the working classes were kindly and peaceable they only knifed each other quietly on sunday evenings after having too much beer  presently the stranger rose and bowed to the marches for goodby and as he walked down the aisle of trees in which they had been fitting together he seemed to be retreating farther and farther from such americanism as they had in common he had reverted to an entirely german effect of dress and figure his walk was slow and teutonic he must be a type of thousands who have returned to the fatherland without wishing to own themselves its children again and yet out of heart with the only country left them  he was rather pathetic my dear said march in the discomfort he knew his wife must be feeling as well as himself how odd to have the lid lifted here and see the same old problems seething and bubbling in the witchs caldron we call civilization as we left simmering away at home and how hard to have our tariff reach out and snatch the bread from the mouths of those poor glassworkers  i thought that was hard she sighed it must have been his bread too  lets hope it was not his cake anyway i suppose he added dreamily that what we used to like in italy was the absence of all the modern activities the italians didnt repel us by assuming to be of our epoch in the presence of their monuments they knew how to behave as pensive memories i wonder if theyre still as charming  oh no she returned nothing is as charming as it used to be and now we need the charm more than ever  he laughed at her despair in the tacit understanding they had lived into that only one of them was to be desperate at a time and that they were to take turns in cheering each other up well perhaps we dont deserve it and im not sure that we need it so much as we did when we were young weve got tougher we can stand the cold facts better now they made me shiver once but now they give me a sort of agreeable thrill besides if life kept up its pretty illusions if it insisted upon being as charming as it used to be how could we ever bear to die weve got that to consider he yielded to the temptation of his paradox but he did not fail altogether of the purpose with which he began and they took the trolley back to their hotel cheerful in the intrepid fancy that they had confronted fate when they had only had the hardihood to face a phrase  they agreed that now he ought really to find out something about the contemporary life of nuremberg and the next morning he went out before breakfast and strolled through some of the simpler streets in the hope of intimate impressions the peasant women serving portions of milk from house to house out of the cans in the little wagons which they drew themselves were a touch of pleasing domestic comedy a certain effect of tragedy imparted itself from the lamentations of the suckingpigs jolted over the pavements in handcarts a certain majesty from the long procession of yellow mailwagons with drivers in the royal bavarian blue trooping by in the cold small rain impassibly dripping from their glazed hatbrims upon their uniforms but he could not feel that these things were any of them very poignantly significant and he covered his retreat from the actualities of nuremberg by visiting the chief bookstore and buying more photographs of the architecture than he wanted and more local histories than he should ever read he made a last effort for the contemporaneous life by asking the englishspeaking clerk if there were any literary men of distinction living in nuremberg and the clerk said there was not one  he went home to breakfast wondering if he should be able to make his meagre facts serve with his wife but he found her far from any wish to listen to them she was intent upon a pair of young lovers at a table near her own who were so absorbed in each other that they were proof against an interest that must otherwise have pierced them through the bridegroom as he would have called himself was a pretty little bavarian lieutenant very dark and regular and the bride was as pretty and as little but delicately blond nature had admirably mated them and if art had helped to bring them together through the genius of the brides mother who was breakfasting with them it had wrought almost as fitly mrs march queried impartially who they were where they met and how and just when they were going to be married and march consented in his personal immunity from their romance to let it go on under his eyes without protest but later when they met the lovers in the street walking arm in arm with the brides mother behind them gloating upon their bliss he said the woman ought at her time of life to be ashamed of such folly she must know that this affair by nine chances out of ten could not fail to eventuate at the best in a marriage as tiresome as most other marriages and yet she was abandoning herself with those ignorant young people to the illusion that it was the finest and sweetest thing in life  well isnt it his wife asked  yes thats the worst of it it shows how povertystricken life really is we want somehow to believe that each pair of lovers will find the good we have missed and be as happy as we expected to be  i think we have been happy enough and that weve had as much good as was wholesome for us she returned hurt  youre always so concrete i meant us in the abstract but if you will be personal ill say that youve been as happy as you deserve and got more good than you had any right to  she laughed with him and then they laughed again to perceive that they were walking arm in arm too like the lovers whom they were insensibly following  he proposed that while they were in the mood they should go again to the old cemetery and see the hinged jaw of the murdered paumgartner wagging in eternal accusation of his murderess its rather hard on her that he should be having the last word that way he said she was a woman no matter what mistakes she had committed  thats what i call banale said mrs march  it is rather he confessed it makes me feel as if i must go to see the house of durer after all  well i knew we should have to sooner or later  it was the thing that they had said would not do in nuremberg because everybody did it but now they hailed a fiacre and ordered it driven to durers house which they found in a remote part of the town near a stretch of the city wall varied in its picturesqueness by the interposition of a dripping grove it was raining again by the time they reached it the quarter had lapsed from earlier dignity and without being squalid it looked worn and hard worked otherwise it could hardly have been different in durers time his dwelling in no way impressive outside amidst the environing quaintness stood at the corner of a narrow sidehill street that sloped cityward and within it was stripped bare of all the furniture of life belowstairs and above was none the cozier for the stiff appointment of a showhouse it was cavernous and cold but if there had been a fire in the kitchen and a table laid in the diningroom and beds equipped for nightmare after the german fashion in the empty chambers one could have imagined a kindly simple neighborly existence there it in no wise suggested the calling of an artist perhaps because artists had not begun in durers time to take themselves so objectively as they do now but it implied the life of a prosperous citizen and it expressed the period  the marches wrote their names in the visitors book and paid the visitors fee which also bought them tickets in an annual lottery for a reproduction of one of durers pictures and then they came away by no means dissatisfied with his house by its association with his sojourns in italy it recalled visits to other shrines and they had to own that it was really no worse than ariostos house at ferrara or petrarchs at arqua or michelangelos at florence but what i admire he said is our futility in going to see it we expected to surprise some quality of the man left lying about in the house because he lived and died in it and because his wife kept him up so close there and worked him so hard to save his widow from coming to want  who said she did that  a friend of his who hated her but he had to allow that she was a godfearing woman and had a new england conscience  well i dare say durer was easygoing  yes but i dont like her laying her plans to survive him though women always do that  they were going away the next day and they sat down that evening to a final supper in such goodhumor with themselves that they were willing to include a young couple who came to take places at their table though they would rather have been alone they lifted their eyes for their expected salutation and recognized mr and mrs leffers of the norumbia  the ladies fell upon each other as if they had been mother and daughter march and the young man shook hands in the feeling of passengers mutually endeared by the memories of a pleasant voyage they arrived at the fact that mr leffers had received letters in england from his partners which allowed him to prolong his wedding journey in a tour of the continent while their wives were still exclaiming at their encounter in the same hotel at nuremberg and then they all sat down to have as the bride said a real norumbia time  she was one of those young wives who talk always with their eyes submissively on their husbands no matter whom they are speaking to but she was already unconsciously ruling him in her abeyance no doubt she was ruling him for his good she had a livelier mind than he and she knew more as the american wives of young american business men always do and she was planning wisely for their travels she recognized her merit in this devotion with an artless candor which was typical rather than personal march was glad to go out with leffers for a little stroll and to leave mrs march to listen to mrs leffers who did not let them go without making her husband promise to wrap up well and not get his feet wet she made march promise not to take him far and to bring him back early which he found himself very willing to do after an exchange of ideas with mr leffers the young man began to talk about his wife in her providential her almost miraculous adaptation to the sort of man he was and when he had once begun to explain what sort of man he was there was no end to it till they rejoined the ladies in the readingroom     xlvii  the young couple came to the station to see the marches off after dinner the next day and the wife left a bank of flowers on the seat beside mrs march who said as soon as they were gone i believe i would rather meet people of our own age after this i used to think that you could keep young by being with young people but i dont now there world is very different from ours our world doesnt really exist any more but as long as we keep away from theirs we neednt realize it young people she went on are more practicalminded than we used to be theyre quite as sentimental but i dont think they care so much for the higher things theyre not so much brought up on poetry as we were she pursued that little mrs leffers would have read longfellow in our time but now she didnt know of his poem on nuremberg she was intelligent enough about the place but you could see that its quaintness was not so precious as it was to us not so sacred her tone entreated him to find more meaning in her words than she had put into them they couldnt have felt as we did about that old ivied wall and that grassy flowery moat under it and the beautiful damenthor and that pileup of the roofs from the burg and those winding streets with their gothic facades all cobwebbed with trolley wires and that yellow aguishlooking river drowsing through the town under the windows of those overhanging houses and the marketplace and the squares before the churches with their queer shops in the nooks and corners round them  i see what you mean but do you think its as sacred to us as it would have been twentyfive years ago i had an irreverent feeling now and then that nuremberg was overdoing nuremberg  oh yes so had i were that modern if were not so young as we were  we were very simple in those days  well if we were simple we knew it  yes we used to like taking our unconsciousness to pieces and looking at it  we had a good time  too good sometimes it seems as if it would have lasted longer if it had not been so good we might have our cake now if we hadnt eaten it  it would be mouldy though  i wonder he said recurring to the lefferses how we really struck them  well i dont believe they thought we ought to be travelling about alone quite at our age  oh not so bad as that after a moment he said i dare say they dont go round quarrelling on their wedding journey as we did  indeed they do they had an awful quarrel just before they got to nuremberg about his wanting to send some of the baggage to liverpool by express that she wanted to keep with them but she said it had been a lesson and they were never going to quarrel again the elders looked at each other in the light of experience and laughed well she ended thats one thing were through with i suppose weve come to feel more alike than we used to  or not to feel at all how did they settle it about the baggage  oh he insisted on her keeping it with her march laughed again but this time he laughed alone and after a while she said well they gave just the right relief to nuremberg with their good clean american philistinism i dont mind their thinking us queer they must have thought nuremberg was queer  yes we oldsters are always queer to the young were either ridiculously lively and chirpy or were ridiculously stiff and grim they never expect to be like us and wouldnt for the world the worst of it is we elderly people are absurd to one another we dont at the bottom of our hearts believe were like that when we meet i suppose that arrogant old ass of a triscoe looks upon me as a grinning dotard  i wonder said mrs march if shes told him yet and march perceived that she was now suddenly far from the mood of philosophic introspection but he had no difficulty in following her  shes had time enough but it was an awkward task burnamy left to her  yes when i think of that i can hardly forgive him for coming back in that way i know she is dead in love with him but she could only have accepted him conditionally  conditionally to his making it all right with stoller  stoller no to her fathers liking it  ah thats quite as hard what makes you think she accepted him at all  what do you think she was crying about  well i have supposed that ladies occasionally shed tears of pity if she accepted him conditionally she would have to tell her father about it mrs march gave him a glance of silent contempt and he hastened to atone for his stupidity perhaps shes told him on the instalment plan she may have begun by confessing that burnamy had been in carlsbad poor old fellow i wish we were going to find him in ansbach he could make things very smooth for us  well you neednt flatter yourself that youll find him in ansbach im sure i dont know where he is  you might write to miss triscoe and ask  i think i shall wait for miss triscoe to write to me she said with dignity  yes she certainly owes you that much after all your suffering for her ive asked the banker in nuremberg to forward our letters to the poste restante in ansbach isnt it good to see the crows again after those ravens around carlsbad  she joined him in looking at the mild autumnal landscape through the open window the afternoon was fair and warm and in the level fields bodies of soldiers were at work with picks and spades getting the ground ready for the military manoeuvres they disturbed among the stubble foraging parties of crows which rose from time to time with cries of indignant protest she said with a smile for the crows yes and im thankful that ive got nothing on my conscience whatever happens she added in dismissal of the subject of burnamy  im thankful too my dear id much rather have things on my own im more used to that and i believe i feel less remorse than when youre to blame  they might have been carried near this point by those telepathic influences which have as yet been so imperfectly studied it was only that morning after the lapse of a week since burnamys furtive reappearance in carlsbad that miss triscoe spoke to her father about it and she had at that moment a longing for support and counsel that might well have made its mystical appeal to mrs march  she spoke at last because she could put it off no longer rather than because the right time had come she began as they sat at breakfast papa there is something that i have got to tell you it is something that you ought to know but i have put off telling you because  she hesitated for the reason and well said her father looking up at her from his second cup of coffee what is it  then she answered mr burnamy has been here  in carlsbad when was he here  the night of the emperors birthday he came into the box when you were behind the scenes with mr march afterwards i met him in the crowd  well  i thought you ought to know mrs march said i ought to tell you  did she say you ought to wait a week he gave way to an irascibility which he tried to check and to ask with indifference why did he come back  he was going to write about it for that paper in paris the girl had the effect of gathering her courage up for a bold plunge she looked steadily at her father and added he said he came back because he couldnt help it hewished to speak with me he said he knew he had no right to suppose i cared anything about what had happened with him and mr stoller he wanted to come back and tell methat  her father waited for her to go on but apparently she was going to leave the word to him now he hesitated to take it but he asked at last with a mildness that seemed to surprise her have you heard anything from him since  no  where is he  i dont know i told him i could not say what he wished that i must tell you about it  the case was less simple than it would once have been for general triscoe there was still his affection for his daughter his wish for her happiness but this had always been subordinate to his sense of his own interest and comfort and a question had recently arisen which put his paternal love and duty in a new light he was no more explicit with himself than other men are and the most which could ever be said of him without injustice was that in his dependence upon her he would rather have kept his daughter to himself if she could not have been very prosperously married on the other hand if he disliked the man for whom she now hardly hid her liking he was not just then ready to go to extremes concerning him  he was very anxious she went on that you should know just how it was he thinks everything of your judgment andandopinion the general made a consenting noise in his throat he said that he did not wish me to whitewash him to you he didnt think he had done right he didnt excuse himself or ask you to excuse him unless you could from the standpoint of a gentleman  the general made a less consenting noise in his throat and asked how do you look at it yourself agatha  i dont believe i quite understand it but mrs march  oh mrs march the general snorted  says that mr march does not think so badly of it as mr burnamy does  i doubt it at any rate i understood march quite differently  she says that he thinks he behaved very nobly afterwards when mr stoller wanted him to help him put a false complexion on it that it was all the more difficult for him to do right then because of his remorse for what he had done before as she spoke on she had become more eager  theres something in that the general admitted with a candor that he made the most of both to himself and to her but i should like to know what stoller had to say of it all is there anything he inquired any reason why i need be more explicit about it just now  nno only i thoughthe thinks so much of your opinion thatif  oh he can very well afford to wait if he values my opinion so highly he can give me time to make up my mind  of course  and im not responsible the general continued significantly for the delay altogether if you had told me this beforenow i dont know whether stoller is still in town  he was not behaving openly with her but she had not behaved openly with him she owned that to herself and she got what comfort she could from his making the affair a question of what burnamy had done to stoller rather than of what burnamy had said to her and what she had answered him if she was not perfectly clear as to what she wanted to do or wished to have happen there was now time and place in which she could delay and make sure the accepted theory of such matters is that people know their minds from the beginning and that they do not change them but experience seems to contradict this theory or else people often act contrary to their convictions and impulses if the statistics were accessible it might be found that many potential engagements hovered in a doubtful air and before they touched the earth in actual promise were dissipated by the play of meteorological chances  when general triscoe put down his napkin in rising he said that he would step round to pupps and see if stoller were still there but on the way he stepped up to mrs addings hotel on the hill and he came back after an interval which he seemed not to have found long to report rather casually that stoller had left carlsbad the day before by this time the fact seemed not to concern agatha herself very vitally  he asked if the marches had left any address with her and she answered that they had not they were going to spend a few days in nuremberg and then push on to holland for mr marchs aftercure there was no relevance in his question unless it intimated his belief that she was in confidential correspondence with mrs march and she met this by saying that she was going to write her in care of their bankers she asked whether he wished to send any word  no i understand he intimated that there is nothing at all in the nature of aaan understanding then with  no nothing  hm the general waited a moment then he ventured do you care to saydo you wish me to knowhow he took it  the tears came into the girls eyes but she governed herself to say hehe was disappointed  he had no right to be disappointed  it was a question and she answered he thought he had he saidthat he wouldnttrouble me any more  the general did not ask at once and you dont know where he is nowyou havent heard anything from him since  agatha flashed through her tears papa  oh i beg your pardon i think you told me   pg editors bookmarks      americans are hungrier for royalty than anybody else     effort to get on common ground with an inferior     he buys my poverty and not my will     honest selfishness     intrepid fancy that they had confronted fate     less intrusive than if he had not been there     monologue to which the wives of absentminded men resign     only one of them was to be desperate at a time     reconciliation with death which nature brings to life at last     votingcattle whom they bought and sold     we dont seem so much our own property     we get too much into the hands of other people     part iii    xlviii  at the first station where the train stopped a young german bowed himself into the compartment with the marches and so visibly resisted an impulse to smoke that march begged him to light his cigarette in the talk which this friendly overture led to between them he explained that he was a railway architect employed by the government on that line of road and was travelling officially march spoke of nuremberg he owned the sort of surfeit he had suffered from its excessive mediaevalism and the young man said it was part of the new imperial patriotism to cherish the gothic throughout germany no other sort of architecture was permitted in nuremberg but they would find enough classicism at ansbach he promised them and he entered with sympathetic intelligence into their wish to see this former capital when march told him they were going to stop there in hopes of something typical of the old disjointed germany of the petty principalities the little paternal despotisms now extinct  as they talked on partly in german and partly in english their purpose in visiting ansbach appeared to the marches more meditated than it was in fact it was somewhat accidental ansbach was near nuremberg it was not much out of the way to holland they took more and more credit to themselves for a reasoned and definite motive in the light of their companions enthusiasm for the place and its charm began for them with the drive from the station through streets whose sentiment was both italian and french and where there was a yellowish cast in the gray of the architecture which was almost mantuan they rested their sensibilities so bruised and fretted by gothic angles and points against the smooth surfaces of the prevailing classicistic facades of the houses as they passed and when they arrived at their hotel an old mansion of versailles type fronting on a long irregular square planted with pollard sycamores they said that it might as well have been lucca  the archway and stairway of the hotel were draped with the bavarian colors and they were obscurely flattered to learn that prince leopold the brother of the princeregent of the kingdom had taken rooms there on his way to the manoeuvres at nuremberg and was momently expected with his suite they realized that they were not of the princely party however when they were told that he had sole possession of the diningroom and they went out to another hotel and had their supper in keeping delightfully native people seemed to come there to write their letters and make up their accounts as well as to eat their suppers they called for stationery like characters in old comedy and the clatter of crockery and the scratching of pens went on together and fortune offered the marches a delicate reparation for their exclusion from their own hotel in the cold popular reception of the prince which they got back just in time to witness a very small group of people mostly women and boys had gathered to see him arrive but there was no cheering or any sign of public interest perhaps he personally merited none he looked a dull sad man with his plain stubbed features and after he had mounted to his apartment the officers of his staff stood quite across the landing and barred the passage of the americans ignoring even mrs marchs presence as they talked together  well my dear said her husband here you have it at last this is what youve been living for ever since we came to germany its a great moment  yes what are you going to do  who i oh nothing this is your affair its for you to act  if she had been young she might have withered them with a glance she doubted now if her dim eyes would have any such power but she advanced steadily upon them and then the officers seemed aware of her and stood aside  march always insisted that they stood aside apologetically but she held as firmly that they stood aside impertinently or at least indifferently and that the insult to her american womanhood was perfectly ideal it is true that nothing of the kind happened again during their stay at the hotel the princes officers were afterwards about in the corridors and on the stairs but they offered no shadow of obstruction to her going and coming and the landlord himself was not so preoccupied with his highhotes but he had time to express his grief that she had been obliged to go out for supper  they satisfied the passion for the little obsolete capital which had been growing upon them by strolling past the old resident at an hour so favorable for a first impression it loomed in the gathering dusk even vaster than it was and it was really vast enough for the pride of a king of france much more a margrave of ansbach time had blackened and blotched its coarse limestone walls to one complexion with the statues swelling and strutting in the figure of roman legionaries before it and standing out against the evening sky along its balustraded roof and had softened to the right tint the stretch of half a dozen houses with mansard roofs and renaissance facades obsequiously in keeping with the versailles ideal of a resident in the rear and elsewhere at fit distance from its courts a native architecture prevailed and at no great remove the marches found themselves in a simple german town again there they stumbled upon a little booksellers shop blinking in a quiet corner and bought three or four guides and small histories of ansbach which they carried home and studied between drowsing and waking the wonderful german syntax seems at its most enigmatical in this sort of literature and sometimes they lost themselves in its labyrinths completely and only made their way perilously out with the help of cumulative declensions past articles and adjectives blindly seeking their nouns to longprocrastinated verbs dancing like swampfires in the distance they emerged a little less ignorant than they went in and better qualified than they would otherwise have been for their second visit to the schloss which they paid early the next morning  they were so early indeed that when they mounted from the great inner court much too big for ansbach if not for the building and rung the custodians bell a smiling maid who let them into an anteroom where she kept on picking over vegetables for her dinner said the custodian was busy and could not be seen till ten oclock she seemed in her nook of the pretentious pile as innocently unconscious of its history as any hensparrow who had built her nest in some coign of its architecture and her friendly peaceful domesticity remained a wholesome human background to the tragedies and comedies of the past and held them in a picturesque relief in which they were alike tolerable and even charming  the history of ansbach strikes its roots in the soil of fable and above ground is a gnarled and twisted growth of good and bad from the time of the great charles to the time of the great frederick between these times she had her various rulers ecclesiastical and secular in various forms of vassalage to the empire but for nearly four centuries her sovereignty was in the hands of the margraves who reigned in a constantly increasing splendor till the last sold her outright to the king of prussia in 1791 and went to live in england on the proceeds she had taken her part in the miseries and glories of the wars that desolated germany but after the reformation when she turned from the ancient faith to which she owed her cloistered origin under st gumpertus her people had peace except when their last prince sold them to fight the battles of others it is in this last transaction that her history almost in the moment when she ceased to have a history of her own links to that of the modern world and that it came home to the marches in their national character for two thousand of those poor ansbach mercenaries were bought up by england and sent to put down a rebellion in her american colonies  humanly they were more concerned for the last margrave because of certain qualities which made him the best margrave in spite of the defects of his qualities he was the son of the wild margrave equally known in the ansbach annals who may not have been the worst margrave but who had certainly a bad trick of putting his subjects to death without trial and in cases where there was special haste with his own hand he sent his son to the university at utrecht because he believed that the republican influences in holland would be wholesome for him and then he sent him to travel in italy but when the boy came home looking frail and sick the wild margrave charged his official travelling companion with neglect and had the unhappy hofrath meyer hanged without process for this crime one of the gentlemen of his realm for a pasquinade on the margrave was brought to the scaffold he had at various times twentytwo of his soldiers shot with arrows and bullets or hanged for desertion besides many whose penalties his clemency commuted to the loss of an ear or a nose a hungarian who killed his huntingdog he had broken alive on the wheel a soldiers wife was hanged for complicity in a case of desertion a young soldier who eloped with the girl he loved was brought to ansbach from a neighboring town and hanged with her on the same gallows a sentry at the door of one of the margraves castles amiably complied with the margraves request to let him take his gun for a moment on the pretence of wishing to look at it for this breach of discipline the prince covered him with abuse and gave him over to his hussars who bound him to a horses tail and dragged him through the streets he died of his injuries the kennelmaster who had charge of the margraves dogs was accused of neglecting them without further inquiry the margrave rode to the mans house and shot him down on his own threshold a shepherd who met the margrave on a shying horse did not get his flock out of the way quickly enough the margrave demanded the pistols of a gentleman in his company but he answered that they were not loaded and the shepherds life was saved as they returned home the gentleman fired them off what does that mean cried the margrave furiously it means gracious lord that you will sleep sweeter tonight for not having heard my pistols an hour sooner  from this it appears that the gracious lord had his moments of regret but perhaps it is not altogether strange that when he died the whole population stormed through the streets to meet his funeral train not in awestricken silence to meditate on the fall of human grandeur but to unite in an eager tumult of rejoicing as if some cruel brigand who had long held the city in terror were delivered over to them bound and in chains for nearly thirty years this bloodstained miscreant had reigned over his hapless people in a sovereign plenitude of power which by the theory of german imperialism in our day is still a divine right  they called him the wild margrave in their instinctive revolt from the belief that any man not untamably savage could be guilty of his atrocities and they called his son the last margrave with a touch of the poetry which perhaps records a regret for their extinction as a state he did not harry them as his father had done his mild rule was the effect partly of the indifference and distaste for his country bred by his long sojourns abroad but doubtless also it was the effect of a kindly nature even in the matter of selling a few thousands of them to fight the battles of a bad cause on the other side of the world he had the best of motives and faithfully applied the proceeds to the payment of the state debt and the embellishment of the capital  his mother was a younger sister of frederick the great and was so constantly at war with her husband that probably she had nothing to do with the marriage which the wild margrave forced upon their son love certainly had nothing to do with it and the last margrave early escaped from it to the society of mlle clairon the great french tragedienne whom he met in paris and whom he persuaded to come and make her home with him in ansbach she lived there seventeen years and though always an alien she bore herself with kindness to all classes and is still remembered there by the roll of butter which calls itself a klarungswecke in its imperfect french  no roll of butter records in faltering accents the name of the brilliant and disdainful english lady who replaced this poor tragic muse in the margraves heart though the lady herself lived to be the last margravine of ansbach where everybody seems to have hated her with a passion which she doubtless knew how to return she was the daughter of the earl of berkeley and the wife of lord craven a sufficiently unfaithful and unworthy nobleman by her account from whom she was living apart when the margrave asked her to his capital there she set herself to oust mlle clairon with sneers and jests for the theatrical style which the actress could not outlive lady craven said she was sure clairons nightcap must be a crown of gilt paper and when clairon threatened to kill herself and the margrave was alarmed you forget said lady craven that actresses only stab themselves under their sleeves  she drove clairon from ansbach and the great tragedienne returned to paris where she remained true to her false friend and from time to time wrote him letters full of magnanimous counsel and generous tenderness but she could not have been so good company as lady craven who was a very gifted person and knew how to compose songs and sing them and write comedies and play them and who could keep the margrave amused in many ways when his loveless and childless wife died he married the english woman but he grew more and more weary of his dull little court and his dull little country and after a while considering the uncertain tenure sovereigns had of their heads since the french king had lost his and the fact that he had no heirs to follow him in his principality he resolved to cede it for a certain sum to prussia to this end his new wifes urgence was perhaps not wanting they went to england where she outlived him ten years and wrote her memoirs  the custodian of the schloss came at last and the marches saw instantly that he was worth waiting for he was as vainglorious of the palace as any grandmonarching margrave of them all he could not have been more personally superb in showing their different effigies if they had been his own family portraits and he would not spare the strangers a single splendor of the twenty vast handsome tiresome versailleslike rooms he led them through the rooms were fatiguing physically but so poignantly interesting that mrs march would not have missed though she perished of her pleasure one of the things she saw she had for once a surfeit of highhoting in the pictures the porcelains the thrones and canopies the tapestries the historical associations with the margraves and their marriages with the great frederick and the great napoleon the great napoleons man bernadotte made the schloss his headquarters when he occupied ansbach after austerlitz and here he completed his arrangements for taking her bargain from prussia and handing it over to bavaria with whom it still remains twice the great frederick had sojourned in the palace visiting his sister louise the wife of the wild margrave and more than once it had welcomed her next neighbor and sister wilhelmina the margravine of baireuth whose autobiographic voice piercingly plaintive and reproachful seemed to quiver in the air here oddly enough the spell of the wild margrave weakened in the presence of his portrait which signally failed to justify his fame of furious tyrant that seems indeed to have been rather the popular and historical conception of him than the impression he made upon his exalted contemporaries the margravine of baireuth at any rate could so far excuse her poor bloodstained brotherinlaw as to say the margrave of ansbach was a young prince who had been very badly educated he continually illtreated my sister they led the life of cat and dog my sister it is true was sometimes in fault her education had been very bad she was married at fourteen  at parting the custodian told the marches that he would easily have known them for americans by the handsome fee they gave him they came away flown with his praise and their national vanity was again flattered when they got out into the principal square of ansbach there in a booksellers window they found among the pamphlets teaching different languages without a master one devoted to the amerikanische sprache as distinguished from the englische sprache that there could be no mistake the cover was printed with colors in a german ideal of the starspangled banner and march said he always knew that we had a language of our own and that now he was going in to buy that pamphlet and find out what it was like he asked the young shopwoman how it differed from english which she spoke fairly well from having lived eight years in chicago she said that it differed from the english mainly in emphasis and pronunciation for instance the english say half past and the americans half past the english say laht and the americans say late  the weather had now been clear quite long enough and it was raining again a fine bitter piercing drizzle they asked the girl if it always rained in ansbach and she owned that it nearly always did she said that sometimes she longed for a little american summer that it was never quite warm in ansbach and when they had got out into the rain march said it was very nice to stumble on chicago in an ansbach bookstore you ought to have told her you had a married daughter in chicago dont miss another such chance  we shall need another bag if we keep on buying books at this rate said his wife with tranquil irrelevance and not to give him time for protest she pushed him into a shop where the valises in the window perhaps suggested her thought march made haste to forestall her there by saying they were americans but the mistress of the shop seemed to have her misgivings and born americans perhaps she ventured she had probably never met any but the naturalized sort and supposed these were the only sort march reassured her and then she said she had a son living in jersey city and she made march take his address that he might tell him he had seen his mother she had apparently no conception what a great way jersey city is from new york  mrs march would not take his arm when they came out now that is what i never can get used to in you basil and ive tried to palliate it for twentyseven years you know you wont look up that poor womans son why did you let her think you would  how could i tell her i wouldnt perhaps i shall  no no you never will i know youre good and kind and thats why i cant understand your being so cruel when we get back how will you ever find time to go over to jersey city  he could not tell but at last he said ill tell you what you must keep me up to it you know how much you enjoy making me do my duty and this will be such a pleasure  she laughed forlornly but after a moment she took his arm and he began from the example of this good mother to philosophize the continuous simplicity and sanity of the people of ansbach under all their civic changes saints and soldiers knights and barons margraves princes kings emperors had come and gone and left their singlehearted friendly subjectfolk pretty much what they found them the people had suffered and survived through a thousand wars and apparently prospered on under all governments and misgovernments when the court was most french most artificial most vicious the citizen life must have remained immutably german dull and kind after all he said humanity seemed everywhere to be pretty safe and pretty much the same  yes that is all very well she returned and you can theorize interestingly enough but im afraid that poor mother there had no more reality for you than those people in the past you appreciate her as a type and you dont care for her as a human being youre nothing but a dreamer after all i dont blame you she went on its your temperament and you cant change now  i may change for the worse he threatened i think i have already i dont believe i could stand up to dryfoos now as i did for poor old lindau when i risked your bread and butter for his i look back in wonder and admiration at myself ive steadily lost touch with life since then im a trifler a dilettante and an amateur of the right and the good as i used to be when i was young oh i have the grace to be troubled at times now and once i never was it never occurred to me then that the world wasnt made to interest me or at the best to instruct me but it does now at times  she always came to his defence when he accused himself it was the best ground he could take with her i think you behaved very well with burnamy you did your duty then  did i im not so sure at any rate its the last time i shall do it ive served my term i think i should tell him that he was all right in that business with stoller if i were to meet him now  isnt it strange she said provisionally that we dont come upon a trace of him anywhere in ansbach  ah youve been hoping he would turn up  yes i dont deny it i feel very unhappy about him  i dont hes too much like me he would have been quite capable of promising that poor woman to look up her son in jersey city when i think of that i have no patience with burnamy  i am going to ask the landlord about him now hes got rid of his highhotes said mrs march     xlix  they went home to their hotel for their midday dinner and to the comfort of having it nearly all to themselves prince leopold had risen early like all the hardworking potentates of the continent and got away to the manoeuvres somewhere at six oclock the decorations had been removed and the courtyard where the hired coach and pair of the prince had rolled in the evening before had only a few majestic ducks waddling about in it and quacking together indifferent to the presence of a yellow mailwagon on which the driver had been apparently dozing till the hour of noon should sound he sat there immovable but at the last stroke of the clock he woke up and drove vigorously away to the station  the diningroom which they had been kept out of by the prince the night before was not such as to embitter the sense of their wrong by its splendor after all the tastes of royalty must be simple if the prince might have gone to the schloss and had chosen rather to stay at this modest hotel but perhaps the schloss was reserved for more immediate royalty than the brothers of princeregents and in that case he could not have done better than dine at the golden star if he paid no more than two marks he dined as cheaply as a prince could wish and as abundantly the wine at ansbach was rather thin and sour but the bread march declared was the best bread in the whole world not excepting the bread of carlsbad  after dinner the marches had some of the local pastry not so incomparable as the bread with their coffee which they had served them in a pavilion of the beautiful garden remaining to the hotel from the time when it was a patrician mansion the garden had roses in it and several sorts of late summer flowers as well as ripe cherries currants grapes and a virginiacreeper red with autumn all harmoniously contemporaneous as they might easily be in a climate where no one of the seasons can very well know itself from the others it had not been raining for half an hour and the sun was scalding hot so that the shelter of their roof was very grateful and the puddles of the paths were drying up with the haste which puddles have to make in germany between rains if they are ever going to dry up at all  the landlord came out to see if they were well served and he was sincerely obliging in the english he had learned as a waiter in london mrs march made haste to ask him if a young american of the name of burnamy had been staying with him a few weeks before and she described burnamys beauty and amiability so vividly that the landlord if he had been a woman could not have failed to remember him but he failed with a real grief apparently and certainly a real politeness to recall either his name or his person the landlord was an intelligent goodlooking young fellow he told them that he was lately married and they liked him so much that they were sorry to see him afterwards privately boxing the ears of the piccolo the waiters little understudy perhaps the piccolo deserved it but they would rather not have witnessed his punishment his being in a dresscoat seemed to make it also an indignity  in the late afternoon they went to the cafe in the old orangery of the schloss for a cup of tea and found themselves in the company of several ansbach ladies who had brought their work in the evident habit of coming there every afternoon for their coffee and for a dish of gossip they were kind uncomely motherlylooking bodies one of them combed her hair at the table and they all sat outside of the cafe with their feet on the borders of the puddles which had not dried up there in the shade of the building  a deep lawn darkened at its farther edge by the long shadows of trees stretched before them with the sunset light on it and it was all very quiet and friendly the tea brought to the marches was brewed from some herb apparently of native growth with bits of what looked like willow leaves in it but it was flavored with a clove in each cup and they sat contentedly over it and tried to make out what the ansbach ladies were talking about these had recognized the strangers for americans and one of them explained that americans spoke the same language as the english and yet were not quite the same people  she differs from the girl in the bookstore said march translating to his wife let us get away before she says that we are not so nice as the english and they made off toward the avenue of trees beyond the lawn  there were a few people walking up and down in the alley making the most of the moment of dry weather they saluted one another like acquaintances and three cleanshaven walnutfaced old peasants bowed in response to marchs stare with a selfrespectful civility they were yeomen of the region of ansbach where the country round about is dotted with their cottages and not held in vast homeless tracts by the nobles as in north germany  the bavarian who had imparted this fact to march at breakfast not without a certain tacit pride in it to the disadvantage of the prussians was at the supper table and was disposed to more talk which he managed in a stout slow english of his own he said he had never really spoken english with an englishspeaking person before or at all since he studied it in school at munich  i should be afraid to put my schoolboy german against your english march said and when he had understood the other laughed for pleasure and reported the compliment to his wife in their own parlance you germans certainly beat us in languages  oh well he retaliated the americans beat us in some other things and mrs march felt that this was but just she would have liked to mention a few but not ungraciously she and the german lady kept smiling across the table and trying detached vocables of their respective tongues upon each other  the bavarian said he lived in munich still but was in ansbach on an affair of business he asked march if he were not going to see the manoeuvres somewhere till now the manoeuvres had merely been the interesting background of their travel but now hearing that the emperor of germany the king of saxony the regent of bavaria and the king of wurtemberg the granddukes of weimar and baden with visiting potentates of all sorts and innumerable lesser highhotes foreign and domestic were to be present mrs march resolved that they must go to at least one of the reviews  if you go to frankfort you can see the king of italy too said the bavarian but he owned that they probably could not get into a hotel there and he asked why they should not go to wurzburg where they could see all the sovereigns except the king of italy  wurzburg wurzburg march queried of his wife where did we hear of that place  isnt it where burnamy said mr stoller had left his daughters at school  so it is and is that on the way to the rhine he asked the bavarian  no no wurzburg is on the main about five hours from ansbach and it is a very interesting place it is where the good wine comes from  oh yes said march and in their rooms his wife got out all their guides and maps and began to inform herself and to inform him about wurzburg but first she said it was very cold and he must order some fire made in the tall german stove in their parlor the maid who came said gleich but she did not come back and about the time they were getting furious at her neglect they began getting warm he put his hand on the stove and found it hot then he looked down for a door in the stove where he might shut a damper there was no door  good heavens he shouted its like something in a dream and he ran to pull the bell for help  no no dont ring it will make us ridiculous theyll think americans dont know anything there must be some way of dampening the stove and if there isnt id rather suffocate than give myself away mrs march ran and opened the window while her husband carefully examined the stove at every point and explored the pipe for the damper in vain cant you find it the night wind came in raw and damp and threatened to blow their lamp out and she was obliged to shut the window  not a sign of it i will go down and ask the landlord in strict confidence how they dampen their stoves in ansbach  well if you must its getting hotter every moment she followed him timorously into the corridor lit by a hanging lamp turned low for the night  he looked at his watch it was eleven oclock im afraid theyre all in bed  yes you mustnt go we must try to find out for ourselves what can that door be for  it was a low iron door half the height of a man in the wall near their room and it yielded to his pull get a candle he whispered and when she brought it he stooped to enter the doorway  oh do you think youd better she hesitated  you can come too if youre afraid youve always said you wanted to die with me  well but you go first  he disappeared within and then came back to the doorway just come in here a moment she found herself in a sort of antechamber half the height of her own room and following his gesture she looked down where in one corner some crouching monster seemed showing its fiery teeth in a grin of derision this grin was the damper of their stove and this was where the maid had kindled the fire which had been roasting them alive and was still joyously chuckling to itself i think that munich man was wrong i dont believe we beat the germans in anything there isnt a hotel in the united states where the stoves have no front doors and every one of them has the space of a goodsized flat given up to the convenience of kindling a fire in it     l  after a red sunset of shameless duplicity march was awakened to a rainy morning by the clinking of cavalry hoofs on the pavement of the longirregular square before the hotel and he hurried out to see the passing of the soldiers on their way to the manoeuvres they were troops of all arms but mainly infantry and as they stumped heavily through the groups of apathetic citizens in their mudsplashed boots they took the steady downpour on their dripping helmets some of them were smoking but none smiling except one gay fellow who made a joke to a servingmaid on the sidewalk an old officer halted his staff to scold a citizen who had given him a mistaken direction the shame of the erring man was great and the pride of a fellowcitizen who corrected him was not less though the arrogant brute before whom they both cringed used them with equal scorn the younger officers listened indifferently round on horseback behind the glitter of their eyeglasses and one of them amused himself by turning the silver bangles on his wrist  then the files of soldier slaves passed on and march crossed the bridge spanning the gardens in what had been the city moat and found his way to the marketplace under the walls of the old gothic church of st gumpertus the market which spread pretty well over the square seemed to be also a fair with peasants clothes and local pottery for sale as well as fruits and vegetables and large baskets of flowers with old women squatting before them it was all as picturesque as the markets used to be in montreal and quebec and in a cloudy memory of his wedding journey long before he bought so lavishly of the flowers to carry back to his wife that a little girl who saw his armload from her window as he returned laughed at him and then drew shyly back her laugh reminded him how many happy children he had seen in germany and how freely they seemed to play everywhere with no one to make them afraid when they grow up the women laugh as little as the men whose rude toil the soldiering leaves them to  he got home with his flowers and his wife took them absently and made him join her in watching the sight which had fascinated her in the street under their windows a slender girl with a waist as slim as a corseted officers from time to time came out of the house across the way to the firewood which had been thrown from a wagon upon the sidewalk there each time she embraced several of the heavy fourfoot logs and disappeared with them indoors once she paused from her work to joke with a welldressed man who came by and seemed to find nothing odd in her work some gentlemen lounging at the window over head watched her with no apparent sense of anomaly  what do you think of that asked mrs march i think its good exercise for the girl and i should like to recommend it to those fat fellows at the window i suppose shell saw the wood in the cellar and then lug it up stairs and pile it up in the stoves dressingrooms  dont laugh its too disgraceful  well i dont know if you like ill offer these gentlemen across the way your opinion of it in the language of goethe and schiller  i wish youd offer my opinion of them theyve been staring in here with an operaglass  ah thats a different affair there isnt much going on in ansbach and they have to make the most of it  the lower casements of the houses were furnished with mirrors set at right angles with them and nothing which went on in the streets was lost some of the streets were long and straight and at rare moments they lay full of sun at such times the marches were puzzled by the sight of citizens carrying open umbrellas and they wondered if they had forgotten to put them down or thought it not worth while in the brief respites from the rain or were profiting by such rare occasions to dry them and some other sights remained baffling to the last once a man with his hands pinioned before him and a gendarme marching stolidly after him with his musket on his shoulder passed under their windows but who he was or what he had done or was to suffer they never knew another time a pair went by on the way to the railway station a young man carrying an umbrella under his arm and a very decentlooking old woman lugging a heavy carpet bag who left them to the lasting question whether she was the young mans servant in her best clothes or merely his mother  women do not do everything in ansbach however the sacristans being men as the marches found when they went to complete their impression of the courtly past of the city by visiting the funeral chapel of the margraves in the crypt of st johannis church in the little exmargravely capital there was something of the neighborly interest in the curiosity of strangers which endears italian witness the whitehaired streetsweeper of ansbach who willingly left his broom to guide them to the house of the sacristan might have been a streetsweeper in vicenza and the old sacristan when he put his velvet skullcap out of an upper window and professed his willingness to show them the chapel disappointed them by saying gleich instead of subito the architecture of the houses was a party to the illusion st johannis like the older church of st gumpertus is gothic with the two unequal towers which seem distinctive of ansbach at the st gumpertus end of the place where they both stand the dwellings are gothic too and might be in hamburg but at the st johannis end they seem to have felt the exotic spirit of the court and are of a sort of teutonized renaissance  the rococo margraves and margravines used of course to worship in st johannis church now they all such as did not marry abroad lie in the crypt of the church in caskets of bronze and copper and marble with draperies of black samite more and more funereally vainglorious to the last their courtly coffins are ranged in a kind of hemicycle with the little coffins of the children that died before they came to the knowledge of their greatness on one of these a kneeling figurine in bronze holds up the effigy of the child within on another the epitaph plays tenderly with the fate of a little princess who died in her first year       in the rosemonth was this sweet rose taken      for the rosekind hath she earth forsaken      the princess is the rose that here no longer blows      from the stem by deaths hand rudely shaken      then rest in the rosehouse      little princessrosebud dear      there lifes rose shall bloom again      in heavens sunshine clear  while march struggled to get this into english words two german ladies who had made themselves of his party passed reverently away and left him to pay the sacristan alone  that is all right he said when he came out i think we got the most value and they didnt look as if they could afford it so well though you never can tell here these ladies may be the highest kind of highhotes practising a praiseworthy economy i hope the lesson wont be lost on us they have saved enough by us for their coffee at the orangery let us go and have a little willowleaf tea  the orangery perpetually lured them by what it had kept of the days when an orangery was essential to the selfrespect of every sovereign prince and of so many private gentlemen on their way they always passed the statue of count platen the dull poet whom heines hate would have delivered so cruelly over to an immortality of contempt but who stands there near the schloss in a grassplot prettily planted with flowers and ignores his brilliant enemy in the comfortable durability of bronze and there always awaited them in the old pleasaunce the pathos of kaspar hausers fate which his murder affixes to it with a red stain  after their cups of willow leaves at the cafe they went up into that nook of the plantation where the simple shaft of churchwardens gothic commemorates the assassination on the spot where it befell here the hapless youth whose mystery will never be fathomed on earth used to come for a little respite from his harsh guardian in ansbach homesick for the kindness of his nuremberg friends and here his murderer found him and dealt him the mortal blow  march lingered upon the last sad circumstance of the tragedy in which the wounded boy dragged himself home to suffer the suspicion and neglect of his guardian till death attested his good faith beyond cavil he said this was the hardest thing to bear in all his story and that he would like to have a look into the soul of the dull unkind wretch who had so misread his charge he was going on with an inquiry that pleased him much when his wife pulled him abruptly away  now i see you are yielding to the fascination of it and you are wanting to take the material from burnamy  oh well let him have the material he will spoil it and i can always reject it if he offers it to every other week  i could believe after your behavior to that poor woman about her son in jersey city youre really capable of it  what comprehensive inculpation i had forgotten about that poor woman     li  the letters which march had asked his nuremberg banker to send them came just as they were leaving ansbach the landlord sent them down to the station and mrs march opened them in the train and read them first so that she could prepare him if there were anything annoying in them as well as indulge her livelier curiosity  theyre from both the children she said without waiting for him to ask you can look at them later theres a very nice letter from mrs adding to me and one from dear little rose for you then she hesitated with her hand on a letter faced down in her lap and theres one from agatha triscoe which i wonder what youll think of she delayed again and then flashed it open before him and waited with a sort of impassioned patience while he read it  he read it and gave it back to her there doesnt seem to be very much in it  thats it dont you think i had a right to there being something in it after all i did for her  i always hoped you hadnt done anything for her but if you have why should she give herself away on paper its a very proper letter  its a little too proper and its the last i shall have to do with her she knew that i should be on pins and needles till i heard how her father had taken burnamys being there that night and she doesnt say a word about it  the general may have had a tantrum that she couldnt describe perhaps she hasnt told him yet  she would tell him instantly cried mrs march who began to find reason in the supposition as well as comfort for the hurt which the girls reticence had given her or if she wouldnt it would be because she was waiting for the best chance  that would be like the wise daughter of a difficult father she may be waiting for the best chance to say how he took it no im all for miss triscoe and i hope that now if shes taken herself off our hands shell keep off  its altogether likely that hes made her promise not to tell me anything about it mrs march mused aloud  that would be unjust to a person who had behaved so discreetly as you have said her husband  they were on their way to wurzburg and at the first station which was a junction a lady mounted to their compartment just before the train began to move she was stout and middleaged and had never been pretty but she bore herself with a kind of authority in spite of her thread gloves her dowdy gray travellingdress and a hat of lower middleclass english tastelessness she took the only seat vacant a backwardriding place beside a sleeping passenger who looked like a commercial traveller but she seemed ill at ease in it and march offered her his seat she accepted it very promptly and thanked him for it in the english of a german and mrs march now classed her as a governess who had been teaching in england and had acquired the national feeling for dress but in this character she found her interesting and even a little pathetic and she made her some overtures of talk which the other met eagerly enough they were now running among low hills not so picturesque as those between eger and nuremberg but of much the same toylike quaintness in the villages dropped here and there in their valleys one small town completely walled with its gray houses and red roofs showed through the green of its trees and gardens so like a colored print in a childs storybook that mrs march cried out for joy in it and then accounted for her rapture by explaining to the stranger that they were americans and had never been in germany before the lady was not visibly affected by the fact she said casually that she had often been in that little town which she named her uncle had a castle in the country back of it and she came with her husband for the shooting in the autumn by a natural transition she spoke of her children for whom she had an english governess she said she had never been in england but had learnt the language from a governess in her own childhood and through it all mrs march perceived that she was trying to impress them with her consequence to humor her pose she said they had been looking up the scene of kaspar hausers death at ansbach and at this the stranger launched into such intimate particulars concerning him and was so familiar at first hands with the facts of his life that mrs march let her run on too much amused with her pretensions to betray any doubt of her she wondered if march were enjoying it all as much and from time to time she tried to catch his eye while the lady talked constantly and rather loudly helping herself out with words from them both when her english failed her in the safety of her perfect understanding of the case mrs march now submitted farther and even suffered some patronage from her which in another mood she would have met with a decided snub  as they drew in among the broad vinewebbed slopes of the wurzburg hills the stranger said she was going to change there and take a train on to berlin mrs march wondered whether she would be able to keep up the comedy to the last and she had to own that she carried it off very easily when the friends whom she was expecting did not meet her on the arrival of their train she refused marchs offers of help and remained quietly seated while he got out their wraps and bags she returned with a hardy smile the cold leave mrs march took of her and when a porter came to the door and forced his way by the marches to ask with anxious servility if she were the baroness von she bade the man get them a traeger and then come back for her she waved them a complacent adieu before they mixed with the crowd and lost sight of her  well my dear said march addressing the snobbishness in his wife which he knew to be so wholly impersonal youve mingled with one highhote anyway i must say she didnt look it any more than the duke and duchess of orleans and yet shes only a baroness think of our being three hours in the same compartment and she doing all she could to impress us and our getting no good of it i hoped you were feeling her quality so that we should have it in the family anyway and always know what it was like but so far the highhotes have all been terribly disappointing  he teased on as they followed the traeger with their baggage out of the station and in the omnibus on the way to their hotel he recurred to the loss they had suffered in the baronesss failure to dramatize her nobility effectually after all perhaps she was as much disappointed in us i dont suppose we looked any more like democrats than she looked like an aristocrat  but theres a great difference mrs march returned at last it isnt at all a parallel case we were not real democrats and she was a real aristocrat  to be sure there is that way of looking at it thats rather novel i wish i had thought of that myself she was certainly more to blame than we were     lii  the square in front of the station was planted with flagpoles wreathed in evergreens a triumphal arch was nearly finished and a colossal allegory in imitation bronze was well on the way to completion in honor of the majesties who were coming for the manoeuvres the streets which the omnibus passed through to the swan inn were draped with the imperial german and the royal bavarian colors and the standards of the visiting nationalities decked the fronts of the houses where their military attaches were lodged but the marches failed to see our own banner and were spared for the moment the ignominy of finding it over an apothecary shop in a retired avenue the sun had come out the sky overhead was of a smiling blue and they felt the galaday glow and thrill in the depths of their inextinguishable youth  the swan inn sits on one of the long quays bordering the main and its windows look down upon the bridges and shipping of the river but the traveller reaches it by a door in the rear through an archway into a back street where an odor dating back to the foundation of the city is waiting to welcome him  the landlord was there too and he greeted the marches so cordially that they fully partook his grief in being able to offer them rooms on the front of the house for two nights only they reconciled themselves to the necessity of then turning out for the staff of the king of saxony the more readily because they knew that there was no hope of better things at any other hotel  the rooms which they could have for the time were charming and they came down to supper in a glazed gallery looking out on the river picturesque with craft of all fashions with rowboats sailboats and little steamers but mainly with long black barges built up into houses in the middle and defended each by a little nervous german dog long rafts of logs weltered in the sunset red which painted the swift current and mantled the immeasurable vineyards of the hills around like the color of their ripening grapes directly in face rose a castled steep which kept the ranging walls and the bastions and battlements of the time when such a stronghold could have defended the city from foes without or from tumult within the arches of a stately bridge spanned the river sunsetward and lifted a succession of colossal figures against the crimson sky  i guess we have been wasting our time my dear said march as they turned from this beauty to the question of supper i wish we had always been here  their waiter had put them at a table in a division of the gallery beyond that which they entered where some groups of officers were noisily supping there was no one in their room but a man whose face was indistinguishable against the light and two young girls who glanced at them with looks at once quelled and defiant and then after a stare at the officers in the gallery beyond whispered together with suppressed giggling the man fed on without noticing them except now and then to utter a growl that silenced the whispering and giggling for a moment the marches from no positive evidence of any sense decided that they were americans  i dont know that i feel responsible for them as their fellowcountryman i should once he said  it isnt that its the worry of trying to make out why they are just what they are his wife returned  the girls drew the mans attention to them and he looked at them for the first time then after a sort of hesitation he went on with his supper they had only begun theirs when he rose with the two girls whom mrs march now saw to be of the same size and dressed alike and came heavily toward them  i thought you was in carlsbad he said bluntly to march with a nod at mrs march he added with a twist of his head toward the two girls my daughters and then left them to her while he talked on with her husband come to see this foolery i suppose im on my way to the woods for my aftercure but i thought i might as well stop and give the girls a chance they got a weeks vacation anyway stoller glanced at them with a sort of troubled tenderness in his strong dull face  oh yes i understood they were at school here said march and he heard one of them saying in a sweet high pipe to his wife  aint it just splendid i hant seen anything equal to it since the worrlds fairr she spoke with a strong contortion of the western r and her sister hastened to put in  i dont think its to be compared with the worrlds fairr but these german girls here just think its great it just does me good to laff at em about it i like to tell em about the electric fountain and the courrt of lionorr when they get to talkin about the illuminations theyre goun to have you goun out to the parade you better engage your carriage right away if you arre the carrsll be a perfect jam fathers engaged ourrs he had to pay sixty marrks forr it  they chattered on without shyness and on as easy terms with a woman of three times their years as if she had been a girl of their own age they willingly took the whole talk to themselves and had left her quite outside of it before stoller turned to her  i been telling mr march here that you better both come to the parade with us i guess my twospanner will hold five or if it wont well make it i dont believe theres a carriage left in wurzburg and if you go in the cars youll have to walk three or four miles before you get to the paradeground you think it over he said to march nobody else is going to have the places anyway and you can say yes at the last minute just as well as now  he moved off with his girls who looked over their shoulders at the officers as they passed on through the adjoining room  my dear cried mrs march didnt you suppose he classed us with burnamy in that business why should he be polite to us  perhaps he wants you to chaperon his daughters hes probably heard of your performance at the kurhaus ball but he knows that i thought burnamy in the wrong this may be stollers way of wiping out an obligation wouldnt you like to go with him  the mere thought of his being in the same town is prostrating id far rather he hated us then he would avoid us  well he doesnt own the town and if it comes to the worst perhaps we can avoid him let us go out anyway and see if we cant  no no im too tired but you go and get all the maps and guides you can theres so very little in baedeker and almost nothing in that great hulking bradshaw of yours and im sure there must be the most interesting history of wurzburg isnt it strange that we havent the slightest association with the name  ive been rummaging in my mind and ive got hold of an association at last said march its beer a sign in a sixth avenue saloon window wurzburger hofbrau  no matter if it is beer find some sketch of the history and well try to get away from the stollers in it i pitied those wild girls too what crazy images of the world must fill their empty minds how their ignorant thoughts must go whirling out into the unknown i dont envy their father do hurry back i shall be thinking about them every instant till you come  she said this but in their own rooms it was so soothing to sit looking through the long twilight at the lovely landscape that the sort of bruise given by their encounter with the stollers had left her consciousness before march returned she made him admire first the convent church on a hill further up the river which exactly balanced the fortress in front of them and then she seized upon the little books he had brought and set him to exploring the labyrinths of their german with a mounting exultation in his discoveries there was a general guide to the city and a special guide with plans and personal details of the approaching manoeuvres and the princes who were to figure in them and there was a sketch of the local history a kind of thing that the germans know how to write particularly well with little gleams of pleasant humor blinking through it for the study of this mrs march realized more and more passionately that they were in the very most central and convenient point for the history of wurzburg might be said to have begun with her princebishops whose rule had begun in the twelfth century and who had built on a forgotten roman work the fortress of the marienburg on that vineyarded hill over against the swan inn there had of course been history before that but nothing so clear nothing so peculiarly swell nothing that so united the glory of this world and the next as that of the princebishops they had made the marienburg their home and kept it against foreign and domestic foes for five hundred years shut within its wellarmed walls they had awed the oftenturbulent city across the main they had held it against the embattled farmers in the peasants war and had splendidly lost it to gustavus adolphus and then got it back again and held it till napoleon took it from them he gave it with their flock to the bavarians who in turn briefly yielded it to the prussians in 1866 and were now in apparently final possession of it  before the princebishops charlemagne and barbarossa had come and gone and since the princebishops there had been visiting thrones and kingdoms enough in the ancient city which was soon to be illustrated by the presence of imperial germany royal wirtemberg and saxony grandducal baden and weimar and a surfeit of all the minor potentates among those who speak the beautiful language of the ja  but none of these could dislodge the princebishops from that supreme place which they had at once taken in mrs marchs fancy the potentates were all going to be housed in the vast palace which the princebishops had built themselves in wurzburg as soon as they found it safe to come down from their stronghold of marienburg and begin to adorn their city and to confirm it in its intense fidelity to the church tiepolo had come up out of italy to fresco their palace where he wrought year after year in that worldly taste which has somehow come to express the most sovereign moment of ecclesiasticism it prevailed so universally in wurzburg that it left her with the name of the rococo city intrenched in a period of time equally remote from early christianity and modern protestantism out of her sixty thousand souls only ten thousand are now of the reformed religion and these bear about the same relation to the catholic spirit of the place that the gothic architecture bears to the baroque  as long as the princebishops lasted the wurzburgers got on very well with but one newspaper and perhaps the smallest amount of merrymaking known outside of the colony of massachusetts bay at the same epoch the princebishops had their finger in everybodys pie and they portioned out the cakes and ale which were made according to formulas of their own the distractions were all of a religious character churches convents monasteries abounded ecclesiastical processions and solemnities were the spectacles that edified if they did not amuse the devout population  it seemed to march an ironical outcome of all this spiritual severity that one of the greatest modern scientific discoveries should have been made in wurzburg and that the roentgen rays should now be giving her name a splendor destined to eclipse the glories of her past  mrs march could not allow that they would do so or at least that the name of roentgen would ever lend more lustre to his city than that of longfellows walther von der vogelweide she was no less surprised than pleased to realize that this friend of the birds was a wurzburger and she said that their first pilgrimage in the morning should be to the church where he lies buried     liii  march went down to breakfast not quite so early as his wife had planned and left her to have her coffee in her room he got a pleasant table in the gallery overlooking the river and he decided that the landscape though it now seemed to be rather too much studied from a dropcertain had certainly lost nothing of its charm in the clear morning light the waiter brought his breakfast and after a little delay came back with a card which he insisted was for march it was not till he put on his glasses and read the name of mr r m kenby that he was able at all to agree with the waiter who stood passive at his elbow  well he said why wasnt this card sent up last night  the waiter explained that the gentleman had just given him his card after asking marchs nationality and was then breakfasting in the next room march caught up his napkin and ran round the partition wall and kenby rose with his napkin and hurried to meet him  i thought it must be you he called out joyfully as they struck their extended hands together but so many people look alike nowadays that i dont trust my eyes any more  kenby said he had spent the time since they last met partly in leipsic and partly in gotha where he had amused himself in rubbing up his rusty german as soon as he realized that wurzburg was so near he had slipped down from gotha for a glimpse of the manoeuvres he added that he supposed march was there to see them and he asked with a quite unembarrassed smile if they had met mr adding in carlsbad and without heeding marchs answer he laughed and added of course i know she must have told mrs march all about it  march could not deny this he laughed too though in his wifes absence he felt bound to forbid himself anything more explicit  i dont give it up you know kenby went on with perfect ease im not a young fellow if you call thirtynine old  at my age i dont march put in and they roared together in mens security from the encroachments of time  but she happens to be the only woman ive ever really wanted to marry for more than a few days at a stretch you know how it is with us  oh yes i know said march and they shouted again  were in love and were out of love twenty times but this isnt a mere fancy its a conviction and theres no reason why she shouldnt marry me  march smiled gravely and his smile was not lost upon kenby you mean the boy he said well i like rose and now march really felt swept from his feet she doesnt deny that she likes me but she seems to think that her marrying again will take her from him the fact is it will only give me to him as for devoting her whole life to him she couldnt do a worse thing for him what the boy needs is a mans care and a mans willgood heavens you dont think i could ever be unkind to the little soul kenby threw himself forward over the table  my dear fellow march protested  id rather cut off my right hand kenby pursued excitedly and then he said with a humorous drop the fact is i dont believe i should want her so much if i couldnt have rose too i want to have them both so far ive only got no for an answer but im not going to keep it i had a letter from rose at carlsbad the other day and  the waiter came forward with a folded scrap of paper on his salver which march knew must be from his wife what is keeping you so she wrote i am all ready its from mrs march he explained to kenby i am going out with her on some errands im awfully glad to see you again we must talk it all over and you mustyou mustntmrs march will want to see you lateriare you in the hotel  oh yes ill see you at the oneoclock table dhote i suppose  march went away with his head whirling in the question whether he should tell his wife at once of kenbys presence or leave her free for the pleasures of wurzburg till he could shape the fact into some safe and acceptable form she met him at the door with her guidebooks wraps and umbrellas and would hardly give him time to get on his hat and coat  now i want you to avoid the stollers as far as you can see them this is to be a real weddingjourney day with no extraneous acquaintance to bother the more strangers the better wurzburg is richer than anything i imagined ive looked it all up ive got the plan of the city so that we can easily find the way well walk first and take carriages whenever we get tired well go to the cathedral at once i want a good gulp of rococo to begin with there wasnt half enough of it at ansbach isnt it strange how weve come round to it  she referred to that passion for the gothic which they had obediently imbibed from ruskin in the days of their early italian travel and courtship when all the englishspeaking world bowed down to him in devout aversion from the renaissance and pious abhorrence of the rococo  what biddable little things we were she went on while march was struggling to keep kenby in the background of his consciousness the rococo must have always had a sneaking charm for us when we were pinning our faith to pointed arches and yet i suppose we were perfectly sincere oh look at that divinely ridiculous madonna they were now making their way out of the crooked footway behind their hotel toward the street leading to the cathedral and she pointed to the blessed virgin over the door of some religious house her drapery billowing about her feet her body twisting to show the sculptors mastery of anatomy and the halo held on her tossing head with the help of stout gilt rays in fact the virgins whole figure was gilded and so was that of the child in her arms isnt she delightful  i see what you mean said march with a dubious glance at the statue but im not sure now that i wouldnt like something quieter in my madonnas  the thoroughfare which they emerged upon with the cathedral ending the prospective was full of the holiday so near at hand the narrow sidewalks were thronged with people both soldiers and civilians and up the middle of the street detachments of military came and went halting the little horsecars and the huge beerwagons which otherwise seemed to have the sole right to the streets of wurzburg they came jingling or thundering out of the aide streets and hurled themselves round the corners reckless of the passers who escaped alive by flattening themselves like posters against the house walls there were peasants men and women in the costume which the unbroken course of their country life had kept as quaint as it was a hundred years before there were citizens in the misfits of the latest german fashions there were soldiers of all arms in their vivid uniforms and from time to time there were pretty young girls in white dresses with low necks and bare arms gloved to the elbows who were following a holiday custom of the place in going about the streets in ball costume the shop windows were filled with portraits of the emperor and the empress and the princeregent and the ladies of his family the german and bavarian colors draped the facades of the houses and festooned the fantastic madonnas posing above so many portals the modern patriotism included the ancient piety without disturbing it the rococo city remained ecclesiastical through its new imperialism and kept the stamp given it by the long rule of the princebishops under the sovereignty of its king and the suzerainty of its kaiser  the marches escaped from the present when they entered the cathedral as wholly as if they had taken hold of the horns of the altar though they were far from literally doing this in an interior so grandiose there area few rococo churches in italy and perhaps more in spain which approach the perfection achieved by the wurzburg cathedral in the baroque style for once one sees what that style can do in architecture and sculpture and whatever one may say of the details one cannot deny that there is a prodigiously effective keeping in it all this interior came together as the decorators say with a harmony that the travellers had felt nowhere in their earlier experience of the rococo it was unimpeachably perfect in its way just march murmured to his wife as the social and political and scientific scheme of the eighteenth century was perfected in certain times and places but the odd thing is to find the apotheosis of the rococo away up here in germany i wonder how much the princebishops really liked it but they had become rococo too look at that row of their statues on both sides of the nave what magnificent swell how they abash this poor plain christ here he would like to get behind the pillar he knows that he could never lend himself to the baroque style it expresses the eighteenth century though but how you long for some little hint of the thirteenth or even the nineteenth  i dont she whispered back im perfectly wild with wurzburg i like to have a thing go as far as it can at nuremberg i wanted all the gothic i could get and in wurzburg i want all the baroque i can get i am consistent  she kept on praising herself to his disadvantage as women do all the way to the neumunster church where they were going to revere the tomb of walther von der vogelweide not so much for his own sake as for longfellows the older poet lies buried within but his monument is outside the church perhaps for the greater convenience of the sparrows which now represent the birds he loved the cenotaph is surmounted by a broad vase and around this are thickly perched the effigies of the meistersingers feathered friends from whom the canons of the church as mrs march read aloud from her baedeker long ago directed his bequest to themselves in revenge for their lawless greed the defrauded beneficiaries choose to burlesque the affair by looking like the fourandtwenty blackbirds when the pie was opened  she consented to go for a moment to the gothic marienkapelle with her husband in the revival of his mediaeval taste and she was rewarded amidst its thirteenthcentury sincerity by his recantation you are right baroque is the thing for wurzburg one cant enjoy gothic here any more than one could enjoy baroque in nuremberg  reconciled in the rococo they now called a carriage and went to visit the palace of the princebishops who had so well known how to make the heavenly take the image and superscription of the worldly and they were jointly indignant to find it shut against the public in preparation for the imperialities and royalties coming to occupy it they were in time for the noon guardmounting however and mrs march said that the way the retiring squad kicked their legs out in the high martial step of the german soldiers was a perfect expression of the insolent militarism of their empire and was of itself enough to make one thank heaven that one was an american and a republican she softened a little toward their system when it proved that the garden of the palace was still open and yet more when she sank down upon a bench between two marble groups representing the rape of proserpine and the rape of europa they stood each in a gravelled plot thickly overrun by a growth of ivy and the vine climbed the white naked limbs of the nymphs who were present on a pretence of gathering flowers but really to pose at the spectators and clad them to the waist and shoulders with an effect of modesty never meant by the sculptor but not displeasing there was an old fountain near its stone rim and centre of rockwork green with immemorial mould and its basin quivering between its waterplants under the soft fall of spray at a waft of fitful breeze some leaves of early autumn fell from the trees overhead upon the elderly pair where they sat and a little company of sparrows came and hopped about their feet though the square without was so all astir with festive expectation there were few people in the garden three or four peasant women in densely fluted white skirts and red aprons and shawls wandered by and stared at the europa and at the proserpine  it was a precious moment in which the charm of the citys past seemed to culminate and they were loath to break it by speech  why didnt we have something like all this on our first wedding journey she sighed at last to think of our battening from boston to niagara and back and how hard we tried to make something of rochester and buffalo of montreal and quebec  niagara wasnt so bad he said and i will never go back on quebec  ah but if we could have had hamburg and leipsic and carlsbad and nuremberg and ansbach and wurzburg perhaps this is meant as a compensation for our lost youth but i cant enjoy it as i could when i was young its wasted on my sere and yellow leaf i wish burnamy and miss triscoe were here i should like to try this garden on them  they wouldnt care for it he replied and upon a daring impulse he added kenby and mrs adding might if she took this suggestion in good part he could tell her that kenby was in wurzburg  dont speak of them theyre in just that besotted early middleage when life has settled into a selfsatisfied present with no past and no future the most philistine the most bourgeois moment of existence better be elderly at once as far as appreciation of all this goes she rose and put her hand on his arm and pushed him away in the impulsive fashion of her youth across alleys of old trees toward a balustraded terrace in the background which had tempted her  it isnt so bad being elderly he said by that time we have accumulated enough past to sit down and really enjoy its associations we have got all sorts of perspectives and points of view we know where we are at  i dont mind being elderly the worlds just as amusing as ever and lots of disagreeable things have dropped out its the getting more than elderly its the getting old and then  they shrank a little closer together and walked on in silence till he said perhaps theres something else something bettersomewhere  they had reached the balustraded terrace and were pausing for pleasure in the garden tops below with the flowery spaces and the statued fountains all coming together she put her hand on one of the fat little urchingroups on the stone coping i dont want cherubs when i can have these putti and those old princebishops didnt either  i dont suppose they kept a new england conscience he said with a vague smile it would be difficult in the presence of the rococo  they left the garden through the beautiful gate which the old court ironsmith oegg hammered out in lovely forms of leaves and flowers and shaped laterally upward as lightly as if with a waft of his hand in gracious louis quinze curves and they looked back at it in the kind of despair which any perfection inspires they said how feminine it was how exotic how expressive of a luxurious ideal of life which art had purified and left eternally charming they remembered their ruskinian youth and the confidence with which they would once have condemned it and they had a sense of recreance in now admiring it but they certainly admired it and it remained for them the supreme expression of that timesoul mundane courtly aristocratic flattering which once influenced the art of the whole world and which had here so curiously found its apotheosis in a city remote from its native place and under a rule sacerdotally vowed to austerity the vast superb palace of the prince bishops which was now to house a whole troop of sovereigns imperial royal grand ducal and ducal swelled aloft in superb amplitude but it did not realize their historic pride so effectively as this exquisite work of the court ironsmith it related itself in its aerial beauty to that of the tiepolo frescoes which the travellers knew were swimming and soaring on the ceilings within and from which it seemed to accent their exclusion with a delicate irony march said or ironmongery he corrected himself upon reflection     liv  he had forgotten kenby in these aesthetic interests but he remembered him again when he called a carriage and ordered it driven to their hotel it was the hour of the german midday table dhote and they would be sure to meet him there the question now was how march should own his presence in time to prevent his wife from showing her ignorance of it to kenby himself and he was still turning the question hopelessly over in his mind when the sight of the hotel seemed to remind her of a fact which she announced  now my dear i am tired to death and i am not going to sit through a long table dhote i want you to send me up a simple beefsteak and a cup of tea to our rooms and i dont want you to come near for hours because i intend to take a whole afternoon nap you can keep all the maps and plans and guides and you had better go and see what the volksfest is like it will give you some notion of the part the people are really taking in all this official celebration and you know i dont care dont come up after dinner to see how i am getting along i shall get along and if you should happen to wake me after i had dropped off  kenby had seen them arrive from where he sat at the readingroom window waiting for the dinner hour and had meant to rush out and greet mrs march as they passed up the corridor but she looked so tired that he had decided to spare her till she came down to dinner and as he sat with march at their soup he asked if she were not well  march explained and he provisionally invented some regrets from her that she should not see kenby till supper  kenby ordered a bottle of one of the famous wurzburg wines for their mutual consolation in her absence and in the friendliness which its promoted they agreed to spend the afternoon together no man is so inveterate a husband as not to take kindly an occasional release to bachelor companionship and before the dinner was over they agreed that they would go to the volksfest and get some notion of the popular life and amusements of wurzburg which was one of the few places where kenby had never been before and they agreed that they would walk  their way was partly up the quay of the main past a barrack full of soldiers they met detachments of soldiers everywhere infantry artillery cavalry  this is going to be a great show kenby said meaning the manoeuvres and he added as if now he had kept away from the subject long enough and had a right to recur to it at least indirectly i should like to have rose see it and get his impressions  ive an idea he wouldnt approve of it his mother says his mind is turning more and more to philanthropy  kenby could not forego such a chance to speak of mrs adding its one of the prettiest things to see how she understands rose its charming to see them together she wouldnt have half the attraction without him  oh yes march assented he had often wondered how a man wishing to marry a widow managed with the idea of her children by another marriage but if kenby was honest it was much simpler than he had supposed he could not say this to him however and in a certain embarrassment he had with the conjecture in his presence he attempted a diversion were promised something at the volksfest which will be a great novelty to us as americans our driver told us this morning that one of the houses there was built entirely of wood  when they reached the grounds of the volksfest this civil feature of the great military event at hand which the marches had found largely set forth in the programme of the parade did not fully keep the glowing promises made for it in fact it could not easily have done so it was in a pleasant neighborhood of new villas such as form the modern quarter of every german city and the volksfest was even more unfinished than its environment it was not yet enclosed by the fence which was to hide its wonders from the nonpaying public but march and kenby went in through an archway where the gatemoney was as effectually collected from them as if they were barred every other entrance  the wooden building was easily distinguishable from the other edifices because these were tents and booths still less substantial they did not make out its function but of the others four sheltered merrygorounds four were beergardens four were restaurants and the rest were devoted to amusements of the usual countryfair type apparently they had little attraction for country people the americans met few peasants in the grounds and neither at the edison kinematograph where they refreshed their patriotism with some scenes of their native life nor at the little theatre where they saw the sports of the arena revived in the wrestle of a woman with a bear did any of the people except tradesmen and artisans seem to be taking part in the festival expression of the popular pleasure  the woman who finally threw the bear whether by slight or by main strength or by a previous understanding with him was a slender creature pathetically small and not altogether plain and march as they walked away lapsed into a pensive muse upon her strange employ he wondered how she came to take it up and whether she began with the bear when they were both very young and she could easily throw him  well women have a great deal more strength than we suppose kenby began with a philosophical air that gave march the hope of some rational conversation then his eye glazed with a faroff look and a doting smile came into his face when we went through the dresden gallery together rose and i were perfectly used up at the end of an hour but his mother kept on as long as there was anything to see and came away as fresh as a peach  then march saw that it was useless to expect anything different from him and he let him talk on about mrs adding all the rest of the way back to the hotel kenby seemed only to have begun when they reached the door and wanted to continue the subject in the readingroom  march pleaded his wish to find how his wife had got through the afternoon and he escaped to her he would have told her now that kenby was in the house but he was really so sick of the fact himself that he could not speak of it at once and he let her go on celebrating all she had seen from the window since she had waked from her long nap she said she could never be glad enough that they had come just at that time soldiers had been going by the whole afternoon and that made it so feudal  yes he assented but arent you coming up to the station with me to see the princeregent arrive hes due at seven you know  i declare i had forgotten all about it no im not equal to it you must go you can tell me everything be sure to notice how the princess maria looks the last of the stuarts you know and some people consider her the rightful queen of england and ill have the supper ordered and we can go down as soon as youve got back     lv  march felt rather shabby stealing away without kenby but he had really had as much of mrs adding as he could stand for one day and he was even beginning to get sick of rose besides he had not sent back a line for every other week yet and he had made up his mind to write a sketch of the manoeuvres to this end he wished to receive an impression of the princeregents arrival which should not be blurred or clouded by other interests his wife knew the kind of thing he liked to see and would have helped him out with his observations but kenby would have got in the way and would have clogged the movement of his fancy in assigning the facts to the parts he would like them to play in the sketch  at least he made some such excuses to himself as he hurried along toward the kaiserstrasse the draught of universal interest in that direction had left the other streets almost deserted but as he approached the thoroughfare he found all the ways blocked and the horsecars ordinarily so furiously headlong arrested by the multiple ranks of spectators on the sidewalks the avenue leading from the railway station to the palace was decorated with flags and garlands and planted with the stems of young firs and birches the doorways were crowded and the windows dense with eager faces peering out of the draped bunting the carriageway was kept clear by mild policemen who now and then allowed one of the crowd to cross it  the crowd was made up mostly of women and boys and when march joined them they had already been waiting an hour for the sight of the princes who were to bless them with a vision of the faery race which kings always are to common men he thought the people looked dull and therefore able to bear the strain of expectation with patience better than a livelier race they relieved it by no attempt at joking here and there a dim smile dawned on a weary face but it seemed an effect of amiability rather than humor there was so little of this or else it was so well bridled by the solemnity of the occasion that not a man woman or child laughed when a bareheaded maidservant broke through the lines and ran down between them with a lifesize plaster bust of the emperor william in her arms she carried it like an overgrown infant and in alarm at her conspicuous part she cast frightened looks from side to side without arousing any sort of notice undeterred by her failure a young dog parted from his owner and seeking him in the crowd pursued his search in a wild flight down the guarded roadway with an air of anxiety that in america would have won him thunders of applause and all sorts of kindly encouragements to greater speed but this german crowd witnessed his progress apparently without interest and without a sign of pleasure they were there to see the princeregent arrive and they did not suffer themselves to be distracted by any preliminary excitement suddenly the indefinable emotion which expresses the fulfilment of expectation in a waiting crowd passed through the multitude and before he realized it march was looking into the friendly graybearded face of the princeregent for the moment that his carriage allowed in passing this came first preceded by four outriders and followed by other simple equipages of bavarian blue full of highnesses of all grades beside the regent sat his daughterinlaw the princess maria her silvered hair framing a face as plain and good as the regents if not so intelligent  he in virtue of having been born in wurzburg is officially supposed to be specially beloved by his fellow townsmen and they now testified their affection as he whirled through their ranks bowing right and left by what passes in germany for a cheer it is the word hoch groaned forth from abdominal depths and dismally prolonged in a hollow roar like that which the mob makes behind the scenes at the theatre before bursting in visible tumult on the stage then the crowd dispersed and march came away wondering why such a kindlylooking princeregent should not have given them a little longer sight of himself after they had waited so patiently for hours to see him but doubtless in those countries he concluded the art of keeping the sovereign precious by suffering him to be rarely and briefly seen is wisely studied  on his way home he resolved to confess kenbys presence and he did so as soon as he sat down to supper with his wife i ought to have told you the first thing after breakfast but when i found you in that mood of having the place all to ourselves i put it off  you took terrible chances my dear she said gravely  and i have been terribly punished youve no idea how much kenby has talked to me about mrs adding  she broke out laughing well perhaps youve suffered enough but you can see now cant you that it would have been awful if i had met him and let out that i didnt know he was here  terrible but if i had told it would have spoiled the whole morning for you you couldnt have thought of anything else  oh i dont know she said airily what should you think if i told you i had known he was here ever since last night she went on in delight at the start he gave i saw him come into the hotel while you were gone for the guidebooks and i determined to keep it from you as long as i could i knew it would worry you weve both been very nice and i forgive you she hurried on because ive really got something to tell you  dont tell me that burnamy is here  dont jump to conclusions no burnamy isnt here poor fellow and dont suppose that im guilty of concealment because i havent told you before i was just thinking whether i wouldnt spare you till morning but now i shall let you take the brunt of it mrs adding and rose are here she gave the fact time to sink in and then she added and miss triscoe and her father are here  what is the matter with major eltwin and his wife being here too are they in our hotel  no they are not they came to look for rooms while you were off waiting for the princeregent and i saw them they intended to go to frankfort for the manoeuvres but they heard that there was not even standingroom there and so the general telegraphed to the spanischer hof and they all came here as it is he will have to room with rose and agatha and mrs adding will room together i didnt think agatha was looking very well she looked unhappy i dont believe shes heard from burnamy yet i hadnt a chance to ask her and theres something else that im afraid will fairly make you sick  oh no go on i dont think anything can do that after an afternoon of kenbys confidences  its worse than kenby she said with a sigh you know i told you at carlsbad i thought that ridiculous old thing was making up to mrs adding  kenby why of co  dont be stupid my dear no not kenby general triscoe i wish you could have been here to see him paying her all sort of silly attentions and hear him making her compliments  thank you i think im just as well without it did she pay him silly attentions and compliments too  thats the only thing that can make me forgive her for his wanting her she was keeping him at armslength the whole time and she was doing it so as not to make him contemptible before his daughter  it must have been hard and rose  rose didnt seem very well he looks thin and pale but hes sweeter than ever shes certainly commoner clay than rose no i wont say that its really nothing but general triscoes being an old goose about her that makes her seem so and it isnt fair  march went down to his coffee in the morning with the delicate duty of telling kenby that mrs adding was in town kenby seemed to think it quite natural she should wish to see the manoeuvres and not at all strange that she should come to them with general triscoe and his daughter he asked if march would not go with him to call upon her after breakfast and as this was in the line of his own instructions from mrs march he went  they found mrs adding with the triscoes and march saw nothing that was not merely friendly or at the most fatherly in the generals behavior toward her if mrs adding or miss triscoe saw more they hid it in a guise of sisterly affection for each other at the most the general showed a gayety which one would not have expected of him under any conditions and which the fact that he and rose had kept each other awake a good deal the night before seemed so little adapted to call out he joked with rose about their room and their beds and put on a comradery with him that was not a perfect fit and that suffered by contrast with the pleasure of the boy and kenby in meeting there was a certain question in the attitude of mrs adding till march helped kenby to account for his presence then she relaxed in an effect of security so tacit that words overstate it and began to make fun of rose  march could not find that miss triscoe looked unhappy as his wife had said he thought simply that she had grown plainer but when he reported this she lost her patience with him in a girl she said plainness was unhappiness and she wished to know when he would ever learn to look an inch below the surface she was sure that agatha triscoe had not heard from burnamy since the emperors birthday that she was at swordspoints with her father and so desperate that she did not care what became of her  he had left kenby with the others and now after his wife had talked herself tired of them all he proposed going out again to look about the city where there was nothing for the moment to remind them of the presence of their friends or even of their existence she answered that she was worrying about all those people and trying to work out their problem for them he asked why she did not let them work it out themselves as they would have to do after all her worry and she said that where her sympathy had been excited she could not stop worrying whether it did any good or not and she could not respect any one who could drop things so completely out of his mind as he could she had never been able to respect that in him  i know my dear he assented but i dont think its a question of moral responsibility its a question of mental structure isnt it your consciousness isnt built in thoughttight compartments and one emotion goes all through it and sinks you but i simply close the doors and shut the emotion in and keep on  the fancy pleased him so much that he worked it out in all its implications and could not after their long experience of each other realize that she was not enjoying the joke too till she said she saw that he merely wished to tease then too late he tried to share her worry but she protested that she was not worrying at all that she cared nothing about those people that she was nervous she was tired and she wished he would leave her and go out alone  he found himself in the street again and he perceived that he must be walking fast when a voice called him by name and asked him what his hurry was the voice was stollers who got into step with him and followed the first with a second question  made up your mind to go to the manoeuvres with me  his bluntness made it easy for march to answer im afraid my wife couldnt stand the drive back and forth  come without her  thank you its very kind of you im not certain that i shall go at all if i do i shall run out by train and take my chances with the crowd  stoller insisted no further he felt no offence at the refusal of his offer or chose to show none he said with the same uncouth abruptness as before heard anything of that fellow since he left carlsbad  burnamy  mm  no  know where he is  i dont in the least  stoller let another silence elapse while they hurried on before he said i got to thinking what he done afterwards he wasnt bound to look out for me he might suppose i knew what i was about  march turned his face and stared in stollers which he was letting hang forward as he stamped heavily on had the disaster proved less than he had feared and did he still want burnamys help in patching up the broken pieces or did he really wish to do burnamy justice to his friend  in any case marchs duty was clear i think burnamy was bound to look out for you mr stoller and i am glad to know that he saw it in the same light  i know he did said stoker with a blaze as from a longsmouldering fury and damn him im not going to have it im not going to plead the baby act with him or with any man you tell him so when you get the chance you tell him i dont hold him accountable for anything i made him do that aint business i dont want him around me any more but if he wants to go back to the paper he can have his place you tell him i stand by what i done and its all right between him and me i haint done anything about it the way i wanted him to help me to ive let it lay and im agoing to i guess it aint going to do me any harm after all our people haint got very long memories but if it is let it you tell him its all right  i dont know where he is mr stoller and i dont know that i care to be the bearer of your message said march  why not  why for one thing i dont agree with you that its all right your choosing to stand by the consequences of burnamys wrong doesnt undo it as i understand you dont pardon it  stoller gulped and did not answer at once then he said i stand by what i done im not going to let him say i turned him down for doing what i told him to because i hadnt the sense to know what i was about  ah i dont think its a thing hell like to speak of in any case said march  stoller left him at the corner they had reached as abruptly as he had joined him and march hurried back to his wife and told her what had just passed between him and stoller  she broke out well i am surprised at you my dear you have always accused me of suspecting people and attributing bad motives and here youve refused even to give the poor man the benefit of the doubt he merely wanted to save his savage pride with you and thats all he wants to do with burnamy how could it hurt the poor boy to know that stoller doesnt blame him why should you refuse to give his message to burnamy i dont want you to ridicule me for my conscience any more basil youre twice as bad as i ever was dont you think that a person can ever expiate an offence ive often heard you say that if any one owned his fault he put it from him and it was the same as if it hadnt been and hasnt burnamy owned up over and over again im astonished at you dearest  march was in fact somewhat astonished at himself in the light of her reasoning but she went on with some sophistries that restored him to his selfrighteousness  i suppose you think he has interfered with stollers political ambition and injured him in that way well what if he has would it be a good thing to have a man like that succeed in politics youre always saying that the low character of our politicians is the ruin of the country and im sure she added with a prodigious leap over all the sequences that mr stoller is acting nobly and its your duty to help him relieve burnamys mind at the laugh he broke into she hastened to say or if you wont i hope youll not object to my doing so for i shall anyway  she rose as if she were going to begin at once in spite of his laughing and in fact she had already a plan for coming to stollers assistance by getting at burnamy through miss triscoe whom she suspected of knowing where he was there had been no chance for them to speak of him either that morning or the evening before and after a great deal of controversy with herself in her husbands presence she decided to wait till they came naturally together the next morning for the walk to the capuchin church on the hill beyond the river which they had agreed to take she could not keep from writing a note to miss triscoe begging her to be sure to come and hinting that she had something very important to speak of  she was not sure but she had been rather silly to do this but when they met the girl confessed that she had thought of giving up the walk and might not have come except for mrs marchs note she had come with rose and had left him below with march mrs adding was coming later with kenby and general triscoe  mrs march lost no time in telling her the great news and if she had been in doubt before of the girls feeling for burnamy she was now in none she had the pleasure of seeing her flush with hope and then the pain which was also a pleasure of seeing her blanch with dismay  i dont know where he is mrs march i havent heard a word from him since that night in carlsbad i expectedi didnt know but you  mrs march shook her head she treated the fact skillfully as something to be regretted simply because it would be such a relief to burnamy to know how mr stoller now felt of course they could reach him somehow you could always get letters to people in europe in the end and in fact it was altogether probable that he was that very instant in wurzburg for if the new yorkparis chronicle had wanted him to write up the wagner operas it would certainly want him to write up the manoeuvres she established his presence in wurzburg by such an irrefragable chain of reasoning that at a knock outside she was just able to kelp back a scream while she ran to open the door it was not burnamy as in compliance with every nerve it ought to have been but her husband who tried to justify his presence by saying that they were all waiting for her and miss triscoe and asked when they were coming  she frowned him silent and then shut herself outside with him long enough to whisper say shes got a headache or anything you please but dont stop talking here with me or i shall go wild she then shut herself in again with the effect of holding him accountable for the whole affair     lvi  general triscoe could not keep his irritation at hearing that his daughter was not coming out of the excuses he made to mrs adding he said again and again that it must seem like a discourtesy to her she gayly disclaimed any such notion she would not hear of putting off their excursion to another day it had been raining just long enough to give them a reasonable hope of a few hours drought and they might not have another dry spell for weeks she slipped off her jacket after they started and gave it to kenby but she let general triscoe hold her umbrella over her while he limped beside her she seemed to march as he followed with rose to be playing the two men off against each other with an ease which he wished his wife could be there to see and to judge aright  they crossed by the old bridge which is of the earliest years of the seventh century between rows of saints whose statues surmount the piers some are bishops as well as saints one must have been at rome in his day for he wore his long thick beard in the fashion of michelangelos moses he stretched out toward the passers two fingers of blessing and was unaware of the sparrow which had lighted on them and was giving him the effect of offering it to the public admiration squads of soldiers tramping by turned to look and smile and the dull faces of citizens lighted up at the quaint sight some children stopped and remained very quiet not to scare away the bird and a coldfaced spirituallooking priest paused among them as if doubting whether to rescue the absentminded bishop from a situation derogatory to his dignity but he passed on and then the sparrow suddenly flew off  rose adding had lingered for the incident with march but they now pushed on and came up with the others at the end of the bridge where they found them in question whether they had not better take a carriage and drive to the foot of the hill before they began their climb march thanked them but said he was keeping up the terms of his cure and was getting in all the walking he could rose begged his mother not to include him in the driving party he protested that he was feeling so well and the walk was doing him good his mother consented if he would promise not to get tired and then she mounted into the twospanner which had driven instinctively up to their party when their parley began and general triscoe took the place beside her while kenby with smiling patience seated himself in front  rose kept on talking with march about wurzburg and its history which it seemed he had been reading the night before when he could not sleep he explained we get little histories of the places wherever we go thats what mr kenby does you know  oh yes said march  i dont suppose i shall get a chance to read much here rose continued with general triscoe in the room he doesnt like the light  well well hes rather old you know and you musnt read too much rose it isnt good for you  i know but if i dont read i think and that keeps me awake worse of course i respect general triscoe for being in the war and getting wounded the boy suggested  a good many did it march was tempted to say  the boy did not notice his insinuation i suppose there were some things they did in the army and then they couldnt get over the habit but general grant says in his life that he never used a profane expletive  does general triscoe  rose answered reluctantly if anything wakes him in the night or if he cant make these german beds over to suit him  i see march turned his face to hide the smile which he would not have let the boy detect he thought best not to let rose resume his impressions of the general and in talk of weightier matters they found themselves at that point of the climb where the carriage was waiting for them from this point they followed an alley through ivied garden walls till they reached the first of the balustraded terraces which ascend to the crest of the hill where the church stands each terrace is planted with sycamores and the face of the terrace wall supports a bassrelief commemorating with the drama of its lifesize figures the stations of the cross  monks and priests were coming and going and dropped on the steps leading from terrace to terrace were women and children on their knees in prayer it was all richly reminiscent of pilgrim scenes in other catholic lands but here there was a touch of earnest in the northern face of the worshipers which the south had never imparted even in the beautiful rococo interior of the church at the top of the hill there was a sense of something deeper and truer than mere ecclesiasticism and march came out of it in a serious muse while the boy at his side did nothing to interrupt a vague regret filled his heart as he gazed silently out over the prospect of river and city and vineyard purpling together below the top where he stood and mixed with this regret was a vague resentment of his wifes absence she ought to have been there to share his pang and his pleasure they had so long enjoyed everything together that without her he felt unable to get out of either emotion all there was in it  the forgotten boy stole silently down the terraces after the rest of the party who had left him behind with march at the last terrace they stopped and waited and after a delay that began to be long to mrs adding she wondered aloud what could have become of them  kenby promptly offered to go back and see and she consented in seeming to refuse it isnt worth while rose has probably got mr march into some deep discussion and theyve forgotten all about us but if you will go mr kenby you might just remind rose of my existence she let him lay her jacket on her shoulders before he left her and then she sat down on one of the steps which general triscoe kept striking with the point of her umbrella as he stood before her  i really shall have to take it from you if you do that any more she said laughing up in his face im serious  he stopped i wish i could believe you were serious for a moment  you may if you think it will do you any good but i dont see why  the general smiled but with a kind of tremulous eagerness which might have been pathetic to any one who liked him do you know this is almost the first time i have spoken alone with you  really i hadnt noticed said mrs adding  general triscoe laughed in rather a ghastly way well thats encouraging at least to a man whos had his doubts whether it wasnt intended  intended by whom what do you mean general triscoe why in the world shouldnt you have spoken alone with me before  he was not with all his eagerness ready to say and while she smiled pleasantly she had the look in her eyes of being brought to bay and being prepared if it must come to that to have the worst over then and there she was not half his age but he was aware of her having no respect for his years compared with her average american past as he understood it his social place was much higher but she was not in the least awed by it in spite of his war record she was making him behave like a coward he was in a false position and if he had any one but himself to blame he had not her he read her equal knowledge of these facts in the clear eyes that made him flush and turn his own away  then he started with a quick hello and stood staring up at the steps from the terrace above where rose adding was staying himself weakly by a clutch of kenby on one side and march on the other  his mother looked round and caught herself up from where she sat and ran toward him oh rose  its nothing mother he called to her and as she dropped on her knees before him he sank limply against her it was like what i had in carlsbad thats all dont worry about me please  im not worrying rose she said with courage of the same texture as his own youve been walking too much you must go back in the carriage with us cant you have it come here she asked kenby  theres no road mrs adding but if rose would let me carry him  i can walk the boy protested trying to lift himself from her neck  no no you mustnt she drew away and let him fall into the arms that kenby put round him he raised the frail burden lightly to his shoulder and moved strongly away followed by the eyes of the spectators who had gathered about the little group but who dispersed now and went back to their devotions  march hurried after kenby with mrs adding whom he told he had just missed rose and was looking about for him when kenby came with her message for them they made sure that he was nowhere about the church and then started together down the terraces at the second or third station below they found the boy clinging to the barrier that protected the bassrelief from the zeal of the devotees he looked white and sick though he insisted that he was well and when he turned to come away with them he reeled and would have fallen if kenby had not caught him kenby wanted to carry him but rose would not let him and had made his way down between them  yea he has such a spirit she said and ive no doubt hes suffering now more from mr kenbys kindness than from his own sickness he had one of these giddy turns in carlsbad though and i shall certainly have a doctor to see him  i think i should mrs adding said march not too gravely for it seemed to him that it was not quite his business to alarm her further if she was herself taking the affair with that seriousness he questioned whether she was taking it quite seriously enough when she turned with a laugh and called to general triscoe who was limping down the steps of the last terrace behind them  oh poor general triscoe i thought you had gone on ahead  general triscoe could not enter into the joke of being forgotten apparently he assisted with gravity at the disposition of the party for the return when they all reached the carriage rose had the place beside his mother and kenby wished march to take his with the general and let him sit with the driver but he insisted that he would rather walk home and he did walk till they had driven out of eight then he called a passing onespanner and drove to his hotel in comfort and silence     lvii  kenby did not come to the swan before supper then he reported that the doctor had said rose was on the verge of a nervous collapse he had overworked at school but the immediate trouble was the high thin air which the doctor said he must be got out of at once into a quiet place at the seashore somewhere he had suggested ostend or some point on the french coast kenby had thought of schevleningen and the doctor had said that would do admirably  i understood from mrs adding he concluded that you were going there for your aftercure mr march and i didnt know but you might be going soon  at the mention of schevleningen the marches had looked at each other with a guilty alarm which they both tried to give the cast of affectionate sympathy but she dismissed her fear that he might be going to let his compassion prevail with him to his hurt when he said why we ought to have been there before this but ive been taking my life in my hands in trying to see a little of germany and im afraid now that mrs march has her mind too firmly fixed on berlin to let me think of going to schevleningen till weve been there  its too bad said mrs march with real regret i wish we were going but she had not the least notion of gratifying her wish and they were all silent till kenby broke out  look here you know how i feel about mrs adding ive been pretty frank with mr march myself and ive had my suspicions that shes been frank with you mrs march there isnt any doubt about my wanting to marry her and up to this time there hasnt been any doubt about her not wanting to marry me but it isnt a question of her or of me now its a question of rose i love the boy and kenbys voice shook and he faltered a moment pshaw you understand  indeed i do mr kenby said mrs march i perfectly understand you  well i dont think mrs adding is fit to make the journey with him alone or to place herself in the best way after she gets to schevleningen shes been badly shaken up she broke down before the doctor she said she didnt know what to do i suppose shes frightened  kenby stopped again and march asked when is she going  tomorrow said kenby and he added and now the question is why shouldnt i go with her  mrs march gave a little start and looked at her husband but he said nothing and kenby seemed not to have supposed that he would say anything  i know it would be very american and all that but i happen to be an american and it wouldnt be out of character for me i suppose he appealed to mrs march that its something i might offer to do if it were from new york to floridaand i happened to be going there and i did happen to be going to holland  why of course mr kenby she responded with such solemnity that march gave way in an outrageous laugh  kenby laughed and mrs march laughed too but with an inner note of protest  well kenby continued still addressing her what i want you to do is to stand by me when i propose it  mrs march gathered strength to say no mr kenby its your own affair and you must take the responsibility  do you disapprove  it isnt the same as it would be at home you see that yourself  well said kenby rising i have to arrange about their getting away tomorrow it wont be easy in this hurlyburly thats coming off  give rose our love and tell mrs adding that ill come round and see her tomorrow before she starts  oh im afraid you cant mrs march theyre to start at six in the morning  they are then we must go and see them tonight well be there almost as soon as you are  march went up to their rooms with his wife and she began on the stairs  well my dear i hope you realize that your laughing so gave us completely away and what was there to keep grinning about all through  nothing but the disingenuous hypocritical passion of love its always the most amusing thing in the world but to see it trying to pass itself off in poor old kenby as duty and humanity and disinterested affection for rose was more than i could stand i dont apologize for laughing i wanted to yell  his effrontery and his philosophy both helped to save him and she said from the point where he had sidetracked her mind i dont call it disingenuous he was brutally frank hes made it impossible to treat the affair with dignity i want you to leave the whole thing to me from this out now will you  on their way to the spanischer hof she arranged in her own mind for mrs adding to get a maid and for the doctor to send an assistant with her on the journey but she was in such despair with her scheme that she had not the courage to right herself when mrs adding met her with the appeal  oh mrs march im so glad you approve of mr kenbys plan it does seem the only thing to do i cant trust myself alone with rose and mr kenbys intending to go to schevleningen a few days later anyway though its too bad to let him give up the manoeuvres  im sure he wont mind that mrs marchs voice said mechanically while her thought was busy with the question whether this scandalous duplicity was altogether kenbys and whether mrs adding was as guiltless of any share in it as she looked she looked pitifully distracted she might not have understood his report or kenby might really have mistaken mrs marchs sympathy for favor  no he only lives to do good mrs adding returned hes with rose wont you come in and see them  rose was lying back on the pillows of a sofa from which they would not let him get up he was full of the trip to holland and had already pushed kenby as kenby owned beyond the bounds of his very general knowledge of the dutch language which rose had plans for taking up after they were settled in schevleningen the boy scoffed at the notion that he was not perfectly well and he wished to talk with march on the points where he had found kenby wanting  kenby is an encyclopaedia compared with me rose the editor protested and he amplified his ignorance for the boys good to an extent which rose saw was a joke he left holland to talk about other things which his mother thought quite as bad for him he wished to know if march did not think that the statue of the bishop with the sparrow on its finger was a subject for a poem and march said gayly that if rose would write it he would print it in every other week  the boy flushed with pleasure at his banter no i couldnt do it but i wish mr burnamy had seen it he could will you tell him about it he wanted to know if march had heard from burnamy lately and in the midst of his vivid interest he gave a weary sigh  his mother said that now he had talked enough and bade him say goodby to the marches who were coming so soon to holland anyway mrs march put her arms round him to kiss him and when she let him sink back her eyes were dim  you see how frail he is said mrs adding i shall not let him out of my sight after this till hes well again  she had a kind of authority in sending kenby away with them which was not lost upon the witnesses he asked them to come into the readingroom a moment with him and mrs march wondered if he were going to make some excuse to her for himself but he said i dont know how were to manage about the triscoes the general will have a room to himself but if mrs adding takes rose in with her it leaves miss triscoe out and there isnt a room to be had in this house for love or money do you think he appealed directly to mrs march that it would do to offer her my room at the swan  why yes she assented with a reluctance rather for the complicity in which he had already involved her and for which he was still unpunished than for what he was now proposing or she could come in with me and mr march could take it  whichever you think said kenby so submissively that she relented to ask  and what will you do  he laughed well people have been known to sleep in a chair i shall manage somehow  you might offer to go in with the general march suggested and the men apparently thought this was a joke mrs march did not laugh in her feminine worry about ways and means  where is miss triscoe she asked we havent seen them  didnt mrs adding tell you they went to supper at a restaurant the general doesnt like the cooking here they ought to have been back before this  he looked up at the clock on the wall and she said i suppose you would like us to wait  it would be very kind of you  oh its quite essential she returned with an airy freshness which kenby did not seem to feel as painfully as he ought  they all sat down and the triscoes came in after a few minutes and a cloud on the generals face lifted at the proposition kenby left mrs march to make  i thought that child ought to be in his mothers charge he said with his own comfort provided for he made no objections to mrs marchs plan and agatha went to take leave of rose and his mother bytheway the general turned to march i found stoller at the restaurant where we supped he offered me a place in his carriage for the manoeuvres how are you going  i think i shall go by train i dont fancy the long drive  well i dont know that its worse than the long walk after you leave the train said the general from the offence which any difference of taste was apt to give him are you going by train too he asked kenby with indifference  im not going at all said kenby im leaving wurzburg in the morning  oh indeed said the general  mrs march could not make out whether he knew that kenby was going with rose and mrs adding but she felt that there must be a full and open recognition of the fact among them yes she said isnt it fortunate that mr kenby should be going to holland too i should have been so unhappy about them if mrs adding had been obliged to make that long journey with poor little rose alone  yes yes very fortunate certainly said the general colorlessly  her husband gave her a glance of intelligent appreciation but kenby was too simply too densely content with the situation to know the value of what she had done she thought he must certainly explain as he walked back with her to the swan whether he had misrepresented her to mrs adding or mrs adding had misunderstood him somewhere there had been an error or a duplicity which it was now useless to punish and kenby was so apparently unconscious of it that she had not the heart to be cross with him she heard miss triscoe behind her with march laughing in the gayety which the escape from her father seemed to inspire in her she was promising march to go with him in the morning to see the emperor and empress of germany arrive at the station and he was warning her that if she laughed there like that she would subject him to fine and imprisonment she pretended that she would like to see him led off between two gendarmes but consented to be a little careful when he asked her how she expected to get back to her hotel without him if such a thing happened     lviii  after all miss triscoe did not go with march she preferred to sleep the imperial party was to arrive at half past seven but at six the crowd was already dense before the station and all along the street leading to the residenz it was a brilliant day with the promise of sunshine through which a chilly wind blew for the manoeuvres the colors of all the german states flapped in this breeze from the poles wreathed with evergreen which encircled the square the workmen putting the last touches on the bronzed allegory hurried madly to be done and they had scarcely finished their labors when two troops of dragoons rode into the place and formed before the station and waited as motionlessly as their horses would allow  these animals were not so conscious as lions at the approach of princes they tossed and stamped impatiently in the long interval before the regent and his daughterinlaw came to welcome their guests all the human beings both those who were in charge and those who were under charge were in a quiver of anxiety to play their parts well as if there were some heavy penalty for failure in the least point the policemen keeping the people in line behind the ropes which restrained them trembled with eagerness the faces of some of the troopers twitched an involuntary sigh went up from the crowd as the regents carriage appeared heralded by outriders and followed by other plain carriages of bavarian blue with liveries of blue and silver then the whistle of the kaisers train sounded a trumpeter advanced and began to blow his trumpet as they do in the theatre and exactly at the appointed moment the emperor and empress came out of the station through the brilliant human alley leading from it mounted their carriages with the stage trumpeter always blowing and whirled swiftly round half the square and flashed into the corner toward the residenz out of sight the same hollow groans of hoooch greeted and followed them from the spectators as had welcomed the regent when he first arrived among his fellowtownsmen with the same effect of being the conventional cries of a stage mob behind the scenes  the emperor was like most of his innumerable pictures with a swarthy face from which his blue eyes glanced pleasantly he looked goodhumored if not goodnatured the empress smiled amiably beneath her deeply fringed white parasol and they both bowed right and left in acknowledgment of those hollow groans but again it seemed to march that sovereignty gave the popular curiosity not to call it devotion a scantier return than it merited he had perhaps been insensibly working toward some such perception as now came to him that the great difference between europe and america was that in europe life is histrionic and dramatized and that in america except when it is trying to be european it is direct and sincere he wondered whether the innate conviction of equality the deep underlying sense of a common humanity transcending all social and civic pretences was what gave their theatrical effect to the shows of deference from low to high and of condescension from high to low if in such encounters of sovereigns and subjects the prince did not play his part so well as the people it might be that he had a harder part to play and that to support his dignity at all to keep from being found out the sham that he essentially was he had to hurry across the stage amidst the distracting thunders of the orchestra if the star staid to be scrutinized by the soldiers citizens and so forth even the poor supernumeraries and sceneshifters might see that he was a tallow candle like themselves  in the censorious mood induced by the reflection that he had waited an hour and a half for half a minutes glimpse of the imperial party march now decided not to go to the manoeuvres where he might be subjected to still greater humiliation and disappointment he had certainly come to wurzburg for the manoeuvres but wurzburg had been richly repaying in itself and why should he stifle half an hour in an overcrowded train and struggle for three miles on foot against that harsh wind to see a multitude of men give proofs of their fitness to do manifold murder he was in fact not the least curious for the sight and the only thing that really troubled him was the question of how he should justify his recreance to his wife this did alloy the pleasure with which he began after an excellent breakfast at a neighboring cafe to stroll about the streets though he had them almost to himself so many citizens had followed the soldiers to the manoeuvres  it was not till the soldiers began returning from the manoeuvres dustyfooted and in white canvas overalls drawn over their trousers to save them that he went back to mrs march and miss triscoe at the swan he had given them time enough to imagine him at the review and to wonder whether he had seen general triscoe and the stollers there and they met him with such confident inquiries that he would not undeceive them at once he let them divine from his inventive answers that he had not gone to the manoeuvres which put them in the best humor with themselves and the girl said it was so cold and rough that she wished her father had not gone either the general appeared just before dinner and frankly avowed the same wish he was rasping and wheezing from the dust which filled his lungs he looked blown and red and he was too angry with the company he had been in to have any comments on the manoeuvres he referred to the military chiefly in relation to the miss stollers ineffectual flirtations which he declared had been outrageous their father had apparently no control over them whatever or else was too ignorant to know that they were misbehaving they were without respect or reverence for any one they had talked to general triscoe as if he were a boy of their own age or a dotard whom nobody need mind they had not only kept up their foolish babble before him they had laughed and giggled they had broken into snatches of american song they had all but whistled and danced they made loud comments in illinois englishon the cuteness of the officers whom they admired and they had at one time actually got out their handkerchiefs he supposed they meant to wave them at the officers but at the look he gave them they merely put their hats together and snickered in derision of him they were american girls of the worst type they conformed to no standard of behavior their conduct was personal they ought to be taken home  mrs march said she saw what he meant and she agreed with him that they were altogether unformed and were the effect of their own ignorant caprices probably however it was too late to amend them by taking them away  it would hide them at any rate he answered they would sink back into the great mass of our vulgarity and not be noticed we behave like a parcel of peasants with our women we think that if no harm is meant or thought we may risk any sort of appearance and we do things that are scandalously improper simply because they are innocent that may be all very well at home but people who prefer that sort of thing had better stay there where our peasant manners wont make them conspicuous  as their train ran northward out of wurzburg that afternoon mrs march recurred to the generals closing words that was a slap at mrs adding for letting kenby go off with her  she took up the history of the past twentyfour hours from the time march had left her with miss triscoe when he went with her father and the addings and kenby to see that church she had had no chance to bring up these arrears until now and she atoned to herself for the delay by making the history very full and going back and adding touches at any point where she thought she had scanted it after all it consisted mainly of fragmentary intimations from miss triscoe and of halfuttered questions which her own art now built into a coherent statement  march could not find that the general had much resented burnamys clandestine visit to carlsbad when his daughter told him of it or that he had done more than make her promise that she would not keep up the acquaintance upon any terms unknown to him  probably mrs march said as long as he had any hopes of mrs adding he was a little too selfconscious to be very up and down about burnamy  then you think he was really serious about her  now my dear he was so serious that i suppose he was never so completely taken aback in his life as when he met kenby in wurzburg and saw how she received him of course that put an end to the fight  the fight  yesthat mrs adding and agatha were keeping up to prevent his offering himself  oh and how do you know that they were keeping up the fight together  how do i didnt you see yourself what friends they were did you tell him what stoller had said about burnamy  i had no chance i dont know that i should have done it anyway it wasnt my affair  well then i think you might it would have been everything for that poor child it would have completely justified her in her own eyes  perhaps your telling her will serve the same purpose  yes i did tell her and i am glad of it she had a right to know it  did she think stollers willingness to overlook burnamys performance had anything to do with its moral quality  mrs march was daunted for the moment but she said i told her you thought that if a person owned to a fault they disowned it and put it away from them just as if it had never been committed and that if a person had taken their punishment for a wrong they had done they had expiated it so far as anybody else was concerned and hasnt poor burnamy done both  as a moralist march was flattered to be hoist with his own petard but as a husband he was not going to come down at once i thought probably you had told her that you had it pat from having just been over it with me when has she heard from him  why thats the strangest thing about it she hasnt heard at all she doesnt know where he is she thought we must know she was terribly broken up  how did she show it  she didnt show it either you want to tease or youve forgotten how such things are with young peopleor at least girls  yes its all a long time ago with me and i never was a girl besides the frank and direct behavior of kenby and mrs adding has been very obliterating to my early impressions of lovemaking  it certainly hasnt been ideal said mrs march with a sigh  why hasnt it been ideal he asked kenby is tremendously in love with her and i believe shes had a fancy for him from the beginning if it hadnt been for rose she would have accepted him at once and now hes essential to them both in their helplessness as for papa triscoe and his europeanized scruples if they have any reality at all theyre the residuum of his personal resentment and kenby and mrs adding have nothing to do with their unreality his being in love with her is no reason why he shouldnt be helpful to her when she needs him and every reason why he should i call it a poem such as very few people have the luck to live out together  mrs march listened with mounting fervor and when he stopped she cried out well my dear i do believe you are right it is ideal as you say its a perfect poem and i shall always say  she stopped at the mocking light which she caught in his look and perceived that he had been amusing himself with her perennial enthusiasm for all sorts of loveaffairs but she averred that she did not care what he had said was true and she should always hold him to it  they were again in the weddingjourney sentiment in which they had left carlsbad when they found themselves alone together after their escape from the pressure of others interests the tide of travel was towards frankfort where the grand parade was to take place some days later they were going to weimar which was so few hours out of their way that they simply must not miss it and all the way to the old literary capital they were alone in their compartment with not even a stranger much less a friend to molest them the flying landscape without was of their own early autumnal mood and when the vineyards of wurzburg ceased to purple it the heavy aftermath of hay and clover which men women and children were loading on heavy wains and driving from the meadows everywhere offered a pastoral and pleasing change it was always the german landscape sometimes flat and fertile sometimes hilly and poor often clothed with dense woods but always charming with castled tops in ruin or repair and with levels where gothic villages drowsed within their walls and dreamed of the mediaeval past silent without apparent life except for some little goosegirl driving her flock before her as she sallied out into the nineteenth century in search of fresh pasturage  as their train mounted among the thuringian uplands they were aware of a finer cooler air through their open window the torrents foamed white out of the black forests of fir and pine and brawled along the valleys where the hamlets roused themselves in momentary curiosity as the train roared into them from the many tunnels the afternoon sunshine had the glister of mountain sunshine everywhere and the travellers had a pleasant bewilderment in which their memories of switzerland and the white mountains mixed with longdormant emotions from adirondack sojourns they chose this place and that in the lovely region where they lamented that they had not come at once for the aftercure and they appointed enough returns to it in future years to consume all the summers they had left to live     lix  it was falling night when they reached weimar where they found at the station a provision of omnibuses far beyond the hotel accommodations they drove first to the crownprince which was in a promising state of reparation but which for the present could only welcome them to an apartment where a canvas curtain cut them off from a freshly plastered wall the landlord deplored the fact and sent hospitably out to try and place them at the elephant but the elephant was full and the russian court was full too then the landlord of the crownprince bethought himself of a new hotel of the second class indeed but very nice where they might get rooms and after the delay of an hour they got a carriage and drove away from the crownprince where the landlord continued to the last as benevolent as if they had been a profit instead of a loss to him  the streets of the town at nine oclock were empty and quiet and they instantly felt the academic quality of the place through the pale night they could see that the architecture was of the classic sentiment which they were destined to feel more and more at one point they caught a fleeting glimpse of two figures with clasped hands and half embraced which they knew for the statues of goethe and schiller and when they mounted to their rooms at the grandduke of saxeweimar they passed under a fresco representing goethe and four other worldfamous poets shakspere milton tasso and schiller the poets all looked like germans as was just and goethe was naturally chief among them he marshalled the immortals on their way and schiller brought up the rear and kept them from going astray in an elysium where they did not speak the language for the rest the hotel was brandnew of a quite american freshness and was pervaded by a sweet smell as of straw matting and provided with steamradiators in the sense of its homelikeness the marches boasted that they were never going away from it  in the morning they discovered that their windows looked out on the grandducal museum with a gardened space before and below its classicistic bulk where in a whim of the weather the gay flowers were full of sun in a pleasant illusion of taking it unawares march strolled up through the town but weimar was as much awake at that hour as at any of the twentyfour and the tranquillity of its streets where he encountered a few passers several blocks apart was their habitual mood he came promptly upon two objects which he would willingly have shunned a denkmal of the francogerman war not so furiously bad as most german monuments but antipathetic and uninteresting as all patriotic monuments are and a womananddog team in the shock from this he was sensible that he had not seen any womananddog teams for some time and he wondered by what civic or ethnic influences their distribution was so controlled that they should have abounded in hamburg leipsic and carlsbad and wholly ceased in nuremberg ansbach and wurzburg to reappear again in weimar though they seemed as characteristic of all germany as the ugly denkmals to her victories over france  the goethe and schiller monument which he had glimpsed the night before was characteristic too but less offensively so german statues at the best are conscious and the poetpair as the inscription calls them have the air of showily confronting posterity with their clasped hands and of being only partially rapt from the spectators but they were more unconscious than any other german statues that march had seen and he quelled a desire to ask goethe as he stood with his hand on schillers shoulder and looked serenely into space far above one of the typical equipages of his country what he thought of that sort of thing but upon reflection he did not know why goethe should be held personally responsible for the existence of the womananddog team he felt that he might more reasonably attribute to his taste the prevalence of classic profiles which he began to note in the weimar populace this could be a sympathetic effect of that passion for the antique which the poet brought back with him from his sojourn in italy though many of the people especially the children were bowlegged perhaps the antique had begun in their faces and had not yet got down to their legs in any case they were charming children and as a test of their culture he had a mind to ask a little girl if she could tell him where the statue of herder was which he thought he might as well take in on his ramble and so be done with as many statues as he could she answered with a pretty regret in her tender voice that i truly cannot and he was more satisfied than if she could for he thought it better to be a child and honest than to know where any german statue was  he easily found it for himself in the place which is called the herder platz after it he went into the peter and paul church there where herder used to preach sermons sometimes not at all liked by the nobility and gentry for their revolutionary tendency the sovereign was shielded from the worst effects of his doctrine by worshipping apart from other sinners in a glazed gallery herder is buried in the church and when you ask where the sacristan lifts a wooden trapdoor in the pavement and you think you are going down into the crypt but you are only to see herders monumental stone which is kept covered so to save it from passing feet here also is the greatest picture of that great soul luke kranach who had sincerity enough in his paining to atone for all the swelling german sculptures in the world it is a crucifixion and the cross is of a white birch log such as might have been cut out of the weimar woods shaved smooth on the sides with the bark showing at the edges kranach has put himself among the spectators and a stream of blood from the side of the savior falls in baptism upon the painters head he is in the company of john the baptist and martin luther luther stands with his bible open and his finger on the line the blood of jesus cleanseth us  partly because he felt guilty at doing all these things without his wife and partly because he was now very hungry march turned from them and got back to his hotel where she was looking out for him from their open window she had the air of being long domesticated there as she laughed down at seeing him come and the continued brilliancy of the weather added to the illusion of home  it was like a day of late spring in italy or america the sun in that gardened hollow before the museum was already hot enough to make him glad of the shelter of the hotel the summer seemed to have come back to oblige them and when they learned that they were to see weimar in a festive mood because this was sedan day their curiosity if not their sympathy accepted the chance gratefully but they were almost moved to wish that the war had gone otherwise when they learned that all the public carriages were engaged and they must have one from a stable if they wished to drive after breakfast still it was offered them for such a modest number of marks and their driver proved so friendly and conversable that they assented to the course of history and were more and more reconciled as they bowled along through the grandducal park beside the waters of the classic ilm  the waters of the classic ilm are sluggish and slimy in places and in places clear and brooklike but always a dull dark green in color they flow in the shadow of pensive trees and by the brinks of sunny meadows where the aftermath wanders in heavy windrows and the children sport joyously over the smoothmown surfaces in all the freedom that there is in germany at last after immemorial appropriation the owners of the earth are everywhere expropriated and the people come into the pleasure if not the profit of it at last the prince the knight the noble finds as in his turn the plutocrat will find that his property is not for him but for all and that the nation is to enjoy what he takes from it and vainly thinks to keep from it parks pleasaunces gardens set apart for kings are the playgrounds of the landless poor in the old world and perhaps yield the sweetest joy of privilege to some statesick ruler some worldweary princess some lonely child born to the solitude of sovereignty as they each look down from their palace windows upon the leisure of overwork taking its little holiday amidst beauty vainly created for the perpetual festival of their empty lives  march smiled to think that in this very weimar where sovereignty had graced and ennobled itself as nowhere else in the world by the companionship of letters and the arts they still were not hurrying first to see the palace of a prince but were involuntarily making it second to the cottage of a poet but in fact it is goethe who is forever the prince in weimar his greatness blots out its history his name fills the city the thought of him is its chiefest imitation and largest hospitality the travellers remembered above all other facts of the grandducal park that it was there he first met christiane vulpius beautiful and young when he too was beautiful and young and took her home to be his love to the just and lasting displeasure of fran von stein who was even less reconciled when after eighteen years of due reflection the love of goethe and christiane became their marriage they wondered just where it was he saw the young girl coming to meet him as the granddukes minister with an officeseeking petition from her brother goethes brother author long famed and long forgotten for his romantic tale of rinaldo rinaldini  they had indeed no great mind in their american respectability for that rather matteroffact and deliberate liaison and little as their sympathy was for the passionless intellectual intrigue with the frau von stein it cast no halo of sentiment about the goethe cottage to suppose that there his lovelife with christiane began mrs march even resented the fact and when she learned later that it was not the fact at all she removed it from her associations with the pretty place almost indignantly  in spite of our facile and multiple divorces we americans are worshipers of marriage and if a great poet the minister of a prince is going to marry a poor girl we think he had better not wait till their son is almost of age mrs march would not accept as extenuating circumstances the granddukes godfatherhood or goethes open constancy to christiane or the tardy consecration of their union after the french sack of weimar when the girls devotion had saved him from the rudeness of the marauding soldiers for her new england soul there were no degrees in such guilt and perhaps there are really not so many as people have tried to think in their deference to goethes greatness but certainly the affair was not so simple for a grandducal minister of worldwide renown and he might well have felt its difficulties for he could not have been proof against the censorious public opinion of weimar or the yet more censorious private opinion of fran von stein  on that lovely italoamerican morning no ghost of these old dead embarrassments lingered within or without the goethe gardenhouse the trees which the poet himself planted flung a sunshot shadow upon it and about its feet basked a garden of simple flowers from which the sweet lame girl who limped through the rooms and showed them gathered a parting nosegay for her visitors the few small livingrooms were above the groundfloor with kitchen and offices below in the italian fashion in one of the little chambers was the campbed which goethe carried with him on his journeys through italy and in the larger room at the front stood the desk where he wrote with the chair before it from which he might just have risen  all was much more livingly conscious of the great man gone than the proud little palace in the town which so abounds with relics and memorials of him his library his study his study table with everything on it just as he left it when          cadde la stanca mana  are there and there is the deathchair facing the window from which he gasped for more light at last the handsome wellarranged rooms are full of souvenirs of his travel and of that passion for italy which he did so much to impart to all german hearts and whose modern waning leaves its records here of an interest pathetically almost amusingly faded they intimate the classic temper to which his mind tended more and more and amidst the multitude of sculptures pictures prints drawings gems medals autographs there is the sense of the manymindedness the universal taste for which he found room in little weimar but not in his contemporaneous germany but it is all less keenly personal less intimate than the simple gardenhouse or else with the great troop of people going through it and the custodians lecturing in various voices and languages to the attendant groups the marches had it less to themselves and so imagined him less in it     lx  all palaces have a character of tiresome unlivableness which is common to them everywhere and very probably if one could meet their proprietors in them one would as little remember them apart afterwards as the palaces themselves it will not do to lift either houses or men far out of the average they become spectacles ceremonies they cease to have charm to have character which belong to the levels of life where alone there are ease and comfort and human nature may be itself with all the little delightful differences repressed in those who represent and typify  as they followed the custodian through the grandducal residenz at weimar march felt everywhere the strong wish of the prince who was goethes friend to ally himself with literature and to be human at least in the humanities he came honestly by his passion for poets his mother had known it in her time and weimar was the home of wieland and of herder before the young grandduke came back from his travels bringing goethe with him and afterwards attracting schiller the story of that great epoch is all there in the residenz told as articulately as a palace can  there are certain poets rooms frescoed with illustrations of goethe schiller and wieland there is the room where goethe and the grandduke used to play chess together there is the conservatory opening from it where they liked to sit and chat everywhere in the pictures and sculptures the engraving and intaglios are the witnesses of the tastes they shared the love they both had for italy and for beautiful italian things the prince was not so great a prince but that he could very nearly be a man the court was perhaps the most human court that ever was the grandduke and the grand poet were first boon companions and then monarch and minister working together for the good of the country they were always friends and yet as the american saw in the light of the new world which he carried with him how far from friends at best it was makebelieve the makebelieve of superiority and inferiority the makebelieve of master and man which could only be the more painful and ghastly for the endeavor of two generous spirits to reach and rescue each other through the asphyxiating unreality but they kept up the show of equality faithfully to the end goethe was born citizen of a free republic and his youth was nurtured in the traditions of liberty he was one of the greatest souls of any time and he must have known the impossibility of the thing they pretended but he died and made no sign and the poets friendship with the prince has passed smoothly into history as one of the things that might really be they worked and played together they dined and danced they picnicked and poetized each on his own side of the impassable gulf with an air of its not being there which probably did not deceive their contemporaries so much as posterity  a part of the palace was of course undergoing repair and in the gallery beyond the conservatory a company of workmen were sitting at a table where they had spread their luncheon they were somewhat subdued by the consciousness of their august environment but the sight of them was charming they gave a kindly interest to the place which it had wanted before and which the marches felt again in another palace where the custodian showed them the little tin dishes and saucepans which the german empress augusta and her sisters played with when they were children the sight of these was more affecting even than the withered wreaths which they had left on the deathbed of their mother and which are still mouldering there  this was in the belvedere the country house on the height overlooking weimar where the grandducal family spend the month of may and where the stranger finds himself amid overwhelming associations of goethe although the place is so full of relics and memorials of the owners it seemed in fact to be a storehouse for the weddingpresents of the whole connection which were on show in every room mrs march hardly knew whether they heightened the domestic effect or took from it but they enabled her to verify with the custodians help certain royal intermarriages which she had been in doubt about before  her zeal for these made such favor with him that he did not spare them a portrait of all those which march hoped to escape he passed them over scarcely able to stand to the gardener who was to show them the openair theatre where goethe used to take part in the plays  the naturtheater was of a classic ideal realized in the trained vines and clipped trees which formed the coulisses there was a grassy space for the chorus and the commoner audience and then a few semicircular gradines cut in the turf one alcove another where the more honored spectators sat behind the seats were plinths bearing the busts of goethe schiller wieland and herder it was all very pretty and if ever the weather in weimar was dry enough to permit a performance it must have been charming to see a play in that open day to which the drama is native though in the late hours it now keeps in the thick air of modern theatres it has long forgotten the fact it would be difficult to be greek under a german sky even when it was not actually raining but march held that with goethes help it might have been done at weimar and his wife and he proved themselves such enthusiasts for the naturtheater that the walnutfaced old gardener who showed it put together a sheaf of the flowers that grew nearest it and gave them to mrs march for a souvenir  they went for a cup of tea to the cafe which looks as from another eyebrow of the hill out over lovely little weimar in the plain below in a moment of sunshine the prospect was very smiling but their spirits sank over their tea when it came they were at least sorry they had not asked for coffee most of the people about them were taking beer including the pretty girls of a young ladies school who were there with their books and needlework in the care of one of the teachers apparently for the afternoon  mrs march perceived that they were not so much engaged with their books or their needlework but they had eyes for other things and she followed the glances of the girls till they rested upon the people at a table somewhat obliquely to the left these were apparently a mother and daughter and they were listening to a young man who sat with his back to mrs march and leaned low over the table talking to them they were both smiling radiantly and as the girl smiled she kept turning herself from the waist up and slanting her face from this side to that as if to make sure that every one saw her smiling  mrs march felt her husbands gaze following her own and she had just time to press her finger firmly on his arm and reduce his cry of astonishment to the hoarse whisper in which he gasped good gracious its the pivotal girl  at the same moment the girl rose with her mother and with the young man who had risen too came directly toward the marches on their way out of the place without noticing them though burnamy passed so near that mrs march could almost have touched him  she had just strength to say well my dear that was the cut direct  she said this in order to have her husband reassure her nonsense he never saw us why didnt you speak to him  speak to him i never shall speak to him again no this is the last of mr burnamy for me i shouldnt have minded his not recognizing us for as you say i dont believe he saw us but if he could go back to such a girl as that and flirt with her after miss triscoe thats all i wish to know of him dont you try to look him up basil im gladyes im glad he doesnt know how stoller has come to feel about him he deserves to suffer and i hope hell keep on suffering you were quite right my dearand it shows how true your instinct is in such things i dont call it more than instinctnot to tell him what stoller said and i dont want you ever should  she had risen in her excitement and was making off in such haste that she would hardly give him time to pay for their tea as she pulled him impatiently to their carriage  at last he got a chance to say i dont think i can quite promise that my minds been veering round in the other direction i think i shall tell him  what after youve seen him flirting with that girl very well then you wont my dear thats all hes behaving very basely to agatha  whats his flirtation with all the girls in the universe to do with my duty to him he has a right to know what stoller thinks and as to his behaving badly toward miss triscoe how has he done it so far as you know there is nothing whatever between them she either refused him outright that last night in carlsbad or else she made impossible conditions with him burnamy is simply consoling himself and i dont blame him  consoling himself with a pivotal girl cried mrs march  yes with a pivotal girl her pivotality may be a nervous idiosyncrasy or it may be the effect of tight lacing perhaps she has to keep turning and twisting that way to get breath but attribute the worst motive say it is to make people look at her well burnamy has a right to look with the rest and i am not going to renounce him because he takes refuge with one pretty girl from another its what men have been doing from the beginning of time  oh i dare say  men he went on are very delicately constituted very peculiarly they have been known to seek the society of girls in general of any girl because some girl has made them happy and when some girl has made them unhappy they are still more susceptible burnamy may be merely amusing himself or he may be consoling himself but in either case i think the pivotal girl has as much right to him as miss triscoe she had him first and im all for her     lxi  burnamy came away from seeing the pivotal girl and her mother off on the train which they were taking that evening for frankfort and hombourg and strolled back through the weimar streets little at ease with himself while he was with the girl and near her he had felt the attraction by which youth impersonally draws youth the charm which mere maid has for mere man but once beyond the range of this he felt sick at heart and ashamed he was aware of having used her folly as an anodyne for the pain which was always gnawing at him and he had managed to forget it in her folly but now it came back and the sense that he had been reckless of her rights came with it he had done his best to make her think him in love with her by everything but words he wondered how he could be such an ass such a wicked ass as to try making her promise to write to him from frankfort he wished never to see her again and he wished still less to hear from her it was some comfort to reflect that she had not promised but it was not comfort enough to restore him to such fragmentary selfrespect as he had been enjoying since he parted with agatha triscoe in carlsbad he could not even get back to the resentment with which he had been staying himself somewhat before the pivotal girl unexpectedly appeared with her mother in weimar  it was sedan day but there was apparently no official observance of the holiday perhaps because the grandduke was away at the manoeuvres with all the other german princes burnamy had hoped for some voluntary excitement among the people at least enough to warrant him in making a paper about sedan day in weimar which he could sell somewhere but the night was falling and there was still no sign of popular rejoicing over the french humiliation twentyeight years before except in the multitude of japanese lanterns which the children were everywhere carrying at the ends of sticks babies had them in their carriages and the effect of the floating lights in the winding upanddownhill streets was charming even to burnamys lacklustre eyes he went by his hotel and on to a cafe with a garden where there was a patriotic concert promised he supped there and then sat dreamily behind his beer while the music banged and brayed round him unheeded  presently he heard a voice of friendly banter saying in english may i sit at your table and he saw an ironical face looking down on him there doesnt seem any other place  why mr march burnamy sprang up and wrung the hand held out to him but he choked with his words of recognition it was so good to see this faithful friend again though he saw him now as he had seen him last just when he had so little reason to be proud of himself  march settled his person in the chair facing burnamy and then glanced round at the joyful jam of people eating and drinking under a firmament of lanterns this is pretty he said mighty pretty i shall make mrs march sorry for not coming when i go back  is mrs marchshe iswith youin weimar burnamy asked stupidly  march forbore to take advantage of him oh yes we saw you out at belvedere this afternoon mrs march thought for a moment that you meant not to see us a woman likes to exercise her imagination in those little flights  i never dreamed of your being therei never saw burnamy began  of course not neither did mrs etkins nor miss etkins she was looking very pretty have you been here some time  not long a week or so ive been at the parade at wurzburg  at wurzburg ah how little the world is or how large wurzburg is we were there nearly a week and we pervaded the place but there was a great crowd for you to hide in from us what had i better take a waiter had come up and was standing at marchs elbow i suppose i mustnt sit here without ordering something  white wine and selters said burnamy vaguely  the very thing why didnt i think of it its a divine drink it satisfies without filling i had it a night or two before we left home in the madison square roof garden have you seen every other week lately  no said burnamy with more spirit than he had yet shown  weve just got our mail from nuremberg the last number has a poem in it that i rather like march laughed to see the young fellows face light up with joyful consciousness come round to my hotel after youre tired here and ill let you see it theres no hurry did you notice the little children with their lanterns as you came along its the gentlest effect that a warlike memory ever came to the french themselves couldnt have minded those innocents carrying those soft lights on the day of their disaster you ought to get something out of that and ive got a subject in trust for you from rose adding he and his mother were at wurzburg im sorry to say the poor little chap didnt seem very well theyve gone to holland for the sea air march had been talking for quantity in compassion of the embarrassment in which burnamy seemed bound but he questioned how far he ought to bring comfort to the young fellow merely because he liked him so far as he could make out burnamy had been doing rather less than nothing to retrieve himself since they had met and it was by an impulse that he could not have logically defended to mrs march that he resumed we found another friend of yours in wurzburg mr stoller  mr stoller burnamy faintly echoed  yes he was there to give his daughters a holiday during the manoeuvres and they made the most of it he wanted us to go to the parade with his family but we declined the twins were pretty nearly the death of general triscoe  again burnamy echoed him general triscoe  ah yes i didnt tell you general triscoe and his daughter had come on with mrs adding and rose kenbyyou remember kenby on the norumbiakenby happened to be there too we were quite a family party and stoller got the general to drive out to the manoeuvres with him and his girls  now that he was launched march rather enjoyed letting himself go he did not know what he should say to mrs march when he came to confess having told burnamy everything before she got a chance at him he pushed on recklessly upon the principle which probably will not hold in morals that one may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb i have a message for you from mr stoller  for me burnamy gasped  ive been wondering how i should put it for i hadnt expected to see you but its simply this he wants you to knowand he seemed to want me to knowthat he doesnt hold you accountable in the way he did hes thought it all over and hes decided that he had no right to expect you to save him from his own ignorance where he was making a show of knowledge as he said he doesnt choose to plead the baby act he says that youre all right and your place on the paper is open to you  burnamy had not been very prompt before but now he seemed braced for instant response i think hes wrong he said so harshly that the people at the next table looked round his feeling as he does has nothing to do with the fact and it doesnt let me out  march would have liked to take him in his arms he merely said i think youre quite right as to that but theres such a thing as forgiveness you know it doesnt change the nature of what youve done but as far as the sufferer from it is concerned it annuls it  yes i understand that but i cant accept his forgiveness if i hate him  but perhaps you wont always hate him some day you may have a chance to do him a good turn its rather banale but there doesnt seem any other way well i have given you his message are you going with me to get that poem  when march had given burnamy the paper at his hotel and burnamy had put it in his pocket the young man said he thought he would take some coffee and he asked march to join him in the diningroom where they had stood talking  no thank you said the elder i dont propose sitting up all night and youll excuse me if i go to bed now its a little informal to leave a guest  youre not leaving a guest im at home here im staying in this hotel too  march said oh and then he added abruptly goodnight and went up stairs under the fresco of the five poets  whom were you talking with below asked mrs march through the door opening into his room from hers  burnamy he answered from within hes staying in this house he let me know just as i was going to turn him out for the night its one of those little uncandors of his that throw suspicion on his honesty in great things  oh then youve been telling him she said with a mental bound high above and far beyond the point  everything  about stoller too  about stoller and his daughters and mrs adding and rose and kenby and general triscoeand agatha  very well thats what i call shabby dont ever talk to me again about the inconsistencies of women but now theres something perfectly fearful  what is it  a letter from miss triscoe came after you were gone asking us to find rooms in some hotel for her and her father tomorrow he isnt well and theyre coming and ive telegraphed them to come here now what do you say     lxii  they could see no way out of the trouble and mrs march could not resign herself to it till her husband suggested that she should consider it providential this touched the lingering superstition in which she had been ancestrally taught to regard herself as a means when in a very tight place and to leave the responsibility with the moral government of the universe as she now perceived it had been the same as ordered that they should see burnamy under such conditions in the afternoon that they could not speak to him and hear where he was staying and in an inferior degree it had been the same as ordered that march should see him in the evening and tell him everything so that she should know just how to act when she saw him in the morning if he could plausibly account for the renewal of his flirtation with miss elkins or if he seemed generally worthy apart from that she could forgive him  it was so pleasant when he came in at breakfast with his wellremembered smile that she did not require from him any explicit defence while they talked she was righting herself in an undercurrent of drama with miss triscoe and explaining to her that they could not possibly wait over for her and her father in weimar but must be off that day for berlin as they had made all their plans it was not easy even in drama where one has everything ones own way to prove that she could not without impiety so far interfere with the course of providence as to prevent miss triscoes coming with her father to the same hotel where burnamy was staying she contrived indeed to persuade her that she had not known he was staying there when she telegraphed them where to come and that in the absence of any open confidence from miss triscoe she was not obliged to suppose that his presence would be embarrassing  march proposed leaving her with burnamy while he went up into the town and interviewed the house of schiller which he had not done yet and as soon as he got himself away she came to business breaking altogether from the inner drama with miss triscoe and devoting herself to burnamy they had already got so far as to have mentioned the meeting with the triscoes in wurzburg and she said did mr march tell you they were coming here or no we hadnt heard then yes they are coming tomorrow they may be going to stay some time she talked of weimar when we first spoke of germany on the ship burnamy said nothing and she suddenly added with a sharp glance they wanted us to get them rooms and we advised their coming to this house he started very satisfactorily and do you think they would be comfortable here she pursued  oh yes very they can have my room its southeast i shall be going into other quarters she did not say anything and mrs march he began again what is the use of my beating about the bush you must know what i went back to carlsbad for that night  no one ever told  well you must have made a pretty good guess but it was a failure i ought to have failed and i did she said that unless her father liked itand apparently he hasnt liked it burnamy smiled ruefully  how do you know she didnt know where you were  she could have got word to me if she had had good news for me theyve forwarded other letters from pupps but its all right i had no business to go back to carlsbad of course you didnt know i was in this house when you told them to come and i must clear out i had better clear out of weimar too  no i dont think so i have no right to pry into your affairs but  oh theyre wide enough open  and you may have changed your mind i thought you might when i saw you yesterday at belvedere  i was only trying to make bad worse  then i think the situation has changed entirely through what mr stoller said to mr march  i cant see how it has i committed an act of shabby treachery and im as much to blame as if he still wanted to punish me for it  did mr march say that to you  no i said that to mr march and he couldnt answer it and you cant youre very good and very kind but you cant answer it  i can answer it very well she boasted but she could find nothing better to say than its your duty to her to see her and let her know  doesnt she know already  she has a right to know it from you i think you are morbid mr burnamy you know very well i didnt like your doing that to mr stoller i didnt say so at the time because you seemed to feel it enough yourself but i did like your owning up to it and here mrs march thought it time to trot out her borrowed battlehorse again my husband always says that if a person owns up to an error fully and faithfully as youve always done they make it the same in its consequences to them as if it had never been done  does mr march say that asked burnamy with a relenting smile  indeed he does  burnamy hesitated then he asked gloomily again  and what about the consequences to the other fellow  a woman said mrs march has no concern with them and besides i think youve done all you could to save mr stoller from the consequences  i havent done anything  no matter you would if you could i wonder she broke off to prevent his persistence at a point where her nerves were beginning to give way what can be keeping mr march  nothing much more important it appeared later than the pleasure of sauntering through the streets on the way to the house of schiller and looking at the pretty children going to school with books under their arms it was the day for the schools to open after the long summer vacation and there was a freshness of expectation in the shining faces which if it could not light up his own graybeard visage could at least touch his heart  when he reached the schiller house he found that it was really not the schiller house but the schiller flat of three or four rooms one flight up whose windows look out upon the street named after the poet the whole place is bare and clean in one corner of the large room fronting the street stands schillers writingtable with his chair before it with the foot extending toward this there stands in another corner the narrow bed on which he died some withered wreaths on the pillow frame a picture of his deathmask which at first glance is like his dead face lying there it is all rather tasteless and all rather touching and the place with its meagre appointments as compared with the rich goethe house suggests that personal competition with goethe in which schiller is always falling into the second place whether it will be finally so with him in literature it is too early to ask of time and upon other points eternity will not be interrogated the great goethe and the good schiller they remain and yet march reasoned there was something good in goethe and something great in schiller  he was so full of the pathos of their inequality before the world that he did not heed the warning on the door of the pastryshop near the schiller house and on opening it he bedaubed his hand with the fresh paint on it he was then in such a state that he could not bring his mind to bear upon the question of which cakes his wife would probably prefer and he stood helplessly holding up his hand till the good woman behind the counter discovered his plight and uttered a loud cry of compassion she ran and got a wet napkin which she rubbed with soap and then she instructed him by word and gesture to rub his hand upon it and she did not leave him till his rescue was complete he let her choose a variety of the cakes for him and came away with a gay paper bag full of them and with the feeling that he had been in more intimate relations with the life of weimar than travellers are often privileged to be he argued from the instant and intelligent sympathy of the pastry woman a high grade of culture in all classes and he conceived the notion of pretending to mrs march that he had got these cakes from a descendant of schiller  his deceit availed with her for the brief moment in which she always after so many years experience of his duplicity believed anything he told her they dined merrily together at their hotel and then burnamy came down to the station with them and was very comfortable to march in helping him to get their tickets and their baggage registered the train which was to take them to halle where they were to change for berlin was rather late and they had but ten minutes after it came in before it would start again mrs march was watching impatiently at the window of the waitingroom for the dismounting passengers to clear the platform and allow the doors to be opened suddenly she gave a cry and turned and ran into the passage by which the new arrivals were pouring out toward the superabundant omnibuses march and burnamy who had been talking apart mechanically rushed after her and found her kissing miss triscoe and shaking hands with the general amidst a tempest of questions and answers from which it appeared that the triscoes had got tired of staying in wurzburg and had simply come on to weimar a day sooner than they had intended  the general was rather much bundled up for a day which was mild for a german summer day and he coughed out an explanation that he had taken an abominable cold at that ridiculous parade and had not shaken it off yet he had a notion that change of air would be better for him it could not be worse  he seemed a little vague as to burnamy rather than inimical while the ladies were still talking eagerly together in proffer and acceptance of mrs marchs lamentations that she should be going away just as miss triscoe was coming he asked if the omnibus for their hotel was there he by no means resented burnamys assurance that it was and he did not refuse to let him order their baggage little and large loaded upon it by the time this was done mrs march and miss triscoe had so far detached themselves from each other that they could separate after one more formal expression of regret and forgiveness with a lament into which she poured a world of inarticulate emotions mrs march wrenched herself from the place and suffered herself to be pushed toward her train but with the last long look which she cast over her shoulder before she vanished into the waitingroom she saw miss triscoe and burnamy transacting the elaborate politenesses of amiable strangers with regard to the very small bag which the girl had in her hand he succeeded in relieving her of it and then he led the way out of the station on the left of the general while miss triscoe brought up the rear     lxiii  from the window of the train as it drew out mrs march tried for a glimpse of the omnibus in which her proteges were now rolling away together as they were quite out of sight in the omnibus which was itself out of sight she failed but as she fell back against her seat she treated the recent incident with a complexity and simultaneity of which no report can give an idea at the end one fatal conviction remained that in everything she had said she had failed to explain to miss triscoe how burnamy happened to be in weimar and how he happened to be there with them in the station she required march to say how she had overlooked the very things which she ought to have mentioned first and which she had on the point of her tongue the whole time she went over the entire ground again to see if she could discover the reason why she had made such an unaccountable break and it appeared that she was led to it by his rushing after her with burnamy before she had had a chance to say a word about him of course she could not say anything in his presence this gave her some comfort and there was consolation in the fact that she had left them together without the least intention or connivance and now no matter what happened she could not accuse herself and he could not accuse her of matchmaking  he said that his own sense of guilt was so great that he should not dream of accusing her of anything except of regret that now she could never claim the credit of bringing the lovers together under circumstances so favorable as soon as they were engaged they could join in renouncing her with a good conscience and they would probably make this the basis of their efforts to propitiate the general  she said she did not care and with the mere removal of the lovers in space her interest in them began to abate they began to be of a minor importance in the anxieties of the change of trains at halle and in the excitement of settling into the express from frankfort there were moments when they were altogether forgotten the car was of almost american length and it ran with almost american smoothness when the conductor came and collected an extra fare for their seats the marches felt that if the charge had been two dollars instead of two marks they would have had every advantage of american travel  on the way to berlin the country was now fertile and flat and now sterile and flat near the capital the level sandy waste spread almost to its gates the train ran quickly through the narrow fringe of suburbs and then they were in one of those vast continental stations which put our outdated depots to shame the good traeger who took possession of them and their handbags put their boxes on a baggagebearing drosky and then got them another drosky for their personal transportation this was a drosky of the firstclass but they would not have thought it so either from the vehicle itself or from the appearance of the driver and his horses the public carriages of germany are the shabbiest in the world at berlin the horses look like old hair trunks and the drivers like their motheaten contents  the marches got no splendor for the two prices they paid and their approach to their hotel on unter den linden was as unimpressive as the ignoble avenue itself it was a moist cold evening and the mean tiresome street slopped and splashed under its two rows of small trees to which the thinning leaves clung like wet rags between long lines of shops and hotels which had neither the grace of paris nor the grandiosity of new york march quoted in bitter derision       bees bees was it your hydromel      under the lindens  and his wife said that if commonwealth avenue in boston could be imagined with its trees and without their beauty flanked by the architecture of sixth avenue with dashes of the west side of union square that would be the famous unter den linden where she had so resolutely decided that they would stay while in berlin  they had agreed upon the hotel and neither could blame the other because it proved secondrate in everything but its charges they ate a poorish table dhote dinner in such low spirits that march had no heart to get a rise from his wife by calling her notice to the mouse which fed upon the crumbs about their feet while they dined their englishspeaking waiter said that it was a very warm evening and they never knew whether this was because he was a humorist or because he was lonely and wished to talk or because it really was a warm evening for berlin when they had finished they went out and drove about the greater part of the evening looking for another hotel whose first requisite should be that it was not on unter den linden what mainly determined mrs march in favor of the large handsome impersonal place they fixed upon was the fact that it was equipped for steamheating what determined march was the fact that it had a passengeroffice where when he wished to leave he could buy his railroad tickets and have his baggage checked without the maddening anxiety of doing it at the station but it was precisely in these points that the hotel which admirably fulfilled its other functions fell short the weather made a succession of efforts throughout their stay to clear up cold it merely grew colder without clearing up but this seemed to offer no suggestion of steam for heating their bleak apartment and the chilly corridors to the management with the help of a large lamp which they kept burning night and day they got the temperature of their rooms up to sixty there was neither stove nor fireplace the cold electric bulbs diffused a frosty glare and in the vast stately diningroom with its vaulted roof there was nothing to warm them but their plates and the handles of their knives and forks which by a mysterious inspiration were always hot when they were ready to go march experienced from the apathy of the baggage clerk and the reluctance of the porters a more piercing distress than any he had known at the railroad stations and one luckless valise which he ordered sent after him by express reached his bankers in paris a fortnight overdue with an accumulation of charges upon it outvaluing the books which it contained  but these were minor defects in an establishment which had many merits and was mainly of the temperament and intention of the large english railroad hotels they looked from their windows down into a gardened square peopled with a full share of the superabounding statues of berlin and frequented by babies and nurse maids who seemed not to mind the cold any more than the stone kings and generals the aspect of this square like the excellent cooking of the hotel and the architecture of the imperial capital suggested the superior civilization of paris even the rows of gray houses and private palaces of berlin are in the french taste which is the only taste there is in berlin the suggestion of paris is constant but it is of paris in exile and without the chic which the city wears in its native air the crowd lacks this as much as the architecture and the sculpture there is no distinction among the men except for now and then a military figure and among the women no style such as relieves the commonplace rash of the new york streets the berliners are plain and ill dressed both men and women and even the little children are plain every one is ill dressed but no one is ragged and among the undersized homely folk of the lower classes there is no such povertystricken shabbiness as shocks and insults the sight in new york that which distinctly recalls our metropolis is the lofty passage of the elevated trains intersecting the prospectives of many streets but in berlin the elevated road is carried on massive brick archways and not lifted upon gay crazy iron ladders like ours  when you look away from this and regard berlin on its aesthetic side you are again in that banished paris whose captive artsoul is made to serve so far as it may be enslaved to such an effect in the celebration of the german triumph over france berlin has never the presence of a great capital however in spite of its perpetual monumental insistence there is no streaming movement in broad vistas the dull looking population moves sluggishly there is no show of fine equipages the prevailing tone of the city and the sky is gray but under the cloudy heaven there is no responsive gothic solemnity in the architecture there are hints of the older german cities in some of the remote and observe streets but otherwise all is as new as boston which in fact the actual berlin hardly antedates  there are easily more statues in berlin than in any other city in the world but they only unite in failing to give berlin an artistic air they stand in long rows on the cornices they crowd the pediments they poise on one leg above domes and arches they shelter themselves in niches they ride about on horseback they sit or lounge on street corners or in garden walks all with a mediocrity in the older sort which fails of any impression if they were only furiously baroque they would be something and it may be from a sense of this that there is a selfassertion in the recent sculptures which are always patriotic more noisy and bragging than anything else in perennial brass this offensive art is the modern prussian avatar of the old german romantic spirit and bears the same relation to it that modern romanticism in literature bears to romance it finds its apotheosis in the monument to kaiser wilhelm i a vast incoherent group of swelling and swaggering bronze commemorating the victory of the first prussian emperor in the war with the last french emperor and avenging the vanquished upon the victors by its ugliness the ungainly and irrelevant assemblage of men and animals backs away from the imperial palace and saves itself too soon from plunging over the border of a canal behind it not far from rauchs great statue of the great frederic to come to it from the simplicity and quiet of that noble work is like passing from some exquisite masterpiece of naturalistic acting to the rant and uproar of melodrama and the marches stood stunned and bewildered by its wild explosions  when they could escape they found themselves so convenient to the imperial palace that they judged best to discharge at once the obligation to visit it which must otherwise weigh upon them they entered the court without opposition from the sentinel and joined other strangers straggling instinctively toward a waitingroom in one corner of the building where after they had increased to some thirty a custodian took charge of them and led them up a series of inclined plains of brick to the state apartments in the antechamber they found a provision of immense felt overshoes which they were expected to put on for their passage over the waxed marquetry of the halls these roomy slippers were designed for the accommodation of the native boots and upon the mixed company of foreigners the effect was in the last degree humiliating the womens skirts some what hid their disgrace but the men were openly put to shame and they shuffled forward with their bodies at a convenient incline like a company of snowshoers in the depths of his own abasement march heard a female voice behind him sighing in american accents to think i should be polishing up these imperial floors with my republican feet  the protest expressed the rebellion which he felt mounting in his own heart as they advanced through the heavily splendid rooms in the historical order of the family portraits recording the rise of the prussian sovereigns from margraves to emperors he began to realize here the fact which grew open him more and more that imperial germany is not the effect of a popular impulse but of a dynastic propensity there is nothing original in the imperial palace nothing national it embodies and proclaims a powerful personal will and in its adaptations of french art it appeals to no emotion in the german witness nobler than his pride in the german triumph over the french in war march found it tiresome beyond the tiresome wont of palaces and he gladly shook off the sense of it with his felt shoes well he confided to his wife when they were fairly outofdoors if prussia rose in the strength of silence as carlyle wants us to believe she is taking it out in talk now and tall talk  yes isnt she mrs march assented and with a passionate desire for excess in a bad thing which we all know at times she looked eagerly about her for proofs of that odious militarism of the empire which ought to have been conspicuous in the imperial capital but possibly because the troops were nearly all away at the manoeuvres there were hardly more in the streets than she had sometimes seen in washington again the german officers signally failed to offer her any rudeness when she met them on the sidewalks there were scarcely any of them and perhaps that might have been the reason why they were not more aggressive but a whole company of soldiers marching carelessly up to the palace from the brandenburg gate without music or so much style as our own militia often puts on regarded her with inoffensive eyes so far as they looked at her she declared that personally there was nothing against the prussians even when in uniform they were kindly and modestlooking men it was when they got up on pedestals in bronze or marble that they began to bully and to brag     lxiv  the dinner which the marches got at a restaurant on unter den linden almost redeemed the avenue from the disgrace it had fallen into with them it was the best meal they had yet eaten in europe and as to fact and form was a sort of compromise between a french dinner and an english dinner which they did not hesitate to pronounce prussian the waiter who served it was a friendly spirit very sensible of their intelligent appreciation of the dinner and from him they formed a more respectful opinion of berlin civilization than they had yet held after the manner of strangers everywhere they judged the country they were visiting from such of its inhabitants as chance brought them in contact with and it would really be a good thing for nations that wish to stand well with the world at large to look carefully to the behavior of its cabmen and car conductors its hotel clerks and waiters its theatreticket sellers and ushers its policemen and sacristans its landlords and salesmen for by these rather than by its society women and its statesmen and divines is it really judged in the books of travellers some attention also should be paid to the weather if the climate is to be praised in the railroad cafe at potsdam there was a waiter so rude to the marches that if they had not been people of great strength of character he would have undone the favorable impression the soldiers and civilians of berlin generally had been at such pains to produce in them and throughout the week of early september which they passed there it rained so much and so bitterly it was so wet and so cold that they might have come away thinking its the worst climate in the world if it had not been for a man whom they saw in one of the public gardens pouring a heavy stream from his garden hose upon the shrubbery already soaked and shuddering in the cold but this convinced them that they were suffering from weather and not from the climate which must really be hot and dry and they went home to their hotel and sat contentedly down in a temperature of sixty degrees the weather was not always so bad one day it was dry cold instead of wet cold with rough rusty clouds breaking a blue sky another day up to eleven in the forenoon it was like indian summer then it changed to a harsh november air and then it relented and ended so mildly that they hired chairs in the place before the imperial palace for five pfennigs each and sat watching the life before them motherly womenfolk were there knitting two american girls in chairs near them chatted together some fine equipages the only ones they saw in berlin went by a dog and a man the wife who ought to have been in harness was probably sick and the poor fellow was forced to take her place passed dragging a cart some schoolboys who had hung their satchels upon the low railing were playing about the base of the statue of king william iii in the joyous freedom of german childhood  they seemed the gayer for the brief moments of sunshine but to the americans who were southern by virtue of their sky the brightness had a sense of lurking winter in it such as they remembered feeling on a sunny day in quebec the blue heaven looked sad but they agreed that it fitly roofed the bit of old feudal berlin which forms the most ancient wing of the schloss this was timeblackened and rude but at least it did not try to be french and it overhung the spree which winds through the city and gives it the greatest charm it has in fact berlin which is otherwise so grandiose without grandeur and so severe without impressiveness is sympathetic wherever the spree opens it to the sky the stream is spanned by many bridges and bridges cannot well be unpicturesque especially if they have statues to help them out the spree abounds in bridges and it has a charming habit of slow hayladen barges at the landings of the little passengersteamers which ply upon it there are cafes and summergardens and these even in the inclement air of september suggested a friendly gayety  the marches saw it best in the tour of the elevated road in berlin which they made in an impassioned memory of the elevated road in new york the brick viaducts which carry this arch the spree again and again in their course through and around the city but with never quite such spectacular effects as our spidery tressels achieve the stations are pleasant sometimes with lunchcounters and newsstands but have not the comicoperachalet prettiness of ours and are not so frequent the road is not so smooth the cars not so smoothrunning or so swift on the other hand they are comfortably cushioned and they are never overcrowded the line is at times above at times below the houses and at times on a level with them alike in city and in suburbs the train whirled out of thickly built districts past the backs of the old houses into outskirts thinly populated with new houses springing up without order or continuity among the meadows and vegetablegardens and along the readymade elmplanted avenues where wooden fences divided the vacant lots everywhere the city was growing out over the country in blocks and detached edifices of limestone sandstone red and yellow brick larger or smaller of no more uniformity than our suburban dwellings but never of their ugliness or lawless offensiveness  in an effort for the intimate life of the country march went two successive mornings for his breakfast to the cafe bauer which has some admirable wallprintings and is the chief cafe on unter den linden but on both days there were more people in the paintings than out of them the second morning the waiter who took his order recognized him and asked wie gestern and from this he argued an affectionate constancy in the berliners and a hospitable observance of the tastes of strangers at his bankers on the other hand the cashier scrutinized his signature and remarked that it did not look like the signature in his letter of credit and then he inferred a suspicious mind in the moneyed classes of prussia as he had not been treated with such unkind doubt by hebrew bankers anywhere he made a mental note that the jews were politer than the christians in germany in starting for potsdam he asked a traeger where the potsdam train was and the man said dat train dare and in coming back he helped a fat old lady out of the car and she thanked him in english from these incidents both occurring the same day in the same place the inference of a widespread knowledge of our language in all classes of the population was inevitable  in this obvious and easy manner he studied contemporary civilization in the capital he even carried his researches farther and went one rainy afternoon to an exhibition of modern pictures in a pavilion of the thiergarten where from the small attendance he inferred an indifference to the arts which he would not ascribe to the weather one evening at a summer theatre where they gave the pantomime of the puppenfee and the operetta of hansel and gretel he observed that the greater part of the audience was composed of nice plain young girls and children and he noted that there was no sort of evening dress from the large number of americans present he imagined a numerous colony in berlin where they mast have an instinctive sense of their conationality since one of them in the stress of getting his hat and overcoat when they all came out confidently addressed him in english but he took stock of his impressions with his wife and they seemed to him so few after all that he could not resist a painful sense of isolation in the midst of the environment  they made a sunday excursion to the zoological gardens in the thiergarten with a large crowd of the lower classes but though they had a great deal of trouble in getting there by the various kinds of horsecars and electric cars they did not feel that they had got near to the popular life they endeavored for some sense of berlin society by driving home in a drosky and on the way they passed rows of beautiful houses in french and italian taste fronting the deep damp green park from the thiergartenstrasse in which they were confident cultivated and delightful people lived but they remained to the last with nothing but their unsupported conjecture     lxv  their excursion to potsdam was the cream of their sojourn in berlin they chose for it the first fair morning and they ran out over the flat sandy plains surrounding the capital and among the low hills surrounding potsdam before it actually began to rain  they wished immediately to see sans souci for the great fredericks sake and they drove through a lively shower to the palace where they waited with a horde of twentyfive other tourists in a gusty colonnade before they were led through voltaires room and fredericks death chamber  the french philosopher comes before the prussian prince at sans souci even in the palatial villa which expresses the wilful caprice of the great frederick as few edifices have embodied the whims or tastes of their owners the whole affair is eighteenthcentury french as the germans conceived it the gardened terrace from which the low onestory building thickly crusted with baroque sculptures looks down into a manycolored parterre was luxuriantly french and sentimentally french the colonnaded front opening to a perspective of artificial ruins with broken pillars lifting a conscious fragment of architrave against the sky within all again was french in the design the decoration and the furnishing at that time there was in fact no other taste and frederick who despised and disused his native tongue was resolved upon french taste even in his intimate companionship the droll story of his coquetry with the terrible free spirit which he got from france to be his guest is vividly reanimated at sans souci where one breathes the very air in which the strangely assorted companions lived and in which they parted so soon to pursue each other with brutal annoyance on one side and with merciless mockery on the other voltaire was long ago revenged upon his host for all the indignities he suffered from him in their comedy he left deeply graven upon fredericks fame the trace of those lacerating talons which he could strike to the quick and it is the singular effect of this scene of their brief friendship that one feels there the preeminence of the wit in whatever was most important to mankind  the rain had lifted a little and the sun shone out on the bloom of the lovely parterre where the marches profited by a smiling moment to wander among the statues and the roses heavy with the shower then they walked back to their carriage and drove to the new palace which expresses in differing architectural terms the same subjection to an alien ideal of beauty it is thronged without by delightfully preposterous rococco statues and within it is rich in all those curiosities and memorials of royalty with which palaces so well know how to fatigue the flesh and spirit of their visitors  the marches escaped from it all with sighs and groans of relief and before they drove off to see the great fountain of the orangeries they dedicated a moment of pathos to the temple of friendship which frederick built in memory of unhappy wilhelmina of beyreuth the sister he loved in the common sorrow of their wretched home and neglected when he came to his kingdom it is beautiful in its rococco way swept up to on its terrace by most noble staircases and swaggered over by baroque allegories of all sorts everywhere the statues outnumbered the visitors who may have been kept away by the rain the statues naturally did not mind it  sometime in the midst of their sightseeing the marches had dinner in a mildewed restaurant where a compatriotic accent caught their ear in a voice saying to the waiter we are in a hurry they looked round and saw that it proceeded from the pretty nose of a young american girl who sat with a party of young american girls at a neighboring table then they perceived that all the people in that restaurant were americans mostly young girls who all looked as if they were in a hurry but neither their beauty nor their impatience had the least effect with the waiter who prolonged the dinner at his pleasure and alarmed the marches with the misgiving that they should not have time for the final palace on their list  this was the palace where the father of frederick the mad old frederick william brought up his children with that severity which solomon urged but probably did not practise it is a vast place but they had time for it all though the custodian made the most of them as the latest comers of the day and led them through it with a prolixity as great as their waiters he was a most friendly custodian and when he found that they had some little notion of what they wanted to see he mixed zeal with his patronage and in a manner made them his honored guests they saw everything but the doorway where the faithful royal father used to lie in wait for his children and beat them princes and princesses alike with his knobby cane as they came through they might have seen this doorway without knowing it but from the window overlooking the paradeground where his family watched the manoeuvres of his gigantic grenadiers they made sure of just such puddles as frederick william forced his family to sit with their feet in while they dined alfresco on pork and cabbage and they visited the room of the smoking parliament where he ruled his convives with a rod of iron and made them the victims of his bad jokes the measuringboard against which he took the stature of his tall grenadiers is there and one room is devoted to those masterpieces which he used to paint in the agonies of gout his chef doeuvre contains a figure with two left feet and there seemed no reason why it might not have had three in another room is a small statue of carlyle who did so much to rehabilitate the house which the daughter of it wilhelmina did so much to demolish in the regard of men  the palace is now mostly kept for guests and there is a chamber where napoleon slept which is not likely to be occupied soon by any other selfinvited guest of his nation it is perhaps to keep the princes of europe humble that hardly a palace on the continent is without the chamber of this adventurer who till he stooped to be like them was easily their master another democracy had here recorded its invasion in the american stoves which the custodian pointed out in the corridor when mrs march with as little delay as possible had proclaimed their country the custodian professed an added respect for them from the fact and if he did not feel it no doubt he merited the drink money which they lavished on him at parting  their driver also was a congenial spirit and when he let them out of his carriage at the station he excused the rainy day to them he was a merry fellow beyond the wont of his nation and helaughed at the bad weather as if it had been a good joke on them  his gayety and the red sunset light which shone on the stems of the pines on the way back to berlin contributed to the content in which they reviewed their visit to potsdam they agreed that the place was perfectly charming and that it was incomparably expressive of kingly will and pride these had done there on the grand scale what all the german princes and princelings had tried to do in imitation and emulation of french splendor in potsdam the grandeur was not a historical growth as at versailles but was the effect of family genius in which there was often the curious fascination of insanity  they felt this strongly again amidst the futile monuments of the hohenzollern museum in berlin where all the portraits effigies personal belongings and memorials of that gifted eccentric race are gathered and historically disposed the princes of the mighty line who stand out from the rest are frederick the great and his infuriate father and in the waxen likeness of the son a small thin figure terribly spry and a face pitilessly alert appears something of the madness which showed in the life of the sire  they went through many rooms in which the memorials of the kings and queens the emperors and empresses were carefully ordered and felt no kindness except before the relics relating to the emperor frederick and his mother in the presence of the greatest of the dynasty they experienced a kind of terror which march expressed when they were safely away in the confession of his joy that those people were dead     lxvi  the rough weather which made berlin almost uninhabitable to mrs march had such an effect with general triscoe at weimar that under the orders of an englishspeaking doctor he retreated from it altogether and went to bed here he escaped the bronchitis which had attacked him and his convalesence left him so little to complain of that he could not always keep his temper in the absence of actual offence either from his daughter or from burnamy his sense of injury took a retroactive form it centred first in stoller and the twins then it diverged toward rose adding his mother and kenby and finally involved the marches in the same measure of inculpation for they had each and all had part directly or indirectly in the chances that brought on his cold  he owed to burnamy the comfort of the best room in the hotel and he was constantly dependent upon his kindness but he made it evident that he did not overvalue burnamys sacrifice and devotion and that it was not an unmixed pleasure however great a convenience to have him about in giving up his room burnamy had proposed going out of the hotel altogether but general triscoe heard of this with almost as great vexation as he had accepted the room he besought him not to go but so ungraciously that his daughter was ashamed and tried to atone for his manner by the kindness of her own  perhaps general triscoe would not have been without excuse if he were not eager to have her share with destitute merit the fortune which she had hitherto shared only with him he was old and certain luxuries had become habits if not necessaries with him of course he did not say this to himself and still less did he say it to her but he let her see that he did not enjoy the chance which had thrown them again in such close relations with burnamy and he did pot hide his belief that the marches were somehow to blame for it this made it impossible for her to write at once to mrs march as she had promised but she was determined that it should not make her unjust to burnamy she would not avoid him she would not let anything that had happened keep her from showing that she felt his kindness and was glad of his help  of course they knew no one else in weimar and his presence merely as a fellowcountryman would have been precious he got them a doctor against general triscoes will he went for his medicines he lent him books and papers he sat with him and tried to amuse him but with the girl he attempted no return to the situation at carlsbad there is nothing like the delicate pride of a young man who resolves to forego unfair advantage in love  the day after their arrival when her father was making up for the sleep he had lost by night she found herself alone in the little readingroom of the hotel with burnamy for the first time and she said i suppose you must have been all over weimar by this time  well ive been here off and on almost a month its an interesting place theres a good deal of the old literary quality left  and you enjoy that i sawshe added this with a little unnecessary flushyour poem in the paper you lent papa  i suppose i ought to have kept that back but i couldnt he laughed and she said  you must find a great deal of inspiration in such a literary place  it isnt lying about loose exactly even in the serious and perplexing situation in which he found himself he could not help being amused with her unliterary notions of literature her conventional and commonplace conceptions of it they had their value with him as those of a more fashionable world than his own which he believed was somehow a greater world at the same time he believed that she was now interposing them between the present and the past and forbidding with them any return to the mood of their last meeting in carlsbad he looked at her ladylike composure and unconsciousness and wondered if she could be the same person and the same person as they who lost themselves in the crowd that night and heard and said words palpitant with fate perhaps there had been no such words perhaps it was all a hallucination he must leave her to recognize that it was reality till she did so he felt bitterly that there was nothing for him but submission and patience if she never did so there was nothing for him but acquiescence  in this talk and in the talks they had afterwards she seemed willing enough to speak of what had happened since of coming on to wurzburg with the addings and of finding the marches there of roses collapse and of his mothers flight seaward with him in the care of kenby who was so fortunately going to holland too he on his side told her of going to wurzburg for the manoeuvres and they agreed that it was very strange they had not met  she did not try to keep their relations from taking the domestic character which was inevitable and it seemed to him that this in itself was significant of a determination on her part that was fatal to his hopes with a lovers indefinite power of blinding himself to what is before his eyes he believed that if she had been more diffident of him more uneasy in his presence he should have had more courage but for her to breakfast unafraid with him to meet him at lunch and dinner in the little diningroom where they were often the only guests and always the only englishspeaking guests was nothing less than prohibitive  in the hotel service there was one of those men who are porters in this world but will be angels in the next unless the perfect goodness of their looks the constant kindness of their acts belies them the marches had known and loved the man in their brief stay and he had been the fast friend of burnamy from the moment they first saw each other at the station he had tenderly taken possession of general triscoe on his arrival and had constituted himself the nurse and keeper of the irascible invalid in the intervals of going to the trains with a zeal that often relieved his daughter and burnamy the general in fact preferred him to either and a tacit custom grew up by which when august knocked at his door and offered himself in his few words of serviceable english that one of them who happened to be sitting with the general gave way and left him in charge the retiring watcher was then apt to encounter the other watcher on the stairs or in the readingroom or in the tiny whitepebbled dooryard at a little table in the shade of the woodentubbed evergreens from the habit of doing this they one day suddenly formed the habit of going across the street to that gardened hollow before and below the grandducal museum there was here a bench in the shelter of some lateflowering bush which the few other frequenters of the place soon recognized as belonging to the young strangers so that they would silently rise and leave it to them when they saw them coming apparently they yielded not only to their right but to a certain authority which resides in lovers and which all other men and especially all other women like to acknowledge and respect  in the absence of any civic documents bearing upon the affair it is difficult to establish the fact that this was the character in which agatha and burnamy were commonly regarded by the inhabitants of weimar but whatever their own notion of their relation was if it was not that of a brant and a brautigam the people of weimar would have been puzzled to say what it was it was known that the gracious young ladys father who would naturally have accompanied them was sick and in the fact that they were americans much extenuation was found for whatever was phenomenal in their unencumbered enjoyment of each others society  if their free american association was indistinguishably like the peasant informality which general triscoe despised in the relations of kenby and mrs adding it is to be said in his excuse that he could not be fully cognizant of it in the circumstances and so could do nothing to prevent it his pessimism extended to his health from the first he believed himself worse than the doctor thought him and he would have had some other physician if he had not found consolation in their difference of opinion and the consequent contempt which he was enabled to cherish for the doctor in view of the mans complete ignorance of the case in proof of his own better understanding of it he remained in bed some time after the doctor said he might get up  nearly ten days had passed before he left his room and it was not till then that he clearly saw how far affairs had gone with his daughter and burnamy though even then his observance seemed to have anticipated theirs he found them in a quiet acceptance of the fortune which had brought them together so contented that they appeared to ask nothing more of it the divine patience and confidence of their youth might sometimes have had almost the effect of indifference to a witness who had seen its evolution from the moods of the first few days of their reunion in weimar to general triscoe however it looked like an understanding which had been made without reference to his wishes and had not been directly brought to his knowledge  agatha he said after due note of a gay contest between her and burnamy over the pleasure and privilege of ordering his supper sent to his room when he had gone back to it from his first afternoon in the open air how long is that young man going to stay in weimar  why i dont know she answered startled from her work of beating the sofa pillows into shape and pausing with one of them in her hand i never asked him she looked down candidly into his face where he sat in an easychair waiting for her arrangement of the sofa what makes you ask  he answered with another question does he know that we had thought of staying here  why weve always talked of that havent we yes he knows it didnt you want him to know it papa you ought to have begun on the ship then of course ive asked him what sort of place it was im sorry if you didnt want me to  have i said that its perfectly easy to push on to paris unless  unless what agatha dropped the pillow and listened respectfully but in spite of her filial attitude she could not keep her youth and strength and courage from quelling the forces of the elderly man  he said querulously i dont see why you take that tone with me you certainly know what i mean but if you dont care to deal openly with me i wont ask you he dropped his eyes from her face and at the same time a deep blush began to tinge it growing up from her neck to her forehead you must knowyoure not a child he continued still with averted eyes that this sort of thing cant go on it must be something else or it mustnt be anything at all i dont ask you for your confidence and you know that ive never sought to control you  this was not the least true but agatha answered either absently or provisionally no  and i dont seek to do so now if you have nothing that you wish to tell me  he waited and after what seemed a long time she asked as if she had not heard him will you lie down a little before your supper papa  i will lie down when i feel like it he answered send august with the supper he can look after me  his resentful tone even more than his words dismissed her but she left him without apparent grievance saying quietly i will send august     lxvii  agatha did not come down to supper with burnamy she asked august when she gave him her fathers order to have a cup of tea sent to her room where when it came she remained thinking so long that it was rather tepid by the time she drank it  then she went to her window and looked out first above and next below above the moon was hanging over the gardened hollow before the museum with the airy lightness of an american moon below was burnamy behind the tubbed evergreens sitting tilted in his chair against the house wall with the spark of his cigar fainting and flashing like an american firefly agatha went down to the door after a little delay and seemed surprised to find him there at least she said oh in a tone of surprise  burnamy stood up and answered nice night  beautiful she breathed i didnt suppose the sky in germany could ever be so clear  it seems to be doing its best  the flowers over there look like ghosts in the light she said dreamily  theyre not dont you want to get your hat and wrap and go over and expose the fraud  oh she answered as if it were merely a question of the hat and wrap i have them  they sauntered through the garden walks for a while long enough to have ascertained that there was not a veridical phantom among the flowers if they had been looking and then when they came to their accustomed seat they sat down and she said i dont know that ive seen the moon so clear since we left carlsbad at the last word his heart gave a jump that seemed to lodge it in his throat and kept him from speaking so that she could resume without interruption ive got something of yours that you left at the posthof the girl that broke the dishes found it and lili gave it to mrs march for you this did not account for agathas having the thing whatever it was but when she took a handkerchief from her belt and put out her hand with it toward him he seemed to find that her having it had necessarily followed he tried to take it from her but his own hand trembled so that it clung to hers and he gasped cant you say now what you wouldnt say then  the logical sequence was no more obvious than be fore but she apparently felt it in her turn as he had felt it in his she whispered back yes and then she could not get out anything more till she entreated in a halfstifled voice oh dont  no no he panted i wonti oughtnt to have done iti beg your pardoni oughtnt to have spokeneveni  she returned in a far less breathless and tremulous fashion but still between laughing and crying i meant to make you and now if youre ever sorry or im ever too topping about anything you can be perfectly free to say that youd never have spoken if you hadnt seen that i wanted you to  but i didnt see any such thing he protested i spoke because i couldnt help it any longer  she laughed triumphantly of course you think so and that shows that you are only a man after all in spite of your finessing but i am going to have the credit of it i knew that you were holding back because you were too proud or thought you hadnt the right or something werent you she startled him with the sudden vehemence of her challenge if you pretend that you werent i shall never forgive you  but i was of course i was i was afraid  isnt that what i said she triumphed over him with another laugh and cowered a little closer to him if that could be  they were standing without knowing how they had got to their feet and now without any purpose of the kind they began to stroll again among the garden paths and to ask and to answer questions which touched every point of their common history and yet left it a mine of inexhaustible knowledge for all future time out of the sweet and dear delight of this encyclopedian reserve two or three facts appeared with a present distinctness one of these was that burnamy had regarded her refusal to be definite at carlsbad as definite refusal and had meant never to see her again and certainly never to speak again of love to her another point was that she had not resented his coming back that last night but had been proud and happy in it as proof of his love and had always meant somehow to let him know that she was torched by his trusting her enough to come back while he was still under that cloud with mr stoller with further logic purely of the heart she acquitted him altogether of wrong in that affair and alleged in proof what mr stoller had said of it to mr march burnamy owned that he knew what stoller had said but even in his present condition he could not accept fully her reading of that obscure passage of his life he preferred to put the question by and perhaps neither of them cared anything about it except as it related to the fact that they were now each others forever  they agreed that they must write to mr and mrs march at once or at least agatha said as soon as she had spoken to her father at her mention of her father she was aware of a doubt a fear in burnamy which expressed itself by scarcely more than a spiritual consciousness from his arm to the hands which she had clasped within it he has always appreciated you she said courageously and i know he will see it in the right light  she probably meant no more than to affirm her faith in her own ability finally to bring her father to a just mind concerning it but burnamy accepted her assurance with buoyant hopefulness and said he would see general triscoe the first thing in the morning  no i will see him she said i wish to see him first he will expect it of me we had better go in now she added but neither made any motion for the present to do so on the contrary they walked in the other direction and it was an hour after agatha declared their duty in the matter before they tried to fulfil it  then indeed after they returned to the hotel she lost no time in going to her father beyond that which must be given to a long handpressure under the fresco of the five poets on the stairs landing where her ways and burnamys parted she went into her own room and softly opened the door into her fathers and listened  well he said in a sort of challenging voice  have you been asleep she asked  ive just blown out my light what has kept you  she did not reply categorically standing there in the sheltering dark she said papa i wasnt very candid with you this afternoon i am engaged to mr burnamy  light the candle said her father or no he added before she could do so is it quite settled  quite she answered in a voice that admitted of no doubt that is as far as it can be without you  dont be a hypocrite agatha said the general and let me try to get to sleep you know i dont like it and you know i cant help it  yes the girl assented  then go to bed said the general concisely  agatha did not obey her father she thought she ought to kiss him but she decided that she had better postpone this so she merely gave him a tender goodnight to which he made no response and shut herself into her own room where she remained sitting and staring out into the moonlight with a smile that never left her lips  when the moon sank below the horizon the sky was pale with the coming day but before it was fairly dawn she saw something white not much greater than some moths moving before her window she pulled the valves open and found it a bit of paper attached to a thread dangling from above she broke it loose and in the morning twilight she read the great central truth of the universe  i love you l j b  she wrote under the tremendous inspiration  so do i dont be silly a t  she fastened the paper to the thread again and gave it a little twitch she waited for the low note of laughter which did not fail to flutter down from above then she threw herself upon the bed and fell asleep  it was not so late as she thought when she woke and it seemed at breakfast that burnamy had been up still earlier of the three involved in the anxiety of the night before general triscoe was still respited from it by sleep but he woke much more haggard than either of the young people they in fact were not at all haggard the worst was over if bringing their engagement to his knowledge was the worst the formality of asking his consent which burnamy still had to go through was unpleasant but after all it was a formality agatha told him everything that had passed between herself and her father and if it had not that cordiality on his part which they could have wished it was certainly not hopelessly discouraging  they agreed at breakfast that burnamy had better have it over as quickly as possible and he waited only till august came down with the generals tray before going up to his room the young fellow did not feel more at his ease than the elder meant he should in taking the chair to which the general waved him from where he lay in bed and there was no talk wasted upon the weather between them  i suppose i know what you have come for mr burnamy said general triscoe in a tone which was rather judicial than otherwise and i suppose you know why you have come the words certainly opened the way for burnamy but he hesitated so long to take it that the general had abundant time to add i dont pretend that this event is unexpected but i should like to know what reason you have for thinking i should wish you to marry my daughter i take it for granted that you are attached to each other and we wont waste time on that point not to beat about the bush on the next point let me ask at once what your means of supporting her are how much did you earn on that newspaper in chicago  fifteen hundred dollars burnamy answered promptly enough  did you earn anything more say within the last year  i got three hundred dollars advance copyright for a book i sold to a publisher the glory had not yet faded from the fact in burnamys mind  eighteen hundred what did you get for your poem in marchs book  thats a very trifling matter fifteen dollars  and your salary as private secretary to that man stoller  thirty dollars a week and my expenses but i wouldnt take that general triscoe said burnamy  general triscoe from his lit de justice passed this point in silence have you any one dependent on you  my mother i take care of my mother answered burnamy proudly  since you have broken with stoller what are your prospects  i have none  then you dont expect to support my daughter you expect to live upon her means  i expect to do nothing of the kind cried burnamy i should be ashamedi should feel disgracedi shouldi dont ask youi dont ask her till i have the means to support her  if you were very fortunate continued the general unmoved by the young fellows pain and unperturbed by the fact that he had himself lived upon his wifes means as long as she lived and then upon his daughters if you went back to stoller  i wouldnt go back to him i dont say hes knowingly a rascal but hes ignorantly a rascal and he proposed a rascally thing to me i behaved badly to him and id give anything to undo the wrong i let him do himself but ill never go back to him  if you went back on your old salary the general persisted pitilessly you would be very fortunate if you brought your earnings up to twentyfive hundred a year  yes  and how far do you think that would go in supporting my daughter on the scale she is used to i dont speak of your mother who has the first claim upon you  burnamy sat dumb and his head which he had lifted indignantly when the question was of stoller began to sink  the general went on you ask me to give you my daughter when you havent money enough to keep her in gowns you ask me to give her to a stranger  not quite a stranger general triscoe burnamy protested you have known me for three months at least and any one who knows me in chicago will tell you  a stranger and worse than a stranger the general continued so pleased with the logical perfection of his position that he almost smiled and certainly softened toward burnamy it isnt a question of liking you mr burnamy but of knowing you my daughter likes you so do the marches so does everybody who has met you i like you myself youve done me personally a thousand kindnesses but i know very little of you in spite of our three months acquaintance and that little isbut you shall judge for yourself you were in the confidential employ of a man who trusted you and you let him betray himself  i did i dont excuse it the thought of it burns like fire but it wasnt done maliciously it wasnt done falsely it was done inconsiderately and when it was done it seemed irrevocable but it wasnt i could have prevented i could have stooped the mischief and i didnt i can never outlive that  i know said the general relentlessly that you have never attempted any defence that has been to your credit with me it inclined me to overlook your unwarranted course in writing to my daughter when you told her you would never see her again what did you expect me to think after that of your coming back to see her or didnt you expect me to know it  i expected you to know it i knew she would tell you but i dont excuse that either it was acting a lie to come back all i can say is that i had to see her again for one last time  and to make sure that it was to be the last time you offered yourself to her  i couldnt help doing that  i dont say you could i dont judge the facts at all i leave them altogether to you and you shall say what a man in my position ought to say to such a man as you have shown yourself  no i will say the door into the adjoining room was flung open and agatha flashed in from it  her father looked coldly at her impassioned face have you been listening he asked  i have been hearing  oh as nearly as a man could in bed general triscoe shrugged  i suppose i had a right to be in my own room i couldnt help hearing and i was perfectly astonished at you papa the cruel way you went on after all youve said about mr stoller and his getting no more than he deserved  that doesnt justify me burnamy began but she cut him short almost as severely as shehad dealt with her father  yes it does it justifies you perfectly and his wanting you to falsify the whole thing afterwards more than justifies you  neither of the men attempted anything in reply to her casuistry they both looked equally posed by it for different reasons and agatha went on as vehemently as before addressing herself now to one and now to the other  and besides if it didnt justify you what you have done yourself would and your never denying it or trying to excuse it makes it the same as if you hadnt done it as far as you are concerned and that is all i care for burnamy started as if with the sense of having heard something like this before and with surprise at hearing it now and she flushed a little as she added tremulously and i should never never blame you for it after that its only trying to wriggle out of things which i despise and youve never done that and he simply had to come back she turned to her father and tell me himself just how it was and you said yourself papaor the same as saidthat he had no right to suppose i was interested in his affairs unless heunlessand i should never have forgiven him if he hadnt told me then that he that he had come back because hefelt the way he did i consider that that exonerated him for breaking his word completely if he hadnt broken his word i should have thought he had acted very cruelly andand strangely and ever since then he has behaved so nobly so honorably so delicately that i dont believe he would ever have said anything againif i hadnt fairly forced him yes yes i did she cried at a movement of remonstrance from burnamy and i shall always be proud of you for it her father stared steadfastly at her and he only lifted his eyebrows for change of expression when she went over to where burnamy stood and put her hand in his with a certain childlike impetuosity and as for the rest she declared everything i have is his just as everything of his would be mine if i had nothing or if he wishes to take me without anything then he can have me so and i shant be afraid but we can get along somehow she added i have managed without a maid ever since i left home and poverty has no terrors for me     lxviii  general triscoe submitted to defeat with the patience which soldiers learn he did not submit amiably that would have been out of character and perhaps out of reason but burnamy and agatha were both so amiable that they supplied goodhumor for all they flaunted their rapture in her fathers face as little as they could but he may have found their serene satisfaction their settled confidence in their fate as hard to bear as a more boisterous happiness would have been  it was agreed among them all that they were to return soon to america and burnamy was to find some sort of literary or journalistic employment in new york she was much surer than he that this could be done with perfect ease but they were of an equal mind that general triscoe was not to be disturbed in any of his habits or vexed in the tenor of his living and until burnamy was at least selfsupporting there must be no talk of their being married  the talk of their being engaged was quite enough for the time it included complete and minute autobiographies on both sides reciprocal analyses of character a scientifically exhaustive comparison of tastes ideas and opinions a profound study of their respective chins noses eyes hands heights complexions moles and freckles with some account of their several friends  in this occupation which was profitably varied by the confession of what they had each thought and felt and dreamt concerning the other at every instant since they met they passed rapidly the days which the persistent anxiety of general triscoe interposed before the date of their leaving weimar for paris where it was arranged that they should spend a month before sailing for new york burnamy had a notion which agatha approved of trying for something there on the new yorkparis chronicle and if he got it they might not go home at once his gains from that paper had eked out his copyright from his book and had almost paid his expenses in getting the material which he had contributed to it they were not so great however but that his gold reserve was reduced to less than a hundred dollars counting the silver coinages which had remained to him in crossing and recrossing frontiers he was at times dimly conscious of his finances but he buoyantly disregarded the facts as incompatible with his status as agathas betrothed if not unworthy of his character as a lover in the abstract  the afternoon before they were to leave weimar they spent mostly in the garden before the grandducal museum in a conference so important that when it came on to rain at one moment they put up burnamys umbrella and continued to sit under it rather than interrupt the proceedings even to let agatha go back to the hotel and look after her fathers packing her own had been finished before dinner so as to leave her the whole afternoon for their conference and to allow her father to remain in undisturbed possession of his room as long as possible  what chiefly remained to be put into the generals trunk were his coats and trousers hanging in the closet and august took these down and carefully folded and packed them then to make sure that nothing had been forgotten agatha put a chair into the closet when she came in and stood on it to examine the shelf which stretched above the hooks  there seemed at first to be nothing on it and then there seemed to be something in the further corner which when it was tiptoed for proved to be a bouquet of flowers not so faded as to seem very old the blue satin ribbon which they were tied up with and which hung down half a yard was of entire freshness except far the dust of the shelf where it had lain  agatha backed out into the room with her find in her hand and examined it near to and then at arms length august stood by with a pair of the generals trousers lying across his outstretched hands and as agatha absently looked round at him she caught a light of intelligence in his eyes which changed her whole psychological relation to the withered bouquet till then it had been a lifeless meaningless bunch of flowers which some one for no motive had tossed up on that dusty shelf in the closet at augusts smile it became something else still she asked lightly enough was ist loss august  his smile deepened and broadened fur die andere he explained  agatha demanded in english what do you mean by feardy ondery  oddaw lehdy  other lady august nodded rejoicing in big success and agatha closed the door into her own room where the general had been put for the time so as to be spared the annoyance of the packing then she sat down with her hands in her lap and the bouquet in her hands now august she said very calmly i want you to tell meich wunsche sie zu mir sagenwhat other ladywass andere damethese flowers belonged todiese blumen gehorte zu verstehen sie  august nodded brightly and with german carefully adjusted to agathas capacity and with now and then a word or phrase of english he conveyed that before she and her herr father had appeared there had been in weimar another american fraulein with her frau mother they had not indeed staid in that hotel but had several times supped there with the young herr bornahmee who was occupying that room before her herr father the young herr had been much about with these american damen driving and walking with them and sometimes dining or supping with them at their hotel the elephant august had sometimes carried notes to them from the young herr and he had gone for the bouquet which the gracious fraulein was holding on the morning of the day that the american damen left by the train for hanover  august was much helped and encouraged throughout by the friendly intelligence of the gracious fraulein who smiled radiantly in clearing up one dim point after another and who now and then supplied the english analogues which he sought in his effort to render his german more luminous  at the end she returned to the work of packing in which she directed him and sometimes assisted him with her own hands having put the bouquet on the mantel to leave herself free she took it up again and carried it into her own room when she went with august to summon her father back to his she bade august say to the young herr if he saw him that she was going to sup with her father and august gave her message to burnamy whom he met on the stairs coming down as he was going up with their tray  agatha usually supped with her father but that evening burnamy was less able than usual to bear her absence in the hotel diningroom and he went up to a cafe in the town for his supper he did not stay long and when he returned his heart gave a joyful lift at sight of agatha looking out from her balcony as if she were looking for him he made her a gay flourishing bow lifting his hat high and she came down to meet him at the hotel door she had her hat on and jacket over one arm and she joined him at once for the farewell walk he proposed in what they had agreed to call their garden  she moved a little ahead of him and when they reached the place where they always sat she shifted her jacket to the other arm and uncovered the hand in which she had been carrying the withered bouquet here is something i found in your closet when i was getting papas things out  why what is it he asked innocently as he took it from her  a bouquet apparently she answered as he drew the long ribbons through his fingers and looked at the flowers curiously with his head aslant  where did you get it  on the shelf  it seemed a long time before burnamy said with a long sigh as of final recollection oh yes and then he said nothing and they did not sit down but stood looking at each other  was it something you got for me and forgot to give me she asked in a voice which would not have misled a woman but which did its work with the young man  he laughed and said well hardly the general has been in the room ever since you came  oh yes then perhaps somebody left it there before you had the room  burnamy was silent again but at last he said no i flung it up there i had forgotten all about it  and you wish me to forget about it too agatha asked in a gayety of tone that still deceived him  it would only be fair you made me he rejoined and there was something so charming in his words and way that she would have been glad to do it  but she governed herself against the temptation and said women are not good at forgetting at least till they know what  oh ill tell you if you want to know he said with a laugh and at the words shesank provisionally in their accustomed seat he sat down beside her but not so near as usual and he waited so long before he began that it seemed as if he had forgotten again why its nothing miss etkins and her mother were here before you came and this is a bouquet that i meant to give her at the train when she left but i decided i wouldnt and i threw it onto the shelf in the closet  may i ask why you thought of taking a bouquet to her at the train  well she and her motheri had been with them a good deal and i thought it would be civil  and why did you decide not to be civil  i didnt want it to look like more than civility  were they here long  about a week they left just after the marches came  agatha seemed not to heed the answer she had exacted she sat reclined in the corner of the seat with her head drooping after an interval which was long to burnamy she began to pull at a ring on the third finger of her left hand absently as if she did not know what she was doing but when she had got it off she held it towards burnamy and said quietly i think you had better have this again and then she rose and moved slowly and weakly away  he had taken the ring mechanically from her and he stood a moment bewildered then he pressed after her  agatha do youyou dont mean  yes she said without looking round at his face which she knew was close to her shoulder its over it isnt what youve done its what you are i believed in you in spite of what you did to that manand your coming back when you said you wouldntandbut i see now that what you did was you it was your nature and i cant believe in you any more  agatha he implored youre not going to be so unjust there was nothing between you and me when that girl was here i had a right to  not if you really cared for me do you think i would have flirted with any one so soon if i had cared for you as you pretended you did for me that night in carlsbad oh i dont say youre false but youre fickle  but im not fickle from the first moment i saw you i never cared for any one but you  you have strange ways of showing your devotion well say you are not fickle say that im fickle i am i have changed my mind i see that it would never do i leave you free to follow all the turning and twisting of your fancy she spoke rapidly almost breathlessly and she gave him no chance to get out the words that seemed to choke him she began to run but at the door of the hotel she stopped and waited till he came stupidly up i have a favor to ask mr burnamy i beg you will not see me again if you can help it before we go tomorrow my father and i are indebted to you for too many kindnesses and you mustnt take any more trouble on our account august can see us off in the morning  she nodded quickly and was gone indoors while he was yet struggling with his doubt of the reality of what had all so swiftly happened  general triscoe was still ignorant of any change in the status to which he had reconciled himself with so much difficulty when he came down to get into the omnibus for the train till then he had been too proud to ask what had become of burnamy though he had wondered but now he looked about and said impatiently i hope that young man isnt going to keep us waiting  agatha was pale and worn with sleeplessness but she said firmly he isnt going papa i will tell you in the train august will see to the tickets and the baggage  august conspired with the traeger to get them a firstclass compartment to themselves but even with the advantages of this seclusion agathas confidences to her father were not full she told her father that her engagement was broken for reasons that did not mean anything very wrong in mr burnamy but that convinced her they could never be happy together as she did not give the reasons he found a natural difficulty in accepting them and there was something in the situation which appealed strongly to his contrarymindedness partly from this partly from his sense of injury in being obliged so soon to adjust himself to new conditions and partly from his comfortable feeling of security from an engagement to which his assent had been forced he said i hope youre not making a mistake  oh no she answered and she attested her conviction by a burst of sobbing that lasted well on the way to the first stop of the train     lxix  it would have been always twice as easy to go direct from berlin to the hague through hanover but the marches decided to go by frankfort and the rhine because they wished to revisit the famous river which they remembered from their youth and because they wished to stop at dusseldorf where heinrich heine was born without this mrs march who kept her husband up to his early passion for the poet with a feeling that she was defending him from age in it said that their silver wedding journey would not be complete and he began himself to think that it would be interesting  they took a sleepingcar for frankfort and they woke early as people do in sleepingcars everywhere march dressed and went out for a cup of the same coffee of which sleepingcar buffets have the awful secret in europe as well as america and for a glimpse of the twilight landscape one gray little town towered and steepled and redroofed within its mediaeval walls looked as if it would have been warmer in something more there was a heavy dew if not a light frost over all and in places a pale fog began to lift from the low hills then the sun rose without dispersing the cold which was afterwards so severe in their room at the russischer hof in frankfort that in spite of the steamradiators they sat shivering in all their wraps till breakfasttime  there was no steam on in the radiators of course when they implored the portier for at least a lamp to warm their hands by he turned on all the electric lights without raising the temperature in the slightest degree amidst these modern comforts they were so miserable that they vowed each other to shun as long as they were in germany or at least while the summer lasted all hotels which were steamheated and electriclighted they heated themselves somewhat with their wrath and over their breakfast they relented so far as to suffer themselves a certain interest in the troops of all arms beginning to pass the hotel they were fragments of the great parade which had ended the day before and they were now drifting back to their several quarters of the empire many of them were very picturesque and they had for the boys and girls running before and beside them the charm which armies and circus processions have for children everywhere but their passage filled with cruel anxiety a large old dog whom his master had left harnessed to a milkcart before the hotel door from time to time he lifted up his voice and called to the absentee with hoarse deep barks that almost shook him from his feet  the day continued blue and bright and cold and the marches gave the morning to a rapid survey of the city glad that it was at least not wet what afterwards chiefly remained to them was the impression of an old town as quaint almost and as gothic as old hamburg and a new town handsome and regular and in the sudden arrest of some streets apparently overbuilt the modern architectural taste was of course parisian there is no other taste for the germans but in the prevailing absence of statues there was a relief from the most oppressive characteristic of the imperial capital which was a positive delight some sort of monument to the national victory over france there must have been but it must have been unusually inoffensive for it left no record of itself in the travellers consciousness they were aware of gardened squares and avenues bordered by stately dwellings of dignified civic edifices and of a vast and splendid railroad station such as the state builds even in minor european cities but such as our paternal corporations have not yet given us anywhere in america they went to the zoological garden where they heard the customary kalmucks at their public prayers behind a high board fence and as pilgrims from the most plutrocratic country in the world march insisted that they must pay their devoirs at the shrine of the rothschilds whose natal bankinghouse they revered from the outside  it was a pity he said that the rothschilds were not on his letter of credit he would have been willing to pay tribute to the genius of finance in the percentage on at least ten pounds but he consoled himself by reflecting that he did not need the money and he consoled mrs march for their failure to penetrate to the interior of the rothschilds birthplace by taking her to see the house where goethe was born the public is apparently much more expected there and in the friendly place they were no doubt much more welcome than they would have been in the rothschild house under that roof they renewed a happy moment of weimar which after the lapse of a week seemed already so remote they wondered as they mounted the stairs from the basement opening into a clean little court how burnamy was getting on and whether it had yet come to that understanding between him and agatha which mrs march at least had meant to be inevitable then they became part of some such sightseeing retinue as followed the custodian about in the goethe horse in weimar and of an emotion indistinguishable from that of their fellow sightseers they could make sure afterwards of a personal pleasure in a certain prescient classicism of the house it somehow recalled both the goethe houses at weimar and it somehow recalled italy it is a separate house of two floors above the entrance which opens to a little court or yard and gives access by a decent stairway to the livingrooms the chief of these is a sufficiently dignified parlor or salon and the most important is the little chamber in the third story where the poet first opened his eyes to the light which he rejoiced in for so long a life and which dying he implored to be with him more it is as large as his deathchamber in weimar where he breathed this prayer and it looks down into the italianlooking court where probably he noticed the world for the first time and thought it a paved enclosure thirty or forty feet square in the birthroom they keep his puppet theatre and the place is fairly suggestive of his childhood later in his youth he could look from the parlor windows and see the house where his earliest love dwelt so much remains of goethe in the place where he was born and as such things go it is not a little the house is that of a prosperous and wellplaced citizen and speaks of the senatorial quality in his family which heine says he was fond of recalling rather than the sartorial quality of the ancestor who again as heine says mended the republics breeches  from the goethe house one drives by the goethe monument to the romer the famous townhall of the old free imperial city which frankfort once was and by this route the marches drove to it agreeing with their coachman that he was to keep as much in the sun as possible it was still so cold that when they reached the romer and he stopped in a broad blaze of the only means of heating that they have in frankfort in the summer the travellers were loath to leave it for the chill interior where the german emperors were elected for so many centuries as soon as an emperor was chosen in the great hall effigied round with the portraits of his predecessors he hurried out in the balcony ostensibly to show himself to the people but really march contended to warm up a little in the sun the balcony was undergoing repairs that day and the travellers could not go out on it but under the spell of the historic interest of the beautiful old gothic place they lingered in the interior till they were halftorpid with the cold then she abandoned to him the joint duty of viewing the cathedral and hurried to their carriage where she basked in the sun till he came to her he returned shivering after a halfhours absence and pretended that she had missed the greatest thing in the world but as he could never be got to say just what she had lost and under the closest crossexamination could not prove that this cathedral was memorably different from hundreds of other fourteenthcentury cathedrals she remained in a lasting content with the easier part she had chosen his only definite impression at the cathedral seemed to be confined to a bostonian of gloomily correct type whom he had seen doing it with his baedeker and not letting an object of interest escape and his account of her fellowtownsman reconciled mrs march more and more to not having gone  as it was warmer outdoors than indoors at frankfort and as the breadth of sunshine increased with the approach of noon they gave the rest of the morning to driving about and ignorantly enjoying the outside of many gothic churches whose names even they did not trouble themselves to learn they liked the river main whenever they came to it because it was so lately from wurzburg and because it was so beautiful with its bridges old and new and its boats of many patterns they liked the marketplace in front of the romer not only because it was full of fascinating bargains in curious crockery and woodenware but because there was scarcely any shade at all in it they read from their baedeker that until the end of the last century no jew was suffered to enter the marketplace and they rejoiced to find from all appearances that the jews had been making up for their unjust exclusion ever since they were almost as numerous there as the anglosaxons were everywhere else in frankfort these both of the english and american branches of the race prevailed in the hotel diningroom where the marches had a midday dinner so good that it almost made amends for the steamheating and electriclighting  as soon as possible after dinner they took the train for mayence and ran rhinewards through a pretty country into what seemed a milder climate it grew so much milder apparently that a lady in their compartment to whom march offered his forwardlooking seat ordered the window down when the guard came without asking their leave then the climate proved much colder and mrs march cowered under her shawls the rest of the way and would not be entreated to look at the pleasant level landscape near or the hills far off he proposed to put up the window as peremptorily as it had been put down but she stayed him with a hoarse whisper she may be another baroness at first he did not know what she meant then he remembered the lady whose claims to rank her presence had so poorly enforced on the way to wurzburg and he perceived that his wife was practising a wise forbearance with their fellowpassengers and giving her a chance to turn out any sort of highhote she chose she failed to profit by the opportunity she remained simply a selfish disagreeable woman of no more perceptible distinction than their other fellowpassenger a little commercial traveller from vienna they resolved from his appearance and the lettering on his valise that he was no other who slept with a sort of passionate intensity all the way to mayence     lxx  the main widened and swam fuller as they approached the rhine and flooded the lowlying fields inplaces with a pleasant effect under a wet sunset when they reached the station in mayence they drove interminably to the hotel they had chosen on the rivershore through a city handsomer and cleaner than any american city they could think of and great part of the way by a street of dwellings nobler mrs march owned than even commonwealth avenue in boston it was planted like that with double rows of trees but lacked its green lawns and at times the sign of weinhandlung at a corner betrayed that there was no such restriction against shops as keeps the boston street so sacred otherwise they had to confess once more that any inferior city of germany is of a more proper and dignified presence than the most parseproud metropolis in america to be sure they said the german towns had generally a thousand years start but all the same the fact galled them  it was very bleak though very beautiful when they stopped before their hotel on the rhine where all their impalpable memories of their visit to mayence thirty years earlier precipitated themselves into something tangible there were the reaches of the storied and fabled stream with its boats and bridges and wooded shores and islands there were the spires and towers and roofs of the town on either bank crowding to the rivers brink and there withindoors was the stately portier in gold braid and the smiling bowing handrubbing landlord alluring them to his most expensive rooms which so late in the season he would fain have had them take but in a little elevator that mounted slowly very slowly in the curve of the stairs they went higher to something lower and the landlord retired baked and left them to the ministrations of the servingmen who arrived with their large and small baggage all these retired in turn when they asked to have a fire lighted in the stove without which mrs march would never have taken the fine stately rooms and sent back a pretty young girl to do it she came indignant not because she had come lugging a heavy hod of coal and a great armload of wood but because her sense of fitness was outraged by the strange demand  what she cried a fire in september  yes march returned inspired to miraculous aptness in his german by the exigency yes if september is cold  the girl looked at him and then either because she thought him mad or liked him merry burst into a loud laugh and kindled the fire without a word more  he lighted all the reluctant gasjets in the vast gilt chandelier and in less than half an hour the temperature of the place rose to at least sixtyfive fahrenheit with every promise of going higher mrs march made herself comfortable in a deep chair before the stove and said she would have her supper there and she bade him send her just such a supper of chicken and honey and tea as they had all had in mayence when they supped in her aunts parlor there all those years ago he wished to compute the years but she drove him out with an imploring cry and he went down to a very gusty diningroom on the groundfloor where he found himself alone with a young english couple and their little boy they were friendly intelligent people and would have been conversable apparently but for the terrible cold of the husband which he said he had contracted at the manoeuvres in hombourg march said he was going to holland and the englishman was doubtful of the warmth which march expected to find there he seemed to be suffering from a suspense of faith as to the warmth anywhere from time to time the door of the diningroom selfopened in a silent ghostly fashion into the court without and let in a chilling draught about the legs of all till the little english boy got down from his place and shut it  he alone continued cheerful for marchs spirits certainly did not rise when some mumbling americans came in and muttered over their meat at another table he hated to own it but he had to own that wherever he had met the two branches of the anglosaxon race together in europe the elder had shown by a superior chirpiness to the disadvantage of the younger the cast clothes of the oldfashioned british offishness seemed to have fallen to the american travellers who were trying to be correct and exemplary and he would almost rather have had back the oldstyle bragging americans whom he no longer saw he asked of an agreeable fellowcountryman whom he found later in the readingroom what had become of these and this compatriot said he had travelled with one only the day before who had posed before their whole compartment in his scorn of the german landscape the german weather the german government the german railway management and then turned out an american of german birth march found his wife in great bodily comfort when he went back to her but in trouble of mind about a clock which she had discovered standing on the lacquered iron top of the stove it was a french clock of architectural pretensions in the taste of the first empire and it looked as if it had not been going since napoleon occupied mayence early in the century but mrs march now had it sorely on her conscience where in its danger from the heat of the stove it rested with the weight of the pantheon whose classic form it recalled she wondered that no one had noticed it before the fire was kindled and she required her husband to remove it at once from the top of the stove to the mantel under the mirror which was the natural habitat of such a clock he said nothing could be simpler but when he lifted it it began to fall all apart like a clock in the house of the hoodoo its marble base droppedoff its pillars tottered its pediment swayed to one side while mrs march lamented her hard fate and implored him to hurry it together before any one came he contrived to reconstruct it in its new place then they both breathed freer and returned to sit down before the stove but at the same moment they both saw ineffaceably outlined on the lacquered top the basal form of the clock the chambermaid would see it in the morning she would notice the removal of the clock and would make a merit of reporting its ruin by the heat to the landlord and in the end they would be mulcted of its value rather than suffer this wrong they agreed to restore it to its place and let it go to destruction upon its own terms march painfully rebuilt it where he had found it and they went to bed with a bad conscience to worse dreams  he remembered before he slept the hour of his youth when he was in mayence before and was so care free that he had heard with impersonal joy two young american voices speaking english in the street under his window one of them broke from the common talk with a gay burlesque of pathos in the line       oh heavens she cried my heeding country save  and then with a laughing goodnight these unseen unknown spirits of youth parted and departed who were they and in what different places with what cares or ills had their joyous voices grown old or fallen silent for evermore it was a moonlight night march remembered and he remembered how he wished he were out in it with those merry fellows  he nursed the memory and the wonder in his dreaming thought and he woke early to other voices under his window but now the voices though young were many and were german and the march of feet and the stamp of hooves kept time with their singing he drew his curtain and saw the street filled with broken squads of men some afoot and some on horseback some in uniform and some in civil dress with students caps loosely straggling on and roaring forth that song whose words he could not make out at breakfast he asked the waiter what it all meant and he said that these were conscripts whose service had expired with the late manoeuvres and who were now going home he promised march a translation of the song but he never gave it and perhaps the sense of their joyful homegoing remained the more poetic with him because its utterance remained inarticulate  march spent the rainy sunday on which they had fallen in wandering about the little city alone his wife said she was tired and would sit by the fire and hear about mayence when he came in he went to the cathedral which has its renown for beauty and antiquity and he there added to his stock of useful information the fact that the people of mayence seemed very catholic and very devout they proved it by preferring to any of the divine old gothic shrines in the cathedral an ugly baroque altar which was everywhere hung about with votive offerings a fashionably dressed young man and young girl sprinkled themselves with holy water as reverently as if they had been old and ragged some tourists strolled up and down the aisles with their red guidebooks and studied the objects of interest a resplendent beadle in a cocked hat and with along staff of authority posed before his own ecclesiastical consciousness in blue and silver at the high altar a priest was saying mass and march wondered whether his consciousness was as wholly ecclesiastical as the beadles or whether somewhere in it he felt the historical majesty the long human consecration of the place  he wandered at random in the town through streets german and quaint and old and streets french and fine and new and got back to the river which he crossed on one of the several handsome bridges the rough river looked chill under a sky of windy clouds and he felt out of season both as to the summer travel and as to the journey he was making the summer of life as well as the summer of that year was past better return to his own radiator in his flat on stuyvesant square to the great ugly brutal town which if it was not home to him was as much home to him as to any one a longing for new york welled up his heart which was perhaps really a wish to be at work again he said he must keep this from his wife who seemed not very well and whom he must try to cheer up when he returned to the hotel  but they had not a very joyous afternoon and the evening was no gayer they said that if they had not ordered their letters sent to dusseldorf they believed they should push on to holland without stopping and march would have liked to ask why not push on to america but he forbore and he was afterwards glad that he had done so  in the morning their spirits rose with the sun though the sun got up behind clouds as usual and they were further animated by the imposition which the landlord practised upon them after a distinct and repeated agreement as to the price of their rooms he charged them twice as much and then made a merit of throwing off two marks out of the twenty he had plundered them of  now i see said mrs march on their way down to the boat how fortunate it was that we baked his clock you may laugh but i believe we were the instruments of justice  do you suppose that clock was never baked before asked her husband the landlord has his own arrangement with justice when he overcharges his parting guests he says to his conscience well they baked my clock     lxxi  the morning was raw but it was something not to have it rainy and the clouds that hung upon the hills and hid their tops were at least as fine as the long board signs advertising chocolate on the river banks the smoke rising from the chimneys of the manufactories of mayence was not so bad either when one got them in the distance a little and march liked the way the river swam to the stems of the trees on the low grassy shores it was like the mississippi between st louis and cairo in that and it was yellow and thick like the mississippi though he thought he remembered it blue and clear a friendly german of those who began to come aboard more and more at all the landings after leaving mayence assured him that he was right and that the rhine was unusually turbid from the unusual rains march had his own belief that whatever the color of the rhine might be the rains were not unusual but he could not gainsay the friendly german  most of the passengers at starting were english and american but they showed no prescience of the international affinition which has since realized itself in their behavior toward one another they held silently apart and mingled only in the effect of one young man who kept the marches in perpetual question whether he was a bostonian or an englishman his look was bostonian but his accent was english and was he a bostonian who had been in england long enough to get the accent or was he an englishman who had been in boston long enough to get the look he wore a belated straw hat and a thin sackcoat and in the rush of the boat through the raw air they fancied him very cold and longed to offer him one of their superabundant wraps at times march actually lifted a shawl from his knees feeling sure that the stranger was english and that he might make so bold with him then at some glacial glint in the young mans eye or at some petrific expression of his delicate face he felt that he was a bostonian and lost courage and let the shawl sink again march tried to forget him in the wonder of seeing the germans begin to eat and drink as soon as they came on boards either from the baskets they had brought with them or from the boats provision but he prevailed with his smile that was like a sneer through all the events of the voyage and took marchs mind off the scenery with a sudden wrench when he came unexpectedly into view after a momentary disappearance at the table dhote which was served when the landscape began to be less interesting the guests were expected to hand their plates across the table to the stewards but to keep their knives and forks throughout the different courses and at each of these partial changes march felt the young mans chilly eyes upon him inculpating him for the semicivilization of the management at such times he knew that he was a bostonian  the weather cleared as they descended the river and under a sky at last cloudless the marches had moments of swift reversion to their former rhine journey when they were young and the purple light of love mantled the vineyarded hills along the shore and flushed the castled steeps the scene had lost nothing of the beauty they dimly remembered there were certain features of it which seemed even fairer and grander than they remembered the town of bingen where everybody who knows the poem was more or less born was beautiful in spite of its factory chimneys though there were no compensating castles near it and the castles seemed as good as those of the theatre here and there some of them had been restored and were occupied probably by robber barons who had gone into trade others were still ruinous and there was now and then such a mere gray snag that march at sight of it involuntarily put his tongue to the broken tooth which he was keeping for the skill of the first american dentist  for natural sublimity the rhine scenery as they recognized once more does not compare with the hudson scenery and they recalled one point on the american river where the central road tunnels a jutting cliff which might very well pass for the rock of the loreley where she dreams       solo sitting by the shores of old romance  and the trains run in and out under her knees unheeded still still you know march argued this is the loreley on the rhine and not the loreley on the hudson and i suppose that makes all the difference besides the rhine doesnt set up to be sublime it only means to be storied and dreamy and romantic and it does it and then we have really got no mouse tower we might build one to be sure  well we have got no denkmal either said his wife meaning the national monument to the german reconquest of the rhine which they had just passed and that is something in our favor  it was too far off for us to see how ugly it was he returned  the denkmal at coblenz was so near that the bronze emperor almost rode aboard the boat  he could not answer such a piece of logic as that he yielded and began to praise the orcharded levels which now replaced the vinepurpled slopes of the upper river he said they put him in mind of orchards that he had known in his boyhood and they agreed that the supreme charm of travel after all was not in seeing something new and strange but in finding something familiar and dear in the heart of the strangeness  at cologne they found this in the tumult of getting ashore with their baggage and driving from the steamboat landing to the railroad station where they were to get their train for dusseldorf an hour later the station swarmed with travellers eating and drinking and smoking but they escaped from it for a precious half of their golden hour and gave the time to the great cathedral which was built a thousand years ago just round the corner from the station and is therefore very handy to it since they saw the cathedral last it had been finished and now under a cloudless evening sky it soared and swept upward like a pale flame within it was a bit overclean a bit bare but without it was one of the great memories of the race the record of a faith which wrought miracles of beauty at least if not piety  the train gave the marches another and last view of it as they slowly drew out of the city and began to run through a level country walled with faroff hills past fields of buckwheat showing their stems like coral under their black tops past peasant houses changing their wonted shape to taller and narrower forms past sluggish streams from which the mist rose and hung over the meadows under a red sunset glassy clear till the manifold factory chimneys of dusseldorf stained it with their dun smoke  this industrial greeting seemed odd from the town where heinrich heine was born but when they had eaten their supper in the capital little hotel they found there and went out for a stroll they found nothing to remind them of the factories and much to make them think of the poet the moon beautiful and perfect as a stage moon came up over the shoulder of a church as they passed down a long street which they had all to themselves everybody seemed to have gone to bed but at a certain corner a girl opened a window above them and looked out at the moon  when they returned to their hotel they found a highwalled garden facing it full of black depths of foliage in the night march woke and saw the moon standing over the garden and silvering its leafy tops this was really as it should be in the town where the idolized poet of his youth was born the poet whom of all others he had adored and who had once seemed like a living friend who had been witness of his first love and had helped him to speak it his wife used to laugh at him for his heineworship in those days but she had since come to share it and she even more than he had insisted upon this pilgrimage he thought long thoughts of the past as he looked into the garden across the way with an ache for his perished self and the dead companionship of his youth all ghosts together in the silvered shadow the trees shuddered in the night breeze and its chill penetrated to him where he stood  his wife called to him from her room what are you doing  oh sentimentalizing he answered boldly  well you will be sick she said and he crept back into bed again  they had sat up late talking in a glad excitement but he woke early as an elderly man is apt to do after broken slumbers and left his wife still sleeping he was not so eager for the poetic interests of the town as he had been the night before he even deferred his curiosity for heines birthhouse to the instructive conference which he had with his waiter at breakfast after all was not it more important to know something of the actual life of a simple common class of men than to indulge a faded fancy for the memory of a genius which no amount of associations could feed again to its former bloom the waiter said he was a nuremberger and had learned english in london where he had served a year for nothing afterwards when he could speak three languages he got a pound a week which seemed low for so many though not so low as the one mark a day which he now received in dusseldorf in berlin he paid the hotel two marks a day march confided to him his secret trouble as to tips and they tried vainly to enlighten each other as to what a just tip was  he went to his bankers and when he came back he found his wife with her breakfast eaten and so eager for the exploration of heines birthplace that she heard with indifference of his failure to get any letters it was too soon to expect them she said and then she showed him her plan which she had been working out ever since she woke it contained every place which heine had mentioned and she was determined not one should escape them she examined him sharply upon his condition accusing him of having taken cold when he got up in the night and acquitting him with difficulty she herself was perfectly well but a little fagged and they must have a carriage  they set out in a lordly twospanner which took up half the little bolkerstrasse where heine was born when they stopped across the way from his birthhouse so that she might first take it all in from the outside before they entered it it is a simple street and not the cleanest of the streets in a town where most of them are rather dirty below the houses are shops and the first story of heines house is a butcher shop with sides of pork and mutton hanging in the windows above where the heine family must once have lived a goldbeater and a framemaker displayed their signs  but did the heine family really once live there the house looked so fresh and new that in spite of the tablet in its front affirming it the poets birthplace they doubted and they were not reassured by the people who half halted as they passed and stared at the strangers so anomalously interested in the place they dismounted and crossed to the butcher shop where the provision man corroborated the tablet but could not understand their wish to go up stairs he did not try to prevent them however and they climbed to the first floor above where a placard on the door declared it private and implored them not to knock was this the outcome of the inmates despair from the intrusion of other pilgrims who had wised to see the heine dwellingrooms they durst not knock and ask so much and they sadly descended to the groundfloor where they found a butcher boy of much greater apparent intelligence than the butcher himself who told them that the building in front was as new as it looked and the house where heine was really born was the old house in the rear he showed them this house across a little court patched with mangy grass and lilacbushes and when they wished to visit it he led the way the place was strewn both underfoot and overhead with feathers it had once been all a garden out to the street the boy said but from these feathers as well as the odor which prevailed and the anxious behavior of a few hens left in the high coop at one side it was plain that what remained of the garden was now a chicken slaughteryard there was one wellgrown tree and the boy said it was of the poets time but when he let them into the house he became vague as to the room where heine was born it was certain only that it was somewhere upstairs and that it could not be seen the room where they stood was the framemakers shop and they bought of him a small frame for a memorial they bought of the butchers boy not so commercially a branch of lilac and they came away thinking how much amused heine himself would have been with their visit how sadly how merrily he would have mocked at their effort to revere his birthplace  they were too old if not too wise to be daunted by their defeat and they drove next to the old court garden beside the rhine where the poet says he used to play with the little veronika and probably did not at any rate the garden is gone the schloss was burned down long ago and nothing remains but a detached tower in which the good elector jan wilhelm of heines time amused himself with his many mechanical inventions the tower seemed to be in process of demolition but an intelligent workman who came down out of it was interested in the strangers curiosity and directed them to a place behind the historical museum where they could find a bit of the old garden it consisted of two or three low trees and under them the statue of the elector by which heine sat with the little veronika if he really did afresh gale blowing through the trees stirred the bushes that backed the statue but not the laurel wreathing the electors head and meeting in a neat point over his forehead the laurel wreath is stone like the rest of the elector who stands there smirking in marble ermine and armor and resting his baton on the nose of a very small lion who in the exigencies of foreshortening obligingly goes to nothing but a tail under the electors robe  this was a prince who loved himself in effigy so much that he raised an equestrian statue to his own renown in the marketplace though he modestly refused the credit of it and ascribed its erection to the affection of his subjects you see him therein a fullbottomed wig mounted on a rampant charger with a tail as big round as a barrel and heavy enough to keep him from coming down on his fore legs as long as he likes to hold them up it was to this horses back that heine clambered when a small boy to see the french take formal possession of dusseldorf and he clung to the waist of the bronze elector who had just abdicated while the burgomaster made a long speech from the balcony of the rathhaus and the electoral arms were taken down from its doorway  the rathhaus is a saladdressing of german gothic and french rococo as to its architectural style and is charming in its way but the marches were in the marketplace for the sake of that moment of heines boyhood they felt that he might have been the boy who stopped as he ran before them and smacked the stomach of a large pumpkin lying at the feet of an old marketwoman and then dashed away before she could frame a protest against the indignity from this incident they philosophized that the boys of dusseldorf are as mischievous at the end of the century as they were at the beginning and they felt the fascination that such a bounteous unkempt old marketplace must have for the boys of any period there were magnificent vegetables of all sorts in it and if the fruits were meagre that was the fault of the rainy summer perhaps the marketplace was very dirty and so was the narrow street leading down from it to the rhine which ran swift as a mountain torrent along a slatternly quay a bridge of boats crossing the stream shook in the rapid current and a long procession of market carts passed slowly over while a cluster of scows waited in picturesque patience for the draw to open  they saw what a beautiful town that was for a boy to grow up in and how many privileges it offered how many dangers how many chances for hairbreadth escapes they chose that heine must often have rushed shrieking joyfully down that foul alley to the rhine with other boys and they easily found a leafstrewn stretch of the sluggish dussel in the public garden where his playmate the little wilhelm lost his life and saved the kittens they were not so sure of the avenue through which the poet saw the emperor napoleon come riding on his small white horse when he took possession of the electors dominions but if it was that where the statue of the kaiser wilhelm i comes riding on a horse led by two victories both poet and hero are avenged there on the accomplished fact defeated and humiliated france triumphs in the badness of that foolish denkmal one of the worst in all denkmalridden germany and the memory of the singer whom the hohenzollern family pride forbids honor in his native place is immortal in its presence  on the way back to their hotel march made some reflections upon the open neglect throughout germany of the greatest german lyrist by which the poet might have profited if he had been present he contended that it was not altogether an effect of hohenzollern pride which could not suffer a joke or two from the archhumorist but that heine had said things of germany herself which germans might well have found unpardonable he concluded that it would not do to be perfectly frank with ones own country though to be sure there would always be the question whether the jewborn heine had even a stepfatherland in the germany he loved so tenderly and mocked so pitilessly he had to own that if he were a negro poet he would not feel bound to measure terms in speaking of america and he would not feel that his fame was in her keeping  upon the whole he blamed heine less than germany and he accused her of taking a shabby revenge in trying to forget him in the heat of his resentment that there should be no record of heine in the city where he was born march came near ignoring himself the fact that the poet freiligrath was also born there as for the famous dusseldorf school of painting which once filled the world with the worst art he rejoiced that it was now so dead and he grudged the glance which the beauty of the new art academy extorted from him it is in the french taste and is so far a monument to the continuance in one sort of that french supremacy of which in another sort another denkmal celebrates the overthrow dusseldorf is not content with the denkmal of the kaiser on horseback with the two victories for grooms there is a second which the marches found when they strolled out again late in the afternoon it is in the lovely park which lies in the heart of the city and they felt in its presence the only emotion of sympathy which the many patriotic monuments of germany awakened in them it had dignity and repose which these never had elsewhere but it was perhaps not so much for the dying warrior and the pitying lion of the sculpture that their hearts were moved as for the gentle and mournful humanity of the inscription which dropped into equivalent english verse in marchs notebook     fame was enough for the victors and glory and verdurous laurel    tears by their mothers wept founded this image of stone  to this they could forgive the vaunting record on the reverse of the german soldiers who died heroes in the war with france the war with austria and even the war with poor little denmark  the morning had been bright and warm and it was just that the afternoon should be dim and cold with a pale sun looking through a september mist which seemed to deepen the seclusion and silence of the forest reaches for the park was really a forest of the german sort as parks are apt to be in germany but it was beautiful and they strayed through it and sometimes sat down on the benches in its damp shadows and said how much seemed to be done in germany for the peoples comfort and pleasure in what was their own explicitly as well as what was tacitly theirs they were not so restricted as we were at home and especially the children seemed made fondly and lovingly free of all public things the marches met troops of them in the forest as they strolled slowly back by the winding dussel to the gardened avenue leading to the park and they found them everywhere gay and joyful but their elders seemed subdued and were silent the strangers heard no sound of laughter in the streets of dusseldorf and they saw no smiling except on the part of a very old couple whose meeting they witnessed and who grinned and cackled at each other like two children as they shook hands perhaps they were indeed children of that sad second childhood which one would rather not blossom back into  in america life is yet a joke with us even when it is grotesque and shameful as it so often is for we think we can make it right when we choose but there is no joking in germany between the first and second childhoods unless behind closed doors even there people do not joke above their breath about kings and emperors if they joke about them in print they take out their laugh in jail for the press laws are severely enforced and the prisons are full of able editors serious as well as comic lesemajesty is a crime that searches sinners out in every walk of life and it is said that in family jars a husband sometimes has the last word of his wife by accusing her of blaspheming the sovereign and so having her silenced for three months at least behind penitential bars  think said march how simply i could adjust any differences of opinion between us in dusseldorf  dont his wife implored with a burst of feeling which surprised him i want to go home  they had been talking over their day and planning their journey to holland for the morrow when it came to this outburst from her in the last halfhour before bed which they sat prolonging beside their stove  what and not go to holland what is to become of my aftercure  oh its too late for that now weve used up the month running about and tiring ourselves to death i should like to rest a weekto get into my berth on the norumbia and rest  i guess the september gales would have something to say about that  i would risk the september gales     lxxii  in the morning march came home from his bankers gay with the days provisional sunshine in his heart and joyously expectant of his wifes pleasure in the letters he was bringing there was one from each of their children and there was one from fulkerson which march opened and read on the street so as to intercept any unpleasant news there might be in them there were two letters for mrs march which he knew without opening were from miss triscoe and mrs adding respectively mrs addings from the postmarks seemed to have been following them about for some time  theyre all right at home he said do see what those people have been doing  i believe she said taking a knife from the breakfast tray beside her bed to cut the envelopes that youve really cared more about them all along than i have  no ive only been anxious to be done with them  she got the letters open and holding one of them up in each hand she read them impartially and simultaneously then she flung them both down and turned her face into her pillow with an impulse of her inalienable girlishness well it is too silly  march felt authorized to take them up and read them consecutively when he had done so he did not differ from his wife in one case agatha had written to her dear mrs march that she and burnamy had just that evening become engaged mrs adding on her part owned a farther step and announced her marriage to mr kenby following immemorial usage in such matters kenby had added a postscript affirming his happiness in unsparing terms and in agathas letter there was an avowal of like effect from burnamy agatha hinted her belief that her father would soon come to regard burnamy as she did and mrs adding professed a certain humiliation in having realized that after all her misgiving about him rose seemed rather relieved than otherwise as if he were glad to have her off his hands  well said march with these troublesome affairs settled i dont see what there is to keep us in europe any longer unless its the consensus of opinion in tom bella and fulkerson that we ought to stay the winter  stay the winter mrs march rose from her pillow and clutched the home letters to her from the abeyance in which they had fallen on the coverlet while she was dealing with the others what do you mean  it seems to have been prompted by a hint you let drop which tom has passed to bella and fulkerson  oh but that was before we left carlsbad she protested while she devoured the letters with her eyes and continued to denounce the absurdity of the writers her son and daughter both urged that now their father and mother were over there they had better stay as long as they enjoyed it and that they certainly ought not to come home without going to italy where they had first met and revisiting the places which they had seen together when they were young engaged people without that their silver wedding journey would not be complete her son said that everything was going well with every other week and both himself and mr fulkerson thought his father ought to spend the winter in italy and get a thorough rest make a job of it march fulkerson wrote and have a sabbatical year while youre at it you may not get another  well i can tell them said mrs march indignantly we shall not do anything of the kind  then you didnt mean it  mean it she stopped herself with a look at her husband and asked gently do you want to stay  well i dont know he answered vaguely the fact was he was sick of travel and of leisure he was longing to be at home and at work again but if there was to be any selfsacrifice which could be had as it were at a bargain which could be fairly divided between them and leave him the self and her the sacrifice he was too experienced a husband not to see the advantage of it or to refuse the merit i thought you wished to stay  yes she sighed i did it has been very very pleasant and if anything i have overenjoyed myself we have gone romping through it like two young people havent we  you have he assented i have always felt the weight of my years in getting the baggage registered they have made the baggage weigh more every time  and ive forgotten mine yes i have but the years havent forgotten me basil and now i remember them im tired it doesnt seem as if i could ever get up but i dare say its only a mood it may be only a cold and if you wish to stay whywe will think it over  no we wont my dear he said with a generous shame for his hypocrisy if not with a pure generosity ive got all the good out of it that there was in it for me and i shouldnt go home any better six months hence than i should now italy will keep for another time and so for the matter of that will holland  no no she interposed we wont give up holland whatever we do i couldnt go home feeling that i had kept you out of your aftercure and when we get there no doubt the sea air will bring me up so that i shall want to go to italy too again though it seems so far off now but go and see when the afternoon train for the hague leaves and i shall be ready my minds quite made up on that point  what a bundle of energy said her husband laughing down at her  he went and asked about the train to the hague but only to satisfy a superficial conscience for now he knew that they were both of one mind about going home he also looked up the trains for london and found that they could get there by way of ostend in fourteen hours then he went back to the bankers and with the help of the parisnew york chronicle which he found there he got the sailings of the first steamers home after that he strolled about the streets for a last impression of dusseldorf but it was rather blurred by the constantly recurring pull of his thoughts toward america and he ended by turning abruptly at a certain corner and going to his hotel  he found his wife dressed but fallen again on her bed beside which her breakfast stood still untasted her smile responded wanly to his brightness im not well my dear she said i dont believe i could get off to the hague this afternoon  could you to liverpool he returned  to liverpool she gasped what do you mean  merely that the cupania is sailing on the twentieth and ive telegraphed to know if we can get a room im afraid it wont be a good one but shes the first boat out and  no indeed we wont go to liverpool and we will never go home till youve had your aftercure in holland she was very firm in this but she added we will stay another night here and go to the hague tomorrow sit down and let us talk it over where were we  she lay down on the sofa and he put a shawl over her we were just starting for liverpool  no no we werent dont say such things dearest i want you to help me sum it all up you think its been a success dont you  as a cure  no as a silver wedding journey  perfectly howling  i do think weve had a good time i never expected to enjoy myself so much again in the world i didnt suppose i should ever take so much interest in anything it shows that when we choose to get out of our rut we shall always find life as fresh and delightful as ever there is nothing to prevent our coming any year now that toms shown himself so capable and having another silver wedding journey i dont like to think of its being confined to germany quite  oh i dont know we can always talk of it as our germansilver wedding journey  thats true but nobody would understand nowadays what you meant by germansilver its perfectly gone out how ugly it was a sort of greasy yellowish stuff always getting worn through i believe it was made worn through aunt mary had a castor of it that i can remember when i was a child it went into the kitchen long before i grew up would a joke like that console you for the loss of italy  it would go far to do it and as a germansilver wedding journey its certainly been very complete  what do you mean  its given us a representative variety of german cities first we had hamburg you know a great modern commercial centre  yes go on  then we had leipsic the academic  yes  then carlsbad the supreme type of a german health resort then nuremberg the mediaeval then anspach the extinct princely capital then wurzburg the ecclesiastical rococo then weimar for the literature of a great epoch then imperial berlin then frankfort the memory of the old free city then dusseldorf the centre of the most poignant personal interest in the worldi dont see how we could have done better if wed planned it all and not acted from successive impulses  its been grand its been perfect as germansilver wedding journey its perfectit seems as if it had been ordered but i will never let you give up holland no we will go this afternoon and when i get to schevleningen ill go to bed and stay there till youve completed your aftercure  do you think that will be wildly gay for the convalescent  she suddenly began to cry oh dearest what shall we do i feel perfectly broken down im afraid im going to be sickand away from home how could you ever let me overdo so she put her handkerchief to her eyes and turned her face into the sofa pillow  this was rather hard upon him whom her vivid energy and inextinguishable interest had not permitted a moments respite from pleasure since they left carlsbad but he had been married too long not to understand that her blame of him was only a form of selfreproach for her own selfforgetfulness she had not remembered that she was no longer young till she had come to what he saw was a nervous collapse the fact had its pathos and its poetry which no one could have felt more keenly than he if it also had its inconvenience and its danger he realized these too  isabel he said we are going home  very well then it will be your doing  quite do you think you could stand it as far as cologne we get the sleepingcar there and you can lie down the rest of the way to ostend  this afternoon why im perfectly strong its merely my nerves that are gone she sat up and wiped her eyes but basil if youre doing this for me  im doing it for myself said march as he went out of the room  she stood the journey perfectly well and in the passage to dover she suffered so little from the rough weather that she was an example to many robust matrons who filled the ladies cabin with the noise of their anguish during the night she would have insisted upon taking the first train up to london if march had not represented that this would not expedite the sailing of the cupania and that she might as well stay the forenoon at the convenient railway hotel and rest it was not quite his ideal of repose that the first people they saw in the coffeeroom when they went to breakfast should be kenby and rose adding who were having their tea and toast and eggs together in the greatest apparent goodfellowship he saw his wife shrink back involuntarily from the encounter but this was only to gather force for it and the next moment she was upon them in all the joy of the surprise then march allowed himself to be as glad as the others both seemed and he shook hands with kenby while his wife kissed rose and they all talked at once in the confusion of tongues it was presently intelligible that mrs kenby was going to be down in a few minutes and kenby took march into his confidence with a smile which was almost a wink in explaining that he knew how it was with the ladies he said that rose and he usually got down to breakfast first and when he had listened inattentively to mrs marchs apology for being on her way home he told her that she was lucky not to have gone to schevleningen where she and march would have frozen to death he said that they were going to spend september at a little place on the english coast near by where he had been the day before with rose to look at lodgings and where you could bathe all through the month he was not surprised that the marches were going home and said well that was their original plan wasnt it  mrs kenby appearing upon this pretended to know better after the outburst of joyful greeting with the marches and intelligently reminded kenby that he knew the marches had intended to pass the winter in paris she was looking extremely pretty but she wished only to make them see how well rose was looking and she put her arm round his shoulders as she spoke schevleningen had done wonders for him but it was fearfully cold there and now they were expecting everything from westgate where she advised march to come too for his aftercure she recollected in time to say she forgot they were on their way home she added that she did not know when she should return she was merely a passenger now she left everything to the men of the family she had in fact the air of having thrown off every responsibility but in supremacy not submission she was always ordering kenby about she sent him for her handkerchief and her rings which she had left either in the tray of her trunk or on the pincushion or on the washstand or somewhere and forbade him to come back without them he asked for her keys and then with a joyful scream she owned that she had left the doorkey in the door and the whole bunch of trunkkeys in her trunk and kenby treated it all as the greatest joke rose too seemed to think that kenby would make everything come right and he had lost that look of anxiety which he used to have at the most he showed a friendly sympathy for kenby for whose sake he seemed mortified at her he was unable to regard his mother as the delightful joke which she appeared to kenby but that was merely temperamental and he was never distressed except when she behaved with unreasonable caprice at kenbys cost  as for kenby himself he betrayed no dissatisfaction with his fate to march he perhaps no longer regarded his wife as that strong character which he had sometimes wearied march by celebrating but she was still the most brilliant intelligence and her charm seemed only to have grown with his perception of its wilful limitations he did not want to talk about her so much he wanted rather to talk about rose his health his education his nature and what was best to do for him the two were on terms of a confidence and affection which perpetually amused mrs kenby but which left the sympathetic witness nothing to desire in their relation  they all came to the train when the marches started up to london and stood waving to them as they pulled out of the station well i cant see but thats all right he said as he sank back in his seat with a sigh of relief i never supposed we should get out of their marriage half so well and i dont feel that you quite made the match either my dear  she was forced to agree with him that the kenbys seemed happy together and that there was nothing to fear for rose in their happiness he would be as tenderly cared for by kenby as he could have been by his mother and far more judiciously she owned that she had trembled for him till she had seen them all together and now she should never tremble again  well march prompted at a certain inconclusiveness in her tone rather than her words  well you can see that it isnt ideal  why isnt it ideal i suppose you think that the marriage of burnamy and agatha triscoe will be ideal with their ignorances and inexperiences and illusions  yes its the illusions no marriage can be perfect without them and at their age the kenbys cant have them  kenby is a solid mass of illusion and i believe that people can go and get as many new illusions as they want whenever theyve lost their old ones  yes but the new illusions wont wear so well and in marriage you want illusions that will last no you neednt talk to me its all very well but it isnt ideal  march laughed ideal what is ideal  going home she said with such passion that he had not the heart to point out that they were merely returning to their old duties cares and pains with the wornout illusion that these would be altogether different when they took them up again     lxxiii  in fulfilment of another ideal mrs march took straightway to her berth when she got on board the cupania and to her husbands admiration she remained there till the day before they reached new york her theory was that the complete rest would do more than anything else to calm her shaken nerves and she did not admit into her calculations the chances of adverse weather which march would not suggest as probable in the last week in september the event justified her unconscious faith the ships run was of unparalled swiftness even for the cupania and of unparalled smoothness for days the sea was as sleek as oil the racks were never on the tables once the voyage was of the sort which those who make it no more believe in at the time than those whom they afterwards weary in boasting of it  the ship was very full but mrs march did not show the slightest curiosity to know who her fellowpassengers were she said that she wished to be let perfectly alone even by her own emotions and for this reason she forbade march to bring her a list of the passengers till after they had left queenstown lest it should be too exciting he did not take the trouble to look it up therefore and the first night out he saw no one whom he knew at dinner but the next morning at breakfast he found himself to his great satisfaction at the same table with the eltwins they were so much at ease with him that even mrs eltwin took part in the talk and told him how they had spent the time of her husbands rigorous aftercure in switzerland and now he was going home much better than they had expected she said they had rather thought of spending the winter in europe but had given it up because they were both a little homesick march confessed that this was exactly the case with his wife and himself and he had to add that mrs march was not very well otherwise and he should be glad to be at home on her account the recurrence of the word home seemed to deepen eltwins habitual gloom and mrs eltwin hastened to leave the subject of their return for inquiry into mrs marchs condition her interest did not so far overcome her shyness that she ventured to propose a visit to her and march found that the fact of the eltwins presence on board did not agitate his wife it seemed rather to comfort her and she said she hoped he would see all he could of the poor old things she asked if he had met any one else he knew and he was able to tell her that there seemed to be a good many swells on board and this cheered her very much though he did not know them she liked to be near the rose though it was not a flower that she really cared for  she did not ask who the swells were and march took no trouble to find out he took no trouble to get a passengerlist and he had the more trouble when he tried at last the lists seemed to have all vanished as they have a habit of doing after the first day the one that he made interest for with the head steward was a secondhand copy and had no one he knew in it but the eltwins the social solitude however was rather favorable to certain other impressions there seemed even more elderly people than there were on the norumbia the human atmosphere was gray and sober there was nothing of the gay expansion of the outward voyage there was little talking or laughing among those autumnal men who were going seriously and anxiously home with faces fiercely set for the coming grapple or necks meekly bowed for the yoke they had eaten their cake and it had been good but there remained a discomfort in the digestion they sat about in silence and march fancied that the flown summer was as dreamlike to each of them as it now was to him he hated to be of their dreary company but spiritually he knew that he was of it and he vainly turned to cheer himself with the younger passengers some matrons who went about clad in furs amused him for they must have been unpleasantly warm in their jackets and boas nothing but the hope of being able to tell the customs inspector with a good conscience that the things had been worn would have sustained one lady draped from head to foot in astrakhan  they were all getting themselves ready for the fray or the play of the coming winter but there seemed nothing joyous in the preparation there were many young girls as there always are everywhere but there were not many young men and such as there were kept to the smokingroom there was no sign of flirtation among them he would have given much for a moment of the pivotal girl to see whether she could have brightened those gloomy surfaces with her impartial lamp march wished that he could have brought some report from the outer world to cheer his wife as he descended to their stateroom they had taken what they could get at the eleventh hour and they had got no such ideal room as they had in the norumbia it was as mrs march graphically said a basement room it was on the north side of the ship which is a cold exposure and if there had been any sun it could not have got into their window which was half the time under water the green waves laced with foam hissed as they ran across the port and the electric fan in the corridor moaned like the wind in a gable  he felt a sinking of the heart as he pushed the stateroom door open and looked at his wife lying with her face turned to the wall and he was going to withdraw thinking her asleep when she said quietly are we going down  not that i know of he answered with a gayety he did not feel but ill ask the head steward  she put out her hand behind her for him to take and clutched his fingers convulsively if im never any better you will always remember this happy summer wont you oh its been such a happy summer it has been one long joy one continued triumph but it was too late we were too old and its broken me  the time had been when he would have attempted comfort when he would have tried mocking but that time was long past he could only pray inwardly for some sort of diversion but what it was to be in their barren circumstance he was obliged to leave altogether to providence he ventured pending an answer to his prayers upon the question dont you think id better see the doctor and get you some sort of tonic  she suddenly turned and faced him the doctor why im not sick basil if you can see the purser and get our rooms changed or do something to stop those waves from slapping against that horrible blinking oneeyed window you can save my life but no tonic is going to help me  she turned her face from him again and buried it in the bedclothes while he looked desperately at the racing waves and the port that seemed to open and shut like a weary eye  oh go away she implored i shall be better presently but if you stand there like thatgo and see if you cant get some other room where i neednt feel as if i were drowning all the way over  he obeyed so far as to go away at once and having once started he did not stop short of the pursers office he made an excuse of getting greenbacks for some english banknotes and then he said casually that he supposed there would be no chance of having his room on the lower deck changed for something a little less intimate with the sea the purser was not there to take the humorous view but he conceived that march wanted something higher up and he was able to offer him a room of those on the promenade where he had seen swells going in and out for six hundred dollars march did not blench but said he would get his wife to look at it with him and then he went out somewhat dizzily to take counsel with himself how he should put the matter to her she would be sure to ask what the price of the new room would be and he debated whether to take it and tell her some kindly lie about it or trust to the bracing effect of the sum named in helping restore the lost balance of her nerves he was not so rich that he could throw six hundred dollars away but there might be worse things and he walked up and down thinking all at once it flashed upon him that he had better see the doctor anyway and find out whether there were not some last hope in medicine before he took the desperate step before him he turned in half his course and ran into a lady who had just emerged from the door of the promenade laden with wraps and who dropped them all and clutched him to save herself from falling  why mr march she shrieked  miss triscoe he returned in the astonishment which he shared with her to the extent of letting the shawls he had knocked from her hold lie between them till she began to pick them up herself then he joined her and in the relief of their common occupation they contrived to possess each other of the reason of their presence on the same boat she had sorrowed over mrs marchs sad state and he had grieved to hear that her father was going home because he was not at all well before they found the general stretched out in his steamerchair and waiting with a grim impatience for his daughter  but how is it youre not in the passengerlist he inquired of them both and miss triscoe explained that they had taken their passage at the last moment too late she supposed to get into the list they were in london and had run down to liverpool on the chance of getting berths beyond this she was not definite and there was an absence of burnamy not only from her company but from her conversation which mystified march through all his selfish preoccupations with his wife she was a girl who had her reserves but for a girl who had so lately and rapturously written them of her engagement there was a silence concerning her betrothed that had almost positive quality with his longing to try miss triscoe upon mrs marchs malady as a remedial agent he had now the desire to try mrs march upon miss triscoes mystery as a solvent she stood talking to him and refusing to sit down and be wrapped up in the chair next her father she said that if he were going to ask mrs march to let her come to her it would not be worth while to sit down and he hurried below  did you get it asked his wife without looking round but not so apathetically as before  oh yes thats all right but now isabel theres something ive got to tell you youd find it out and youd better know it at once  she turned her face and asked sternly what is it  then he said with an almost equal severity miss triscoe is on board miss triscoeandherfather she wishes to come down and see you  mrs march sat up and began to twist her hair into shape and burnamy  there is no burnamy physically or so far as i can make out spiritually she didnt mention him and i talked at least five minutes with her  hand me my dressingsack said mrs march and poke those things on the sofa under the berth shut up that washstand and pull the curtain across that hideous window stop throw those towels into your berth put my shoes and your slippers into the shoebag on the door slip the brushes into that other bag beat the dent out of the sofa cushion that your head has made now  thenthen you will see her  see her  her voice was so terrible that he fled before it and he returned with miss triscoe in a dreamlike simultaneity he remembered as he led the way into his corridor to apologize for bringing her down into a basement room  oh were in the basement too it was all we could get she said in words that ended within the stateroom he opened to her then he went back and took her chair and wraps beside her father  he let the general himself lead the way up to his health which he was not slow in reaching and was not quick in leaving he reminded march of the state he had seen him in at wurzburg and he said it had gone from bad to worse with him at weimar he had taken to his bed and merely escaped from it with his life then they had tried schevleningen for a week where he said in a tone of some injury they had rather thought they might find them the marches the air had been poison to him and they had come over to england with some notion of bournemouth but the doctor in london had thought not and urged their going home all europe is damp you know and dark as a pocket in winter he ended  there had been nothing about burnamy and march decided that he must wait to see his wife if he wished to know anything when the general who had been silent twisted his head towards him and said without regard to the context it was complicated at weimar by that young man in the most devilish way did my daughter write to mrs march aboutwell it came to nothing after all and i dont understand how to this day i doubt if they do it was some sort of quarrel i suppose i wasnt consulted in the matter either way it appears that parents are not consulted in these trifling affairs nowadays he had married his daughters mother in open defiance of her father but in the glare of his daughters wilfulness this fact had whitened into pious obedience i dare say i shall be told byandby and shall be expected to approve of the result  a fancy possessed march that by operation of temperamental laws general triscoe was no more satisfied with burnamys final rejection than with his acceptance if the engagement was ever to be renewed it might be another thing but as it stood march divined a certain favor for the young man in the generals attitude but the affair was altogether too delicate for comment the generals aristocratic frankness in dealing with it might have gone farther if his knowledge had been greater but in any case march did not see how he could touch it he could only say he had always liked burnamy himself  he had his good qualities the general owned he did not profess to understand the young men of our time but certainly the fellow had the instincts of a gentleman he had nothing to say against him unless in that business with that manwhat was his name  stoller march prompted i dont excuse him in that but i dont blame him so much either if punishment means atonement he had the opportunity of making that right very suddenly and if pardon means expunction then i dont see why that offence hasnt been pretty well wiped out  those things are not so simple as they used to seem said the general with a seriousness beyond his wont in things that did not immediately concern his own comfort or advantage     lxxvi  in the mean time mrs march and miss triscoe were discussing another offence of burnamys  it wasnt said the girl excitedly after a plunge through all the minor facts to the heart of the matter that he hadnt a perfect right to do it if he thought i didnt care for him i had refused him at carlsbad and i had forbidden him to speak to me abouton the subject but that was merely temporary and he ought to have known it he ought to have known that i couldnt accept him on the spur of the moment that way and when he had come back after going away in disgrace before he had done anything to justify himself i couldnt have kept my selfrespect and as it was i had the greatest difficulty and he ought to have seen it of course he said afterwards that he didnt see it but whenwhen i found out that she had been in weimar and all that time while i had been suffering in carlsbad and wurzburg and longing to see himlet him know how i was really feelinghe was flirting with thatthat girl then i saw that he was a false nature and i determined to put an end to everything and that is what i did and i shall always think idid rightand  the rest was lost in agathas handkerchief which she put up to her eyes mrs march watched her from her pillow keeping the girls unoccupied hand in her own and softly pressing it till the storm was past sufficiently to allow her to be heard  then she said men are very strangethe best of them and from the very fact that he was disappointed he would be all the more apt to rush into a flirtation with somebody else  miss triscoe took down her handkerchief from a face that had certainly not been beautified by grief i didnt blame him for the flirting or not so much it was his keeping it from me afterwards he ought to have told me the very first instant we were engaged but he didnt he let it go on and if i hadnt happened on that bouquet i might never have known anything about it that is what i mean bya false nature i wouldnt have minded his deceiving me but to let me deceive myselfoh it was too much  agatha hid her face in her handkerchief again she was perching on the edge of the berth and mrs march said with a glance which she did not see toward the sofa im afraid thats rather a hard seat for you  oh no thank you im perfectly comfortablei like itif you dont mind  mrs march pressed her hand for answer and after another little delay sighed and said they are not like us and we cannot help it they are more temporizing  how do you mean agatha unmasked again  they can bear to keep things better than we can and they trust to time to bring them right or to come right of themselves  i dont think mr march would trust things to come right of themselves said agatha in indignant accusal of mrs marchs sincerity  ah thats just what he would do my dear and has done all along and i dont believe we could have lived through without it we should have quarrelled ourselves into the grave  mrs march  yes indeed i dont mean that he would ever deceive me but he would let things go on and hope that somehow they would come right without any fuss  do you mean that he would let anybody deceive themselves  im afraid he wouldif he thought it would come right it used to be a terrible trial to me and it is yet at times when i dont remember that he means nothing but good and kindness by it only the other day in ansbachhow long ago it seemshe let a poor old woman give him her sons address in jersey city and allowed her to believe he would look him up when we got back and tell him we had seen her i dont believe unless i keep right round after him as we say in new england that hell ever go near the man  agatha looked daunted but she said that is a very different thing  it isnt a different kind of thing and it shows what men arethe sweetest and best of them that is they are terribly apt to beeasygoing  then you think i was all wrong the girl asked in a tremor  no indeed you were right because you really expected perfection of him you expected the ideal and thats what makes all the trouble in married life we expect too much of each otherwe each expect more of the other than we are willing to give or can give if i had to begin over again i should not expect anything at all and then i should be sure of being radiantly happy but all this talking and all this writing about love seems to turn our brains we know that men are not perfect even at our craziest because women are not but we expect perfection of them and they seem to expect it of us poor things if we could keep on after we are in love just as we were before we were in love and take nice things as favors and surprises as we did in the beginning but we get more and more greedy and exacting  do you think i was too exacting in wanting him to tell me everything after we were engaged  no i dont say that but suppose he had put it off till you were married agatha blushed a little but not painfully would it have been so bad then you might have thought that his flirting up to the last moment in his desperation was a very good joke you would have understood better just how it was and it might even have made you fonder of him you might have seen that he had flirted with some one else because he was so heartbroken about you  then you believe that if i could have waited tilltillbut when i had found out dont you see i couldnt wait it would have been all very well if i hadnt known it till then but as i did know it dont you see  yes that certainly complicated it mrs march admitted but i dont think if hed been a false nature hed have owned up as he did you see he didnt try to deny it and thats a great point gained  yes that is true said agatha with conviction i saw that afterwards but you dont think mrs march that i was unjust oror hasty  no indeed you couldnt have done differently under the circumstances you may be sure he felt thathe is so unselfish and generous agatha began to weep into her handkerchief again mrs march caressed her hand and it will certainly come right if you feel as you do  no the girl protested he can never forgive me its all over everything is over it would make very little difference to me what happened nowif the steamer broke her shaft or anything but if i can only believe i wasnt unjust  mrs march assured her once more that she had behaved with absolute impartiality and she proved to her by a process of reasoning quite irrefragable that it was only a question of time with which place had nothing to do when she and burnamy should come together again and all should be made right between them the fact that she did not know where he was any more than mrs march herself had nothing to do with the result that was a mere detail which would settle itself she clinched her argument by confessing that her own engagement had been broken off and that it had simply renewed itself all you had to do was to keep willing it and waiting there was something very mysterious in it  and how long was it till agatha faltered  well in our ease it was two years  oh said the girl but mrs march hastened to reassure her  but our case was very peculiar i could see afterwards that it neednt have been two months if i had been willing to acknowledge at once that i was in the wrong i waited till we met  if i felt that i was in the wrong i should write said agatha i shouldnt care what he thought of my doing it  yes the great thing is to make sure that you were wrong  they remained talking so long that march and the general had exhausted all the topics of common interest and had even gone through those they did not care for at last the general said im afraid my daughter will tire mrs march  oh i dont think shell tire my wife but do you want her  well when youre going down  i think ill take a turn about the deck and start my circulation said march and he did so before he went below  he found his wife up and dressed and waiting provisionally on the sofa i thought i might as well go to lunch she said and then she told him about agatha and burnamy and the means she had employed to comfort and encourage the girl and now dearest i want you to find out where burnamy is and give him a hint you will wont you if you could have seen how unhappy she was  i dont think i should have cared and im certainly not going to meddle i think burnamy has got no more than he deserved and that hes well rid of her i cant imagine a broken engagement that would more completely meet my approval as the case stands they have my blessing  dont say that dearest you know you dont mean it  i do and i advise you to keep your hands off youve done all and more than you ought to propitiate miss triscoe youve offered yourself up and youve offered me up  no no basil i merely used you as an illustration of what men werethe best of them  and i cant observe he continued that any one else has been considered in the matter is miss triscoe the sole sufferer by burnamys flirtation what is the matter with a little compassion for the pivotal girl  now you know youre not serious said his wife and though he would not admit this he could not be seriously sorry for the new interest which she took in the affair there was no longer any question of changing their stateroom under the tonic influence of the excitement she did not go back to her berth after lunch and she was up later after dinner than he could have advised she was absorbed in agatha but in her liberation from her hypochondria she began also to make a comparative study of the american swells in the light of her late experience with the german highhotes it is true that none of the swells gave her the opportunity of examining them at close range as the highhotes had done they kept to their staterooms mostly where after he thought she could bear it march told her how near he had come to making her their equal by an outlay of six hundred dollars she now shuddered at the thought but she contended that in their magnificent exclusiveness they could give points to european princes and that this showed again how when americans did try to do a thing they beat the world agatha triscoe knew who they were but she did not know them they belonged to another kind of set she spoke of them as rich people and she seemed content to keep away from them with mrs march and with the shy silent old wife of major eltwin to whom march sometimes found her talking  he never found her father talking with major eltwin general triscoe had his own friends in the smokingroom where he held forth in a certain corner on the chances of the approaching election in new york and mocked their incredulity when he prophesied the success of tammany and the return of the king march himself much preferred major eltwin to the general and his friends he lived back in the talk of the ohioan into his own younger years in indiana and he was amused and touched to find how much the midwestern life seemed still the same as he had known the conditions had changed but not so much as they had changed in the east and the farther west the picture that the major drew of them in his own region was alluring it made march homesick though he knew that he should never go back to his native section there was the comfort of kind in the major and he had a vein of philosophy spare but sweet which march liked he liked also the meekness which had come through sorrow upon a spirit which had once been proud  they had both the elderly mans habit of early rising and they usually found themselves together waiting impatiently for the cup of coffee ingenuously bad which they served on the cupania not earlier than half past six in strict observance of a rule of the line discouraging to people of their habits march admired the vileness of the decoction which he said could not be got anywhere out of the british empire and he asked eltwin the first morning if he had noticed how instantly on the channel boat they had dropped to it and to the sour heavy sodden british bread from the spirited and airy continental tradition of coffee and rolls  the major confessed that he was no great hand to notice such things and he said he supposed that if the line had never lost a passenger and got you to new york in six days it had a right to feed you as it pleased he surmised that if they could get their airing outside before they took their coffee it would give the coffee a chance to taste better and this was what they afterwards did they met well buttoned and well mined up on the promenade when it was yet so early that they were not at once sure of each other in the twilight and watched the morning planets pale east and west before the sun rose sometimes there were no paling planets and no rising sun and a black sea ridged with white tossed under a low dark sky with dim rifts  one morning they saw the sun rise with a serenity and majesty which it rarely has outside of the theatre the dawn began over that sea which was like the rumpled canvas imitations of the sea on the stage under long mauve clouds bathed in solemn light above these in the pale tender sky two silver stars hung and the steamers smoke drifted across them like a thin dusky veil to the right a bank of dun cloud began to burn crimson and to burn brighter till it was like a low hillside full of gorgeous rugosities fleeced with a dense dwarfish growth of autumnal shrubs the whole eastern heaven softened and flushed through diaphanous mists the west remained a livid mystery the eastern masses and flakes of cloud began to kindle keenly but the stars shone clearly and then one star till the tawny pink hid it all the zenith reddened but still the sun did not show except in the color of the brilliant clouds at last the lurid horizon began to burn like a flameshot smoke and a fiercely bright disc edge pierced its level and swiftly defined itself as the suns orb  many thoughts went through marchs mind some of them were sad but in some there was a touch of hopefulness it might have been that beauty which consoled him for his years somehow he felt himself if no longer young a part of the young immortal frame of things his state was indefinable but he longed to hint at it to his companion  yes said eltwin with a long deep sigh i feel as if i could walk out through that brightness and find her i reckon that such hopes wouldnt be allowed to lie to us that so many ages of men couldnt have fooled themselves so im glad ive seen this he was silent and they both remained watching the rising sun till they could not bear its splendor now said the major it must be time for that mud as you call it over their coffee and crackers at the end of the table which they had to themselves he resumed i was thinking all the timewe seem to think half a dozen things at once and this was one of themabout a piece of business ive got to settle when i reach home and perhaps you can advise me about it youre an editor ive got a newspaper on my hands i reckon it would be a pretty good thing if it had a chance but i dont know what to do with it i got it in trade with a fellow who has to go west for his lungs but hes staying till i get back whats become of that young chapwhats his namethat went out with us  burnamy prompted march rather breathlessly  yes couldnt he take hold of it i rather liked him hes smart isnt he  very said march but i dont know where he is i dont know that he would go into the country but he might if  they entered provisionally into the case and for arguments sake supposed that burnamy would take hold of the majors paper if he could be got at it really looked to march like a good chance for him on eltwins showing but he was not confident of burnamys turning up very soon and he gave the major a pretty clear notion why by entering into the young fellows history for the last three months  isnt it the very irony of fate he said to his wife when he found her in their room with a cup of the same mud he had been drinking and reported the facts to her  irony she said with all the excitement he could have imagined or desired nothing of the kind its a leading if ever there was one it will be the easiest thing in the world to find burnamy and out there she can sit on her steps  he slowly groped his way to her meaning through the hypothesis of burnamys reconciliation and marriage with agatha triscoe and their settlement in major eltwins town under social conditions that implied a habit of spending the summer evenings on their front porch while he was doing this she showered him with questions and conjectures and requisitions in which nothing but the impossibility of going ashore saved him from the instant devotion of all his energies to a worldwide inquiry into burnamys whereabouts  the next morning he was up before major eltwin got out and found the secondcabin passengers free of the firstcabin promenade at an hour when their superiors were not using it as he watched these inferiors decentlooking wellclad men and women enjoying their privilege with a furtive air and with stolen glances at him he asked himself in what sort he was their superior till the inquiry grew painful then he rose from his chair and made his way to the place where the material barrier between them was lifted and interested himself in a few of them who seemed too proud to avail themselves of his society on the terms made a figure seized his attention with a sudden fascination of conjecture and rejection the figure of a tall young man who came out on the promenade and without looking round walked swiftly away to the bow of the ship and stood there looking down at the water in an attitude which was bewilderingly familiar his movement his posture his dress even was that of burnamy and march after a first flush of pleasure felt a sickening repulsion in the notion of his presence it would have been such a cheap performance on the part of life which has all sorts of chances at command and need not descend to the poor tricks of secondrate fiction and he accused burnamy of a complicity in the bad taste of the affair though he realized when he reflected that if it were really burnamy he must have sailed in as much unconsciousness of the triscoes as he himself had done he had probably got out of money and had hurried home while he had still enough to pay the secondcabin fare on the first boat back clearly he was not to blame but life was to blame for such a shabby device and march felt this so keenly that he wished to turn from the situation and have nothing to do with it he kept moving toward him drawn by the fatal attraction and at a few paces distance the young man whirled about and showed him the face of a stranger  march made some witless remark on the rapid course of the ship as it cut its way through the water of the bow the stranger answered with a strong lancashire accent and in the talk which followed he said he was going out to see the cottonmills at fall river and new bedford and he seemed hopeful of some advice or information from march then he said he must go and try to get his missus out march understood him to mean his wife and he hurried down to his own to whom he related his hairbreadth escape from burnamy  i dont call it an escape at all she declared i call it the greatest possible misfortune if it had been burnamy we could have brought them together at once just when she has seen so clearly that she was in the wrong and is feeling all broken up there wouldnt have been any difficulty about his being in the secondcabin we could have contrived to have them meet somehow if the worst came to the worst you could have lent him money to pay the difference and got him into the firstcabin  i could have taken that sixhundreddollar room for him said march and then he could have eaten with the swells  she answered that now he was teasing that he was fundamentally incapable of taking anything seriously and in the end he retired before the stewardess bringing her first coffee with a wellmerited feeling that if it had not been for his triviality the young lancashireman would really have been burnamy     lxxv  except for the first day and night out from queenstown when the ship rolled and pitched with straining and squeaking noises and a thumping of the lifted screws there was no rough weather and at last the ocean was livid and oily with a long swell on which she swayed with no perceptible motion save from her machinery  most of the seamanship seemed to be done after dark or in those early hours when march found the stewards cleaning the stairs and the sailors scouring the promenades he made little acquaintance with his fellowpassengers one morning he almost spoke with an old quaker lady whom he joined in looking at the niagara flood which poured from the churning screws but he did not quite get the words out on the contrary he talked freely with an american who bred horses on a farm near boulogne and was going home to the horse show he had been thirtyfive years out of the country but he had preserved his yankee accent in all its purity and was the most typicallooking american on board now and then march walked up and down with a blond mexican whom he found of the usual wellordered latin intelligence but rather flavorless at times he sat beside a nice jew who talked agreeably but only about business and he philosophized the race as so tiresome often because it seemed so often without philosophy he made desperate attempts at times to interest himself in the poolselling in the smokingroom where the betting on the ships wonderful run was continual  he thought that people talked less and less as they drew nearer home but on the last day out there was a sudden expansion and some whom he had not spoken with voluntarily addressed him the sweet soft air was like midsummer the water rippled gently without a swell blue under the clear sky and the ship left a wide track that was silver in the sun there were more sail the first and second class baggage was got up and piled along the steerage deck  some people dressed a little more than usual for the last dinner which was earlier than usual so as to be out of the way against the arrival which had been variously predicted at from five to seventhirty an indescribable nervousness culminated with the appearance of the customs officers on board who spread their papers on cleared spaces of the diningtables and summoned the passengers to declare that they had nothing to declare as a preliminary to being searched like thieves at the dock  this ceremony proceeded while the cupania made her way up the narrows and into the north river where the flare of lights from the crazy steeps and cliffs of architecture on the new york shore seemed a persistence of the last fourth of july pyrotechnics march blushed for the grotesque splendor of the spectacle and was confounded to find some englishmen admiring it till he remembered that aesthetics were not the strong point of our race his wife sat hand in hand with miss triscoe and from time to time made him count the pieces of small baggage in the keeping of their steward while general triscoe held aloof in a sarcastic calm  the steamer groped into her dock the gangways were lifted to her side the passengers fumbled and stumbled down their incline and at the bottom the marches found themselves respectively in the arms of their son and daughter they all began talking at once and ignoring and trying to remember the triscoes to whom the young marches were presented bella did her best to be polite to agatha and tom offered to get an inspector for the general at the same time as for his father then march remorsefully remembered the eltwins and looked about for them so that his son might get them an inspector too he found the major already in the hands of an inspector who was passing all his pieces after carelessly looking into one the official who received the declarations on board had noted a grand army button like his own in the majors lapel and had marked his fellowveterans paper with the mystic sign which procures for the bearer the honor of being promptly treated as a smuggler while the less favored have to wait longer for this indignity at the hands of their government when marchs own inspector came he was as civil and lenient as our hateful law allows when he had finished march tried to put a banknote in his hand and was brought to a just shame by his refusal of it the bedroom steward keeping guard over the baggage helped putit together after the search and protested that march had feed him so handsomely that he would stay there with it as long as they wished this partly restored marchs selfrespect and he could share in general triscoes indignation with the treasury ruling which obliged him to pay duty on his own purchases in excess of the hundreddollar limit though his daughter had brought nothing and they jointly came far within the limit for two  he found that the triscoes were going to a quiet old hotel on the way to stuyvesant square quite in his own neighborhood and he quickly arranged for all the ladies and the general to drive together while he was to follow with his son on foot and by car they got away from the scene of the customs havoc while the steamer shed with its vast darkness dimly lit by its many lamps still showed like a battlefield where the inspectors groped among the scattered baggage like details from the victorious army searching for the wounded his son clapped him on the shoulder when he suggested this notion and said he was the same old father and they got home as gayly together as the dispiriting influences of the new york ugliness would permit it was still in those good and decent times now so remote when the city got something for the money paid out to keep its streets clean and those they passed through were not foul but merely mean  the ignoble effect culminated when they came into broadway and found its sidewalks at an hour when those of any european metropolis would have been brilliant with life as unpeopled as those of a minor country town while long processions of cablecars carted heaps of men and women up and down the thoroughfare amidst the deformities of the architecture  the next morning the march family breakfasted late after an evening prolonged beyond midnight in spite of halfhourly agreements that now they must really all go to bed the children had both to recognize again and again how well their parents were looking tom had to tell his father about the condition of every other week bella had to explain to her mother how sorry her husband was that he could not come on to meet them with her but was coming a week later to take her home and then she would know the reason why they could not all go back to chicago with him it was just the place for her father to live for everybody to live at breakfast she renewed the reasoning with which she had maintained her position the night before the travellers entered into a full expression of their joy at being home again march asked what had become of that stray parrot which they had left in the treetop the morning they started and mrs march declared that this was the last silver wedding journey she ever wished to take and tried to convince them all that she had been on the verge of nervous collapse when she reached the ship they sat at table till she discovered that it was very nearly eleven oclock and said it was disgraceful  before they rose there was a ring at the door and a card was brought in to tom he glanced at it and said to his father oh yes this man has been haunting the office for the last three days hes got to leave today and as it seemed to be rather a case of life and death with him i said hed probably find you here this morning but if you dont want to see him i can put him off till afternoon i suppose  he tossed the card to his father who looked at it quietly and then gave it to his wife perhaps id as well see him  see him she returned in accents in which all the intensity of her soul was centred by an effort of selfcontrol which no words can convey a just sense of she remained with her children while her husband with a laugh more teasing than can be imagined went into the drawingroom to meet burnamy  the poor fellow was in an effect of belated summer as to clothes and he looked not merely haggard but shabby he made an effort for dignity as well as gayety however in stating himself to march with many apologies for his persistency but he said he was on his way west and he was anxious to know whether there was any chance of his kasper hauler paper being taken if he finished it up march would have been a far harderhearted editor than he was if he could have discouraged the suppliant before him he said he would take the kasper hauler paper and add a band of music to the usual rate of ten dollars a thousand words then burnamys dignity gave way if not his gayety he began to laugh and suddenly he broke down and confessed that he had come home in the steerage and was at his last cent beyond his fare to chicago his straw hat looked like a withered leaf in the light of his sad facts his thin overcoat affected marchs imagination as something like the diaphanous cast shell of a locust hopelessly resumed for comfort at the approach of autumn he made burnamy sit down after he had once risen and he told him of major eltwins wish to see him and he promised to go round with him to the majors hotel before the eltwins left town that afternoon  while he prolonged the interview in this way mrs march was kept from breaking in upon them only by the psychical experiment which she was making with the help and sympathy of her daughter at the window of the diningroom which looked up sixteenth street at the first hint she gave of the emotional situation which burnamy was a main part of her son with the brutal contempt of young men for other young mens love affairs said he must go to the office he bade his mother tell his father there was no need of his coming down that day and he left the two women together this gave the mother a chance to develop the whole fact to the daughter with telegrammic rapidity and brevity and then to enrich the firstoutline with innumerable details while they both remained at the window and mrs march said at twominutely intervals with no sense of iteration for either of them i told her to come in the morning if she felt like it and i know she will but if she doesnt i shall say there is nothing in fate or providence either at any rate im going to stay here and keep longing for her and well see whether theres anything in that silly theory of your fathers i dont believe there is she said to be on the safe side  even when she saw agatha triscoe enter the park gate on rutherford place she saved herself from disappointment by declaring that she was not coming across to their house as the girl persisted in coming and coming and at last came so near that she caught sight of mrs march at the window and nodded the mother turned ungratefully upon her daughter and drove her away to her own room so that no society detail should hinder the divine chance she went to the door herself when agatha rang and then she was going to open the way into the parlor where march was still closeted with burnamy and pretend that she had not known they were there but a soberer second thought than this prevailed and she told the girl who it was that was within and explained the accident of his presence i think she said nobly that you ought to have the chance of going away if you dont wish to meet him  the girl with that heroic precipitation which mrs march had noted in her from the first with regard to what she wanted to do when burnamy was in question answered but i do wish to meet him mrs march  while they stood looking at each other march came out to ask his wife if she would see burnamy and she permitted herself so much stratagem as to substitute agatha after catching her husband aside and subduing his proposed greeting of the girl to a hasty handshake  half an hour later she thought it time to join the young people urged largely by the frantic interest of her daughter but she returned from the halfopen door without entering i couldnt bring myself to break in on the poor things they are standing at the window together looking over at st georges  bella silently clasped her hands march gave cynical laugh and said well we are in for it my dear then he added i hope theyll take us with them on their silver wedding
