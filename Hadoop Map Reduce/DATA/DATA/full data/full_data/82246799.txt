82246799	the shewingup of blanco posnet  bernard shaw  1909    preface  the censorship  this little play is really a religious tract in dramatic form if our silly censorship would permit its performance it might possibly help to set rightsideup the perverted conscience and reinvigorate the starved selfrespect of our considerable class of looselived playgoers whose point of honor is to deride all official and conventional sermons as it is it only gives me an opportunity of telling the story of the select committee of both houses of parliament which sat last year to enquire into the working of the censorship against which it was alleged by myself and others that as its imbecility and mischievousness could not be fully illustrated within the limits of decorum imposed on the press it could only be dealt with by a parliamentary body subject to no such limits   a readable bluebook  few books of the year 1909 can have been cheaper and more entertaining than the report of this committee its full title is report from the joint select committee of the house of lords and the house of commons on the stage plays censorship together with the proceedings of the committee minutes of evidence and appendices what the phrase the stage plays means in this title i do not know nor does anyone else the number of the bluebook is 214  how interesting it is may be judged from the fact that it contains verbatim reports of long and animated interviews between the committee and such witnesses as w william archer mr granville barker mr j m barrie mr forbes robertson mr cecil raleigh mr john galsworthy mr laurence housman sir herbert beerbohm tree mr w l courtney sir william gilbert mr a b walkley miss lena ashwell professor gilbert murray mr george alexander mr george edwardes mr comyns carr the speaker of the house of commons the bishop of southwark mr hall caine mr israel zangwill sir squire bancroft sir arthur pinero and mr gilbert chesterton not to mention myself and a number of gentlemen less well known to the general public but important in the world of the theatre the publication of a book by so many famous contributors would be beyond the means of any commercial publishing firm his majestys stationery office sells it to all comers by weight at the very reasonable price of three andthreepence a copy   how not to do it  it was pointed out by charles dickens in little dorrit which remains the most accurate and penetrating study of the genteel littleness of our class governments in the english language that whenever an abuse becomes oppressive enough to persuade our party parliamentarians that something must be done they immediately set to work to face the situation and discover how not to do it since dickenss day the exposures effected by the socialists have so shattered the selfsatisfaction of modern commercial civilization that it is no longer difficult to convince our governments that something must be done even to the extent of attempts at a reconstruction of civilization on a thoroughly uncommercial basis consequently the first part of the process described by dickens that in which the reformers were snubbed by front bench demonstrations that the administrative departments were consuming miles of red tape in the correctest forms of activity and that everything was for the best in the best of all possible worlds is out of fashion and we are in that other phase familiarized by the history of the french revolution in which the primary assumption is that the country is in danger and that the first duty of all parties politicians and governments is to save it but as the effect of this is to give governments a great many more things to do it also gives a powerful stimulus to the art of how not to do them that is to say the art of contriving methods of reform which will leave matters exactly as they are  the report of the joint select committee is a capital illustration of this tendency the case against the censorship was overwhelming and the defence was more damaging to it than no defence at all could have been even had this not been so the mere caprice of opinion had turned against the institution and a reform was expected evidence or no evidence therefore the committee was unanimous as to the necessity of reforming the censorship only unfortunately the majority attached to this unanimity the usual condition that nothing should be done to disturb the existing state of things how this was effected may be gathered from the recommendations finally agreed on which are as follows  1 the drama is to be set entirely free by the abolition of the existing obligation to procure a licence from the censor before performing a play but every theatre lease is in future to be construed as if it contained a clause giving the landlord power to break it and evict the lessee if he produces a play without first obtaining the usual licence from the lord chamberlain  2 some of the plays licensed by the lord chamberlain are so vicious that their present practical immunity from prosecution must be put an end to but no manager who procures the lord chamberlains licence for a play can be punished in any way for producing it though a special tribunal may order him to discontinue the performance and even this order must not be recorded to his disadvantage on the licence of his theatre nor may it be given as a judicial reason for cancelling that licence  3 authors and managers producing plays without first obtaining the usual licence from the lord chamberlain shall be perfectly free to do so and shall be at no disadvantage compared to those who follow the existing practice except that they may be punished have the licences of their theatres endorsed and cancelled and have the performance stopped pending the proceedings without compensation in the event of the proceedings ending in their acquittal  4 authors are to be rescued from their present subjection to an irresponsible secret tribunal which can condemn their plays without giving reasons by the substitution for that tribunal of a committee of the privy council which is to be the final authority on the fitness of a play for representation and this committee is to sit in camera if and when it pleases  5 the power to impose a veto on the production of plays is to be abolished because it may hinder the growth of a great national drama but the office of examiner of plays shall be continued and the lord chamberlain shall retain his present powers to license plays but shall be made responsible to parliament to the extent of making it possible to ask questions there concerning his proceedings especially now that members have discovered a method of doing this indirectly  and so on and so forth the thing is to be done and it is not to be done everything is to be changed and nothing is to be changed the problem is to be faced and the solution to be shirked and the word of dickens is to be justified   the story of the joint select committee  let me now tell the story of the committee in greater detail partly as a contribution to history partly because like most true stories it is more amusing than the official story  all commissions of public enquiry are more or less intimidated both by the interests on which they have to sit in judgment and when their members are party politicians by the votes at the back of those interests but this unfortunate committee sat under a quite exceptional cross fire first there was the king the censor is a member of his household retinue and as a kings retinue has to be jealously guarded to avoid curtailment of the royal state no matter what may be the function of the particular retainer threatened nothing but an express royal intimation to the contrary which is a constitutional impossibility could have relieved the committee from the fear of displeasing the king by any proposal to abolish the censorship of the lord chamberlain now all the lords on the committee and some of the commoners could have been wiped out of society in their sense of the word by the slightest intimation that the king would prefer not to meet them and this was a heavy risk to run on the chance of a great and serious national drama ensuing on the removal of the lord chamberlains veto on mrs warrens profession second there was the nonconformist conscience holding the liberal government responsible for the committee it had appointed and holding also to the extent of votes enough to turn the scale in some constituencies that the theatre is the gate of hell to be tolerated as vice is tolerated only because the power to suppress it could not be given to any public body without too serious an interference with certain liberal traditions of liberty which are still useful to nonconformists in other directions third there was the commercial interest of the theatrical managers and their syndicates of backers in the city to whom as i shall shew later on the censorship affords a cheap insurance of enormous value fourth there was the powerful interest of the trade in intoxicating liquors fiercely determined to resist any extension of the authority of teetotallerled local governing bodies over theatres fifth there were the playwrights without political power but with a very close natural monopoly of a talent not only for playwriting but for satirical polemics and since every interest has its opposition all these influences had created hostile bodies by the operation of the mere impulse to contradict them always strong in english human nature   why the managers love the censorship  the only one of these influences which seems to be generally misunderstood is that of the managers it has been assumed repeatedly that managers and authors are affected in the same way by the censorship when a prominent author protests against the censorship his opinion is supposed to be balanced by that of some prominent manager who declares that the censorship is the mainstay of the theatre and his relations with the lord chamberlain and the examiner of plays a cherished privilege and an inexhaustible joy this error was not removed by the evidence given before the joint select committee the managers did not make their case clear there partly because they did not understand it and partly because their most eminent witnesses were not personally affected by it and would not condescend to plead it feeling themselves on the contrary compelled by their selfrespect to admit and even emphasize the fact that the lord chamberlain in the exercise of his duties as licenser had done those things which he ought not to have done and left undone those things which he ought to have done mr forbes robertson and sir herbert tree for instance had never felt the real disadvantage of which managers have to complain this disadvantage was not put directly to the committee and though the managers are against me on the question of the censorship i will now put their case for them as they should have put it themselves and as it can be read between the lines of their evidence when once the reader has the clue  the manager of a theatre is a man of business he is not an expert in politics religion art literature philosophy or law he calls in a playwright just as he calls in a doctor or consults a lawyer or engages an architect depending on the playwrights reputation and past achievements for a satisfactory result a play by an unknown man may attract him sufficiently to induce him to give that unknown man a trial but this does not occur often enough to be taken into account his normal course is to resort to a wellknown author and take mostly with misgiving what he gets from him now this does not cause any anxiety to mr forbes robertson and sir herbert tree because they are only incidentally managers and men of business primarily they are highly cultivated artists quite capable of judging for themselves anything that the most abstruse playwright is likely to put before them  but the plain sailing tradesman who must be taken as the typical manager for the west end of london is not the whole theatrical world is by no means equally qualified to judge whether a play is safe from prosecution or not he may not understand it may not like it may not know what the author is driving at may have no knowledge of the ethical political and sectarian controversies which may form the intellectual fabric of the play and may honestly see nothing but an ordinary character part in a stage figure which may be a libellous and unmistakeable caricature of some eminent living person of whom he has never heard yet if he produces the play he is legally responsible just as if he had written it himself without protection he may find himself in the dock answering a charge of blasphemous libel seditious libel obscene libel or all three together not to mention the possibility of a private action for defamatory libel his sole refuge is the opinion of the examiner of plays his sole protection the licence of the lord chamberlain a refusal to license does not hurt him because he can produce another play it is the author who suffers the granting of the licence practically places him above the law for though it may be legally possible to prosecute a licensed play nobody ever dreams of doing it the really responsible person the lord chamberlain could not be put into the dock and the manager could not decently be convicted when he could procure in his defence a certificate from the chief officer of the kings household that the play was a proper one   a two guinea insurance policy  the censorship then provides the manager at the negligible premium of two guineas per play with an effective insurance against the author getting him into trouble and a complete relief from all conscientious responsibility for the character of the entertainment at his theatre under such circumstances managers would be more than human if they did not regard the censorship as their most valuable privilege this is the simple explanation of the rally of the managers and their associations to the defence of the censorship of their reiterated resolutions of confidence in the lord chamberlain of their presentations of plate and generally of their enthusiastic contentment with the present system all in such startling contrast to the denunciations of the censorship by the authors it also explains why the managerial witnesses who had least to fear from the censor were the most reluctant in his defence whilst those whose practice it is to strain his indulgence to the utmost were almost rapturous in his praise there would be absolute unanimity among the managers in favor of the censorship if they were all simply tradesmen even those actormanagers who made no secret before the committee of their contempt for the present operation of the censorship and their indignation at being handed over to a domestic official as casual servants of a specially disorderly kind demanded not the abolition of the institution but such a reform as might make it consistent with their dignity and unobstructive to their higher artistic aims feeling no personal need for protection against the author they perhaps forgot the plight of many a manager to whom the modern advanced drama is so much greek but they did feel very strongly the need of being protected against vigilance societies and municipalities and common informers in a country where a large section of the community still believes that art of all kinds is inherently sinful   why the government interfered  it may now be asked how a liberal government had been persuaded to meddle at all with a question in which so many conflicting interests were involved and which had probably no electoral value whatever many simple simple souls believed that it was because certain severely virtuous plays by ibsen by m brieux by mr granville barker and by me were suppressed by the censorship whilst plays of a scandalous character were licensed without demur no doubt this influenced public opinion but those who imagine that it could influence british governments little know how remote from public opinion and how full of their own little family and party affairs british governments both liberal and unionist still are the censorship scandal had existed for years without any parliamentary action being taken in the matter and might have existed for as many more had it not happened in 1906 that mr robert vernon harcourt entered parliament as a member of the liberal party of which his father had been one of the leaders during the gladstone era mr harcourt was thus a young man marked out for office both by his parentage and his unquestionable social position as one of the governing class also and this was much less usual he was brilliantly clever and was the author of a couple of plays of remarkable promise mr harcourt informed his leaders that he was going to take up the subject of the censorship the leaders recognizing his hereditary right to a parliamentary canter of some sort as a prelude to his public career and finding that all the clever people seemed to be agreed that the censorship was an anti liberal institution and an abominable nuisance to boot indulged him by appointing a select committee of both houses to investigate the subject the then chancellor of the duchy of lancaster mr herbert samuel now postmastergeneral who had made his way into the cabinet twenty years ahead of the usual age was made chairman mr robert harcourt himself was of course a member with him representing the commons were mr alfred mason a man of letters who had won a seat in parliament as offhandedly as he has since discarded it or as he once appeared on the stage to help me out of a difficulty in casting arms and the man when that piece was the newest thing in the advanced drama there was mr hugh law an irish member son of an irish chancellor presenting a keen and joyous front to english intellectual sloth above all there was colonel lockwood to represent at one stroke the opposition and the average popular man this he did by standing up gallantly for the censor to whose support the opposition was in no way committed and by visibly defying the most cherished conventions of the average man with a bunch of carnations in his buttonhole as large as a dinnerplate which would have made a bunthorne blench and which very nearly did make mr granville barker who has an antipathy to the scent of carnations faint   the peers on the joint select committee  the house of lords then proceeded to its selection as fashionable drama in paris and london concerns itself almost exclusively with adultery the first choice fell on lord gorell who had for many years presided over the divorce court lord plymouth who had been chairman to the shakespear memorial project now merged in the shakespear memorial national theatre was obviously marked out for selection and it was generally expected that the lords lytton and esher who had taken a prominent part in the same movement would have been added this expectation was not fulfilled instead lord willoughby de broke who had distinguished himself as an amateur actor was selected along with lord newton whose special qualifications for the committee if he had any were unknown to the public finally lord ribblesdale the argute son of a scotch mother was thrown in to make up for any shortcoming in intellectual subtlety that might arise in the case of his younger colleagues and this completed the two teams   the committees attitude toward the theatre  in england thanks chiefly to the censorship the theatre is not respected it is indulged and despised as a department of what is politely called gaiety it is therefore not surprising that the majority of the committee began by taking its work uppishly and carelessly when it discovered that the contemporary drama licensed by the lord chamberlain included plays which could be described only behind closed doors and in the discomfort which attends discussions of very nasty subjects between men of widely different ages it calmly put its own convenience before its public duty by ruling that there should be no discussion of particular plays much as if a committee on temperance were to rule that drunkenness was not a proper subject of conversation among gentlemen   a bad beginning  this was a bad beginning everybody knew that in england the censorship would not be crushed by the weight of the constitutional argument against it heavy as that was unless it were also brought home to the committee and to the public that it had sanctioned and protected the very worst practicable examples of the kind of play it professed to extirpate for it must be remembered that the other half of the practical side of the case dealing with the merits of the plays it had suppressed could never secure a unanimous assent if the censor had suppressed hamlet as he most certainly would have done had it been submitted to him as a new play he would have been supported by a large body of people to whom incest is a tabooed subject which must not be mentioned on the stage or anywhere else outside a criminal court hamlet oedipus and the cenci mrs warrens profession brieuxs maternite and les avaries maeterlincks monna vanna and mr granville barkers waste may or may not be great poems or edifying sermons or important documents or charming romances our tribal citizens know nothing about that and do not want to know anything all that they do know is that incest prostitution abortion contagious diseases and nudity are improper and that all conversations or books or plays in which they are discussed are improper conversations improper books improper plays and should not be allowed the censor may prohibit all such plays with complete certainty that there will be a chorus of quite right too sufficient to drown the protests of the few who know better the achilles heel of the censorship is therefore not the fine plays it has suppressed but the abominable plays it has licensed plays which the committee itself had to turn the public out of the room and close the doors before it could discuss and which i myself have found it impossible to expose in the press because no editor of a paper or magazine intended for general family reading could admit into his columns the baldest narration of the stories which the censor has not only tolerated but expressly certified as fitting for presentation on the stage when the committee ruled out this part of the case it shook the confidence of the authors in its impartiality and its seriousness of course it was not able to enforce its ruling thoroughly plays which were merely lightminded and irresponsible in their viciousness were repeatedly mentioned by mr harcourt and others but the really detestable plays which would have damned the censorship beyond all apology or salvation were never referred to and the moment mr harcourt or anyone else made the committee uncomfortable by a move in their direction the ruling was appealed to at once and the censorship saved   a comic interlude  it was part of this nervous dislike of the unpleasant part of its business that led to the comic incident of the committees sudden discovery that i had insulted it and its suspension of its investigation for the purpose of elaborately insulting me back again comic to the lookerson that is for the majority of the committee made no attempt to conceal the fact that they were wildly angry with me and i though my public experience and skill in acting enabled me to maintain an appearance of imperturbable goodhumor was equally furious the friction began as follows  the precedents for the conduct of the committee were to be found in the proceedings of the committee of 1892 that committee no doubt recognizing the absurdity of calling on distinguished artists to give their views before it and then refusing to allow them to state their views except in nervous replies to such questions as it might suit members to put to them allowed sir henry irving and sir john hare to prepare and read written statements and formally invited them to read them to the committee before being questioned i accordingly prepared such a statement for the greater convenience of the committee i offered to have this statement printed at my own expense and to supply the members with copies the offer was accepted and the copies supplied i also offered to provide the committee with copies of those plays of mine which had been refused a licence by the lord chamberlain that offer also was accepted and the books duly supplied   an antishavian panic  as far as i can guess the next thing that happened was that some timid or unawakened member of the committee read my statement and was frightened or scandalized out of his wits by it at all events it is certain that the majority of the committee allowed themselves to be persuaded to refuse to allow any statement to be read but to avoid the appearance of pointing this expressly at me the form adopted was a resolution to adhere strictly to precedent the committee being then unaware that the precedents were on my side accordingly when i appeared before the committee and proposed to read my statement according to precedent the committee was visibly taken aback the chairman was bound by the letter of the decision arrived at to allow me to read my statement since that course was according to precedent but as this was exactly what the decision was meant to prevent the majority of the committee would have regarded this hoisting of them with their own petard as a breach of faith on the part of the chairman who i infer was not in agreement with the suppressive majority there was nothing for it after a somewhat awkward pause but to clear me and the public out of the room and reconsider the situation in camera when the doors were opened again i was informed simply that the committee would not hear my statement but as the committee could not very decently refuse my evidence altogether the chairman with a printed copy of my statement in his hand as proof was able to come to the rescue to some extent by putting to me a series of questions to which no doubt i might have replied by taking another copy out of my pocket and quoting my statement paragraph by paragraph as some of the later witnesses did but as in offering the committee my statement for burial in their bluebook i had made a considerable sacrifice being able to secure greater publicity for it by independent publication on my own account and as further the circumstances of the refusal made it offensive enough to take all heart out of the scrupulous consideration with which i had so far treated the committee i was not disposed to give its majority a second chance or to lose the opportunity offered me by the questions to fire an additional broadside into the censorship i pocketed my statement and answered the questions viva voce at the conclusion of this my examination inchief the committee adjourned asking me to present myself again for virtually crossexamination but this cross examination never came off as the sequel will shew   a rare and curious first edition  the refusal of the committee to admit my statement had not unnaturally created the impression that it must be a scandalous document and a lively demand for copies at once set in and among the very first applicants were members of the majority which had carried the decision to exclude the document they had given so little attention to the business that they did not know or had forgotten that they had already been supplied with copies at their own request at all events they came to me publicly and cleaned me out of the handful of copies i had provided for distribution to the press and after the sitting it was intimated to me that yet more copies were desired for the use of the committee a demand under the circumstances of breathbereaving coolness at the same time a brisk demand arose outside the committee not only among people who were anxious to read what i had to say on the subject but among victims of the craze for collecting first editions copies of privately circulated pamphlets and other real or imaginary rarities and who will cheerfully pay five guineas for any piece of discarded old rubbish of mine when they will not pay fourandsixpence for this book because everyone else can get it for fourandsixpence too   the times to the rescue  the day after the refusal of the committee to face my statement i transferred the scene of action to the columns of the times which did yeomans service to the public on this as on many other occasions by treating the question as a public one without the least regard to the supposed susceptibilities of the court on the one side or the avowed prejudices of the free churches or the interests of the managers or theatrical speculators on the other the times published the summarized conclusions of my statement and gave me an opportunity of saying as much as it was then advisable to say of what had occurred for it must be remembered that however impatient and contemptuous i might feel of the intellectual cowardice shewn by the majority of the committee face to face with myself it was none the less necessary to keep up its prestige in every possible way not only for the sake of the dignity and importance of the matter with which it had to deal and in the hope that the treatment of subsequent witnesses and the final report might make amends for a feeble beginning but also out of respect and consideration for the minority for it is fair to say that the majority was never more than a bare majority and that the worst thing the committee didthe exclusion of references to particular playswas perpetrated in the absence of the chairman  i therefore had to treat the committee in the times very much better than its majority deserved an injustice for which i now apologize i did not however resist the temptation to hint quite goodhumoredly that my politeness to the committee had cost me quite enough already and that i was not prepared to supply the members of the committee or anyone else with extra copies merely as collectors curiosities   the council of ten  then the fat was in the fire the majority chaffed for its eagerness to obtain copies of scarce pamphlets retailable at five guineas went dancing mad when i presented myself as requested for crossexamination i found the doors of the committee room shut and the corridors of the house of lords filled by a wondering crowd to whom it had somehow leaked out that something terrible was happening inside it could not be another licensed play too scandalous to be discussed in public because the committee had decided to discuss no more of these examples of the censors notions of purifying the stage and what else the committee might have to discuss that might not be heard by all the world was not easily guessable  without suggesting that the confidence of the committee was in any way violated by any of its members further than was absolutely necessary to clear them from suspicion of complicity in the scene which followed i think i may venture to conjecture what was happening it was felt by the majority first that it must be cleared at all costs of the imputation of having procured more than one copy each of my statement and that one not from any interest in an undesirable document by an irreverent author but in the reluctant discharge of its solemn public duty second that a terrible example must be made of me by the most crushing public snub in the power of the committee to administer to throw my wretched little pamphlet at my head and to kick me out of the room was the passionate impulse which prevailed in spite of all the remonstrances of the commoners seasoned to the giveandtake of public life and of the single peer who kept his head the others for the moment had no heads to keep and the fashion in which they proposed to wreak their vengeance was as follows   the sentence  i was to be admitted as a lamb to the slaughter and allowed to take my place as if for further examination the chairman was then to inform me coldly that the committee did not desire to have anything more to say to me the members were thereupon solemnly to hand me back the copies of my statement as so much waste paper and i was to be suffered to slink away with what countenance i could maintain in such disgrace  but this plan required the active cooperation of every member of the committee and whilst the majority regarded it as an august and impressive vindication of the majesty of parliament the minority regarded it with equal conviction as a puerile tomfoolery and declined altogether to act their allotted parts in it besides they did not all want to part with the books for instance mr hugh law being an irishman with an irishmans sense of how to behave like a gallant gentleman on occasion was determined to be able to assure me that nothing should induce him to give up my statement or prevent him from obtaining and cherishing as many copies as possible i quote this as an example to the house of lords of the right thing to say in such emergencies so the program had to be modified the minority could not prevent the enraged majority from refusing to examine me further nor could the chairman refuse to communicate that decision to me neither could the minority object to the secretary handing me back such copies as he could collect from the majority and at that the matter was left the doors were opened the audience trooped in i was called to my place in the dock so to speak and all was ready for the sacrifice   the execution  alas the majority reckoned without colonel lockwood that hardy and undaunted veteran refused to shirk his share in the scene merely because the minority was recalcitrant and the majority perhaps subject to stage fright when mr samuel had informed me that the committee had no further questions to ask me with an urbanity which gave the public no clue as to the temper of the majority when i had jumped up with the proper air of relief and gratitude when the secretary had handed me his little packet of books with an affability which effectually concealed his dramatic function as executioner when the audience was simply disappointed at being baulked of the entertainment of hearing mr robert harcourt crossexamine me in short when the situation was all but saved by the tact of the chairman and secretary colonel lockwood rose with all his carnations blazing and gave away the whole case by handing me with impressive simplicity and courtesy his two copies of the precious statement and i believe that if he had succeeded in securing ten he would have handed them all back to me with the most sincere conviction that every one of the ten must prove a crushing addition to the weight of my discomfiture i still cherish that second copy a little blue bound pamphlet methodically autographed lockwood b among my most valued literary trophies  an innocent lady told me afterwards that she never knew that i could smile so beautifully and that she thought it shewed very good taste on my part i was not conscious of smiling but i should have embraced the colonel had i dared as it was i turned expectantly to his colleagues mutely inviting them to follow his example but there was only one colonel lockwood on that committee no eye met mine except minority eyes dancing with mischief there was nothing more to be said i went home to my mornings work and returned in the afternoon to receive the apologies of the minority for the conduct of the majority and to see mr granville barker overwhelmed by the consciencestricken politeness of the now almost abject committee and by a powerful smell of carnations heading the long list of playwrights who came there to testify against the censorship and whose treatment i am happy to say was everything they could have desired  after all ridiculous as the scene was colonel lockwoods simplicity and courage were much more serviceable to his colleagues than their own inept coup de theatre would have been if he had not spoiled it it was plain to every one that he had acted in entire good faith without a thought as to these apparently insignificant little books being of any importance or having caused me or anybody else any trouble and that he was wounded in his most sensitive spot by the construction my times letter had put on his action and in colonel lockwoods case one saw the case of his party on the committee they had simply been thoughtless in the matter  i hope nobody will suppose that this in any way exonerates them when people accept public service for one of the most vital duties that can arise in our society they have no right to be thoughtless in spite of the fun of the scene on the surface my public sense was and still is very deeply offended by it it made an end for me of the claim of the majority to be taken seriously when the government comes to deal with the question as it presumably will before long i invite it to be guided by the chairman the minority and by the witnesses according to their weight and to pay no attention whatever to those recommendations which were obviously inserted solely to conciliate the majority and get the report through and the committee done with  my evidence will be found in the bluebook pp 4653 and here is the terrible statement which the committee went through so much to suppress    the rejected statement  part i  the witnesss qualifications  i am by profession a playwright i have been in practice since 1892 i am a member of the managing committee of the society of authors and of the dramatic subcommittee of that body i have written nineteen plays some of which have been translated and performed in all european countries except turkey greece and portugal they have been performed extensively in america three of them have been refused licences by the lord chamberlain in one case a licence has since been granted the other two are still unlicensed i have suffered both in pocket and reputation by the action of the lord chamberlain in other countries i have not come into conflict with the censorship except in austria where the production of a comedy of mine was postponed for a year because it alluded to the part taken by austria in the servo bulgarian war this comedy was not one of the plays suppressed in england by the lord chamberlain one of the plays so suppressed was prosecuted in america by the police in consequence of an immense crowd of disorderly persons having been attracted to the first performance by the lord chamberlains condemnation of it but on appeal to a higher court it was decided that the representation was lawful and the intention innocent since when it has been repeatedly performed  i am not an ordinary playwright in general practice i am a specialist in immoral and heretical plays my reputation has been gained by my persistent struggle to force the public to reconsider its morals in particular i regard much current morality as to economic and sexual relations as disastrously wrong and i regard certain doctrines of the christian religion as understood in england today with abhorrence i write plays with the deliberate object of converting the nation to my opinions in these matters i have no other effectual incentive to write plays as i am not dependent on the theatre for my livelihood if i were prevented from producing immoral and heretical plays i should cease to write for the theatre and propagate my views from the platform and through books i mention these facts to shew that i have a special interest in the achievement by my profession of those rights of liberty of speech and conscience which are matters of course in other professions i object to censorship not merely because the existing form of it grievously injures and hinders me individually but on public grounds   the definition of immorality  in dealing with the question of the censorship everything depends on the correct use of the word immorality and a careful discrimination between the powers of a magistrate or judge to administer a code and those of a censor to please himself  whatever is contrary to established manners and customs is immoral an immoral act or doctrine is not necessarily a sinful one on the contrary every advance in thought and conduct is by definition immoral until it has converted the majority for this reason it is of the most enormous importance that immorality should be protected jealously against the attacks of those who have no standard except the standard of custom and who regard any attack on customthat is on moralsas an attack on society on religion and on virtue  a censor is never intentionally a protector of immorality he always aims at the protection of morality now morality is extremely valuable to society it imposes conventional conduct on the great mass of persons who are incapable of original ethical judgment and who would be quite lost if they were not in leadingstrings devised by lawgivers philosophers prophets and poets for their guidance but morality is not dependent on censorship for protection it is already powerfully fortified by the magistracy and the whole body of law blasphemy indecency libel treason sedition obscenity profanity and all the other evils which a censorship is supposed to avert are punishable by the civil magistrate with all the severity of vehement prejudice morality has not only every engine that lawgivers can devise in full operation for its protection but also that enormous weight of public opinion enforced by social ostracism which is stronger than all the statutes a censor pretending to protect morality is like a child pushing the cushions of a railway carriage to give itself the sensation of making the train travel at sixty miles an hour it is immorality not morality that needs protection it is morality not immorality that needs restraint for morality with all the dead weight of human inertia and superstition to hang on the back of the pioneer and all the malice of vulgarity and prejudice to threaten him is responsible for many persecutions and many martyrdoms  persecutions and martyrdoms however are trifles compared to the mischief done by censorships in delaying the general march of enlightenment this can be brought home to us by imagining what would have been the effect of applying to all literature the censorship we still apply to the stage the works of linnaeus and the evolutionists of 17901830 of darwin wallace huxley helmholtz tyndall spencer carlyle ruskin and samuel butler would not have been published as they were all immoral and heretical in the very highest degree and gave pain to many worthy and pious people they are at present condemned by the greek and roman catholic censorships as unfit for general reading a censorship of conduct would have been equally disastrous the disloyalty of hampden and of washington the revolting immorality of luther in not only marrying when he was a priest but actually marrying a nun the heterodoxy of galileo the shocking blasphemies and sacrileges of mohammed against the idols whom he dethroned  to make way for his conception of one god the still more startling blasphemy of jesus when he declared god to be the son of man and himself to be the son of god are all examples of shocking immoralities every immorality shocks somebody the suppression and extinction of which would have been more disastrous than the utmost mischief that can be conceived as ensuing from the toleration of vice  these facts glaring as they are are disguised by the promotion of immoralities into moralities which is constantly going on christianity and mohammedanism once thought of and dealt with exactly as anarchism is thought of and dealt with today have become established religions and fresh immoralities are prosecuted in their name the truth is that the vast majority of persons professing these religions have never been anything but simple moralists the respectable englishman who is a christian because he was born in clapham would be a mohammedan for the cognate reason if he had been born in constantinople he has never willingly tolerated immorality he did not adopt any innovation until it had become moral and then he adopted it not on its merits but solely because it had become moral in doing so he never realized that it had ever been immoral consequently its early struggles taught him no lesson and he has opposed the next step in human progress as indignantly as if neither manners customs nor thought had ever changed since the beginning of the world toleration must be imposed on him as a mystic and painful duty by his spiritual and political leaders or he will condemn the world to stagnation which is the penalty of an inflexible morality   what toleration means  this must be done all the more arbitrarily because it is not possible to make the ordinary moral man understand what toleration and liberty really mean he will accept them verbally with alacrity even with enthusiasm because the word toleration has been moralized by eminent whigs but what he means by toleration is toleration of doctrines that he considers enlightened and by liberty liberty to do what he considers right that is he does not mean toleration or liberty at all for there is no need to tolerate what appears enlightened or to claim liberty to do what most people consider right toleration and liberty have no sense or use except as toleration of opinions that are considered damnable and liberty to do what seems wrong setting englishmen free to marry their deceased wifes sisters is not tolerated by the people who approve of it but by the people who regard it as incestuous catholic emancipation and the admission of jews to parliament needed no toleration from catholics and jews the toleration they needed was that of the people who regarded the one measure as a facilitation of idolatry and the other as a condonation of the crucifixion clearly such toleration is not clamored for by the multitude or by the press which reflects its prejudices it is essentially one of those abnegations of passion and prejudice which the common man submits to because uncommon men whom he respects as wiser than himself assure him that it must be so or the higher affairs of human destiny will suffer  such admission is the more difficult because the arguments against tolerating immorality are the same as the arguments against tolerating murder and theft and this is why the censor seems to the inconsiderate as obviously desirable a functionary as the police magistrate but there is this simple and tremendous difference between the cases that whereas no evil can conceivably result from the total suppression of murder and theft and all communities prosper in direct proportion to such suppression the total suppression of immorality especially in matters of religion and sex would stop enlightenment and produce what used to be called a chinese civilization until the chinese lately took to immoral courses by permitting railway contractors to desecrate the graves of their ancestors and their soldiers to wear clothes which indecently revealed the fact that they had legs and waists and even posteriors at about the same moment a few bold englishwomen ventured on the immorality of riding astride their horses a practice that has since established itself so successfully that before another generation has passed away there may not be a new sidesaddle in england or a woman who could use it if there was   the case for toleration  accordingly there has risen among wise and farsighted men a perception of the need for setting certain departments of human activity entirely free from legal interference this has nothing to do with any sympathy these liberators may themselves have with immoral views a man with the strongest conviction of the divine ordering of the universe and of the superiority of monarchy to all forms of government may nevertheless quite consistently and conscientiously be ready to lay down his life for the right of every man to advocate atheism or republicanism if he believes in them an attack on morals may turn out to be the salvation of the race a hundred years ago nobody foresaw that tom paines centenary would be the subject of a laudatory special article in the times and only a few understood that the persecution of his works and the transportation of men for the felony of reading them was a mischievous mistake even less perhaps could they have guessed that proudhon who became notorious by his essay entitled  what is property it is theft would have received on the like occasion and in the same paper a respectful consideration which nobody would now dream of according to lord liverpool or lord brougham nevertheless there was a mass of evidence to shew that such a development was not only possible but fairly probable and that the risks of suppressing liberty of propaganda were far greater than the risk of paines or proudhons writings wrecking civilization now there was no such evidence in favor of tolerating the cutting of throats and the robbing of tills no case whatever can be made out for the statement that a nation cannot do without common thieves and homicidal ruffians but an overwhelming case can be made out for the statement that no nation can prosper or even continue to exist without heretics and advocates of shockingly immoral doctrines the inquisition and the star chamber which were nothing but censorships made ruthless war on impiety and immorality the result was once familiar to englishmen though of late years it seems to have been forgotten it cost england a revolution to get rid of the star chamber spain did not get rid of the inquisition and paid for that omission by becoming a barely thirdrate power politically and intellectually no power at all in the europe she had once dominated as the mightiest of the christian empires   the limits to toleration  but the large toleration these considerations dictate has limits for example though we tolerate and rightly tolerate the propaganda of anarchism as a political theory which embraces all that is valuable in the doctrine of laisserfaire and the method of free trade as well as all that is shocking in the views of bakounine we clearly cannot or at all events will not tolerate assassination of rulers on the ground that it is propaganda by deed or sociological experiment a play inciting to such an assassination cannot claim the privileges of heresy or immorality because no case can be made out in support of assassination as an indispensable instrument of progress now it happens that we have in the julius caesar of shakespear a play which the tsar of russia or the governorgeneral of india would hardly care to see performed in their capitals just now it is an artistic treasure but it glorifies a murder which goethe described as the silliest crime ever committed it may quite possibly have helped the regicides of 1649 to see themselves as it certainly helped generations of whig statesmen to see them in a heroic light and it unquestionably  vindicates and ennobles a conspirator who assassinated the head of the roman state not because he abused his position but solely because he occupied it thus affirming the extreme republican principle that all kings good or bad should be killed because kingship and freedom cannot live together under certain circumstances this vindication and ennoblement might act as an incitement to an actual assassination as well as to plutarchian republicanism for it is one thing to advocate republicanism or royalism it is quite another to make a hero of brutus or ravaillac or a heroine of charlotte corday assassination is the extreme form of censorship and it seems hard to justify an incitement to it on anticensorial principles the very people who would have scouted the notion of prohibiting the performances of julius caesar at his majestys theatre in london last year might now entertain very seriously a proposal to exclude indians from them and to suppress the play completely in calcutta and dublin for if the assassin of caesar was a hero why not the assassins of lord frederick cavendish presidents lincoln and mckinley and sir curzon wyllie here is a strong case for some constitutional means of preventing the performance of a play true it is an equally strong case for preventing the circulation of the bible which was always in the hands of our regicides but as the roman catholic church does not hesitate to accept that consequence of the censorial principle it does not invalidate the argument  take another actual case a modern comedy arms and the man though not a comedy of politics is nevertheless so far historical that it reveals the unacknowledged fact that as the servobulgarian war of 1885 was much more than a struggle between the servians and bulgarians the troops engaged were officered by two european powers of the first magnitude in consequence the performance of the play was for some time forbidden in vienna and more recently it gave offence in rome at a moment when popular feeling was excited as to the relations of austria with the balkan states now if a comedy so remote from political passion as arms and the man can merely because it refers to political facts become so inconvenient and inopportune that foreign offices take the trouble to have its production postponed what may not be the effect of what is called a patriotic drama produced at a moment when the balance is quivering between peace and war is there not something to be said for a political censorship if not for a moral one may not those continental governments who leave the stage practically free in every other respect but muzzle it politically be justified by the practical exigencies of the situation   the difference between law and censorship  the answer is that a pamphlet a newspaper article or a resolution moved at a political meeting can do all the mischief that a play can and often more yet we do not set up a permanent censorship of the press or of political meetings any journalist may publish an article any demagogue may deliver a speech without giving notice to the government or obtaining its licence the risk of such freedom is great but as it is the price of our political liberty we think it worth paying we may abrogate it in emergencies by a coercion act a suspension of the habeas corpus act or a proclamation of martial law just as we stop the traffic in a street during a fire or shoot thieves at sight if they loot after an earthquake but when the emergency is past liberty is restored everywhere except in the theatre the act of 1843 is a permanent coercion act for the theatre a permanent suspension of the habeas corpus act as far as plays are concerned a permanent proclamation of martial law with a single official substituted for a court martial it is in fact assumed that actors playwrights and theatre managers are dangerous and dissolute characters whose existence creates a chronic state of emergency and who must be treated as earthquake looters are treated it is not necessary now to discredit this assumption it was broken down by the late sir henry irving when he finally shamed the government into extending to his profession the official recognition enjoyed by the other branches of fine art today we have on the roll of knighthood actors authors and managers the rogue and vagabond theory of the depravity of the theatre is as dead officially as it is in general society and with it has perished the sole excuse for the act of 1843 and for the denial to the theatre of the liberties secured at far greater social risk to the press and the platform  there is no question here of giving the theatre any larger liberties than the press and the platform or of claiming larger powers for shakespear to eulogize brutus than lord rosebery has to eulogize cromwell the abolition of the censorship does not involve the abolition of the magistrate and of the whole civil and criminal code on the contrary it would make the theatre more effectually subject to them than it is at present for once a play now runs the gauntlet of the censorship it is practically placed above the law it is almost humiliating to have to demonstrate the essential difference between a censor and a magistrate or a sanitary inspector but it is impossible to ignore the carelessness with which even distinguished critics of the theatre assume that all the arguments proper to the support of a magistracy and body of jurisprudence apply equally to a censorship  a magistrate has laws to administer a censor has nothing but his own opinion a judge leaves the question of guilt to the jury the censor is jury and judge as well as lawgiver a magistrate may be strongly prejudiced against an atheist or an anti vaccinator just as a sanitary inspector may have formed a careful opinion that drains are less healthy than cesspools but the magistrate must allow the atheist to affirm instead of to swear and must grant the antivaccinator an exemption certificate when their demands are lawfully made and in cities the inspector must compel the builder to make drains and must prosecute him if he makes cesspools the law may be only the intolerance of the community but it is a defined and limited intolerance the limitation is sometimes carried so far that a judge cannot inflict the penalty for housebreaking on a burglar who can prove that he found the door open and therefore made only an unlawful entry on the other hand it is sometimes so vague as for example in the case of the american law against obscenity that it makes the magistrate virtually a censor but in the main a citizen can ascertain what he may do and what he may not do and though no one knows better than a magistrate that a single illconducted family may demoralize a whole street no magistrate can imprison or otherwise restrain its members on the ground that their immorality may corrupt their neighbors he can prevent any citizen from carrying certain specified weapons but not from handling pokers tableknives bricks or bottles of corrosive fluid on the ground that he might use them to commit murder or inflict malicious injury he has no general power to prevent citizens from selling unhealthy or poisonous substances or judging for themselves what substances are unhealthy and what wholesome what poisonous and what innocuous what he can do is to prevent anybody who has not a specific qualification from selling certain specified poisons of which a schedule is kept nobody is forbidden to sell minerals without a licence but everybody is forbidden to sell silver without a licence when the law has forgotten some atrocious sinfor instance contracting marriage whilst suffering from contagious diseasethe magistrate cannot arrest or punish the wrongdoer however he may abhor his wickedness in short no man is lawfully at the mercy of the magistrates personal caprice prejudice ignorance superstition temper stupidity resentment timidity ambition or private conviction but a playwrights livelihood his reputation and his inspiration and mission are at the personal mercy of the censor the two do not stand as the criminal and the judge stand in the presence of a law that binds them both equally and was made by neither of them but by the deliberative collective wisdom of the community the only law that affects them is the act of 1843 which empowers one of them to do absolutely and finally what he likes with the others work and when it is remembered that the slave in this case is the man whose profession is that of eschylus and euripides of shakespear and goethe of tolstoy and ibsen and the master the holder of a party appointment which by the nature of its duties practically excludes the possibility of its acceptance by a serious statesman or great lawyer it will be seen that the playwrights are justified in reproaching the framers of that act for having failed not only to appreciate the immense importance of the theatre as a most powerful instrument for teaching the nation how and what to think and feel but even to conceive that those who make their living by the theatre are normal human beings with the common rights of english citizens in this extremity of inconsiderateness it is not surprising that they also did not trouble themselves to study the difference between a censor and a magistrate and it will be found that almost all the people who disinterestedly defend the censorship today are defending him on the assumption that there is no constitutional difference between him and any other functionary whose duty it is to restrain crime and disorder  one further difference remains to be noted as a magistrate grows old his mind may change or decay but the law remains the same the censorship of the theatre fluctuates with every change in the views and character of the man who exercises it and what this implies can only be appreciated by those who can imagine what the effect on the mind must be of the duty of reading through every play that is produced in the kingdom year in year out   why the lord chamberlain  what may be called the high political case against censorship as a principle is now complete the pleadings are those which have already freed books and pulpits and political platforms in england from censorship if not from occasional legal persecution the stage alone remains under a censorship of a grotesquely unsuitable kind no play can be performed if the lord chamberlain happens to disapprove of it and the lord chamberlains functions have no sort of relationship to dramatic literature a great judge of literature a farseeing statesman a born champion of liberty of conscience and intellectual integritysay a milton a chesterfield a bentham would be a very bad lord chamberlain so bad in fact that his exclusion from such a post may be regarded as decreed by natural law on the other hand a good lord chamberlain would be a stickler for morals in the narrowest sense a busybody a man to whom a matter of two inches in the length of a gentlemans sword or the absence of a feather from a ladys headdress would be a graver matter than the habeas corpus act the lord chamberlain as censor of the theatre is a direct descendant of the kings master of the revels appointed in 1544 by henry viii to keep order among the players and musicians of that day when they performed at court this first appearance of the theatrical censor in politics as the whipperin of the player with its conception of the player as a rich mans servant hired to amuse him and outside his professional duties as a gay disorderly anarchic spoilt child half privileged half outlawed probably as much vagabond as actor is the real foundation of the subjection of the whole profession actors managers authors and all to the despotic authority of an officer whose business it is to preserve decorum among menials it must be remembered that it was not until a hundred years later in the reaction against the puritans that a woman could appear on the english stage without being pelted off as the italian actresses were the theatrical profession was regarded as a shameless one and it is only of late years that actresses have at last succeeded in living down the assumption that actress and prostitute are synonymous terms and made good their position in respectable society this makes the survival of the old ostracism in the act of 1843 intolerably galling and though it explains the apparently unaccountable absurdity of choosing as censor of dramatic literature an official whose functions and qualifications have nothing whatever to do with literature it also explains why the present arrangement is not only criticized as an institution but resented as an insult   the diplomatic objection to the lord chamberlain  there is another reason quite unconnected with the susceptibilities of authors which makes it undesirable that a member of the kings household should be responsible for the character and tendency of plays the drama dealing with all departments of human life is necessarily political recent events have shownwhat indeed needed no demonstrationthat it is impossible to prevent inferences being made both at home and abroad from the action of the lord chamberlain the most talked about play of the present year 1909 an englishmans home has for its main interest an invasion of england by a fictitious power which is understood as it is meant to be understood to represent germany the lesson taught by the play is the danger of invasion and the need for every english citizen to be a soldier the lord chamberlain licensed this play but refused to license a parody of it shortly afterwards he refused to license another play in which the fear of a german invasion was ridiculed the german press drew the inevitable inference that the lord chamberlain was an antigerman alarmist and that his opinions were a reflection of those prevailing in st jamess palace immediately after this the lord chamberlain licensed the play whether the inference as far as the lord chamberlain was concerned was justified is of no consequence what is important is that it was sure to be made justly or unjustly and extended from the lord chamberlain to the throne   the objection of court etiquet  there is another objection to the lord chamberlains censorship which affects the authors choice of subject formerly very little heed was given in england to the susceptibilities of foreign courts for instance the notion that the mikado of japan should be as sacred to the english playwright as he is to the japanese lord chamberlain would have seemed grotesque a generation ago now that the maintenance of entente cordiale between nations is one of the most prominent and most useful functions of the crown the freedom of authors to deal with political subjects even historically is seriously threatened by the way in which the censorship makes the king responsible for the contents of every play one authorthe writer of these lines in facthas long desired to dramatize the life of mahomet but the possibility of a protest from the turkish ambassadoror the fear of itcausing the lord chamberlain to refuse to license such a play has prevented the play from being written now if the censorship were abolished nobody but the author could be held responsible for the play the turkish ambassador does not now protest against the publication of carlyles essay on the prophet or of the english translations of the koran in the prefaces to which mahomet is criticized as an impostor or of the older books in which he is reviled as mahound and classed with the devil himself but if these publications had to be licensed by the lord chamberlain it would be impossible for the king to allow the licence to be issued as he would thereby be made responsible for the opinions expressed this restriction of the historical drama is an unmixed evil great religious leaders are more interesting and more important subjects for the dramatist than great conquerors it is a misfortune that public opinion would not tolerate a dramatization of mahomet in constantinople but to prohibit it here where public opinion would tolerate it is an absurdity which if applied in all directions would make it impossible for the queen to receive a turkish ambassador without veiling herself or the dean and chapter of st pauls to display a cross on the summit of their cathedral in a city occupied largely and influentially by jews court etiquet is no doubt an excellent thing for court ceremonies but to attempt to impose it on the drama is about as sensible as an attempt to make everybody in london wear court dress   why not an enlightened censorship  in the above cases the general question of censorship is separable from the question of the present form of it every one who condemns the principle of censorship must also condemn the lord chamberlains control of the drama but those who approve of the principle do not necessarily approve of the lord chamberlain being the censor ex officio they may however be entirely opposed to popular liberties and may conclude from what has been said not that the stage should be made as free as the church press or platform but that these institutions should be censored as strictly as the stage it will seem obvious to them that nothing is needed to remove all objections to a censorship except the placing of its powers in better hands  now though the transfer of the censorship to say the lord chancellor or the primate or a cabinet minister would be much less humiliating to the persons immediately concerned the inherent vices of the institution would not be appreciably less disastrous they would even be aggravated for reasons which do not appear on the surface and therefore need to be followed with some attention  it is often said that the public is the real censor that this is to some extent true is proved by the fact that plays which are licensed and produced in london have to be expurgated for the provinces this does not mean that the provinces are more strait laced but simply that in many provincial towns there is only one theatre for all classes and all tastes whereas in london there are separate theatres for separate sections of playgoers so that for example sir herbert beerbohm tree can conduct his majestys theatre without the slightest regard to the tastes of the frequenters of the gaiety theatre and mr george edwardes can conduct the gaiety theatre without catering in any way for lovers of shakespear thus the farcical comedy which has scandalized the critics in london by the libertinage of its jests is played to the respectable dress circle of northampton with these same jests slurred over so as to be imperceptible by even the most prurient spectator the public in short takes care that nobody shall outrage it  but the public also takes care that nobody shall starve it or regulate its dramatic diet as a schoolmistress regulates the reading of her pupils even when it wishes to be debauched no censor canor at least no censor doesstand out against it if a play is irresistibly amusing it gets licensed no matter what its moral aspect may be a brilliant instance is the divorcons of the late victorien sardou which may not have been the naughtiest play of the 19th century but was certainly the very naughtiest that any english manager in his senses would have ventured  to produce nevertheless being a very amusing play it passed the licenser with the exception of a reference to impotence as a ground for divorce which no english actress would have ventured on in any case within the last few months a very amusing comedy with a strongly polygamous moral was found irresistible by the lord chamberlain plenty of fun and a happy ending will get anything licensed because the public will have it so and the examiner of plays as the holder of the office testified before the commission of 1892 report page 330 feels with the public and knows that his office could not survive a widespread unpopularity in short the support of the mobthat is of the unreasoning unorganized uninstructed mass of popular sentimentis indispensable to the censorship as it exists to day in england this is the explanation of the toleration by the lord chamberlain of coarse and vicious plays it is not long since a judge before whom a licensed play came in the course of a lawsuit expressed his scandalized astonishment at the licensing of such a work eminent churchmen have made similar protests in some plays the simulation of criminal assaults on the stage has been carried to a point at which a step further would have involved the interference of the police provided the treatment of the theme is gaily or hypocritically popular and the ending happy the indulgence of the lord chamberlain can be counted on on the other hand anything unpleasing and unpopular is rigorously censored adultery and prostitution are tolerated and even encouraged to such an extent that plays which do not deal with them are commonly said not to be plays at all but if any of the unpleasing consequences of adultery and prostitutionfor instance an unsuccessful illegal operation successful ones are tolerated or venereal diseaseare mentioned the play is prohibited this principle of shielding the playgoer from unpleasant reflections is carried so far that when a play was submitted for license in which the relations of a prostitute with all the male characters in the piece was described as immoral the examiner of plays objected to that passage though he made no objection to the relations themselves the lord chamberlain dare not in short attempt to exclude from the stage the tragedies of murder and lust or the farces of mendacity adultery and dissolute gaiety in which vulgar people delight but when these same vulgar people are threatened with an unpopular play in which dissoluteness is shown to be no laughing matter it is prohibited at once amid the vulgar applause the net result being that vice is made delightful and virtue banned by the very institution which is supported on the understanding that it produces exactly the opposite result   the weakness of the lord chamberlains department  now comes the question why is our censorship armed as it is with apparently autocratic powers so scandalously timid in the face of the mob why is it not as autocratic in dealing with playwrights below the average as with those above it the answer is that its position is really a very weak one it has no direct coercive forces no funds to institute prosecutions and recover the legal penalties of defying it no powers of arrest or imprisonment in short none of the guarantees of autocracy what it can do is to refuse to renew the licence of a theatre at which its orders are disobeyed when it happens that a theatre is about to be demolished as was the case recently with the imperial theatre after it had passed into the hands of the wesleyan methodists unlicensed plays can be performed technically in private but really in full publicity without risk the prohibited plays of brieux and ibsen have been performed in london in this way with complete impunity but the impunity is not confined to condemned theatres not long ago a west end manager allowed a prohibited play to be performed at his theatre taking his chance of losing his licence in consequence the event proved that the manager was justified in regarding the risk as negligible for the lord chamberlains remedythe closing of a popular and wellconducted theatrewas far too extreme to be practicable unless the play had so outraged public opinion as to make the manager odious and provoke a clamor for his exemplary punishment the lord chamberlain could only have had his revenge at the risk of having his powers abolished as unsupportably tyrannical  the lord chamberlain then has his powers so adjusted that he is tyrannical just where it is important that he should be tolerant and tolerant just where he could screw up the standard a little by being tyrannical his plea that there are unmentionable depths to which managers and authors would descend if he did not prevent them is disproved by the plain fact that his indulgence goes as far as the police and sometimes further than the public will let it if our judges had so little power there would be no law in england if our churches had so much there would be no theatre no literature no science no art possibly no england the institution is at once absurdly despotic and abjectly weak   an enlightened censorship still worse than the lord chamberlains  clearly a censorship of judges bishops or statesmen would not be in this abject condition it would no doubt make short work of the coarse and vicious pieces which now enjoy the protection of the lord chamberlain or at least of those of them in which the vulgarity and vice are discoverable by merely reading the prompt copy but it would certainly disappoint the main hope of its advocates the hope that it would protect and foster the higher drama it would do nothing of the sort on the contrary it would inevitably suppress it more completely than the lord chamberlain does because it would understand it better the one play of ibsens which is prohibited on the english stage ghosts is far less subversive than a dolls house but the lord chamberlain does not meddle with such farreaching matters as the tendency of a play he refuses to license ghosts exactly as he would refuse to license hamlet if it were submitted to him as a new play he would license even hamlet if certain alterations were made in it he would disallow the incestuous relationship between the king and queen he would probably insist on the substitution of some fictitious country for denmark in deference to the near relations of our reigning house with that realm he would certainly make it an absolute condition that the closet scene in which a son in an agony of shame and revulsion reproaches his mother for her relations with his uncle should be struck out as unbearably horrifying and improper but compliance with these conditions would satisfy him he would raise no speculative objections to the tendency of the play  this indifference to the larger issues of a theatrical performance could not be safely predicated of an enlightened censorship such a censorship might be more liberal in its toleration of matters which are only objected to on the ground that they are not usually discussed in general social conversation or in the presence of children but it would presumably have a far deeper insight to and concern for the real ethical tendency of the play for instance had it been in existence during the last quarter of a century it would have perceived that those plays of ibsens which have been licensed without question are fundamentally immoral to an altogether extraordinary degree every one of them is a deliberate act of war on society as at present constituted religion marriage ordinary respectability are subjected to a destructive exposure and criticism which seems to mere moraliststhat is to persons of no more than average depth of mindto be diabolical it is no exaggeration to say that ibsen gained his overwhelming reputation by undertaking a task of no less magnitude than changing the mind of europe with the view of changing its morals now you cannot license work of that sort without making yourself responsible for it the lord chamberlain accepted the responsibility because he did not understand it or concern himself about it but what really enlightened and conscientious official dare take such a responsibility the strength of character and range of vision which made ibsen capable of it are not to be expected from any official however eminent it is true that an enlightened censor might whilst shrinking even with horror from ibsens views perceive that any nation which suppressed ibsen would presently find itself falling behind the nations which tolerated him just as spain fell behind england but the proper action to take on such a conviction is the abdication of censorship not the practise of it as long as a censor is a censor he cannot endorse by his licence opinions which seem to him dangerously heretical  we may therefore conclude that the more enlightened a censorship is the worse it would serve us the lord chamberlain an obviously unenlightened censor prohibits ghosts and licenses all the rest of ibsens plays an enlightened censorship would possibly license ghosts but it would certainly suppress many of the other plays it would suppress subversiveness as well as what is called bad taste the lord chamberlain prohibits one play by sophocles because like hamlet it mentions the subject of incest but an enlightened censorship might suppress all the plays of euripides because euripides like ibsen was a revolutionary freethinker under the lord chamberlain we can smuggle a good deal of immoral drama and almost as much coarsely vulgar and furtively lascivious drama as we like under a college of cardinals or bishops or judges or any other conceivable form of experts in morals philosophy religion or politics we should get little except stagnant mediocrity   the practical impossibilities of censorship  there is besides a crushing material difficulty in the way of an enlightened censorship it is not too much to say that the work involved would drive a man of any intellectual rank mad consider for example the christmas pantomimes imagine a judge of the high court or an archbishop or a cabinet minister or an eminent man of letters earning his living by reading through the mass of trivial doggerel represented by all the pantomimes which are put into rehearsal simultaneously at the end of every year the proposal to put such minddestroying drudgery upon an official of the class implied by the demand for an enlightened censorship falls through the moment we realize what it implies in practice  another material difficulty is that no play can be judged by merely reading the dialogue to be fully effective a censor should witness the performance the miseenscene of a play is as much a part of it as the words spoken on the stage no censor could possibly object to such a speech as might i speak to you for a moment miss yet that apparently innocent phrase has often been made offensively improper on the stage by popular low comedians with the effect of changing the whole character and meaning of the play as understood by the official examiner in one of the plays of the present season the dialogue was that of a crude melodrama dealing in the most conventionally correct manner with the fortunes of a goodhearted and virtuous girl its morality was that of the sunday school but the principal actress between two speeches which contained no reference to her action changed her underclothing on the stage it is true that in this case the actress was so much better than her part that she succeeded in turning what was meant as an impropriety into an inoffensive stroke of realism yet it is none the less clear that stage business of this character on which there can be no check except the actual presence of a censor in the theatre might convert any dialogue however innocent into just the sort of entertainment against which the censor is supposed to protect the public  it was this practical impossibility that prevented the london county council from attempting to apply a censorship of the lord chamberlains pattern to the london music halls a proposal to examine all entertainments before permitting their performance was actually made and it was abandoned not in the least as contrary to the liberty of the stage but because the executive problem of how to do it at once reduced the proposal to absurdity even if the council devoted all its time to witnessing rehearsals of variety performances and putting each item to the vote possibly after a prolonged discussion followed by a division the work would still fall into arrear no committee could be induced to undertake such a task the attachment of an inspector of morals to each music hall would have meant an appreciable addition to the ratepayers burden in the face of such difficulties the proposal melted away had it been pushed through and the inspectors appointed each of them would have become a censor and the whole body of inspectors would have become a police des moeurs those who know the history of such police forces on the continent will understand how impossible it would be to procure inspectors whose characters would stand the strain of their opportunities of corruption both pecuniary and personal at such salaries as a local authority could be persuaded to offer  it has been suggested that the present censorship should be supplemented by a board of experts who should deal not with the whole mass of plays sent up for license but only those which the examiner of plays refuses to pass as the number of plays which the examiner refuses to pass is never great enough to occupy a board in permanent session with regular salaries and as casual employment is not compatible with public responsibility this proposal would work out in practice as an addition to the duties of some existing functionary a secretary of state would be objectionable as likely to be biased politically an ecclesiastical referee might be biassed against the theatre altogether a judge in chambers would be the proper authority this plan would combine the inevitable intolerance of an enlightened censorship with the popular laxity of the lord chamberlain  the judge would suppress the pioneers whilst the examiner of plays issued two guinea certificates for the vulgar and vicious plays for this reason the plan would no doubt be popular but it would be very much as a relaxation of the administration of the public health acts accompanied by the cheapening of gin would be popular   the arbitration proposal  on the occasion of a recent deputation of playwrights to the prime minister it was suggested that if a censorship be inevitable provision should be made for an appeal from the lord chamberlain in cases of refusal of licence the authors of this suggestion propose that the lord chamberlain shall choose one umpire and the author another the two umpires shall then elect a referee whose decision shall be final  this proposal is not likely to be entertained by constitutional lawyers it is a naive offer to accept the method of arbitration in what is essentially a matter not between one private individual or body and another but between a public offender and the state it will presumably be ruled out as a proposal to refer a case of manslaughter to arbitration would be ruled out but even if it were constitutionally sound it bears all the marks of that practical inexperience which leads men to believe that arbitration either costs nothing or is at least cheaper than law who is to pay for the time of the three arbitrators presumably men of high professional standing the author may not be able the manager may not be willing neither of them should be called upon to pay for a public service otherwise than by their contributions to the revenue clearly the state should pay but even so the difficulties are only beginning a licence is seldom refused except on grounds which are controversial  the two arbitrators selected by the opposed parties to the controversy are to agree to leave the decision to a third party unanimously chosen by themselves that is very far from being a simple solution an attempt to shorten and simplify the passing of the finance bill by referring it to an arbitrator chosen unanimously by mr asquith and mr balfour might not improbably cost more and last longer than a civil war and why should the chosen refereeif he ever succeeded in getting chosenbe assumed to be a safer authority than the examiner of plays he would certainly be a less responsible one in fact being however eminent a casual person called in to settle a single case he would be virtually irresponsible worse still he would take all responsibility away from the lord chamberlain who is at least an official of the kings household and a nominee of the government the lord chamberlain with all his shortcomings thinks twice before he refuses a licence knowing that his refusal is final and may promptly be  made public but if he could transfer his responsibility to an arbitrator he would naturally do so whenever he felt the slightest misgiving or whenever for diplomatic reasons the licence would come more gracefully from an authority unconnected with the court these considerations added to the general objection to the principle of censorship seem sufficient to put the arbitration expedient quite out of the question  end of the first part of the rejected statement   the rejected statement part two  the licensing of theatres  the distinction between licensing and censorship  it must not be concluded that the uncompromising abolition of all censorship involves the abandonment of all control and regulation of theatres factories are regulated in the public interest but there is no censorship of factories for example many persons are sincerely convinced that cotton clothing is unhealthy that alcoholic drinks are demoralizing and that playingcards are the devils picturebooks but though the factories in which cotton whiskey and cards are manufactured are stringently regulated under the factory code and the public health and building acts the inspectors appointed to carry out these acts never go to a manufacturer and inform him that unless he manufactures woollens instead of cottons gingerbeer instead of whiskey bibles instead of playingcards he will be forbidden to place his products on the market in the case of premises licensed for the sale of spirits the authorities go a step further a publichouse differs from a factory in the essential particular that whereas disorder in a factory is promptly and voluntarily suppressed because every moment of its duration involves a measurable pecuniary loss to the proprietor disorder in a publichouse may be a source of profit to the proprietor by its attraction for disorderly customers consequently a publican is compelled to obtain a licence to pursue his trade and this licence lasts only a year and need not be renewed if his house has been conducted in a disorderly manner in the meantime   prostitution and drink in theatres  the theatre presents the same problem as the publichouse in respect to disorder to begin with a theatre is actually a place licensed for the sale of spirits the bars at a london theatre can be let without difficulty for 30 pounds a week and upwards and though it is clear that nobody will pay from a shilling to half a guinea for access to a theatre bar when he can obtain access to an ordinary publichouse for nothing there is no law to prevent the theatre proprietor from issuing free passes broadcast and recouping himself by the profit on the sale of drink besides there may be some other attraction than the sale of drink when this attraction is that of the play no objection need be made but it happens that the auditorium of a theatre with its brilliant lighting and luxurious decorations makes a very effective shelter and background for the display of fine dresses and pretty faces consequently theatres have been used for centuries in england as markets by prostitutes from the restoration to the days of macready all theatres were made use of in this way as a matter of course and to this far more than to any prejudice against dramatic art we owe the puritan formula that the theatre door is the gate of hell macready had a hard struggle to drive the prostitutes from his theatre and since his time the london theatres controlled by the lord chamberlain have become respectable and even socially pretentious but some of the variety theatres still derive a revenue by selling admissions to women who do not look at the performance and men who go to purchase or admire the women and in the provinces this state of things is by no means confined to the variety theatres the real attraction is sometimes not the performance at all the theatre is not really a theatre it is a drink shop and a prostitution market and the last shred of its disguise is stripped by the virtually indiscriminate issue of free tickets to the men access to the stage is so easily obtained and the plays preferred by the management are those in which the stage is filled with young women who are not in any serious technical sense of the word actresses at all considering that all this is now possible at any theatre and actually occurs at some theatres the fact that our best theatres are as respectable as they are is much to their credit but it is still an intolerable evil that respectable managers should have to fight against the free tickets and disorderly housekeeping of unscrupulous competitors the dramatic author is equally injured he finds that unless he writes plays which make suitable sideshows for drinkingbars and brothels he may be excluded from towns where there is not room for two theatres and where the one existing theatre is exploiting drunkenness and prostitution instead of carrying on a legitimate dramatic business indeed everybody connected with the theatrical profession suffers in reputation from the detestable tradition of such places against which the censorship has proved quite useless  here we have a strong case for applying either the licensing system or whatever better means may be devized for securing the orderly conduct of houses of public entertainment dramatic or other liberty must no doubt be respected in so far that no manager should have the right to refuse admission to decently dressed sober and wellconducted persons whether they are prostitutes soldiers in uniform gentlemen not in evening dress indians or what not but when disorder is stopped disorderly persons will either cease to come or else reform their manners it is however quite arguable that the indiscriminate issue of free admissions though an apparently innocent and good natured and certainly a highly popular proceeding should expose the proprietor of the theatre to the risk of a refusal to renew his licence   why the managers dread local control  all this points to the transfer of the control of theatres from the lord chamberlain to the municipality and this step is opposed by the longrun managers partly because they take it for granted that municipal control must involve municipal censorship of plays so that plays might be licensed in one town and prohibited in the next and partly because as they have no desire to produce plays which are in advance of public opinion and as the lord chamberlain in every other respect gives more scandal by his laxity than trouble by his severity they find in the present system a cheap and easy means of procuring a certificate which relieves them of all social responsibility and provides them with so strong a weapon of defence in case of a prosecution that it acts in practice as a bar to any such proceedings above all they know that the examiner of plays is free from the pressure of that large body of english public opinion already alluded to which regards the theatre as the prohibitionist teetotaller regards the publichouse that is as an abomination to be stamped out unconditionally the managers rightly dread this pressure more than anything else and they believe that it is so strong in local governments as to be a characteristic bias of municipal authority in this they are no doubt mistaken there is not a municipal authority of any importance in the country in which a proposal to stamp out the theatre or even to treat it illiberally would have a chance of adoption municipal control of the variety theatres formerly called music halls has been very far from liberal except in the one particular in which the lord chamberlain is equally illiberal that particular is the assumption that a draped figure is decent and an undraped one indecent it is useless to point to actual experience which proves abundantly that naked or apparently naked figures whether exhibited as living pictures animated statuary or in a dance are at their best not only innocent but refining in their effect whereas those actresses and skirt dancers who have brought the peculiar aphrodisiac effect which is objected to to the highest pitch of efficiency wear twice as many petticoats as an ordinary lady does and seldom exhibit more than their ankles unfortunately municipal councillors persist in confusing decency with drapery and both in london and the provinces certain positively edifying performances have been forbidden or withdrawn under pressure and replaced by coarse and vicious ones there is not the slightest reason to suppose that the lord chamberlain would have been any more tolerant but this does not alter the fact that the municipal licensing authorities have actually used their powers to set up a censorship which is open to all the objections to censorship in general and which in addition sets up the objection from which central control is free namely the impossibility of planning theatrical tours without the serious commercial risk of having the performance forbidden in some of the towns booked how can this be prevented   desirable limitations of local control  the problem is not a difficult one the municipality can be limited just as the monarchy is limited the act transferring theatres to local control can be a charter of the liberties of the stage as well as an act to reform administration the power to refuse to grant or renew a licence to a theatre need not be an arbitrary one the municipality may be required to state the ground of refusal and certain grounds can be expressly declared as unlawful so that it shall be possible for the manager to resort to the courts for a mandamus to compel the authority to grant a licence it can be declared unlawful for a licensing authority to demand from the manager any disclosure of the nature of any entertainment he proposes to give or to prevent its performance or to refuse to renew his licence on the ground that the tendency of his entertainments is contrary to religion and morals or that the theatre is an undesirable institution or that there are already as many theatres as are needed or that the theatre draws people away from the churches chapels mission halls and the like in its neighborhood the assumption should be that every citizen has a right to open and conduct a theatre and therefore has a right to a licence unless he has forfeited that right by allowing his theatre to become a disorderly house or failing to provide a building which complies with the regulations concerning sanitation and egress in case of fire or being convicted of an offence against public decency also the licensing powers of the authority should not be delegated to any official or committee and the manager or lessee of the theatre should have a right to appear in person or by counsel to plead against any motion to refuse to grant or renew his licence with these safeguards the licensing power could not be stretched to censorship the manager would enjoy liberty of conscience as far as the local authority is concerned but on the least attempt on his part to keep a disorderly house under cover of opening a theatre he would risk his licence  but the managers will not and should not be satisfied with these limits to the municipal power if they are deprived of the protection of the lord chamberlains licence and at the same time efficiently protected against every attempt at censorship by the licensing authority the enemies of the theatre will resort to the ordinary law and try to get from the prejudices of a jury what they are debarred from getting from the prejudices of a county council or city corporation moral reform societies purity societies vigilance societies exist in england and america for the purpose of enforcing the existing laws against obscenity blasphemy sabbathbreaking the debauchery of children prostitution and so forth the paid officials of these societies in their anxiety to produce plenty of evidence of their activity in the annual reports which go out to the subscribers do not always discriminate between an obscene postcard and an artistic one or to put it more exactly between a naked figure and an indecent one they often combine a narrow but terribly sincere sectarian bigotry with a complete ignorance of art and history even when they have some culture their livelihood is at the mercy of subscribers and committee men who have none if these officials had any power of distinguishing between art and blackguardism between morality and virtue between immorality and vice between conscientious heresy and mere baseness of mind and foulness of mouth they might be trusted by theatrical managers not to abuse the powers of the common informer as it is it has been found necessary in order to enable good music to be performed on sunday to take away these powers in that particular and vest them solely in the attorneygeneral this disqualification of the common informer should be extended to the initiation of all proceedings of a censorial character against theatres few people are aware of the monstrous laws against blasphemy which still disgrace our statute book if any serious attempt were made to carry them out prison accommodation would have to be provided for almost every educated person in the country beginning with the archbishop of canterbury until some government with courage and character enough to repeal them comes into power it is not too much to ask that such infamous powers of oppression should be kept in responsible hands and not left at the disposal of every bigot ignorant enough to be unaware of the social dangers of persecution besides the common informer  is not always a sincere bigot who believes he is performing an action of signal merit in silencing and ruining a heretic he is unfortunately just as often a blackmailer who has studied his powers as a common informer in order that he may extort money for refraining from exercising them if the manager is to be responsible he should be made responsible to a responsible functionary to be responsible to every fanatical ignoramus who chooses to prosecute him for exhibiting a cast of the hermes of praxiteles in his vestibule or giving a performance of measure for measure is mere slavery it is made bearable at present by the protection of the lord chamberlains certificate but when that is no longer available the common informer must be disarmed  if the manager is to enjoy security   summary  the general case against censorship as a principle and the particular case against the existing english censorship and against its replacement by a more enlightened one is now complete the following is a recapitulation of the propositions and conclusions contended for  1 the question of censorship or no censorship is a question of high political principle and not of petty policy  2 the toleration of heresy and shocks to morality on the stage and even their protection against the prejudices and superstitions which necessarily enter largely into morality and public opinion are essential to the welfare of the nation  3 the existing censorship of the lord chamberlain does not only intentionally suppress heresy and challenges to morality in their serious and avowed forms but unintentionally gives the special protection of its official licence to the most extreme impropriety that the lowest section of london playgoers will tolerate in theatres especially devoted to their entertainment licensing everything that is popular and forbidding any attempt to change public opinion or morals  4 the lord chamberlains censorship is open to the special objection that its application to political plays is taken to indicate the attitude of the crown on questions of domestic and foreign policy and that it imposes the limits of etiquet on the historical drama  5 a censorship of a more enlightened and independent kind exercised by the most eminent available authorities would prove in practice more disastrous than the censorship of the lord chamberlain because the more eminent its members were the less possible it would be for them to accept the responsibility for heresy or immorality by licensing them and because the many heretical and immoral plays which now pass the lord chamberlain because he does not understand them would be understood and suppressed by a more highly enlightened censorship  6 a reconstructed and enlightened censorship would be armed with summary and effective powers which would stop the evasions by which heretical and immoral plays are now performed in spite of the lord chamberlain and such powers would constitute a tyranny which would ruin the theatre spiritually by driving all independent thinkers from the drama into the uncensored forms of art  7 the work of critically examining all stage plays in their written form and of witnessing their performance in order to see that the sense is not altered by the stage business would even if it were divided among so many officials as to be physically possible be mentally impossible to persons of taste and enlightenment  8 regulation of theatres is an entirely different matter from censorship inasmuch as a theatre being not only a stage but a place licensed for the sale of spirits and a public resort capable of being put to disorderly use and needing special provision for the safety of audiences in cases of fire etc cannot be abandoned wholly to private control and may therefore reasonably be made subject to an annual licence like those now required before allowing premises to be used publicly for music and dancing  9 in order to prevent the powers of the licensing authority being abused so as to constitute a virtual censorship any act transferring the theatres to the control of a licensing authority should be made also a charter of the rights of dramatic authors and managers by the following provisions  a the public prosecutor the attorneygeneral alone should have the right to set the law in operation against the manager of a theatre or the author of a play in respect of the character of the play or entertainment  b no disclosure of the particulars of a theatrical entertainment shall be required before performance  c licences shall not be withheld on the ground that the existence of theatres is dangerous to religion and morals or on the ground that any entertainment given or contemplated is heretical or immoral  d the licensing area shall be no less than that of a county council or city corporation which shall not delegate its licensing powers to any minor local authority or to any official or committee it shall decide all questions affecting the existence of a theatrical licence by vote of the entire body managers lessees and proprietors of theatres shall have the right to plead in person or by counsel against a proposal to withhold a licence and the licence shall not be withheld except for stated reasons the validity of which shall be subject to the judgment of the high courts  e the annual licence once granted shall not be cancelled or suspended unless the manager has been convicted by public prosecution of an offence against the ordinary laws against disorderly housekeeping indecency blasphemy etc except in cases where some structural or sanitary defect in the building necessitates immediate action for the protection of the public against physical injury  f no licence shall be refused on the ground that the proximity of the theatre to a church mission hall school or other place of worship edification instruction or entertainment including another theatre would draw the public away from such places into its own doors   preface resumed  mr george alexanders protest  on the facts mentioned in the foregoing statement and in my evidence before the joint select committee no controversy arose except on one point mr george alexander protested vigorously and indignantly against my admission that theatres like public houses need special control on the ground that they can profit by disorder and are sometimes conducted with that end in view now mr alexander is a famous actormanager and it is very difficult to persuade the public that the more famous an actor manager is the less he is likely to know about any theatre except his own when the committee of 1892 reported i was considered guilty of a perverse paradox when i said that the witness who knew least about the theatre was henry irving yet a moments consideration would have shown that the paradox was a platitude for about quarter of a century irving was confined night after night to his own theatre and his own dressingroom never seeing a play even there because he was himself part of the play producing the works of longdeparted authors and to the extent to which his talent was extraordinary necessarily making his theatre unlike any other theatre when he went to the provinces or to america the theatres to which he went were swept and garnished for him and their staffs replacedas far as he came in contact with themby his own lieutenants in the end there was hardly a firstnighter in his gallery who did not know more about the london theatres and the progress of dramatic art than he and as to the provinces if any chief constable had told him the real history and character of many provincial theatres he would have denounced that chief constable as an ignorant libeller of a noble profession but the constable would have been right for all that now if this was true of sir henry irving who did not become a london manager until he had roughed it for years in the provinces how much more true must it be of say mr george alexander whose successful march through his profession has passed as far from the purlieus of our theatrical world as the kings naval career from the isle of dogs the moment we come to that necessary part of the censorship question which deals with the control of theatres from the point of view of those who know how much money can be made out of them by managers who seek to make the auditorium attractive rather than the stage you find the managers divided into two sections the first section consists of honorable and successful managers like mr alexander who know nothing of such abuses and deny with perfect sincerity and indignant vehemence that they exist except perhaps in certain notorious variety theatres the other is the silent section which knows better but is very well content to be publicly defended and privately amused by mr alexanders innocence to accept a west end manager as an expert in theatres because he is an actor is much as if we were to accept the organist of st pauls cathedral as an expert on music halls because he is a musician the real experts are all in the conspiracy to keep the police out of the theatre and they are so successful that even the police do not know as much as they should  the police should have been examined by the committee and the whole question of the extent to which theatres are disorderly houses in disguise sifted to the bottom for it is on this point that we discover behind the phantoms of the corrupt dramatists who are restrained by the censorship from debauching the stage the reality of the corrupt managers and theatre proprietors who actually do debauch it without let or hindrance from the censorship the whole case for giving control over theatres to local authorities rests on this reality   eliza and her bath  the persistent notion that a theatre is an alsatia where the kings writ does not run and where any wickedness is possible in the absence of a special tribunal and a special police was brought out by an innocent remark made by sir william gilbert who when giving evidence before the committee was asked by colonel lockwood whether a law sufficient to restrain impropriety in books would also restrain impropriety in plays sir william replied i should say there is a very wide distinction between what is read and what is seen in a novel one may read that eliza stripped off her dressinggown and stepped into her bath without any harm but i think if that were presented on the stage it would be shocking all the stupid and inconsiderate people seized eagerly on this illustration as if it were a successful attempt to prove that without a censorship we should be unable to prevent actresses from appearing naked on the stage as a matter of fact if an actress could be persuaded to do such a thing and it would be about as easy to persuade a bishops wife to appear in church in the same condition the police would simply arrest her on a charge of indecent exposure the extent to which this obvious safeguard was overlooked may be taken as a measure of the thoughtlessness and frivolity of the excuses made for the censorship it should be added that the artistic representation of a bath with every suggestion of nakedness that the law as to decency allows is one of the most familiar subjects of scenic art from the rhine maidens in wagners trilogy and the bathers in the second act of les huguenots to the ballets of water nymphs in our christmas pantomimes and at our variety theatres the sound hygienic propaganda of the bath and the charm of the undraped human figure are exploited without offence on the stage to an extent never dreamt of by any novelist   a kings proctor  another hare was started by professor gilbert murray and mr laurence housman who in pure kindness to the managers asked whether it would not be possible to establish for their assistance a sort of kings proctor to whom plays might be referred for an official legal opinion as to their compliance with the law before production there are several objections to this proposal and they may as well be stated in case the proposal should be revived in the first place no lawyer with the most elementary knowledge of the law of libel in its various applications to sedition obscenity and blasphemy could answer for the consequences of producing any play whatsoever as to which the smallest question could arise in the mind of any sane person i have been a critic and an author in active service for thirty years and though nothing i have written has ever been prosecuted in england or made the subject of legal proceedings yet i have never published in my life an article a play or a book as to which if i had taken legal advice an expert could have assured me that i was proof against prosecution or against an action for damages by the persons criticized no doubt a sensible solicitor might have advised me that the risk was no greater than all men have to take in dangerous trades but such an opinion though it may encourage a client does not protect him for example if a publisher asks his solicitor whether he may venture on an edition of sternes sentimental journey or a manager whether he may produce king lear without risk of prosecution the solicitor will advise him to go ahead but if the solicitor or counsel consulted by him were asked for a guarantee that neither of these works was a libel he would have to reply that he could give no such guarantee that on the contrary it was his duty to warn his client that both of them are obscene libels that king lear containing as it does perhaps the most appalling blasphemy that despair ever uttered is a blasphemous libel and that it is doubtful whether it could not be construed as a seditious libel as well as to ibsens brand the play which made him popular with the most earnestly religious people no sane solicitor would advise his client even to chance it except in a broadly cultivated and tolerant or indifferent modern city the lighter plays would be no better off what lawyer could accept any responsibility for the production of sardous divorcons or clyde fitchs the woman in the case put the proposed kings proctor in operation tomorrow and what will be the result the managers will find that instead of insuring them as the lord chamberlain does he will warn them that every play they submit to him is vulnerable to the law and that they must produce it not only on the ordinary risk of acting on their own responsibility but at the very grave additional risk of doing so in the teeth of an official warning under such circumstances what manager would resort a second time to the proctor and how would the proctor live without fees unless indeed the government gave him a salary for doing nothing the institution would not last a year except as a job for somebody   counsels opinion  the proposal is still less plausible when it is considered that at present without any new legislation at all any manager who is doubtful about a play can obtain the advice of his solicitor or counsels opinion if he thinks it will be of any service to him the verdict of the proposed kings proctor would be nothing but counsels opinion without the liberty of choice of counsel possibly cheapened but sure to be adverse for an official cannot give practical advice as a friend and a man of the world he must stick to the letter of the law and take no chances and as far as the law is concerned journalism literature and the drama exist only by custom or sufferance   wanted a new magna charta  this leads us to a very vital question is it not possible to amend the law so as to make it possible for a lawyer to advise his client that he may publish the works of blake zola and swinburne or produce the plays of ibsen and mr granville barker or print an ordinary criticism in his newspaper without the possibility of finding himself in prison or mulcted in damages and costs in consequence no doubt it is but only by a declaration of constitutional right to blaspheme rebel and deal with tabooed subjects such a declaration is not just now within the scope of practical politics although we are compelled to act to a great extent as if it was actually part of the constitution all that can be done is to take my advice and limit the necessary public control of the theatres in such a manner as to prevent its being abused as a censorship we have ready to our hand the machinery of licensing as applied to publichouses a licensed victualler can now be assured confidently by his lawyer that a magistrate cannot refuse to renew his licence on the ground that he the magistrate is a teetotaller and has seen too much of the evil of drink to sanction its sale the magistrate must give a judicial reason for his refusal meaning really a constitutional reason and his teetotalism is not such a reason in the same way you can protect a theatrical manager by ruling out certain reasons as unconstitutional as suggested in my statement combine this with the abolition of the common informers power to initiate proceedings and you will have gone as far as seems possible at present you will have local control of the theatres for police purposes and sanitary purposes without censorship and i do not see what more is possible until we get a formal magna charta declaring all the categories of libel and the blasphemy laws contrary to public liberty and repealing and defining accordingly   proposed a new star chamber  yet we cannot mention magna charta without recalling how useless such documents are to a nation which has no more political comprehension nor political virtue than king john when henry vii calmly proceeded to tear up magna charta by establishing the star chamber a criminal court consisting of a committee of the privy council without a jury nobody objected until about a century and a half later the star chamber began cutting off the ears of eminent xvii century nonconformists and standing them in the pillory and then the nonconformists and nobody else abolished the star chamber and if anyone doubts that we are quite ready to establish the star chamber again let him read the report of the joint select committee on which i now venture to offer a few criticisms  the report of the committee which will be found in the bluebook should be read with attention and respect as far as page x up to which point it is an able and wellwritten statement of the case from page x onward when it goes on from diagnosing the disease to prescribing the treatment it should be read with even greater attention but with no respect whatever as the main object of the treatment is to conciliate the how not to do it majority it contains however one very notable proposal the same being nothing more or less than to revive the star chamber for the purpose of dealing with heretical or seditious plays and their authors and indeed with all charges against theatrical entertainments except common police cases of indecency the reason given is that for which the star chamber was created by henry vii that is the inadequacy of the ordinary law we consider says the report that the law which prevents or punishes indecency blasphemy and libel in printed publications it does not by the way except in the crudest police cases would not be adequate for the control of the drama therefore a committee of the privy council is to be empowered to suppress plays and punish managers and authors at its pleasure on the motion of the attorneygeneral without a jury the members of the committee will of course be men of high standing and character otherwise they would not be on the privy council that is to say they will have all the qualifications of archbishop laud  now i have no guarantee that any member of the majority of the joint select committee ever heard of the star chamber or of archbishop laud one of them did not know that politics meant anything more than party electioneering nothing is more alarming than the ignorance of our public men of the commonplaces of our history and their consequent readiness to repeat experiments which have in the past produced national catastrophes at all events whether they knew what they were doing or not there can be no question as to what they did they proposed virtually that the act of the long parliament in 1641 shall be repealed and the star chamber reestablished in order that playwrights and managers may be punished for unspecified offences unknown to the law when i say unspecified i should say specified as follows see page xi of the report in the case of a play  a to be indecent  b to contain offensive personalities  c to represent on the stage in an invidious manner a living person or any person recently dead  d to do violence to the sentiment of religious reverence  e to be calculated to conduce to vice or crime  f to be calculated to impair friendly relations with any foreign power  g to be calculated to cause a breach of the peace  now it is clear that there is no play yet written or possible to be written in this world that might not be condemned under one or other of these heads how any sane man not being a professed enemy of public liberty could put his hand to so monstrous a catalogue passes my understanding had a comparatively definite and innocent clause been added forbidding the affirmation or denial of the doctrine of transubstantiation the country would have been up in arms at once lord ribblesdale made an effort to reduce the seven categories to the old formula not to be fitting for the preservation of good manners decorum or the public peace but this proposal was not carried whilst on lord gorells motion a final widening of the net was achieved by adding the phrase to be calculated to so that even if a play does not produce any of the results feared the author can still be punished on the ground that his play is calculated to produce them i have no hesitation in saying that a committee capable of such an outrageous display of thoughtlessness and historical ignorance as this paragraph of its report implies deserves to be haled before the tribunal it has itself proposed and dealt with under a general clause levelled at conduct calculated to overthrow the liberties of england   possibilities of the proposal  still though i am certainly not willing to give lord gorell the chance of seeing me in the pillory with my ears cut off if i can help it i daresay many authors would rather take their chance with a star chamber than with a jury just as some soldiers would rather take their chance with a courtmartial than at quarter sessions for that matter some of them would rather take their chance with the lord chamberlain than with either and though this is no reason for depriving the whole body of authors of the benefit of magna charta still if the right of the proprietor of a play to refuse the good offices of the privy council and to perform the play until his accusers had indicted him at law and obtained the verdict of a jury against him were sufficiently guarded the proposed committee might be set up and used for certain purposes for instance it might be made a condition of the intervention of the attorneygeneral or the director of public prosecutions that he should refer an accused play to the committee and obtain their sanction before taking action offering the proprietor of the play if the committee thought fit an opportunity of voluntarily accepting trial by the committee as an alternative to prosecution in the ordinary course of law but the committee should have no powers of punishment beyond the power formidable enough of suspending performances of the play if it thought that additional punishment was called for it could order a prosecution without allowing the proprietor or author of the play the alternative of a trial by itself the author of the play should be made a party to all proceedings of the committee and have the right to defend himself in person or by counsel this would provide a check on the attorneygeneral who might be as bigoted as any of the municipal aldermen who are so much dreaded by the actormanagers without enabling the committee to abuse its powers for party class or sectarian ends beyond that irreducible minimum of abuse which a popular jury would endorse for which minimum there is no remedy  but when everything is said for the star chamber that can be said and every precaution taken to secure to those whom it pursues the alternative of trial by jury the expedient still remains a very questionable one to be endured for the sake of its protective rather than its repressive powers it should abolish the present quaint toleration of rioting in theatres for example if it is to be an offence to perform a play which the proposed new committee shall condemn it should also be made an offence to disturb a performance which the committee has not condemned brawling at a theatre should be dealt with as severely as brawling in church if the censorship is to be taken out of the hands of the public at present jenny geddes may throw her stool at the head of a playwright who preaches unpalatable doctrine to her or rather since her stool is a fixture she may hiss and hoot and make it impossible to proceed with the performance even although nobody has compelled her to come to the theatre or suspended her liberty to stay away and although she has no claim on an unendowed theatre for her spiritual necessities as she has on her parish church if mob censorship cannot be trusted to keep naughty playwrights in order still less can it be trusted to keep the pioneers of thought in countenance and i submit that anyone hissing a play permitted by the new censorship should be guilty of contempt of court   star chamber sentimentality  but what is most to be dreaded in a star chamber is not its sternness but its sentimentality there is no worse censorship than one which considers only the feelings  of the spectators except perhaps one which considers the feelings of people who do not even witness the performance take the case of the passion play at oberammergau the offence given by a representation of the crucifixion on the stage is not bounded by frontiers further it is an offence of which the voluntary spectators are guilty no less than the actors if it is to be tolerated at all if we are not to make war on the german empire for permitting it nor punish the english people who go to bavaria to see it and thereby endow it with english money we may as well tolerate it in london where nobody need go to see it except those who are not offended by it when wagners parsifal becomes available for representation in london many people will be sincerely horrified when the miracle of the mass is simulated on the stage of covent garden and the holy ghost descends in the form of a dove but if the committee of the privy council or the lord chamberlain or anyone else were to attempt to keep parsifal from us to spare the feelings of these people it would not be long before even the most thoughtless champions of the censorship would see that the principle of doing nothing that could shock anybody had reduced itself to absurdity no quarter whatever should be given to the bigotry of people so unfit for social life as to insist not only that their own prejudices and superstitions should have the fullest toleration but that everybody else should be compelled to think and act as they do every service in st pauls cathedral is an outrage to the opinions of the congregation of the roman catholic cathedral of westminster every liberal meeting is a defiance and a challenge to the most cherished opinions of the unionists a law to compel the roman catholics to attend service at st pauls or the liberals to attend the meetings of the primrose league would be resented as an insufferable tyranny but a law to shut up both st pauls and the westminster cathedral and to put down political meetings and associations because of the offence given by them to many worthy and excellent people would be a far worse tyranny because it would kill the religious and political life of the country outright whereas to compel people to attend the services and meetings of their opponents would greatly enlarge their minds and would actually be a good thing if it were enforced all round i should not object to a law to compel everybody to read two newspapers each violently opposed to the other in politics but to forbid us to read newspapers at all would be to maim us mentally and cashier our country in the ranks of civilization i deny that anybody has the right to demand more from me over and above lawful conduct in a general sense than liberty to stay away from the theatre in which my plays are represented if he is unfortunate enough to have a religion so petty that it can be insulted any man is as welcome to insult my religion if he can as he is to insult the universe i claim the right to insult it to my hearts content if i choose provided i do not compel him to come and hear me if i think this country ought to make war on any other country then so long as war remains lawful i claim full liberty to write and perform a play inciting the country to that war without interference from the ambassadors of the menaced country i may give pain to many worthy people and pleasure to none as the censors pet phrase puts it i may even make europe a cockpit and asia a shambles no matter if preachers and politicians statesmen and soldiers may do these thingsif it is right that such things should be done then i claim my share in the right to do them if the proposed committee is meant to prevent me from doing these things whilst men of other professions are permitted to do them then i protest with all my might against the formation of such a committee if it is to protect me on the contrary against the attacks that bigots and corrupt pornographers may make on me by appealing to the ignorance and prejudices of common jurors then i welcome it but is that really the object of its proposers and if it is what guarantee have i that the new tribunal will not presently resolve into a mere committee to avoid unpleasantness and keep the stage in good taste it is no more possible for me to do my work honestly as a playwright without giving pain than it is for a dentist the nations morals are like its teeth the more decayed they are the more it hurts to touch them prevent dentists and dramatists from giving pain and not only will our morals become as carious as our teeth but toothache and the plagues that follow neglected morality will presently cause more agony than all the dentists and dramatists at their worst have caused since the world began   anything for a quiet life  another doubt would a committee of the privy council really face the risks that must be taken by all communities as the price of our freedom to evolve would it not rather take the popular english view that freedom and virtue generally are sweet and desirable only when they cost nothing nothing worth having is to be had without risk a mother risks her childs life every time she lets it ramble through the countryside or cross the street or clamber over the rocks on the shore by itself a father risks his sons morals when he gives him a latchkey the members of the joint select committee risked my producing a revolver and shooting them when they admitted me to the room without having me handcuffed and these risks are no unreal ones every day some child is maimed or drowned and some young man infected with disease and political assassinations have been appallingly frequent of late years railway travelling has its risks motoring has its risks aeroplaning has its risks every advance we make costs us a risk of some sort and though these are only risks to the individual to the community they are certainties it is not certain that i will be killed this year in a railway accident but it is certain that somebody will the invention of printing and the freedom of the press have brought upon us not merely risks of their abuse but the establishment as part of our social routine of some of the worst evils a community can suffer from people who realize these evils shriek for the suppression of motor cars the virtual imprisonment and enslavement of the young the passing of press laws especially in egypt india and ireland exactly as they shriek for a censorship of the stage the freedom of the stage will be abused just as certainly as the complaisance and innocence of the censorship is abused at present it will also be used by writers like myself for raising very difficult and disturbing questions social political and religious at moments which may be extremely inconvenient to the government is it certain that a committee of the privy council would stand up to all this as the price of liberty i doubt it if i am to be at the mercy of a nice amiable committee of elderly gentlemen i know all about elderly gentlemen being one myself whose motto is the highly popular one anything for a quiet life and who will make the inevitable abuses of freedom by our blackguards an excuse for interfering with any disquieting use of it by myself then i shall be worse off than i am with the lord chamberlain whose mind is not broad enough to obstruct the whole range of thought if it were he would be given a more difficult post   shall the examiner of plays starve  and here i may be reminded that if i prefer the lord chamberlain i can go to the lord chamberlain who is to retain all his present functions for the benefit of those who prefer to be judged by him but i am not so sure that the lord chamberlain will be able to exercise those functions for long if resort to him is to be optional let me be kinder to him than he has been to me and uncover for him the pitfalls which the joint select committee have dug and concealed in his path consider how the voluntary system must inevitably work the joint select committee expressly urges that the lord chamberlains licence must not be a bar to a prosecution granted that in spite of this reservation the licence would prove in future as powerful a defence as it has been in the past yet the voluntary clause nevertheless places the manager at the mercy of any author who makes it a condition of his contract that his play shall not be submitted for licence i should probably take that course without opposition from the manager for the manager knowing that three of my plays have been refused a licence and that it would be far safer to produce a play for which no licence had been asked than one for which it had been asked and refused would agree that it was more prudent in my case to avail himself of the power of dispensing with the lord chamberlains  licence but now mark the consequences the manager having thus discovered that his best policy was to dispense with the licence in the few doubtful cases would presently ask himself why he should spend two guineas each on licences for the many plays as to which no question could conceivably arise what risk does any manager run in producing such works as sweet lavender peter pan the silver king or any of the 99 per cent of plays that are equally neutral on controversial questions does anyone seriously believe that the managers would continue to pay the lord chamberlain two guineas a play out of mere love and loyalty only to create an additional risk in the case of controversial plays and to guard against risks that do not exist in the case of the great bulk of other productions only those would remain faithful to him who produce such plays as the select committee began by discussing in camera and ended by refusing to discuss at all because they were too nasty these people would still try to get a licence and would still no doubt succeed as they do today but could the kings reader of plays live on his fees from these plays alone and if he could how long would his post survive the discredit of licensing only pornographic plays it is clear to me that the examiner would be starved out of existence and the censorship perish of desuetude perhaps that is exactly what the select committee contemplated if so i have nothing more to say except that i think sudden death would be more merciful   lord gorells awakening  in the meantime conceive the situation which would arise if a licensed play were prosecuted to make it clearer let us imagine any other offendersay a company promoter with a fraudulent prospectuspleading in court that he had induced the lord chamberlain to issue a certificate that the prospectus contained nothing objectionable and that on the strength of that certificate he issued it also that by law the court could do nothing to him except order him to wind up his company some such vision as this must have come to lord gorell when he at last grappled seriously with the problem mr harcourt seized the opportunity to make a last rally he seconded lord gorells proposal that the committee should admit that its scheme of an optional censorship was an elaborate absurdity and report that all censorship before production was out of the question but it was too late the volte face was too sudden and complete it was lord gorell whose vote had turned the close division which took place on the question of receiving my statement it was lord gorell without whose countenance and authority the farce of the books could never have been performed yet here was lord gorell after assenting to all the provisions for the optional censorship paragraph by paragraph suddenly informing his colleagues that they had been wrong all through and that i had been right all through and inviting them to scrap half their work and adopt my conclusion no wonder lord gorell got only one vote that of mr harcourt but the incident is not the less significant lord gorell carried more weight than any other member of the committee on the legal and constitutional aspect of the question had he begun where he left offhad he at the outset put down his foot on the notion that an optional penal law could ever be anything but a gross contradiction in terms that part of the committees proposals would never have come into existence   judges their professional limitations  i do not however appeal to lord gorells judgment on all points it is inevitable that a judge should be deeply impressed by his professional experience with a sense of the impotence of judges and laws and courts to deal satisfactorily with evils which are so protean and elusive as to defy definition and which yet seem to present quite simple problems to the common sense of men of the world you have only to imagine the privy council as consisting of men of the world highly endowed with common sense to persuade yourself that the supplementing of the law by the common sense of the privy council would settle the whole difficulty but no man knows what he means by common sense though every man can tell you that it is very uncommon even in privy councils and since every ploughman is a man of the world it is evident that even the phrase itself does not mean what it says as a matter of fact it means in ordinary use simply a man who will not make himself disagreeable for the sake of a principle just the sort of man who should never be allowed to meddle with political rights now to a judge a political right that is a dogma which is above our laws and conditions our laws instead of being subject to them is anarchic and abhorrent that is why i trust lord gorell when he is defending the integrity of the law against the proposal to make it in any sense optional whilst i very strongly mistrust him as i mistrust all professional judges when political rights are in danger   conclusion  i must conclude by recommending the government to take my advice wherever it conflicts with that of the joint select committee it is i think obviously more deeply considered and better informed though i say it that should not at all events i have given my reasons and at that i must leave it as the tradition which makes malvolio not only master of the revels but master of the mind of england and which has come down to us from henry viii is manifestly doomed to the dustbin the sooner it goes there the better for the democratic control which naturally succeeds it can easily be limited so as to prevent it becoming either a censorship or a tyranny the examiner of plays should receive a generous pension and be set free to practise privately as an expert adviser of theatrical managers there is no reason why they should be deprived of the counsel they so highly value  it only remains to say that public performances of the shewingup of blanco posnet are still prohibited in great britain by the lord chamberlain an attempt was made to prevent even its performance in ireland by some indiscreet castle officials in the absence of the lord lieutenant this attempt gave extraordinary publicity to the production of the play and every possible effort was made to persuade the irish public that the performance would be an outrage to their religion and to provoke a repetition of the rioting that attended the first performances of synges playboy of the western world before the most sensitive and on provocation the most turbulent audience in the kingdom the directors of the irish national theatre lady gregory and mr william butler yeats rose to the occasion with inspiriting courage i am a conciliatory person and was willing as i always am to make every concession in return for having my own way but lady gregory and mr yeats not only would not yield an inch but insisted within the due limits of gallant warfare on taking the field with every circumstance of defiance and winning the battle with every trophy of victory their triumph was as complete as they could have desired the performance exhausted the possibilities of success and provoked no murmur though it inspired several approving sermons later on lady gregory and mr yeats brought the play to london and performed it under the lord chamberlains nose through the instrumentality of the stage society  after this the play was again submitted to the lord chamberlain but though beaten he too understands the art of how not to do it he licensed the play but endorsed on his licence the condition that all the passages which implicated god in the history of blanco posnet must be omitted in representation all the coarseness the profligacy the prostitution the violence the drinkingbar humor into which the light shines in the play are licensed but the light itself is extinguished i need hardly say that i have not availed myself of this licence and do not intend to there is enough licensed darkness in our theatres today without my adding to it  ayot st lawrence 14th july 1910  postscriptsince the above was written the lord chamberlain has made an attempt to evade his responsibility and perhaps to postpone his doom by appointing an advisory committee unknown to the law on which he will presumably throw any odium that may attach to refusals of licences in the future this strange and lawless body will hardly reassure our moralists who object much more to the plays he licenses than to those he suppresses and are therefore unmoved by his plea that his refusals are few and far between it consists of two eminent actors one retired an oxford professor of literature and two eminent barristers as their assembly is neither created by statute nor sanctioned by custom it is difficult to know what to call it until it advises the lord chamberlain to deprive some author of his means of livelihood when it will i presume become a conspiracy and be indictable accordingly unless indeed it can persuade the courts to recognize it as a new estate of the realm created by the lord chamberlain this constitutional position is so questionable that i strongly advise the members to resign promptly before the lord chamberlain gets them into trouble    the shewingup of blanco posnet  a number of women are sitting working together in a big room not unlike an old english tithe barn in its timbered construction but with windows high up next the roof it is furnished as a courthouse with the floor raised next the walls and on this raised flooring a seat for the sheriff a rough jury box on his right and a bar to put prisoners to on his left in the well in the middle is a table with benches round it a few other benches are in disorder round the room the autumn sun is shining warmly through the windows and the open door the women whose dress and speech are those of pioneers of civilisation in a territory of the united states of america are seated round the table and on the benches shucking nuts the conversation is at its height  babsy a bumptious young slattern with some good looks i say that a man that would steal a horse would do anything  lottie a sentimental girl neat and clean well i never should look at it in that way i do think killing a man is worse any day than stealing a horse  hannah elderly and wise i dont say its right to kill a man in a place like this where every man has to have a revolver and where theres so much to try peoples tempers the men get to be a deal too free with one another in the way of shooting god knows its hard enough to have to bring a boy into the world and nurse him up to be a man only to have him brought home to you on a shutter perhaps for nothing or only just to shew that the man that killed him wasnt afraid of him but men are like children when they get a gun in their hands theyre not content til theyve used it on somebody  jessie a goodnatured but sharptongued hoitytoity young woman babsys rival in good looks and her superior in tidiness they shoot for the love of it look at them at a lynching theyre not content to hang the man but directly the poor creature is swung up they all shoot him full of holes wasting their cartridges that cost solid money and pretending they do it in horror of his wickedness though half of them would have a rope round their own necks if all they did was knownlet alone the mess it makes  lottie i wish we could get more civilized i dont like all this lynching and shooting i dont believe any of us like it if the truth were known  babsy our sheriff is a real strong man you want a strong man for a rough lot like our people here he aint afraid to shoot and he aint afraid to hang lucky for us quiet ones too  jessie oh dont talk to me i know what men are of course he aint afraid to shoot and he aint afraid to hang wheres the risk in that with the law on his side and the whole crowd at his back longing for the lynching as if it was a spree would one of them own to it or let him own to it if they lynched the wrong man not them what they call justice in this place is nothing but a breaking out of the devil thats in all of us what i want to see is a sheriff that aint afraid not to shoot and not to hang  emma a sneak who sides with babsy or jessie according to the fortune of war well i must say it does sicken me to see sheriff kemp putting down his foot as he calls it why dont he put it down on his wife she wants it worse than half the men he lynches he and his vigilance committee indeed  babsy incensed oh well if people are going to take the part of horsethieves against the sheriff  jessie whos taking the part of horsethieves against the sheriff  babsy you are waitle your own horse is stolen and youll know better i had an uncle that died of thirst in the sage brush because a negro stole his horse but they caught him and burned him and serve him right too  emma i have known that a child was born crooked because its mother had to do a horses work that was stolen  babsy there you hear that i say stealing a horse is ten times worse than killing a man and if the vigilance committee ever gets hold of you youd better have killed twenty men than as much as stole a saddle or bridle much less a horse  elder daniels comes in  elder daniels sorry to disturb you ladies but the vigilance committee has taken a prisoner and they want the room to try him in  jessie but they cant try him til sheriff kemp comes back from the wharf  elder daniels yes but we have to keep the prisoner here til he comes  babsy what do you want to put him here for cant you tie him up in the sheriffs stable  elder daniels he has a soul to be saved almost like the rest of us i am bound to try to put some religion into him before he goes into his makers presence after the trial  hannah what has he done mr daniels  elder daniels stole a horse  babsy and are we to be turned out of the town hall for a horse thief aint a stable good enough for his religion  elder daniels it may be good enough for his babsy but by your leave it is not good enough for mine while i am elder here i shall umbly endeavour to keep up the dignity of him i serve to the best of my small ability so i must ask you to be good enough to clear out allow me he takes the sack of husks and put it out of the way against the panels of the jury box  the women murmuring thats always the way just as wed settled down to work what harm are we doing well it is tiresome let them finish the job themselves oh dear oh dear we cant have a minute to ourselves shoving us out like that  hannah whose horse was it mr daniels  elder daniels returning to move the other sack i am sorry to say that it was the sheriffs horsethe one he loaned to young strapper strapper loaned it to me and the thief stole it thinking it was mine if it had been mine id have forgiven him cheerfully im sure i hoped he would get away for he had two hours start of the vigilance committee but they caught him he disposes of the other sack also  jessie it cant have been much of a horse if they caught him with two hours start  elder daniels coming back to the centre of the group the strange thing is that he wasnt on the horse when they took him he was walking and of course he denies that he ever had the horse the sheriffs brother wanted to tie him up and lash him till he confessed what hed done with it but i couldnt allow that its not the law  babsy law what right has a horsethief to any law law is thrown away on a brute like that  elder daniels dont say that babsy no man should be made to confess by cruelty until religion has been tried and failed please god ill get the whereabouts of the horse from him if youll be so good as to clear out from this disturbance outside they are bringing him in now ladies please please  they rise reluctantly hannah jessie and lottie retreat to the sheriffs bench shepherded by daniels but the other women crowd forward behind babsy and emma to see the prisoner  blanco posnet it brought in by strapper kemp the sheriffs brother and a crosseyed man called squinty others follow blanco is evidently a blackguard it would be necessary to clean him to make a close guess at his age but he is under forty and an upturned red moustache and the arrangement of his hair in a crest on his brow proclaim the dandy in spite of his intense disreputableness he carries his head high and has a fairly resolute mouth though the fire of incipient delirium tremens is in his eye  his arms are bound with a rope with a long end which squinty holds they release him when he enters and he stretches himself and lounges across the courthouse in front of the women strapper and the men remain between him and the door  babsy spitting at him as he passes her horsethief horse thief  others you will hang for it do you hear and serve you right serve you right that will teach you i wouldnt wait to try you lynch him straight off the varmint yes yes tell the boys lynch him  blanco mocking angels ever bright and fair  babsy you call me an angel and ill smack your dirty face for you  blanco take oh take me to your care  emma there wont be any angels where youre going to  others aha devils more likely and too good company for a horsethief  all horsethief horsethief horsethief  blanco do women make the law here or men drive these heifers out  the women oh they rush at him vituperating screaming passionately tearing at him lottie puts her fingers in her ears and runs out hannah follows shaking her head blanco is thrown down oh did you hear what he called us you foulmouthed brute you liar how dare you put such a name to a decent woman let me get at him you coward oh he struck me did you see that lynch him pete will you stand by and hear me called names by a skunk like that burn him burn him thats what id do with him aye burn him  the men pulling the women away from blanco and getting them out partly by violence and partly by coaxing here come out of this let him alone clear the courthouse come on now out with you now sally out you go let go my hair or ill twist your arm out ah would you now then get along you know you must go whats the use of scratching like that now ladies ladies ladies how would you like it if you were going to be hanged  at last the women are pushed out leaving elder daniels the sheriffs brother strapper kemp and a few others with blanco strapper is a lad just turning into a man strong selfish sulky and determined  blanco sitting up and tidying himself       oh woman in our hours of ease      uncertain coy and hard to please  is my face scratched i can feel their damned claws all over me still am i bleeding he sits on the nearest  bench  elder daniels nothing to hurt theyve drawn a drop or two under your left eye  strapper lucky for you to have an eye left in your head  blanco wiping the blood off      when pain and anguish wring the brow     a ministering angel thou  go out to them strapper kemp and tell them about your big brothers little horse that some wicked man stole go and cry in your mammys lap  strapper furious you jounce me any more about that horse blanco posnet and illill  blanco youll scratch my face wont you yah your brothers the sheriff aint he  strapper yes he is he hangs horsethieves  blanco with calm conviction hes a rotten sheriff oh a rotten sheriff if he did his first duty hed hang himself this is a rotten town your fathers came here on a false alarm of gold digging and when the gold didnt pan out they lived by licking their young into habits of honest industry  strapper if i hadnt promised elder daniels here to give him a chance to keep you out of hell id take the job of twisting your neck off the hands of the vigilance committee  blanco with infinite scorn you and your rotten elder and your rotten vigilance committee  strapper theyre sound enough to hang a horsethief anyhow  blanco any fool can hang the wisest man in the country nothing he likes better but you cant hang me  strapper cant we  blanco no you cant i left the town this morning before sunrise because its a rotten town and i couldnt bear to see it in the light your brothers horse did the same as any sensible horse would instead of going to look for the horse you went looking for me that was a rotten thing to do because the horse belonged to your brotheror to the man he stole it from and i dont belong to him well you found me but you didnt find the horse if i had took the horse id have been on the horse would i have taken all that time to get to where i did if id a horse to carry me  strapper i dont believe you started not for two hours after you say you did  blanco who cares what you believe or dont believe is a man worth six of you to be hanged because youve lost your big brothers horse and youll want to kill somebody to relieve your rotten feelings when he licks you for it not likely till you can find a witness that saw me with that horse you cant touch me and you know it  strapper is that the law elder  elder daniels the sheriff knows the law i wouldnt say for sure but i think it would be more seemly to have a witness go and round one up strapper and leave me here alone to wrestle with his poor blinded soul  strapper ill get a witness all right enough i know the road he took and ill ask at every house within sight of it for a mile out come boys  strapper goes out with the others leaving blanco and elder daniels together blanco rises and strolls over to the elder surveying him with extreme disparagement  blanco well brother well boozy posnet alias elder daniels well thief well drunkard  elder daniels its no good blanco theyll never believe were brothers  blanco never fear do you suppose i want to claim you do you suppose im proud of you youre a rotten brother boozy posnet all you ever did when i owned you was to borrow money from me to get drunk with now you lend money and sell drink to other people i was ashamed of you before and im worse ashamed of you now i wont have you for a brother heaven gave you to me but i return the blessing without thanks so be easy i shant blab he turns his back on him and sits down  elder daniels i tell you they wouldnt believe you so what does it matter to me whether you blab or not talk sense blanco theres no time for your foolery now for youll be a dead man an hour after the sheriff comes back what possessed you to steal that horse  blanco i didnt steal it i distrained on it for what you owed me i thought it was yours i was a fool to think that you owned anything but other peoples property you laid your hands on everything father and mother had when they died i never asked you for a fair share i never asked you for all the money id lent you from time to time i asked you for mothers old necklace with the hair locket in it you wouldnt give me that you wouldnt give me anything so as you refused me my due i took it just to give you a lesson  elder daniels why didnt you take the necklace if you must steal something they wouldnt have hanged you for that  blanco perhaps id rather be hanged for stealing a horse than let off for a damned piece of sentimentality  elder daniels oh blanco blanco spiritual pride has been your ruin if youd only done like me youd be a free and respectable man this day instead of laying there with a rope round your neck  blanco turning on him done like you what do you mean drink like you eh well ive done some of that lately i see things  elder daniels too late blanco too late convulsively oh why didnt you drink as i used to why didnt you drink as i was led to by the lord for my good until the time came for me to give it up it was drink that saved my character when i was a young man and it was the want of it that spoiled yours tell me this did i ever get drunk when i was working  blanco no but then you never worked when you had money enough to get drunk  elder daniels that just shews the wisdom of providence and the lords mercy god fulfils himself in many ways ways we little think of when we try to set up our own shortsighted laws against his word when does the devil catch hold of a man not when hes working and not when hes drunk but when hes idle and sober our own natures tell us to drink when we have nothing else to do look at you and me when wed both earned a pocketful of money what did we do went on the spree naturally but i was humble minded i did as the rest did i gave my money in at the drink shop and i said fire me out when i have drunk it all up did you ever see me sober while it lasted  blanco no and you looked so disgusting that i wonder it didnt set me against drink for the rest of my life  elder daniels that was your spiritual pride blanco you never reflected that when i was drunk i was in a state of innocence temptations and bad company and evil thoughts passed by me like the summer wind as you might say i was too drunk to notice them when the money was gone and they fired me out i was fired out like gold out of the furnace with my character unspoiled and unspotted and when i went back to work the work kept me steady can you say as much blanco did your holidays leave your character unspoiled oh no no it was theatres it was gambling it was evil company it was reading in vain romances it was women blanco women it was wrong thoughts and gnawing discontent it ended in your becoming a rambler and a gambler it is going to end this evening on the gallows tree oh what a lesson against spiritual pride oh what ablanco throws his hat at him  blanco stow it boozy sling it cut it cheese it shut up shake not the dying sinners hand  elder daniels aye there you go with your scraps of lustful poetry but you cant deny what i tell you why do you think i would put my soul in peril by selling drink if i thought it did no good as them silly temperance reformers make out flying in the face of the natural tastes implanted in us all for a good purpose not if i was to starve for it tomorrow but i know better i tell you blanco what keeps america today the purest of the nations is that when shes not working shes too drunk to hear the voice of the tempter  blanco dont deceive yourself boozy you sell drink because you make a bigger profit out of it than you can by selling tea and you gave up drink yourself because when you got that fit at edwardstown the doctor told you youd die the next time and that frightened you off it  elder daniels fervently oh thank god selling drink pays me and thank god he sent me that fit as a warning that my drinking time was past and gone and that he needed me for another service  blanco take care boozy he hasnt finished with you yet he always has a trick up his sleeve  elder daniels oh is that the way to speak of the ruler of the universethe great and almighty god  blanco hes a sly one hes a mean one he lies low for you he plays cat and mouse with you he lets you run loose until you think youre shut of him and then when you least expect it hes got you  elder daniels speak more respectful blancomore reverent  blanco springing up and coming at him reverent who taught you your reverent cant not your bible it says he cometh like a thief in the nightaye like a thiefa horsethief  elder daniels shocked oh  blanco overhearing him and its true thats how he caught me and put my neck into the halter to spite me because i had no use for himbecause i lived my own life in my own way and would have no truck with his dont do this and you mustnt do that and youll go to hell if you do the other i gave him the gobye and did without him all these years but he caught me out at last the laugh is with him as far as hanging me goes he thrusts his hands into his pockets and lounges moodily away from daniels to the table where he sits facing the jury box  elder daniels dont dare to put your theft on him man it was the devil tempted you to steal the horse  blanco not a bit of it neither god nor devil tempted me to take the horse i took it on my own he had a cleverer trick than that ready for me he takes his hands out of his pockets and clenches his fists gosh when i think that i might have been safe and fifty miles away by now with that horse and here i am waiting to be hung up and filled with lead what came to me what made me such a fool thats what i want to know thats the great secret  elder daniels at the opposite side of the table blanco the great secret now is what did you do with the horse  blanco striking the table with his fist may my lips be blighted like my soul if ever i tell that to you or any mortal men they may roast me alive or cut me to ribbons but strapper kemp shall never have the laugh on me over that job let them hang me let them shoot so long as they are shooting a man and not a sniveling skunk and softy i can stand up to them and take all they can give megame  elder daniels dont be headstrong blanco whats the use slyly they might let up on you if you put strapper in the way of getting his brothers horse back  blanco not they hangings too big a treat for them to give up a fair chance ive done it myself ive yelled with the dirtiest of them when a man no worse than myself was swung up ive emptied my revolver into him and persuaded myself that he deserved it and that i was doing justice with strong stern men well my turns come now let the men i yelled at and shot at look up out of hell and see the boys yelling and shooting at me as i swing up  elder daniels well even if you want to be hanged is that any reason why strapper shouldnt have his horse i tell you im responsible to him for it bending over the table and coaxing him act like a brother blanco tell me what you done with it  blanco shortly getting up and leaving the table never you mind what i done with it i was done out of it let that be enough for you  elder daniels following him then why dont you put us on to the man that done you out of it  blanco because hed be too clever for you just as he was too clever for me  feemy reddening and disengaging her arm

strapper she saw a man on a horse when she was too drunk to tell which was the man and which was the horse  feemy breaking in you lie i wasnt drunkat least not as drunk as that  blanco ignoring the interruptionand you found a man without a horse is a man on a horse the same as a man on foot yah take your witness away whos going to believe her shove her into the dustbin youve got to find that horse before you get a rope round my neck he turns away from her contemptuously and sits at the table with his back to the jury box  feemy following him ill hang you you dirty horsethief or not a man

last and ill die game he puts out his hand she strikes savagely at it but he withdraws it in time and laughs at her discomfiture  feemy you  elder daniels never mind him feemy hes not right in his head today she receives the assurance with contemptuous credulity and sits down on the step of the sheriffs dais  sheriff kemp comes in a stout man with large flat ears and a neck thicker than his head  elder daniels morning sheriff  the sheriff morning elder passing on morning strapper passing on morning miss evans stopping between strapper and blanco is this the prisoner  blanco rising thats so morning sheriff  the sheriff morning you know i suppose that if youve stole a horse and the jury find against you you wont have any time to settle your affairs consequently if you feel guilty youd better settle em now  blanco affairs be damned ive got none  the sheriff well are you in a proper state of mind has the elder talked to you  blanco he has and i say its against the law its torture thats what it is  elder daniels hes not accountable hes out of his mind sheriff hes not fit to go into the presence of his maker  the sheriff you are a merciful man elder but you wont take the boys with you there to blanco if it comes to hanging you youd better for your own sake be hanged in a proper state of mind than in an improper one but it wont make any difference to us make no mistake about that  blanco lord keep me wicked till i die now ive said my little prayer im ready not that im guilty mind you but this is a rotten town dead certain to do the wrong thing  the sheriff you wont be asked to live long in it i guess to strapper got the witness all right strapper  strapper yes got everything  blanco except the horse  the sheriff whats that aint you got the horse  strapper no he traded it before we overtook him i guess but feemy saw him on it  feemy she did  strapper shall i call in the boys  blanco just a moment sheriff a good appearance is everything in a lowclass place like this he takes out a pocket comb and mirror and retires towards the dais to arrange his hair  elder daniels oh think of your immortal soul man not of your foolish face  blanco i cant change my soul elder it changes mesometimes feemy im too pale let me rub my cheek against yours darling  feemy you lie my colors my own such as it is and a pretty color youll be when youre hung white and shot red  blanco aint she spiteful sheriff  the sheriff times wasted on you to strapper go and see if the boys are ready some of them were short of cartridges and went down to the store to buy them they may as well have their fun and itll be shorter for him  strapper young jack has brought a boxful up theyre all ready  the sheriff going to the dais and addressing blanco your place is at the bar there take it blanco bows ironically and goes to the bar miss evans youd best sit at the table she does so at the corner nearest the bar the elder takes the opposite corner the sheriff takes his chair all ready strapper  strapper at the door all in to begin  the crowd comes in and fills the court babsy jessie and emma come to the sheriffs right hannah and lottie to his left  the sheriff silence there the jury will take their places as usual they do so  blanco i challenge this jury sheriff  the foreman do you by gosh  the sheriff on what ground  blanco on the general ground that its a rotten jury laughter  the sheriff thats not a lawful ground of challenge  the foreman its a lawful ground for me to shoot yonder skunk at sight first time i meet him if he survives this trial  blanco i challenge the foreman because hes prejudiced  the foreman i say you lie we mean to hang you blanco posnet but you will be hanged fair  the jury hear hear  strapper to the sheriff george this is rot how can you get an unprejudiced jury if the prisoner starts by telling them theyre all rotten if theres any prejudice against him he has himself to thank for it  the boys thats so of course he has insulting the court challenge be jiggered gag him  nestor a juryman with a long white beard drunk the oldest man present besides sheriff i go so far as to say that the man that is not prejudiced against a horsethief is not fit to sit on a jury in this town  the boys right bully for you nestor thats the straight truth of course he aint hear hear  the sheriff that is no doubt true old man still you must get as unprejudiced as you can the critter has a right to his chance such as he is so now go right ahead if the prisoner dont like this jury he should have stole a horse in another town for this is all the jury hell get here  the foreman thats so blanco posnet  the sheriff to blanco dont you be uneasy you will get justice here it may be rough justice but it is justice  blanco what is justice  the sheriff hanging horsethieves is justice so now you know now then weve wasted enough time hustle with your witness there will you  blanco indignantly bringing down his fist on the bar swear the jury a rotten sheriff you are not to know that the jurys got to be sworn  the foreman galled be swore for you not likely what do you say old son  nestor deliberately and solemnly i say guilty  the boys tumultuously rushing at blanco thats it guilty guilty take him out and hang him hes found guilty fetch a rope up with him they are about to drag him from the bar  the sheriff rising pistol in hand hands off that man hands off him i say squinty or i drop you and would if you were my own son dead silence im sheriff here and its for me to say when he may lawfully be hanged they release him  blanco as the actor says in the play a daniel come to judgment rotten actor he was too  the sheriff elder daniel is come to judgment all right my lad elder the floor is yours the elder rises give your evidence the truth and the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god  elder daniels sheriff let me off this i didnt ought to swear away this mans life he and i are in a manner of speaking brothers  the sheriff it does you credit elder every man here will acknowledge it but religion is one thing law is another in religion were all brothers in law we cut our brother off when he steals horses  the foreman besides you neednt hang him you know theres plenty of willing hands to take that job off your conscience so rip ahead old son  strapper youre accountable to me for the horse until you clear yourself elder remember that  blanco out with it you fool  elder daniels you might own up blanco as far as my evidence goes everybody knows i borrowed one of the sheriffs horses from strapper because my owns gone lame everybody knows you arrived in the town yesterday and put up in my house everybody knows that in the morning the horse was gone and you were gone  blanco in a forensic manner sheriff the elder though known to you and to all here as no brother of mine and the rottenest liar in this town is speaking the truth for the first time in his life as far as what he says about me is concerned as to the horse i say nothing except that it was the rottenest horse you ever tried to sell  the sheriff how do you know it was a rotten horse if you didnt steal it  blanco i dont know of my own knowledge i only argue that if the horse had been worth its keep you wouldnt have lent it to strapper and strapper wouldnt have lent it to this eloquent and venerable ram suppressed laughter and now i ask him this to the elder did we or did we not have a quarrel last evening about a certain article that was left by my mother and that i considered i had a right to more than you and did you say one word to me about the horse not belonging to you  elder daniels why should i we never said a word about the horse at all how was i to know what it was in your mind to do  blanco bear witness all that i had a right to take a horse from him without stealing to make up for what he denied me i am no thief but you havnt proved yet that i took the horse strapper kemp had i the horse when you took me or had i not  strapper no nor you hadnt a railway train neither but feemy evans saw you pass on the horse at four oclock twentyfive miles from the spot where i took you at seven on the road to pony harbor did you walk twentyfive miles in three hours that so feemy eh  feemy thats so at four i saw him to blanco thats done for you  the sheriff you say you saw him on my horse  feemy i did  blanco and i ate it i suppose before strapper fetched up with me suddenly and dramatically sheriff i accuse feemy of immoral relations with strapper  feemy oh you liar  blanco i accuse the fair euphemia of immoral relations with every man in this town including yourself sheriff i say this is a conspiracy to kill me between feemy and strapper because i wouldnt touch feemy with a pair of tongs i say you darent hang any white man on the word of a woman of bad character i stand on the honor and virtue of my american manhood i say that shes not had the oath and that you darent for the honor of the town give her the oath because her lips would blaspheme the holy bible if they touched it i say thats the law and if you are a proper united states sheriff and not a lowdown lyncher youll hold up the law and not let it be dragged in the mud by your brothers kept woman  great excitement among the women the men much puzzled  jessie thats right she didnt ought to be let kiss the book  emma how could the like of her tell the truth  babsy it would be an insult to every respectable woman here to believe her  feemy its easy to be respectable with nobody ever offering you a chance to be anything else  the women clamoring all together shut up you hussy youre a disgrace how dare you open your lips to answer your betters hold your tongue and learn your place miss you painted slut whip her out of the town  the sheriff silence do you hear silence the clamor ceases did anyone else see the prisoner with the horse  feemy passionately aint i good enough  babsy no youre dirt thats what you are  feemy and you  the sheriff silence this trial is a mans job and if the women forget their sex they can go out or be put out strapper and miss evans you cant have it two ways you can run straight or you can run gay so to speak but you cant run both ways together there is also a strong feeling among the men of this town that a line should be drawn between those that are straight wives and mothers and those that are in the words of the book of books taking the primrose path we dont wish to be hard on any woman and most of us have a personal regard for miss evans for the sake of old times but theres no getting out of the fact that she has private reasons for wishing to oblige strapper and thatif she will excuse my saying soshe is not what i might call morally particular as to what she does to oblige him therefore i ask the prisoner not to drive us to give miss evans the oath i ask him to tell us fair and square as a man who has but a few minutes between him and eternity what he done with my horse  the boys hear hear thats right thats fair that does it now blanco own up  blanco sheriff you touch me home this is a rotten world but there is still one thing in it that remains  sacred even to the rottenest of us and that is a horse  the boys good well said blanco thats straight  blanco you have a right to your horse sheriff and if i could put you in the way of getting it back i would but if i had that horse i shouldnt be here as i hope to be saved sheriffor rather as i hope to be damned for i have no taste for pious company and no talent for playing the harpi know no more of that horses whereabouts than you do yourself  strapper who did you trade him to  blanco i did not trade him i got nothing for him or by him i stand here with a rope round my neck for the want of him when you took me did i fight like a thief or run like a thief and was there any sign of a horse on me or near me  strapper you were looking at a rainbow like a damned silly fool instead of keeping your wits about you and we stole up on you and had you tight before you could draw a bead on us  the sheriff that dont sound like good sense what would he look at a rainbow for  blanco ill tell you sheriff i was looking at it because there was something written on it  sheriff how do you mean written on it  blanco the words were ive got the cinch on you this time blanco posnet yes sheriff i saw those words in green on the red streak of the rainbow and as i saw them i felt strappers grab on my arm and squintys on my pistol  the foreman hes shammin mad thats what he is aint it about time to give a verdict and have a bit of fun sheriff  the boys yes lets have a verdict were wasting the whole afternoon cut it short  the sheriff making up his mind swear feemy evans elder she dont need to touch the book let her say the words  feemy worse people than me has kissed that book what wrong ive done most of you went shares in ive to live havnt i same as the rest of you however it makes no odds to me i guess the truth is the truth and a lie is a lie on the book or off it  babsy do as youre told who are you to be let talk about it  the sheriff silence there i tell you sail ahead elder  elder daniels feemy evans do you swear to tell the truth and the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god  feemy i do so help me  sheriff thats enough

hands  the whole crowd a woman  the sheriff well fetch her in strapper goes out the sheriff continues to feemy and what do you mean you lying jade by putting up this story on us about blanco  feemy i aint put up no story on you this is a plant you see if it isnt  strapper returns with a woman her expression of intense grief silences them as they crane over one anothers  heads to see her strapper takes her to the corner of the table the elder moves up to make room for her  blanco terrified that woman aint real you take care that woman will make you do what you never intended thats the rainbow woman thats the woman that brought me to this  the sheriff shut your mouth will you youve got the horrors to the woman now you who are you and what are you doing with a horse that doesnt belong to you  the woman i took it to save my childs life i thought it would get me to a doctor in time it was choking with croup  blanco strangling and trying to laugh a little choker thats the word for him his choking wasnt real wait and see mine he feels his neck with a sob  the sheriff wheres the child  strapper on pug jacksons bench in his shed hes makin a coffin for it  blanco with a horrible convulsion of the throatfrantically dead the little judas kid the child i gave my life for he breaks into hideous laughter  the sheriff jarred beyond endurance by the sound hold you noise will you shove his neckerchief into his mouth if he dont stop to the woman dont you mind him maam hes mad with drink and devilment i suppose theres no fake about this strapper who found her  waggoner jo i did sheriff theres no fake about it i came on her on the track round by red mountain she was settin on the ground with the dead body on her lap stupidlike the horse was grazin on the other side of the road  the sheriff puzzled well this is blamed queer to the woman what call had you to take the horse from elder daniels stable to find a doctor theres a doctor in the very next house  blanco mopping his dabbled red crest and trying to be ironically gay story simply wont wash my angel you got it from the man that stole the horse he gave it to you because he was a softy and went to bits when you played off the sick kid on him well i guess that clears me im not that sort catch me putting my neck in a noose for anybodys kid  the foreman dont you go putting her up to what to say she said she took it  the woman yes i took it from a man that met me i thought god sent him to me i rode here joyfully  thinking so all the time to myself then i noticed that the child was like lead in my arms god would never have been so cruel as to send me the horse to disappoint me like that  blanco just what he would do  strapper we aint got nothin to do with that this is the man aint he pointing to blanco  the woman pulling herself together after looking scaredly at blanco and then at the sheriff and at the jury no  the foreman you lie  the sheriff youve got to tell us the truth thats the law you know  the woman the man looked a bad man he cursed me and he cursed the child god forgive him but something came over him i was desperate i put the child in his arms and it got its little fingers down his neck and called him daddy and tried to kiss him for it was not right in its head with the fever he said it was a little judas kid and that it was betraying him with a kiss and that hed swing for it and then he gave me the horse and went away crying and laughing and singing dreadful dirty wicked words to hymn tunes like as if he had seven devils in him  strapper shes lying give her the oath george  the sheriff go easy there youre a smart boy strapper but youre not sheriff yet this is my job you just wait i submit that were in a difficulty here if blanco was the man the lady cant as a white woman give him away she oughtnt to be put in the position of having either to give him away or commit perjury on the other hand we dont want a horsethief to get off through a ladys delicacy  the foreman no we dont and we dont intend he shall not while i am foreman of this jury  blanco with intense expression a rotten foreman oh what a rotten foreman  the sheriff shut up will you providence shows us a way out here two women saw blanco with a horse one has a delicacy about saying so the other will excuse me saying that delicacy is not her strongest holt she can give the necessary witness feemy evans youve taken the oath you saw the man that took the horse  feemy i did and he was a lowdown rotten drunken lying hound that would go further to hurt a woman any day than to help her and if he ever did a  good action it was because he was too drunk to know what he was doing so its no harm to hang him she said he cursed her and went away blaspheming and singing things that were not fit for the child to hear  blanco troubled i didnt mean them for the child to hear you venomous devil  the sheriff all thats got nothing to do with us the question you have to answer is was that man blanco posnet  the woman no i say no i swear it sheriff dont hang that man oh dont you may hang me instead if you like ive nothing to live for now you darent take her word against mine she never had a child i can see it in her face  feemy stung to the quick i can hang him in spite of you anyhow much good your child is to you now lying there on pug jacksons bench  blanco rushing at her with a shriek ill twist your heart out of you for that they seize him before he can reach her  feemy mocking at him as he struggles to get at her ha ha blanco posnet you cant touch me and i can hang you ha ha oh ill do for you ill twist your heart and ill twist your neck he is dragged back to the bar and leans on it gasping and exhausted give me the oath again elder ill settle him and do you to the woman take your sickly face away from in front of me  strapper just turn your back on her there will you  the woman god knows i dont want to see her commit murder she folds her shawl over her head  the sheriff now miss evans cut it short was the prisoner the man you saw this morning or was he not yes or no  feemy a little hysterically ill tell you fast enough dont think im a softy  the sheriff losing patience here weve had enough of this you tell the truth feemy evans and let us have no more of your lip was the prisoner the man or was he not on your oath  feemy on my oath and as im a living womanflinching oh god he felt the little childs hands on his necki cant bursting into a flood of tears and scolding at the other woman its you with your snivelling face that has put me off it desperately no it wasnt him i only said it out of spite because he insulted me may i be struck dead if i ever saw him with the horse  everybody draws a long breath dead silence  blanco whispering at her softy crybaby landed like me doing what you never intended taking up his hat and speaking in his ordinary tone i presume i may go now sheriff  strapper here hold hard  the foreman not if we know it you dont  the boys barring the way to the door you stay where you are stop a bit stop a bit dont you be in such a hurry dont let him go not much  blanco stands motionless his eye fixed thinking hard and apparently deaf to what is going on  the sheriff rising solemnly silence there wait a bit i take it that if the sheriff is satisfied and the owner of the horse is satisfied theres no more to be said i have had to remark on former occasions that what is wrong with this court is that theres too many sheriffs in it today there is going to be one and only one and that one is your humble servant i call that to the notice of the foreman of the jury and also to the notice of young strapper i am also the owner of the horse does any man say that i am not silence very well then in my opinion to commandeer a horse for the purpose of getting a dying child to a doctor is not stealing provided as in the present case that the horse is returned safe and sound i rule that there has been no theft  nestor that aint the law  the sheriff i fine you a dollar for contempt of court and will collect it myself off you as you leave the building and as the boys have been disappointed of their natural sport i shall give them a little fun by standing outside the door and taking up a collection for the bereaved mother of the late kid that shewed up blanco posnet  the boys a collection oh i say calls that sport is this a mothers meeting well ill be jiggered where does the sport come in  the sheriff continuing the sport comes in my friends not so much in contributing as in seeing others fork out thus each contributes to the general enjoyment and all contribute to his blanco posnet you go free under the protection of the vigilance committee for just long enough to get you out of this town which is not a healthy place for you as you are in a hurry ill sell you the horse at a reasonable figure now boys let nobody go out till i get to the door the court is adjourned he goes out  strapper to feemy as he goes to the door im done with you do you hear im done with you he goes out sulkily  feemy calling after him as if i cared about a stingy brat like you go back to the freckled maypole  you left for me youve been fretting for her long enough  the foreman to blanco on his way out a man like you makes me sick just sick blanco makes no sign the foreman spits disgustedly and follows strapper out the jurymen leave the box except nestor who collapses in a drunken sleep  blanco suddenly rushing from the bar to the table and jumping up on it boys im going to preach you a sermon on the moral of this days proceedings  the boys crowding round him yes lets have a sermon go ahead blanco silence for elder blanco tune the organ let us pray  nestor staggering out of his sleep never hold up your head in this town again im done with you  blanco pointing inexorably to nestor drunk in church disturbing the preacher hand him out  the boys chivying nestor out now nestor outside outside nestor out you go get your subscription  ready for the sheriff skiddoo nestor  nestor afraid to be hanged afraid to be hanged at the door coward he is thrown out  blanco dearly beloved brethren  a boy same to you blanco

that youre miserable sinners am i a miserable sinner no im a fraud and a failure i started in to be a bad man like the rest of you you all started in to be bad men or you wouldnt be in this jumpedup jerkedoff hospitalturnedout camp that calls itself a town i took the broad path because i thought i was a man and not a snivelling canting turningtheothercheek apprentice angel serving his time in a vale of tears they talked christianity to us on sundays but when they really meant business they told us never to take a blow without giving it back and to get dollars when they talked the golden rule to me i just looked at them as if they werent there and spat but when they told me to try to live my life so that i could always look my fellowman straight in the eye and tell him to go to hell that fetched me  the boys quite right good bully for you blanco old son right good sense too ahaaah  blanco yes but whats come of it all am i a real bad man a man of game and grit a man that does what he likes and goes over or through other people to his own gain or am i a snivelling cry baby that let a horse his life depended on be took from him by a woman and then sat on the grass looking at the rainbow and let himself be took like a hare in a trap by strapper kemp a lad whose back i or any grown man here could break against his knee im a rottener fraud and failure than the elder here and youre all as rotten as me or youd have lynched me  a boy anything to oblige you blanco  another we can do it yet if you feel really bad about it  blanco no the devils gone out of you were all frauds theres none of us real good and none of us real bad  elder daniels there is one above blanco  blanco what do you know about him you that always talk as if he never did anything without asking your rotten leave first why did the child die tell me that if you can he cant have wanted to kill the child why did he make me go soft on the child if he was going hard on it himself why should he go hard on the innocent kid and go soft on a rotten thing like me why did i go soft myself why did the sheriff go soft why did feemy go soft whats this game that upsets our game for seems to me theres two games bein played our game is a rotten game that makes me feel im dirt and that youre all as rotten dirt as me tother game may be a silly game but it aint rotten when the sheriff played it he stopped being rotten when feemy played it the paint nearly dropped off her face when i played it i cursed myself for a fool but i lost the rotten feel all the same  elder daniels it was the lord speaking to your soul blanco  blanco oh yes you know all about the lord dont you youre in the lords confidence he wouldnt for the world do anything to shock you would he boozy dear yah what about the croup it was early days when he made the croup i guess it was the best he could think of then but when it turned out wrong on his hands he made you and me to fight the croup for him you bet he didnt make us for nothing and he wouldnt have made us at all if he could have done his work without us by gum that must be what were for hed never have made us to be rotten drunken blackguards like me and goodfornothing rips like feemy he made me because he had a job for me he let me run loose til the job was ready and then i had to come along and do it hanging or no hanging and i tell you it didnt
