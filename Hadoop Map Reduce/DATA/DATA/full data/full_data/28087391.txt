south of the hismáruins of shuwák and shaghab    we have now left the region explored by europeans and our line to the south and the southeast will lie over ground wholly new in front of us the land is no longer arz madyan we are entering south midian which will extend to elhejáz as the march might last longer than had been expected i ordered fresh supplies from elmuwaylah to meet us in the interior viâ zibá a very small boy acted dromedaryman and on the next day he reached the fort distant some thirtyfive and a half direct geographical miles eastward with a trifling of northing  we left the jayb elkhuraytah on a delicious morning 615 am february 26th startling the gazelles and the hares from their breakfast graze  the former showed in troops of six and the latter were still breeding as frequent captures of the longeared young proved the track lay down the wady dahal and other influents of the great wady salúwwah a main feeder of the dámah we made a considerable détour between southsoutheast and southeast to avoid the rocks and stones discharged by the valleys of the shafah range on our left to the right rose the jibál eltihámah over whose nearer brown heights appeared the pale blue peaks of jebel shárr and its southern neighbour jebel salúwwah  at nine am we turned abruptly eastward up the wady elsulaysalah whose head falls sharply from the shafah range the surface is still hismá ground red sand with blocks of ruddy grit washed down from the plateau on the left and according to furayj it forms the southwestern limit of the harrah the valley is honeycombed into mantraps by rats and lizards causing many a tumble and notably developing the mulish instinct we then crossed a rough and rocky divide arabicè a majrá or as the bedawin here pronounce it a magráhen1 which takes its name from the tormented ruways ridge on the right after a hot unlively march of four hours  eleven miles on mules worn out by want of water we dismounted at a queer isolated lump on the left of the track this jebel elmuraytbah of the little step is lumpy grey granite of the coarsest elements whose false strata tilted up till they have become quasivertical and worn down to pillars and drums crown the crest like gigantic columnar crystallizations we shall see the same freak of nature far more grandly developed into the pins of the shárr it has evidently upraised the trap of which large and small blocks are here and there imbedded in it the granite is cut in its turn by long horizontal dykes of the hardest quadrangular basalt occasionally puddingd with banded lumps of red jasper and oxydulated iron from afar they look like waterlines and in places they form walls regular as if built the rounded forms result from the granites flaking off in curved laminæ like onioncoats want of homogeneity in the texture causes the granite to degrade into caves and holes the huge blocks which have fallen from the upper heights often show unexpected hollows in the under and lower sides above the water we found an immense natural dolmen under which apparently the bedawin take shelter after elmuraytbah the regular granitic sequence disappears nor will it again be visible till we reach shaghab march 2nd  about noon we remounted and rounded the south of the block disturbing by vain shots two fine black eagles i had reckoned upon the water of elmuraytbah in order to make an exceptional march after so many days of deadly slow going but the cry arose that the rainpuddle was dry we had not brought a sufficient supply with us and twentytwo miles to and from the wady dahal was a long way for camels to say nothing of their owners and the danger of prowling maázah in front water lay still farther off according to the guides who it will be seen notably deceived us so i ordered the camp to be pitched after reconnoitering the locale of the water and we all proceeded to work with a detachment of soldiers and quarrymen it was not a rainpuddle but a spring rising slowly in the sand which had filled up a fissure in the granite about four feet broad of these crevices three were disposed parallel to one another and at different heights they wanted only clearing out the produce was abundant and though slightly flavoured with iron and sulphur it was drinkable the thirsty mules amused us not a little they smelt water at once hobbled as they were all hopped like kangaroos over the plain and with long ears well to the fore they stood superintending the operation till it was their turn to be happy  our evening at the foot of elruways was cheered despite the flies the earwigs and the biting baúzah beetle which here first put in an appearance by the weird and fascinating aspect of the southern hismáwall standing opposite to us and distant about a mile from the dull drabcoloured basin elmajrá based upon mighty massive foundations of brown and green trap the undulating junction being perfectly defined by a horizontal white line the capping of sandstone rises regular as if laid in courses with a huge rampart falling perpendicular upon the natural slope of its glacis this bounding curtain is called the taur elshafah the inaccessible part of the liprange further eastward the continuity of the coping has been broken and weathered into the most remarkable castellations you pass mile after mile of cathedrals domes spires minarets and pinnacles of fortresses dungeons bulwarks walls and towers of platforms buttresses and flying buttresses these girágir jirájir as the bedawin call them change shape at every new point of view and the eye never wearies of their infinite variety nor are the tints less remarkable than the forms when the light of day warms them with its gorgeous glaze the buildings wear the brightest hues of red concrete like a certain house near princes gate set off by lambent lights of lively pink and balasruby and by shades of deep transparent purple while here and there a dwarf dome or a tumulus gleams sparkling white in the hot sunray the evenglow is indescribably lovely and all the lovelier because unlasting the moment the red disc disappears the glorious rosy smile fades away leaving the pale grey ghosts of their former selves to gloom against the gloaming of the eastern sky i could not persuade m lacaze to transfer this vividity of colour to canvas he had the artists normal excuse who would believe it  the next morning saw the expedition afoot at six am determined to make up for a half by the whole days work so long intended the track struck eastward and issued from the dull hollow majrá elruways by a made road about a mile and a half long a cornice cut in the stony flanks of a hill whose head projected southwards into the broad wady hujayl the little partridge this line seems to drain inland presently it bends round by the east and feeds the wady dámah rain must lately have fallen for the earth is purfled flowers pink white and yellow the latter is the tint prevailing in midian often suggesting the careless european wheatfield in which shillock or wild mustard rears its gamboge head above the green midian wants not only the charming oleander and the rugged terebinth typical of the desert but also the blood of adonis the lovely anemone which lights up the syrian landscape like the fishermans scarlet cap in a seapiece this stage introduced us to the hargul harjal rhazya stricta whose perfume filled the valley with the clean smell of the hennabloom the eastern privetmr clarke said wallflowers our mules ate it greedily whilst the country animals they say refuse it the flowers dried and pounded cure by fumigation pains in the bones here also we saw for the first time the quaint distaffshape of the purple red masrúr cynomorium coccineum linn from which the bedawi cook bread it is eaten simply peeled and sundried when it has a vegetable taste slightly astringent as if by tannin something between a potato and a turnip or its rudely pounded flour is made into balls with soured milk this styptic i am told by mr r b sharpe of the british museum was long supposed to be peculiar to malta hence its prelinnaean name fungus melitensisen2 now it is known to occur through the mediterranean to india let me here warn future collectors of botany in midian that throughout the land the vegetable kingdom follows the rule of the mineral every march shows something new and he who neglects to gather specimens especially of the smaller flowers in one valley will perhaps find none of them in those adjoining  a denser row of trees lower down the wady hujayl led to the water of amdán mídán about an hour and a half from our last nightingplace yesterday it had been reported six hours distant high towering on our left north rose three huge buttresses of the girágir in front stood a marvellous background of domes and arches cones and ninepins all decayed hismá blurred and broken by the morning mist which could hardly be called a fog and forming a perspective of a dozen distances now they curve from northeast to southwest in a kind of scorpions tail with detached vertebrae torn and wasted by the adjacent plutonic outcrops and looking from the west they suggest bloodred islets rising above the great gloomy waves of trap and porphyry this projection will remain in sight until we reach shuwák and in places we shall see it backed by the basalts and lavas of the straightlined harrah  presently turning sharp to the right southeast we struck across a second divide far more shallow than the first and fell into the northern basin of the great dámah valley also known as elrahabah the openthe rehoboth spaces of the hebrews like yesterdays the loose red sand is hismá and it is also scattered with harrah lava after a four hours ride we halted to enable the caravan to come up our shaykhs were bent upon making twelve miles the average days work and their little game was now to delay as much as possible here we again found flocks of sheep and goats tended by young girls who ran away like ostriches and by old women who did not on the contrary sycorax enjoyed asking the news and wrangling over a kid the camels throughout this country seem to be always under the charge of men or boys  here began our study of the great wady damah whose fame as an arabian arcadia extends far and wide and whose possession has caused many a bloody battle we now see it at its best in early spring morning when            the landscape smiles      calm in the sun and silent are the hills      and valleys and the blue serene of air  this notable feature is a haddúdah frontier divider which in ancient days separated the ukbíyyah ukbahland to the north from the balawiyyah baliyyland south the latter still claim it as their northern limit but the intrusive egyptoarabs have pushed their way far beyond this bourne its present huwayti owners the sulaymiyyín the sulaymát the jeráfín and other tribes are a less turbulent race than the northerns because they are safe from the bandit maázah they are more easily managed and they do not meet a fair offer with the eternal yaftah allahallah opensen3  the head of the dámah a great bay in the hismáwall to the east is now in sight of us and we shall pass its mouth which debouches into the sea below zibá this tract is equally abundant in herds camels flocks and vegetation in places a thin forest gathers and the treeclumps now form a feature in the scenery the sole a broad expanse of loose red arenaceous matter the washings of the plateau is fearfully burrowed and honeycombed it is also subject like its sister the sadr to the frequent assault of devils or sandpillars that it is plentifully supplied with water we learn from the presence of birds the cries of the caravane the knockkneed plover of egypt yellowbeaked and blackeyed resounded in the more barren belts a lovely little sunbird nectarinia ose which the frenchmen of course called colibri with ravishing reflections of green and gold flashed like a gem thrown from shrub to shrub this oiseau mouche is found scattered throughout midian we saw it even about elmuwaylah but i had unfortunately twice forgotten dustshot the egyptian rakham percnopter yellow with blacktipped wings a carrioneater now so rare and the common brown kite still so common near civilized cairo soared in the sky while the larger vultures perching upon the rockridges suggested bedawi sentinels the ravens here as elsewhere are a plague flights of them occupy favourite places and they prey upon the young lambs hares and maimed birds  we advanced another five miles and crossed to the southern side of the actual torrentbed whose banks strewed with a quantity of dead floodwood entangling the trees and whose flaky clays cracked to the shape of slabs and often curling into tubes of natural pottery show that at times the hismá must discharge furious torrents we camped close to the dámah at the foot of the jebel elbalawi the water known as máyat eljebayl of the hillock lay ahead in a low rocky snout it was represented as being distant a full hour and the mules did not return from it till three had passed but thirty minutes would have been nearer the truth the niledrinkers turned up their fastidious noses at the supply but lieutenant amir who had graduated in the rough campaigningschool of the súdán pronounced it regular  the nightingplace on the dámah was as pretty and picturesque as the majrá was tame and uncouth while the west was amber clear long stripes of purpling crimson flaming cloud to the south and the east set off the castled crags disposed in a semicircle round the wadyhead and the buildings appeared artlike enough to be haunted ground the domain of the fata morgana a glimpse of the city of brass built by shaddaá son of ad when the stars began to glitter sharp and clear our men fell to singing and dancing and the boy husayn ganinah again distinguished himself by his superior ribaldry our work was more respectable and prosaic firing a mule with a swollen back  within a mile or so of us stood some bedawi tents which we had passed on the march they were deserted by the men here sulaymát who drive their camels to the wilds sometimes for a week at a time an old wife who brought us a goat for sale and who begged that husayn the báshbuzúk might pass the night with her in order to shoot an especially objectionable wolf had a long tale to tell of neighbouring ruins she also reported that near the same place there is a well with steps into which the arabs had descended some seven fathoms presently they found houses occupying the galleries at the bottom and fled in terror  lieutenant amir was sent to sketch and survey the site next morning and he was lucky enough to be guided by one said bin zayfullah the sulaymi whose prime dated from the palmy days of the great mohammed ali pasha he acknowledged as his friends the grandfather and even the father of our guide furayj but the latter he ignored looking upon him as a mere walad lad moreover he remembered the birth of shaykh mohammed afnán chief of the baliyy which took place when he himself had already become a hunter of the gazelleen4 according to him the remains are still known as the dár house or diyár houses elnasáráof the nazarenes that is of the nabathaeans the former term is retained here as in sinai by popular tradition and the latter is clean forgotten throughout midianen5  riding down the wady dámah to the southwest lieutenant amir came upon a spring in a stonerevetted well near the left bank this ayn elbada is not to be confounded with the badí water or with the badá plain both of which we shall presently visit a strew of broken quartz around it showed the atelier and specimens of scattered fragments glass and pottery were gathered the settlementruins which the guide called elkantarah lie further down upon a southern influent of the main line they are divided into two blocks one longer than the other lieutenant amir made a careful plan of the remains and then pushed forward to shuwák by the direct track westward of that taken by the caravan he arrived in camp none the worse for a welldeveloped cropper his dromedary had put its foot in a hole and had fallen with a suddenness generally unknown to the cameline race  by way of geographical exercitation we had all drawn our several plans showing after arab statement the lay of shaghab and shuwák the two ruins which we were about to visit nothing could be more ridiculous when the sketchmaps came to be compared this was owing to the route following the three sides of a long parallelogram whilst the fourth is based upon the wady dámah causing considerable complication and the excursus ended all were convinced that we had made much southing when our furthest point was not more than five miles south of zibá north lat 27° 20  we quitted the great valley at six am february 28th and struck up the wady shuwák an influent that runs northwards to the dámahs left bank on the stony ground above the right side of this fiumara lay six circles of stones disposed in a line from northeast to southwest they may have been ruins of hufrah waterpits as we rose the nullah surface was pied with white flowers the early growth which here takes the place of primroses i had some difficulty in persuading our good friend furayj who had not seen the country for fifteen years to engage as guide one of the many bedawin camelherds his course seemed to serpentine like that of an animal grazinghe said it was intended to show the least stony roadand when he pointed with the wave of the maimed right hand he described an arc of some 90° the sulaymi lad caught the nearest camel climbed its sides as you would a tree and when the animal set off at a lumbering gallop pressed the soles of his feet to the ribs with exactly the action of a simiad clinging the while like grim death to the hairy hump  after some six miles we attempted a short cut a gorge that debouched on the left bank of the shuwák valley it showed at once a complete change of formation the sides were painted with clays of variegated colours crystallized lime and porphyritic conglomerates tinted mauvepurple as if by manganese further on the path striking over broken divides and long tracts of stony ground became rough riding it was bordered by the usual monotonous melancholy hills of reddish and greenish trap whose slaty and schistlike edges in places stood upright on the summit of the last col appeared the ruins of an outwork a large square and a central heap of boulderstones straight in front rose the block that backs our destination the jebel elsáni or mountain of the maker the artificer par excellence that is the blacksmith it is so called from a legendary shoer of horses and mules who lived there possibly in the days before sultán selim it is remarkable for its twin peaks sharptopped blocks the higher to the east and called by the bedawin naghar and nughayr the guides spoke of a furnace near the summit of these remarkable cones excellent landmarks which we shall keep in sight during several marches at length after ten miles of slow work we saw before us stretched as upon a map the broad valley with its pink sands the daumtrees the huge ushr or apple of sodom the fanpalm bush and the large old jujubeshere an invariable sign of former civilizationwhich informed us that there lay fair shuwák  the dull gorge introduced us to what was then a novelty in midian but we afterwards found it upon the cold heights of the shárr where it supplied us with many a dainty dish this was the shinnáren6 caccabis a partridge as large as a pheasant and flavoured exactly like the emigrant from phasis  the coat the clock clock and the nimble running over the rocks ever the favourite haunt denote the perdix the head is black as in the c melanocephala of abyssinia and the legs and feet are red like the smaller greek caccabis that inhabits the hismá the male birds have no spurs and they are but little larger than their mates there seems to be no difficulty in keeping them we bought a hen and chicks caged at elwijh but whether they lived or not i neglected to note here too we learned the reason why the falcons and the hawks falco milvus f gentilis etc are so fierce and so wellfed the tyrant of the air raises the partridge or the quail by feinting a swoop and as it hurries away screaming aloud follows it leisurely at a certain distance finally when the quarry reaches the place intendedat least the design so appearsthe falcon stoops and ends the chase the other birds were ringdoves turtles and the little butcher impaling gaily as a gallant turk its live victim upon a long thorn  shuwák which lies in about north lat 27° 15 can be no other than the greek placed by ptolemy vi 7 in north lat 26° 15 and if so we must add one degree to his latitudes which are sixty miles too lowen7 according to sprenger alt geog p 25 greek and greek do not fit into any of the alexandrians routes and were connected only with their ports rhaunathos mjirmah and phoenicon vicus zibá but both these cities were large and important centres both of agriculture and of mining industry forming crucial stations on the great nabathæan highway the overland between leukè kóme and petra the line was kept up by the moslems until sultán selims superseded it and hence the modern look of the remains which at first astonished us so much the tradition of the hajjpassage is distinctly preserved by the bedawin and i have little doubt that metal has been worked here as lately perhaps as the end of the last century but by whom again deponent ventures not to say even to guess  the site of shuwák is a long island in the broad sandy wady of the same name which as has been remarked feeds the dámah its thalweg has shifted again and again the main line now hugs the southern or left bank under the slopes and folds of the jebel elsáni whilst a smaller branch on the northern side is subtended by the stony divide last crossed at the city the lay of the valley is from northeast to southwest and the altitude is about seventeen hundred feet aner 2828 the head still shows the castellations of the hismá looking downstream beyond the treedotted bed and the low dark hills that divide this basin from the adjoining wady to the south we see the tall grey tops of the jebel zigláb zijláb and of the shahbágámirahthe ashencoloured peak of gámirahthe latter being the name of a valley both look white by the side of the dark red and green rocks and we shall presently find that they mark the granite region lying south and seaward of the great trap formations we were not sorry to see it againour eyes were weary of the gloomy plutonic curtains on either side  at shuwák we allowed the camels a day of rest whilst we planned and sketched dug into and described the ruins a difficulty about drinkingwater somewhat delayed us the modern wells like those of the haurán are rudely revetted pits in a bald and shiny bit of clayplain below the principal block of ruins only one in the dozen holds water and that has been made wahsh foul by the torrent sweeping into it heaps of the refuse and manure strewed around the lower folds of the sáni block also supply rainpools but here again the arabs and their camels had left their marks the only drinkable water lies a very long mile down the southern left bank above the old aqueduct in a deep and narrow gorge of trap the perennial spring still trickling down the rocks was dammed across as remnants of cement show us in more places than one there are also signs of cut basins which the barrages above and below once divided into a series of tanks up the rough steps of the bed the camelmen drove their beasts and the name of a gujráti maker printed upon a sack of angloindian canvas had a curious effect among such bedawi surroundings  at last we sank a pit some five feet deep in a reentering angle of the northern or smaller branch we lined it with stone downstream where the flow made the loose sand fall in and we obtained an ample and excellent supply doubtless it was spoiled as soon as our backs were turned by the halffellah jeráfínhuwaytát to whom the place belongs the seabreeze during the day was high and dustladen but we passed a cool delicious night upon the clean sweet sand which does not stick or cling at this altitude there is no fear of bugs and fleasthe only dread is signor pediculus  we will begin with our surveyors at the valley head and note the ruins as we stroll down this section shuwák proper is nearly a mile and a half long and could hardly have lodged less than twenty thousand souls but that extent by no means represents the whole our next march will prolong it along the valley for a total of at least four miles the material is variousboulders of granite and syenite squares of trap and porphyry the red sandstones of the hismá the basalts of the harrah and the rock found in situ a brown and crumbling grit modern and still in process of agglutination the heaps and piles which denote buildings are divided by mounds and tumuli of loose friable soil white with saltminiatures of babylon nineveh and troy on either flanks of the riverholm the periodical torrents have done their worst cutting up the once regular bank into a succession of clay buttresses on the right side we find a large fort half sliced away but still showing the concrete flooring of a tower about the centre of the length are the remnants of a round burj blocks of buildings all levelled to the foundations lie to the northwest and on the west appear signs of a square perhaps the most interesting discovery is that of catacombs proving a civilization analogous to magháir shuayb but ruder because more distant from the centre the caves are hollowed in a long reef of loose breccia which fronting eastward forms the right bank of the smaller branch they are now almost obliterated by being turned into sheepfolds the roofs have fallen in and only one preserves the traces of two loculi  the arrangements touching fuel and water in this great metalworking establishment are on a large scale the biggest of the afrán furnaces lies to the northwest near the right bank of the valley all are of the ordinary type originally some five or six feet high to judge from the bases they are built of firebrick and of the hismá stone which faces itself into a natural latex we dug deep into several of them but so careful had been the workmen or perhaps those who afterwards ransacked these places that not the smallest tear of metal remained we found only ashes pottery and scoriae as usual black and green the latter worked subaerially many of them had projections like stalactite round the furnaces are strewed carbonate of lime stained black with iron like that of sharmá and a quantity of the chloriteenamelled serpentine still used in the brazil as a flux  quartz was absent and we were at a loss to divine what stone had been worked at last we observed near the catacombs sundry heaps of pinkish earth evidently washed out and our researches in the south country afterwards suggested that this may have been the remains of the micaceous schist whose containing quartz was so extensively worked at umm elharáb moreover a short study of shaghab threw more light on the matter  water also had been stored up with prodigious labour we could easily trace the lines of half a dozen aqueducts mostly channelled with rough cement overlying a fine concrete some of them had grooved stones to divert the stream by means of lashers the fiskíyyah or tanks as carefully built were of all sizes and the wells which appeared to be mediaeval were lined with stones cut in segments of circles we shall see the same curve in sultán selims work near zibá the greatest feat is an aqueduct which sanded over in the upper part subtends the left side of the valley it is carefully but rudely built and where it crosses a gully the horizontal arch is formed of projecting stone tiers without a sign of key this magnum opus must date from the days when the southern part of the wady was nearly what it is now  about a mile and a quarter below our camp the wady which broadens to a mile shows on the left bank a wall measuring a thousand metres long apparently ending in a tank of 110 feet each way around it are ruined parallelograms of every size which in ancient times may have been workshops connected with the buildings in the island higher up the torrents have now washed away the continuation if ever there was any and though the lower remnants are comparatively safe upon their high ledge the holm is evidently fated to disappear  i did not learn till too late that a single days march southwards from the wady shuwák along the old main line of traffic leads to the wady nejd upon whose upper course is the plain of badá and which after assuming four different names falls as will be seen into the sea about thirtyfive miles north of elwijh  we left shuwák considerably posed puzzled and perplexed by what it had shown us a little pottery had been picked up but our diggings had not produced a coin or even a bit of glass the evidences of immense labour are the more astonishing when compared with the utter absence of what we call civilization the greek and latin inscriptions of the hauranic cities declare their origin these absolutely unalphabetic refuse a single hint concerning the mysterious race which here lived and worked and worked so nobly and finally who were the moslems that succeeded them in a later day when the hajjcaravan some three centuries and a half ago ceased to march by this road how is it that the annalists say nothing of them that not a vestige of tradition remains concerning any race but the nazarenes  from shuwák to the wady dámah there are two roads a direct and an indirect the latter passing by the ruins of shaghab the caravan begged hard to take the former but was summarily refused at six am we rode down the shuwák valley again noting its huge constructions and then striking away from it to the left we passed over a short divide of brown hill where the narrow pass was marked only by bedawi graves the morning showed a peculiar rainbow if a bow may be called so when no rain appeared a perpendicular stripe brilliant enough and lasting at least twenty minutes the cloud behind it had no skirt no droop in fact no sign of dissolution and what made it the stranger was that this bullseye lay north of and not opposite to but quite near the rising sun we shall note another of these exceptional rainbows at elbadáen8  after marching some seven miles to the south with westing we saw inform heaps to the left half an hour afterwards boulderencircled pits of a brighter green on the right the themáil elmá artificial cisterns of the arabs announced that we were reaching shaghab the caravan punished us by wasting five hours on the way in order to force a halt and by camping at the wrong place when i objected to the delay it brought with it however a fine young beden ibex killed by one of the bedawin and we determined to stuff to bury and to bake it arab fashion under the superintendence of the báshbuzúk husayn unfortunately it was served to us on the next day cold whereas it should have been eaten at once piping hot the meat was dark with a beefy rather than a gamey flavour palatable but by no means remarkable there were loud regrets that a cuisse de chevreuil had not been marinée in fact an infect odour of the quartier latin everywhere followed us and when a guide told us the pattern lie that we should not reach umm amir before the fourth day the poor frogs croaked and croaked audibly as dismally their last bottle of ordinaire was finished gabr the kázi had come into camp bearing a long official arabic document from lieutenant yusuf but not a single journal de genève there was no news of a steamer being sent with rations and forage from suez briefly cétait embetantto use the milder of the two favourite synonyms  the ruins of shaghab are built upon a more complicated site than those of shuwák the position is charming the wady shaghab flowing to the south here spreads out in a broad bulge or basin open to the west downstream we see a gate formed by the meeting of two rocky tonguetips both showing large works beyond these narrows the valley bends to the southwest and feeds the wady aznab which falls into the sea south of the dámah the mass of the ruined city lies upon the left bank where a high and artificiallooking remblai of earth masks an eastern influent the wady elaslah athlah or of the kaliplant it drains the mountain of the same name and the jebel zigláb zijláb the cones of pale granite visible from shuwák and upon its broad mouth the old settlement stood à cheval a little north of west rises profiled the great shárr no longer a ridge with a coping of four horns but a tall and portly block from whose summit spring heads and peaks of airy bluepink slightly east of north the twins naghar and nughayr combining to form the mountain of the maker jebel elsáni tower in the shape of a huge pyramid lastly a regular ascent the majrá elwághir fronts the city sloping up to the westnorthwest and discloses a view of the jibál eltihámah this broad incline was some three centuries ago the route of the hajjcaravan  we walked down the shaghab valleybed whose sides like those of the dámah are chevaux de frise of dead wood the characteristic rock is a conglomerate of large and small stones compacted by hard silicious paste and stained mauvepurple apparently by manganese we had seen it on the way to shuwák and the next days march will pave the uplands with it the wells in the sole are distinctly arab triangular mouths formed and kept open by laying down treetrunks upon which the drawer of water safely stands on the right bank upstream no ruins are perceptible those on the left are considerable but not a quarter the size of shuwák here again appear the usual succession of great squares the largest to the east measures 500 metres along the sides and there are three others one of 400 metres by 192 they are subtended by one of many aqueducts whose walls two feet thick showed no signs of brick it is remarkable for being run underground to pierce a hillock in fact the system is rather greek or subterranean than roman or subaerial further down are the remains apparently of a fort heaps of landshells lie about it they are very rare in this region and during our four months march we secured only two speciesen9  still descending we found the ancient or mediaeval wells numbering about a dozen and in no wise differing from those of shuwák at the gorge where the wady escapes from view lieutenant amir planned buildings on the lower right bank and on the left he found a wall about half a mile long with the remains of a furnace and quartz scattered about it this stone had reappeared in large quantities the moment we crossed the divide the pale grey of the jebel zigláb and its neighbours was evidently owing to its presence and from this point it will be found extending southwards and seawards as far as elhejaz he brought with him a hard white stone much resembling trachyte and fragments of fine green jasper  a cursory inspection of shaghab removed some of the difficulties which had perplexed us at shuwák and elsewhere in the north country signs of metalworking which was mostly confined to the wadys have been generally obliterated washed away or sanded over here the industry revealed itself without mistake the furnaces were few but around each one lay heaps of negro and coppergreen quartz freshly fractured while broken handmills of basalt and lava differing from the rubstones and mortars of a softer substance told their own tale  at shaghab then the metalliferous marú brought from the adjacent granitic mountains was crushed and then transported for roasting and washing to shuwák where water the prime necessary in these lands must have been more abundant possibly in early days the two settlements formed one the single greek of ptolemy and the south end would have been the headquarters of the wealthy hence the bedawin always give it precedenceshaghab wa shuwák moreover we remarked a better style of building in the former and we picked up glass as well as pottery  as a turkey buzzard vulture is the fittest emblem for murderous dahome so i should propose for midian now spoiled and wasted by the wild man a broken handmill of basalt upon a pile of spalled negro quartz                                chapter xii   from shaghab to zibáruins of elkhandakí and umm Ámilthe              turquoise minereturn to elmuwaylah    leaving lieutenant amir to map the principal ruins we followed the caravan up the majrá elwághir the long divide rising to the westnorthwest the thin forest reminded me of the wooded slopes of the antilibanus about elkunaytarah there however terebinths and holmoaks take the place of these unlovely and uncomfortable thorntrees they are cruelly beatenan operation called elramáby the bedawi camelman part of whose travelling kit and the most important part too here as in sinai is the flail murmár or makhbat and the mat to receive the leaves perhaps acacias and mimosas are not so much bettered by bashing as the woman the whelp and the walnuttree of the good old english proverb after three miles we passed on the left ruins of long walls and arab wasm with white memorial stones perched on black in front rose the tall jebel tulayh buttressing the right or northern bank of the dámah and behind it stained faintblue by distance floated in the flickering mirage the familiar forms of the tihámah range a ridge now broken into half a dozen blocks i had ordered the caravan to march upon the tuwayl elsúk but after one hour and fifteen minutes we found the tents pitched some three miles short of it on a bleak and ugly wave of the wághir the shaykhs swore by all holy things that this was the veritable tuwayl and a bedawi who declared that he knew where water lay in the neighbourhood refused to show it sans the preliminary bakhshísh mashallah it is a noble race  early next morning six am march 3rd we followed the right bank of the wady elkhandakí which runs north with westing beyond it lay the foothills of gloomy trap leading to the jebel elraydán a typical granitic form a short demipique saddleback with inwardssloping pommel like the pao dassucar of picturesque rio de janeiro here as elsewhere the granites run parallel with and seaward of the traps the tuwayl elsúk is nothing but an open and windy flat where the hajjcaravan used to camp an adjoining ridge the hamrá eltuwayl shows spalled quartz wasm and memorial stones the principal formation here is the mauvepurple conglomerate before described  after riding nine miles we came unexpectedly upon a large and curious ruin backed by the broad wady dámah gleaming white in the sun the first feature noticed was a pair of parallel walls or rather their foundations thirtyfive feet apart and nearly a kilometre in length it looked like a vast hangar to the left lie three tracings of squares the central is a work of earth and stone not unlike a rude battery and a few paces further north a similar fort has a cistern attached to its western curtain heaps of rounded boulders and the crumbling whiteedged mounds which in these regions always denote old habitations run down the right bank of the wady elkhandakí to its junction with the dámah for want of a better name i called this old settlement kharábát the ruins of elkhandakí and greatly regretted that we had not time enough to march down the whole line of the dámah  half an hour more placed us at the great wady whose general direction is here west with a little southing and which still merits its fame as an arabian arcadia the banks were thickly bordered with secular tamarisks t orientalis those hardy warriors with the hebrewarabic name asl athl that battle against wind and weather as successfully at dovercourt essex as at haydarábád sind  the tint was the normal greygreen not unlike that of the traps in arrière plan the clumps sheltered goats sheep and camels and our mules now revel every day on green meat growing fatter and fatter upon the aristida grass the panicum the hordeum murinum and the bromus of many varieties fronting us rose the twin granitic peaks of jebel mutadán one with a stepped side like an unfinished pyramid they are separated from the dámah by a rough and stony divide and ruins with furnaces are reported to be found in their valleydrain which feeds the great wady amúd  we halted after some sixteen to seventeen miles at the water elziyayb slightly brackish but relished by our animals and resumed our way in the cool seabreeze at one pm passing the jebel tulayh on the north bank the track then left the dámah and turned up a short broad bed to the northwest on the right rose a block of syenite ruddy with orthose all rounded lumps and twisted finials it discharged a quantity of black sand that streaked the gravel plain at four pm we camped on a broad divide elkutayyifah where an adjacent shab or fold supplied fresh rainwater the march had teen long seven hours  twentytwo miles and shaykhs and camelmen looked the sayyid said as if they had smelt jehannum  this divide also called the jayb el salúwwah with granites to the east and traps mixed with granites on the west shows signs of labour hard by to the southwest some exceptionally industrious bedawi of the jeráfínhuwaytát had laid out a small field with barley in the evening we walked westward to the hills that bound the slope and came upon a rockcut road leading to an atalier where marú has been spalled from the stone in situ some specimens had a lightbluish tinge as if stained by cobalt a metal found in several slags and there were veins of crystalline amethystquartz coloured said the engineer by chlorure of silver  the filons and filets cut the granite in all directions and the fiery action of frequent trapdykes had torn the groundrock to tatters the western side of elkutayyifah also showed modern ruins  the guides reported as usual when too late that to the westsouthwest lies a nakb called abúl marwah father of the quartzplace whose waters flow viâ the mutadán to the amúd valley for some days i had cold shudders lest this pass thus left unvisited might be the zúlmarwah the classical móchoura one of the objects of our expedition the alarm proved however as will be seen false a bedawi youth also volunteered a grand account of three written stones a built well surrounded by broken quartz and a little off the road from elkutayyifah to umm Ámil the remains of eldayr the convent as leake well knew the latter is a name which is often indiscriminately applied by the arabs to ancient ruins the lad said they were close by but the garíb near and the gurayyib nearish of the midianite much resemble the egyptian fellahs taht elwish under the facewe should say noseor taht elkab under the heel they may mean a handful of miles as he refused to guide us we secured the services of an old shepherd who objecting to sleep in camp caused abundant trouble and delay next morning  from this divide two roads lead to the ruins of umm Ámil one makes a considerable detour up a branchvalley in order to avoid an ugly pass on the direct line i again refused the camelmen permission to proceed by the indirect route well knowing that they would do their best to miss us on march 4th at six am a long descent and a similar rise led us to a col which presently became a broad open plain 2100 feet above sealevel aner 2885 tents were scattered about the valleys the lads tended their goats and we greatly admired one fellow who had fallen asleep in the hot ascending steams here the old guide halted us and declared that on the top of the dark trapblock the left south was a mashghal or workplace with a strew of quartz and nothing else thus ended the built well descending to a lower plane bounded in front by low rolling hills i sent lieutenant amir to examine the convent and the written stones he came up with us at the halt having been led over a rough divide by an abominable path and he had seen only a few ruined heaps and three arab wusúm moreover he had not dared to show disappointment before the old shepherd who would probably have bolted in fear and left him to find his own way  meanwhile the caravan continued its course down the broad smooth wady ruways on whose left side was a large atelier with broken walls and spalled quartz of the negro variety here we found for the first time the handmills made of the hardest grey granite so beautifully worked further south they explained the fine and carefully polished tube which had been brought to the first expedition at zibáen10 several of these articles were all but whole an exception in this land of clasts we then struck over the stony divide to the left towards a fine landmarka khitm or block shaped like a seal cut en cabochon its name is the barbarous sounding khurm elbadaríyyah during the ascent which was easy we passed a second strew and scatter of the white stone broken into small pieces from the col reached at 945 am a descent vile for camels not for mules presently landed us in the wady umm Ámil the left bank of the hideous narrow gorge showed a line of wells or waterpits made said furayj by the mutakaddimín veteresthe ancients who were probably mediævals crossing the torrentgully we left on its right bank the ruins of large works especially the upper parallelogram after a thirteen miles ride we halted at 1040 am under a rock on the left side opposite three couthless heaps of waterrolled stones surrounded by fine quartz by far the poorest thing we had yet seen this town had been grandiosely described to the first expedition at zibá many blessings were heaped upon the head of Ámil and his mother the name however as the sayyid suggested is evidently a corruption of muámilthe workman the employeeen11 i would conjecture that here the slaveminers were stationed old zibá being the masters abode our caravan entitled it ellománthe bagnio the prison for galériens on the coasttown i procured some specimens of heavy red copper which had been dug out of a ruined furnace the metal is admirable and it retrieves to a certain extent the lost reputation of umm Ámil  at noon we resumed a hot ride down the ugly rocky watercourse both of whose banks showed long lines of ruins presently crossing a divide marked by two stoneheaps we fell into the broader but equally unpicturesque wady salmá it is on about the same parallel as ziba north lat 27° 20 and more than the usual allowance for the error of low latitude must be admitted if we would identify it with the mediterranean greek of ptolemy vi 7 greek in north lat 260° or fifteen miles south of sóaka  wady salmá is the smallest and the northernmost of the three basins which we have just visited the central being the dámah and the southern wady shaghabaslahaznab steaming southwards we shall note the mouths of all these watercourses we presently passed on the right bank the debouchure of the wady ruways and left there a guard to direct the caravan in case it should disobey orders and march up to umm Ámil here the valley gave forage to a herd of milchcamels apparently unguarded each had her foal some newborn others dating from january or february after one hour and fortyfive minutes  six miles we camped on the fine sands that floor the dull line hemmed in by tall masses of red and green trap the adjacent scatter of arab wells in the bed is known as the má elbadíah i carefully inquired concerning ruins in the neighbourhood and we climbed the torrentsides to command a very limited birdseye view of the hills according to the guides there are no remains of the old ones nearer than umm Ámil  setting out early next morning 545 am march 5th after half an hour down the wady salmá we saw its lower course becoming a mere gorge constricted by two opposite rocks on the left bank above this narrow lies a group of arab graves which may have been built upon older foundations the right side here receives the wady haraymal little peganumplant the haráímil of the broadspeaking bedawin as we struck up its dull ascent the southern form of the shárrgiant suddenly broke upon us all glorious in his morning robes of ethereal gauzy pink the foreshortened view from the south as well as the north shows a compact prismformed mass which has been compared with an iceberg the main peak abú shenázir here no 4 from the north proudly bears a mural crown of granite towers which it hides from elmuwaylah and the southern end a mere vanishing ridge at this angle but shown en face to the seaboard abreast of it breaks into three distinctly marked bluffs and headsen12  a divide then led upwards and downwards to the wady abá rikayy remarkable only for warm pools and crystalclear runners springing from the sole the fringings of white show the presence of salt the shallows are covered with the greenest mosses and beetles chase one another over the depths where the waters sleep the lower course takes the name of wady kifáfí and discharges into the sea north of the wady salmá with which it has erroneously been united as in niebuhrs selmá wa kafâfa according to the kátib chelebi who over two centuries ago made the kabr shaykh elkifáfí the second pilgrimstation south of elmuwaylah a certain bedawi chief elkifáfí was killed with a spear and his tomb became a place of pious visitation it is said still to exist between the wadys salmá and kifáfí a third divide to the north led along the eastern flank of the jebel abú rísh which exposes its head to the sea and reaching the col we had the pleasure of once more greeting the blue cove that forms the port of zibá  we then descended into the wady sidrah whose left bank is formed by the safrá zibáthe yellow hill of zibá this small outlying peak is clad in the gaudiest of colours especially a vivid citronyellow set off by red and rusty surroundings which are streaked with a dead chalkywhite the citizens declare that it is absolutely useless because it does not supply sulphur during our days halt at zibá m marie brought from it quartz of several kinds the waxy the heataltered and the blue stained with carbonate of copper possibly this metal may be abundant at a lower horizon  the valley of the one jujubetree after narrowing to a stony gut suddenly flares out into the wady zibá the vulgar feature of these regions provided with the normal gate some three hundred yards broad beyond it the flat surrounding the head of the cove is remarkably well grown with palms clumps of the daum and scattered datetrees of which one is walled round hence i am disposed to consider zibá the greek or phoenicon vicus of ptolemy although he places it in north lat 26° 20 or between sharm dumayghah and elwijh when it lies in north lat 27° 20 i have already protested against the derivation of the wordwhich is written dhoba by wallin deba by niebuhr and zibber by the hydrographic chartproposed by my learned friend sprengeren13 his theory was probably suggested by elyákút iii 464 who in the twelfth century describes dhabba as a village on the coast opposite to which is a settlement with flowing water called badá the two are separated by seventy miles an older name for the station is bir elsultánithe well of the sultán selim we shall presently inspect these remains itineraries also give kabr eltawáshi the eunuchs tomb and this we still find near the palms at the head of the inner baylet it is a square measuring six paces each way mud and coralline showing traces of plaster outside like wellsted ii x we failed to discover any sign of the birkat tank mentioned in a guidebook which burckhardt quotes nor had the citizens ever heard of a reservoir  the campingground of the pilgrims lies between the gate and the covehead around the wells sat at squat a small gathering of the filthy moghrebin allah yakharribhum about 260 of these rufffians were being carried gratis by some charitable merchant in a sambúk that lay at the harbourmouth a party had lately slaughtered a camel of course not their own property and yet they wondered that the bedawin shoot them they showed their insolence by threatening with an axe the dog juno when she sportively sallied out to greet them and were highly offended because in view of cholera and smallpox i stationed sentries to keep them at a distance had there been contagious disease among them it would have spread in no time they haunted the wells which were visited all day by women driving asses from the settlement even the single old beggar of zibáunfailing sign of civilizationwas here and the black tents of the arabs who grazed their flocks at the covehead lay within easy shot of infection on the evening of the next day when the sambúk made sail the shouting and screaming the brawling cudgelling and fighting heard a mile off reminded me of the foul company of maghrabís on board the golden wire  sultán selims well has now grown to four all large and masonrylined that to the southeast is dry travellers are confined to the western whose strong coping they have managed to tear down whilst the northern shows hard old kerbstones deeply grooved and ropechannelled like that of beersheba we breakfasted at the head of the inner bay whilst the sayyid rode forward to meet his brother mahmúd who had kindly brought us the news from elmuwaylah here we could see the townlet covering a low point projecting into the sharm a few large and some small tenements formed the body whilst the head was the little burj built some fourteen years ago upon the tall seabank to the north it bore by way of welcome the viceroys flag  the camp was pitched upon the northern shore of the inner cove behind the new town and sheltered by the tall seacliff here stood old zibá whose stones buried for ages under the sand are now dug up to build its successor i thought better of the settlement and of the port after visiting them a second time we had looked forward to it even as to a petit paris so damascus and the syrian cities appear centres of civilization to westerns coming from the eastnot from the west it is far superior especially in the article water to elmuwaylah it exports charcoal in large quantities and it does a thriving business with the bedawi here are signs of a pier and a mosque is to be built the fish is excellent and abundant lobsters are caught by night near the reef and oysters in the bay when the tide is out we succeeded at last in having our batterie de cuisine properly tinned and we replenished our storesen14 as at elakabah hashísh may be bought in any quantity but no rákihence perhaps the paleness and pastiness of the local complexionand yet our old acquaintance mohammed elmusalmáni is a copt who finds it convenient to be a moslem he aided us in collecting curiosities especially a chalcedony agate intended for a talisman and roughly inscribed in kufic characters archaic and pointed like bengali with the koranic chapter xcii that testifies the unity kul huw allah etc as regards the port wellsted il x is too severe upon it at sherm dhobá the anchorage is small and inconvenient and could only be made available for boats or small vessels dredging the sandbar and cutting a passage in the soft coralline reef will give excellent shelter and some say a depth of seventeen fathoms  our first care was to walk straight into the sea travelling clothes and all i then received the notables including mohammed selámah of elwijh and at once began to inquire about the jebel elfayrúz the chief trader pleaded ignorance he was a stranger a newcomer he had never been out of the settlement the others opposed to me hard and unmitigated iying they knew nothing about turquoises there were no such stones the mines were exhausted  and yet i knew that this coast is visited for turquoises by europeans and that the gem has been and still is sold at suez and cairo mr clarke had many uncut specimens at zagázig embedded in a dark gangue which he called porphyry as opposed to the limestone which bears the silicate of copper upon our first expedition we had noticed a splendid specimen set in a bedawi matchlock and the people of elakabah praised highly the produce of the jebel elghál lastly i happened to have heard that an arab lately brought to zibá a turquoise which sold there for £3 evidently the mine like the goldsands before alluded to would be carefully hidden from us this reticence explained how on our first visit the two staffofficers sent to prospect the diggings had been misdirected to a block lying north of the townlet the red hills alias the jebel elshegayg  shortly after i left egypt an italian sig f returned to suez from elmuwaylah with some fine pearls worth each from £20 to £30 and turquoises which appeared equally good he was then bound for italy but he intended returning to midian in a month or two these are the men who teach the ready natives the very latest dodges such as stimulating the peculiar properties of the pearloyster by inserting grains of sand  i also collected notes concerning the ruins of mjirmah of which we had heard so many tales the site they said is a branch of the wady azlam the first of the three marches between zibá and elwijh and seven and a half hours sail along the coast this watercourse shows above the modern hajjstation the ruins of a fort built by sultán selim wellsted ii x also mentions a castle lying three miles inland from the head of the sharm dumayghah seventy to seventytwo knots south of elmuwaylah shaykh furayj pointed out to us the paleblue peaks of the jebel zafaren15 in the upper part of its wady the amúd zafar a southern branch valley of the azlam lies the ruin he made it six hours march from the seaboard it was an ancient goldmine  whose housefoundations and a well with steps still remain mjirmah which must not be confounded with the umm jirmah an atelier that we shall visit tomorrow has been identified with the greek rhaunathi pagus of ptolemy north lat 25° 40 we will return to this subject when steaming down coast  our day of rest ended at seven pm with a heavy storm of wind and rain from the north the sun had been unusually hot for some days and the sky looked ugly in the evening as usual all assured us that the clouds contained wind not rain despite which when the messtent had been nearly blown down owing to our men being unwilling to leave their warm retreats a heavy drenching downfall set in and continued till eleven pm after a short lull wind and rain again raged at midnight and then the gale gradually blew itself out the next two mornings were delightfully brisk and bracing and deep puddles dotted the rocks  on march 7th the caravan marched straight northwards by the hajjroad along the shore to its campingground an affair of two hours while m marie and i set off for the turquoise mine furayj who had never passed that way engaged as guide one sulaym elmakrafi and this old dromedaryriders son had been sent on to bring into camp all the fayruz he could find crossing at six am the broad pilgrimtrack we struck eastward at a place where the secondary gypsum subtends the old coralline cliff after threequarters of an hour we traversed the wady zahakán the southernmost pass over the shárr proper and presently we ascended a branch that falls into the right bank as we advanced it became a rockwalled stonesoled tunnel winding contracting and widening rising and flattening and generally interesting compared with the dull flat breadth of such features as the wady salmá the overfalls of rock and the unfriendly thorntrees selfishly taking up all the room necessitate frequent zigzags up and down the rocky precipitous banks after a number of divides we entered the wady háskshah which was wider and good for riding and at 830 am we passed into the wady umm jirmah  in this broad basin we found none of the ruins so often reported but immense quantities of broken quartz showed the mashghal or atelier the material was distinguished from all the outcrops hitherto observed by its pretty pink stained with oxide of iron it appeared in large ramifications mostly striking eastwest and in little pitons dotting the valley sole and sides a subsequent visit to wady umm jirmah found many furnaces surrounded by wellworked scoriae of these specimens were secured  after another halfhour we dismounted at the watershed of the wady elghál where the old guide lost no time in losing his head the jebel elghál whose folds fall into its watercourse is a detached block rising nearly due south of the sharp peak as the chart calls abú kusayb the northernmost horn of the shárr while the ghál cove breaking the seacliff bears 270° mag from the summit the hill which may measure 250 feet above sealevel aner 2975 is composed of porphyritic trap and of the hardest felspars veined with chocolatecoloured quartz the true gangue while we examined the formation furayj and old sulaym who became more and more moony ransacked the block in all directions and notably failed to find a trace of mining evidently athor the genius of the turquoise mountain was not to be conquered by a coup de main so i determined to tire her out  after building a stoneman on the finial of the jebel elghál and a short rest in the northwestern wady we remounted and struck seawards some ugly divides led us after half an hour to a broad fiumara well grown with palmbush the veritable wady elghál from this point a total of four miles and a grand total of fourteen led us to the camp it had been pitched at the mahattat elghal on the north bank where the wintertorrent falling into the cove has broken through the sea cliff  here the best of news was in store for us lieutenant yusuf who had this morning rejoined the expedition brought our mails from the sambúk which i had ordered by letter at elakabah and reported that his highnesss frigate sinnár an old friend would relieve the lively mukhbir in taking us to our last journey southwards rations for men and mules and supplies for ourselves all were coming we felt truly grateful to the viceroy and the prince minister for the gracious interest they had taken in the expedition and we looked forward with excitement to the proper finish of our labours without the third march the exploration of midian would have been abtar as the arabs say tailless that is lame and impotent in point of conclusion  but i would not be beaten by the enemy upon the subject of the lapis pharanitis mine during the course of the day a jeráfín bedawi selím ibn musallim brought in scoriae of copper and iron and on the morrow i sent him as guide to lieutenant yusuf with an escort of two soldiers and eight quarrymen on seven camels after three days absence march 810 the officer rejoined us and reported as follows  leaving the mahattat elghál he rode up its watercourse and then turned southwards into the long wady umm jirmah after seven miles and a half  direct five and threequarters he came upon the jebel elfayrúz it is a rounded eminence of no great height showing many signs of work especially three or four cuttings some twenty metres deep a hillock to the northwest supplied the scoriæ before mentioned lieutenant yusuf blasted the chocolatecoloured quartzose rock in four places filled as many sacks and struck the pilgrimroad in the wady elmuarrash leaving its red block the hamrá elmuarrash to the left his specimens were very satisfactory except to the learned geologists of the citadel cairo who pronounced them to be carbonate of copper dr l karl moser of trieste examined them and found crystals of turquoise or rather johnite as dana has it embedded in or spread upon the quartz one specimen moreover contained silver so much for the zibá or southern turquoisediggings  our journey ended on march 8th with a dull ride along the hajjroad northwards passing the creek abú sharír which like many upon this coast is rendered futile by a wall of coral reef we threaded a long flat and after two hours  seven miles we entered a valley where the secondary formation again showed its débris here is the mahattat elhusan the stallions leap a large boulder lying to the left of the track and pitted with holes which a little imagination may convert into hoofprints the name of the noble animal was elmashhúr that of its owner is characteristically enough forgotten by the arabs it lived in the days of ignorance others add more vaguely still when the beni ukbah the lords of the land were warring with the baliyy the gorge was then a mere cutting blocked up by this rock elmashhúr negotiated it alighting upon the surface like a galway hunter taking a stone wall and carried to wady tiryam its rider whose throat was incontinently cut by the foeman in pursuit the legend is known to all and the bedawin still scrape away the sands which threaten to bury the boulder it has its value showing that in regions where the horse is now unknown where in fact nothing but a donkey can live noble blood was once bred the same remark is made by professor palmer the desert of the exodus p 42 concerning the mangaz hisán abú zená leap of the stallion of the father of adultery two heaps of stone near the sinaitic wady gharandal there however the animal is cursed while here it is blessed perhaps also the midianite tradition may descend from a source which still older named the greek is this too farfetched and yet peradventure it may be true  we then fell into the wady jibbah passed the jebel elkibrít examined m philipins work and led over a very vile and very long short cut found ourselves once more on board the mukhbir                  note on the supplies procurable at zibá    the chief stores are  rice good yemani per kis or

xiii  a week around and upon the shárr mountainrésumé of the march                through eastern or central midian    for months the jebel shárr the grand block which backs elmuwaylah had haunted us starting up unexpectedly in all directions with its towering heads that shifted shape and colour from every angle and with each successive change of weather we could hardly leave unexplored the classical hippos mons the moslems elishárah the landmark and the bullocks horns of the prosaic british taren16 the few vacant days before the arrival of the sinnár offered an excellent opportunity for

shport gravely debating whether it would be safe to fire upon le léopard i was anxious to collect specimens of botany and natural history from an altitude hitherto unreached by any traveller in western arabia and lastly there was geography as well as mineralogy to be done  the hydrographic chart gives the mountain a maximum of nine thousanden17 feet evidently a clerical error often repeatedreally those admiralty gentleman are too incurious wellsted who surveyed it remarks ii x the height of the most elevated peak was found to be 6500 feet and it obtained from us the appellation of mowilabh high peakwhen there are native names for every head we had been convinced that the lesser is the true measure by our view from the hismá plateau 3800 feet above sealevel again the form the size and the inclination of the noble massif are wrongly laid down by the hydrographers it is a compact block everywhere rising abruptly from low and sandy watercourses and completely detached from its neighbours by broad wadysthe surr to the north and east while southwards run the kuwayd and the zahakán the huge longoval prism measures nineteen and a half by five miles  ninetyseven and a half square miles of area and its lay is 320° mag thus deflected 40° westward of the magnetic north the general appearance seen in profile from the west is a pentedactylon a central apex with two others on each side tossed as it were to the north and south and turning like chiens de faïence their backs upon one another  moreover the chart assigns to its mount mowilah only two great culminationssharp peak 6330 feet to the north and south of it high peak 9000 the surveyors doubtless found difficulty in obtaining the bedawi names for the several features which are unknown to the citizens of the coast but they might easily have consulted the only authorities the jeráfínhuwaytát who graze their flocks and herds on and around the mountain as usual in arabia the four several main horns are called after the fiumaras that drain them the northernmost is the abú gusayb kusayb or ras elgusayb the little reed a unity composed of a single block and of three knobs in a knot the tallest of the latter especially when viewed from the south resembles an erect and reflexed thumbhence our sharp peak follows umm elfurút the mother of plenty a mural crest a quoinshaped wall cliffing to the south the face perpendicular where it looks seawards bears a succession of scars upright gashes the work of wind and weather and the body which supports it is a slope disposed at the natural angle an innominatus in the shape of a similar quoin is separated by a deep col apparently a torrentbed from a huge beco de papagaiothe parrots bill so common in the brazil this is the abú shenázir or shaykhánib the father of columns and as if two names did not suffice it has a third ras elhuwayz of the little cistern it is our high peak the most remarkable feature of the seafaçade even when it conceals the pair of towering pillars that show conspicuously to the north and south from the beakshaped apex the range begins to decline and fall there is little to notice in the fourth horn whose unimportant items the ras lahyánah the jebel maíh and the umm gisr jisr end the wall each has its huge white wady striping the country in alternation with darkbrown divides and trending coastwards in the usual network  the material of the four crests is the normal grey granite enormous lumps and masses rounded by degradation all chasms and naked columns with here and there a sheet burnished by ancient cataracts and a slide trickling with water unseen in the shade and flashing in the sun like a sheet of crystal the granite however is a mere mask or excrescence being everywhere based upon and backed by the green and red plutonic traps which have enveloped it and the prism has no easy inland slopes as a first glance suggests instead of being the seawall of a great plateau it falls abruptly to the east as well as to the west the country behind it shows a perspective of high and low hills lines of dark rock divided from one another by wadys of the usual exaggerated size of these minor heights only one the jebel elsahhárah looks down upon the sea rising between the dibbaghkhshabríyyah block to the north and the shárr to the south beyond the broken eastern ground the ruddy hismá and the gloomy harrah form the fitting horizon  after this much for geography we may view the monarch of midianite mountains in the beauty and the majesty of his picturesque form seen from elmuwaylah he is equally magnificent in the flush of morning in the still of noon and in the evening glow as the rays which suggested the obelisk are shooting over the southern crests leaving the basement blue with a tint between the amethyst and the lapis lazuli its northern third lies wrapped in a cloak of cold azure grey and its central length already dons a halflight of warmer hue meanwhile the side next the sun is flooded with an aerial aureole of subtle mist a drift of liquid gold a gush of living light rippling from the unrisen orb decreasing in warmth and brilliancy paling and fading and waxing faint with infinite gradations proportioned to the increase of distance again after the clear brooding sheen of day has set off the stark strength and grandeur of rockform contrasted with the brilliancy and sprightliness of sea the sinking sun paints the scene with the most gorgeous of blazonings the colours of the pale rockskeleton are so faint that there is nothing to interfere with the perfect development of atmospheric effects it is a white sheet spread to catch the grand illumination lambent lights of saffron and peachblossom and shades of purple and hyacinth as indescribably lovely is the afterglow the zodiacal light which may have originated the pyramid the lively pink reflection from the upper atmosphere the vast variety of tints with which the greens and the reds the purples and the fiery crimsons of the western sky tincture the receptive surface of the neutralhued granites and the chameleonshiftings of the dying day as it sinks into the arms of night nor less admirable are the feats of the fairy refraction the mighty curtain seems to rise and fall as if by magic it imitates as it were the framework of man in early morning the dancing of the air adds many a hundred cubits to its apparent stature it is now a giant when at midnight after the equipoise of atmospheric currents it becomes a dwarf replica of its former self                                    i had neglected to order overnight the camels from elmuwaylah a pennywise proceeding which delayed our departure it was nearly nine am march 13th before we left the mukhbir whose unhappies still sighed and yearned for the civilization and dissipation of suez landed at the head of the sharm yáhárr and marched up the wady hárr we were guided by two jeráfín sulayman ibn musallim and farj ibn awayz the former a model hillman a sturdy thicklegged hugecalved gruffvoiced fullbearded fellow hottempered goodhumoured and renowned as an ibexhunter his gun marked lazari coitinaz was a longbarrelled spanish musket degraded to a matchlock it had often changed hands probably by theft and the present owner declared that he had bought it for seventy dollarsnearly £15 yet its only luxury was the bottom of a breechloader brass cartridge inlaid and flanked by the sharp incisors of the little wabar or mountain coney these bedawin make gunpowder for themselves they find saltpetre in every cavern and they buy from egypt the sulphur which is found in their own hills  after a few minutes we left the hárr which drains the tallest of the inland hillockranges and the red block hamrá elmaysarah and we struck southeast into the wady sanawíyyah it is a vulgar valley with a novelty the tamrat faraj this cairn of brickcoloured boulders buttressing the right bank has or is said to have the memnonic property of emitting soundsyarinn is the bedawi word the boomings and bellowings are said to be loudest at sunrise and sunset the hideous hum of such subterraneous thunderings is alluded to by all travellers in the dalmatian island of melada and in the narenta valley the marvel has been accounted for by the escape of imprisoned air unequally expanded but a veil of mystery hangs over the wholeen18 the valleysides of dark trap were striped with white veins of heataltered argil the sole with black magnetic sand and patches of the bed were buttercupyellow with the handán dandelion the cytisus and the zaram panicum turgidum loved by camels their jaundiced hue contrasted vividly with the red and mauve blossoms of the boragine elkahlá the blue flowerets of the lavandula elzayti and the delicate green of the uselessen19 asphodel elborag which now gave a faint and shadowy aspect of verdure to the slopes although the rise was inconsiderable the importance of the vegetation palpably decreased as we advanced inland  after four miles we reached the wadyhead and wasted a couple of hours awaiting the camels that carried our supplies the path then struck over a stony divide with the hamrá to the left or north and on the other side the hamrá elmuarrash made familiar to us by our last march the latter ends in an isolated peak the jebel gharghúr which on our return was mistaken for the sulphurhill of jibbah presently we renewed acquaintance with the wady elbayzá whose lower course we had crossed south of sharm yáhárr here it is a long and broad white and treedotted expanse glaring withal and subtending all this section of the shárrs seafacing base we reached after a total of eight miles the jibál elkawáim or the perpendiculars one of the features which the bedawin picturesquely call the aulád elshárr sons of the sharr the three heads projected westwards from the umm furút peak and then trending northwards form a lateral valley a bay known as wady elkáimah it is a picturesque feature with its dark sands and red grit while the profile of no 3 head the káimat abú rákí shows a snubnosed face in a judicial wig the trees forming an apology for a beard i thought of buzfuz bovill  we camped early as the safh elshárr the plain of the shárr and the lateral valley were found strewed with quartzes white pink and deep slateblue the guides had accidentally mentioned a jebel elmarú and i determined to visit it next morning the night was warm and still the radiation of heat from the huge rockrange explained the absence of cold so remarkable during all this excursionhence the african traveller ever avoids camping near bare stones dew however wetted our boxes like thin rain the meteor remarked for the first time on march 13th will last they say three months and will greatly forward vegetation it seems to be uncertain or rather to be influenced by conditions which we had no opportunity of studying at times it would be exceptionally heavy and in other places it was entirely absent before evening new contractboots bought from the mukhbir were distributed to the soldiers and all the quarrymen who limped painfully on their poor bare feetnext day all wore their wellhidden old boots  early on march 14th we ascended the wady elkáimah which showed a singular spectacle and read us another lecture upon the diversity of formation which distinguishes this region an abrupt turn then led over rough ground the lower folds of the umm furút where a great granite gorge the nakb abú shár ran up to a depression in the dorsum an apparently practicable col suddenly the rocks assumed the quaintest hues and forms the quartz slatyblue and black was here spotted and streaked with a dull dead white as though stained by the droppings of myriad birds there it lay veined and marbled with the most vivid of rainbow colours reds and purples greens and yellows set off by the pale chalky white evident signs of work were remarked in a made road running up to the jebel elmarú proper whose strike is 38° mag and whose dip is westward it is an arête a cockscomb of snowy quartz some sixty feet high by fortyfive broad at the base crowning a granitic fold that descends abruptly with a deep fall on either side from the mother of plenty this strangely isolated wall left standing by the denudation that swept away the containing stone had been broken by perpendicular rifts into four distinct sections the colour became whiter as it neared the coping and each rock was crowned with a capping that sparkled like silver in the sudden glance of the cloudcompelling sun the sight delighted us and m lacaze here made one of his most effective croquis showing the explorers reduced to the size of ants as yet we had seen nothing of the kind nor shall we see a similar vein till we reach abúlmarwah near our farthest southern point i expected a corresponding formation upon the opposite eastern versant we found only a huge crest a spine of black plutonic rock intensely ugly and repulsive as we rode back down the valley of the perpendiculars the aspect of the jebel elmarú was épâtantto use another favourite campword standing sharply out from its vague and gloomy background made gloomier by the morning mists the col whose steep raincut slopes and sole were scattered with dark trees and darker rocks this glittering wall became the shell of an enchanted castle in gustave doré  returning to our old campingground after a ride of three hours and thirty minutes  nine miles we crossed two short divides and descended the wady elkusayb which gives a name to sharp peak here a few formless stoneheaps and straggling bushes represented the ruins the gardens of palms and the bullrushes of the bedawi shepherd ladsen20 our tents had been pitched in the rondpoint of the wady surr which before had given us hospitality february 19th on a safh or high bouldery ledge of the left bank where it receives the broad kusayb watercourse the day had been sultry the sun was a rain sun while the clouds massed thick to the southwest and at night the lamps of heaven shone with a reddish lurid light the tentpegs were weighted with camelboxes against the storm nevertheless our messtent was levelled in a moment by the howling northeasterwarm withalwhich setting in about midnight made all things uncomfortable enough  whilst the caravan was ordered to march straight up the noble wady surr we set off next morning at six am up the wady malíh the northeastern branch of the bulge in the bed a few arab tents were scattered about the bushes above the mouth and among the yelping curs was a smokyfaced tyke which might have been eskimobredhereabouts poor brahim had been lost and was not fated to be found a crosscountry climb led to the jebel malíh whose fame for metallic wealth gave us the smallest expectationshitherto all our discoveries came by surprise a careful examination showed nothing at all but a few days afterwards glorious specimens of cast copper were brought in the bedawi declaring that he had found them amongst the adjoining hills in the reentering angles of the subjacent wady the thrust of a stick is everywhere followed by the reappearance of storedup rain and the sole shows a large puddle of brackish and polluted water perhaps the malayh of the bedawin may mean the salt málih not the pleasant malíh malíh or mallih is also the name of a plant the reaumuria vernice of forskâl  resuming our ride up the torrentbed and crossing to the wady daumah of the single daumpalm we dragged our mules down a ladder of rock and boulder the left bank of the upper surr the great valley now defines sharply as a knifecut the northernmost outlines of the shárr whose apex elkusayb towered above our heads thorntrees are abundant fanpalm bush grows in patches and we came upon what looked like a flowing stream ruffled by the morning breeze the guides declared that it is a rainpool dry as a bone in summer presently the rocky bed made a sharp turn and its gate opened upon another widening the meeting place of four wadys the northern being the wady zibayyib that drains ruddy abálbárid  after a short halt to examine the rude ruins reported by mr clarkeen21 we resumed the ascent of the surr whose left bank still defines the eastern edge of the shárr the latter presently puts forth the jagged spine of black and repulsive plutonic rock which notes the shab makhúl the corresponding versant of the nakb abú shar the bedawin who as usual luxuriate in nomenclature distinguish between the eastern and western faces of the same block and between the wadys of the scarp and the counterscarp for instance the eastern front of the ras elkusayb is called abú kurayg kurayj this is natural as the formations often of a different material show completely different features  a little further on the continuity of the right bank is broken by the wady elhámah it receives the wady khshabríyyah which bifurcating in the upper bed drains the dibbagh and the umm jedayl blocks and in the fork lie we were told the ruins of elfara some five hours march from this section of the surr at the confluence of elhámah we found the camels grazing and the tents pitched without orders the two shaykhs were determined to waste another day so they were directed to reload while we breakfasted everything was in favour of a long march the dusty gusty northeaster had blown itself out in favour of a pleasant southerly wind a sea breeze deflected from the west  after marching three miles we camped at the foot of the ridge to be ascended next morning the place is called safhat elmuayrah from a slaty schistose hill on the eastern bank the guides declared that the only practicable line to the summit was from this place and that the shabs cols generally cannot be climbed even by the arabsi have reason to believe the reverse musallim an old bedawi brought amongst other specimens from the adjacent atelier the mashghal elmuayrah a bright bead about the size of no 5 shot in the evening dusk it was taken for gold and it already aroused debates concerning the proper direction of the promised reward fifty dollars the morning light showed fine copper here free metal was distinctly traceable in the scoriæ and it was the first time that we had seen slag so carelessly worked not a little merriment was caused by the ostentatious display of goldstones marked by m philipins coppernailed boots sulaymán the bedawi had killed a wabar whose sadly mutilated form appeared to be that of the syrian hill coney these men split the bullet into four pot at the shortest distance and of course blow to pieces any small game they may happen to hit  early on march 16th we attacked the shárr in a general direction from north to south where the ascent looked easy enough on the left bank a porphyritic block up whose side a mule can be ridden is disposed in a slope of the palest and most languid of greens broken by piles of black rock so regular as to appear artificial this step leads to a horizontal crest a broken wall forming its summit it is evidently an outlier and experience asked what will be behind it the more distant plane showed only the heads of the shenázir or pins the two quaint columns which are visible as far as the shárr itself this lower block is bounded north and south by gorges fissures that date from the birth of the mountain deepened by age and raging torrents apparently they offered no passage in the former direction yawns the rushúh abú tinázib so called from its growththe tanzubtreeen22 sodada decidua and in the latter the sháb umm khárgah khárjah i should have preferred a likely looking nakb south of this southern gorge but the bedawin and especially abú khartúm who had fed his camels and sheep upon the mountain overruled me  the ascent of the outlier occupied three very slow hours spent mostly in prospecting and collecting at nine am we stood 3200 feet above sealevel aner 2679 high enough to make our tents look like bits of white macadam what most struck us was the increased importance of the vegetation both in quantity and quality the result doubtless of more abundant dew and rain as well as of shade from each passing mistcloud the view formed a startling contrast of fertility and barrenness at every hundred yards the growths of the plain became more luxuriant in the rich humus filling the fissures and contrary to the general rule the plants especially the sorrel rumex and the dandelion taraxacum instead of dwindling gained in stature the strongsmelling ferula looked like a bush and the sarh grew into a tree the araren23 a homely hawthorn hawthornleaved rhus whose appearance was a surprise equalled the cratgus of syria and the upper heights must have been a forest of fine junipers habíbah  juniperus phnicea with trunks thick as a mans body the guides spoke of wild figs but we failed to find them our chasseurs who had their guns eagerly conned over the traces of ibex and hyenas and the earths as well as the large round footprints of un léopard but none of the larger animals were seen the bedawi matchlock has made them wary chance might give a shot the first day on the other hand skill might be baffled for a month or twoi passed six weeks upon the antilibanus before seeing a bear the noble shinnárpartridge again appeared an eagles feather lay on the ground two white papillons and one yellow butterfly reminded me of the camarones mountain the wild bee and the ladybirdlike baúzah stuck to us as though they loved us and we were pestered by the attentions of the common fly the egyptian symbol for paul pry is supposed to denote an abundance of organic matter it musters strong throughout midian even in the dreariest wastes and it accompanies us everywhere whole swarms riding upon our backs  the only semblance of climbing was over the crest of brown burnished and quartzless traps even there the hands were hardly required although our poor feet regretted the want of spartellesen24 here the track debouched upon an inverted arch with a hill or rather a tall and knobby outcrop of rock on either flank of the keystone the inland or eastward view was a map of the region over which we had travelled a panorama of little chains mostly running parallel with the great range and separated from it by wadys lateral oblique and perpendicular of these torrentbeds some were yellow others pink and others faint sickly green with decomposed trap whilst all bore a fair growth of thorntreesacacias and mimosas high over and beyond the monarch of the shafah mountains jebel sahhárah whose blue poll shows far out at sea ran the red levels of the hismá backed at a greater elevation by the blackblue harrah the whole tihámah range now so familiar to us assumed a novel expression the staple material proved to be blocks and crests of granite protruding from the younger plutonics which enfolded and enveloped their bases and backs the one exception was the dwarf umm jedayl a heap composed only of grey granite the jebel khshabríyyah in the dibbagh block attracted every eye the head was supported by a neck swathed as with an oldfashioned cravat  the summit of the outlier is tolerably level and here the shepherds had built small hollow piles of dry stone in which their newly yeaned lambs are sheltered from the rude blasts the view westwards or towards the sea which is not seen almost justifies by its peculiarity the wild traditions of built wells of a moaning mountain and of furnaces upon the loftiest slopes it is notable that the higher we went the less we heard of these features which at last vanished into thin air our platform is as i suspected cut off from the higher plane by a dividing gorge but the depth is only three hundred feet and to the south it is bridged by a connecting ridge beyond it rises the great mask of granite forming the apex a bonier skeleton than any before seen down the northern sheetrocks trickled a thin stream that caught the suns eye thus the ravine is well supplied with water in two places south of it rises a tempting col with a slope apparently easy separating a dull mass of granite on the right from the peculiar formation to the left the latter is a dome of smooth polished and slippery grey granite evidently unpleasant climbing and from its landward slope rise abrupt as if handbuilt two isolated gigantic pins which can hardly measure less than four hundred feet in stature they are the remains of a sharp granitic comb whose apex was once the parrots beak the mass formerly mammilated has been broken and denticulated by the destruction of softer strata already the lower crest bounding the shab umm khárgah shows perpendicular fissures which when these huge columns shall be gnawed away by the tooth of time will form a new range of pillars for the benefit of those ascending the shárr let us say in about ad 10000 such are the pins which name the mountain and which concealed from the coast make so curious a show to the north south and east of this petrified glacier  after breaking their fast mm clarke lacaze and philipin volunteered to climb the tempting col none of them had ever ascended a mountain and they duly despised the obstacles offered by big rocks distancedwarfed to pavingstones and of sharp angles especially the upper perspectiveblunted to easy slopes however all three did exceeding well for such a forlorn hope young recruits are better than old soldiers they set out at eleven am and lost no time in falling asunder whilst the quarrymen who accompanied them with the waterskins shirked work as usual lagged behind sat and slept in some snug hollow and returned when deadtired of slumber declaring that they had missed the effendis  m philipin took singly the sloping side of the connecting ridge and turning to the right made straight for the pins below which was spread a fleck of lean and languid green the ascent was comparatively mild except where it became a sheet of smooth and slippery granite but when he reached a clump of large junipers his course was arrested by a bergschrund which divides this blockevidently a second outlierfrom the apex of the shárr the dome and the parrots beak it was vain to attempt a passage of the deep gash with perpendicular upper walls and lower slopes overgrown with vegetation nor could he advance to the right and rejoin his companions who were parted from him by the precipices on the near side of the col consequently he beat a retreat and returned to us at 230 pm after three hours and thirty minutes of exceedingly thirsty work the air felt brisk and cool but the sun shone pitilessly unveiled by the smallest scrap of mist he brought with him an ibexhorn still stained with blood and a branch of juniper straight enough to make an excellent walkingstick  the other two struck across the valley and at once breasted the couloir leading to the col where we had them well in sight they found the ascent much harder on the collar than they expected fortunately the sole of the huge gutter yielded a trickle of water the upper part was to their naive surprise mere climbing on all fours and they reached the summit visible from our haltingplace in two hours here they also were summarily stopped by perpendicular rocks on either side and by the deep gorge or crevasse shedding seawards and landwards upon whose further side rose the parrots beak the time employed would give about two thousand feet not including the ascent from the valley three hundred feet and thus their highest point could hardly be less than 5200 feet allowing another thousand for the apex which they could not reachen25 the altitude of the shárr would be between 6000 and 6500 feet  the shadows were beginning to lengthen before the two reappeared and the delay caused no small apprehension the sayyid showed a kindly agitation that was quite foreign to his calm and collected demeanour when threatened by personal danger to be benighted amongst these cruel mountains must be no joke nor would it have been possible to send up a tent or even mouthmunition however before the sun had reached the west they came back triumphant with the spoils of war one was a snake echis colorata günther found basking upon the stones near the trickle of water it hissed at them and when dying it changed colour they declared like a chameleonthat night saw it safely in the spirittin they were loaded with juniper boughs and fortunately they had not forgotten the berries the latter establish the identity of the tree with the common asiatic species m lacaze brought back several alpine plants a small helix which he had found near the summit and copious scrawls for future croquishis studies of the pins and the dome were greatly admired at cairo  ere the glooms of night had set in we found ourselves once more at the tents only one man suffered from the ascent and his sunstroke was treated in egyptian fashion instead of bleeding like that terrible murderous italian school of sangrados the fellahs tie a string tightly round the head and after sunsetwhich is considered de rigueurthey fill the ears with strong brine according to them the band causes a bunch of veins to swell in the forehead and when pressed hard it bursts like a pistolshot the cure is evidently effected by the cold saltandwater the evening ended happily with the receipt of a mail and with the good news that the sinnár corvette had been sent to take the place of elmukhbir the unfortunate once more we felt truly grateful to the viceroy and the prince who so promptly and so considerately had supplied all our wants and whose kindness would convert our southern cruise into a holiday gîte without the imminent deadly risk of a burst boiler  we set out in high spirits on the next morning 615 am march 17th riding still southwards up the surr the stony broken surface now showed that we were fast approaching its source beyond the umm khárgah gorge on the western bank rose a tall head the ras elrukabíyyah and beyond it was a ravine in which palms and water are said to be found the opposite side raised its monotonous curtain of green and red traps whose several projections bore the names of jebel elwuayrahthe hill behind our campinggroundjebel elmaín and jebel sháhitah a little beyond the latter debouched the darb elkufl road of caravans alias darb elashárif road of the sherifs a winding gap the old line of the egyptian pilgrims by which the sulaymáyyán bedawin still wend their way to suez the second name perhaps conserves the tradition of longpast wars waged between the descendants of the apostle and the beni ukbahen26 the broad mouth was dotted with old graves with quartzcapped memorialcairns and here and there with a block bearing some tribal mark the wadysole grew a stinkhorn held to be poisonous and called from its fetor faswat elagúz cynophallus impudicus one specimen was found on the tip of an ibexhorn and the other had been impaled with a stick after two hours and thirty minutes  seven miles we sighted the head of the wady surr proper whose influents drain the southern khurayatah or hismá pass here the amount of green surface and the number of birds especially the bluerock and the insectimpaling butcher whose nests were in the thin forest of thorntrees argue that water is not far off the ras wady surr is a charming haltingplace  our arabs worked hard to gain another day the only tolerable pass rounding the southern shárr was they declared the wady aújar an influent of the wady zahakán near zibá the col elkuwayd now within a few yards of us is so terrible that the unfortunate camels would require before they could attempt it at least twentyfour hours of preparatory rest and rich feeding and so forth however we pushed them on with flouts and jeers and we ourselves followed at eleven am  the pass proved to be one of the easiest it began with a gradual rise up a short broad wady separating the southernmost counterforts of the shárr from the north end of the jebel elghuráb this raven mountain is a line of similar but lower formation which virtually prolongs the great landmark down coast the bottom was dotted with lumps of pure marú washed from the upper levels we reached the summit in forty minutes and the seaward slope beyond it was a large outcrop of quartz in situ that assumed the strangest appearancea dull dead chalkywhite looking as if heataltered or mixed with clay the rockladder leading to the lower wady kuwayd which has an upper branch of the same name offered no difficulty to man or beast and the aneroid showed its height to be some 470 feet 28132850 the caravan having preceded us revenged itself by camping at the nearest pool distant nineteen and a half direct geographical miles from our destination  this day was the first of the khamsín or as m loufti  a coptic student writes it khamasín from khama warm and sina airen27 the midianites call it eldaufún the hot blasts and expect it to blow at intervals for a couple of months this scirocco has been modified in egypt at least during the spring apparently by the planting of trees about a quartercentury ago its regular course was three days on the first it set in the second was its worst and men knew that it would exhaust itself on the third now it often lasts only a single day and even that short period has breaks  the site of the camp made sleep wellnigh impossiblea bad preparation for the only long ride of this excursion setting off at dark 420 am march 18th we finished the monotonous wady kuwayd which mouths upon the rolling ground falling coastwards the track then struck to the northwest across and sometimes down the network of wadys that subtends the southwestern shárrtheir names have already been mentioned as we sighted the cool greenblue sea its horizonline appeared prodigiously uplifted as if the fountains of the great deep were ready for another deluge i remembered the inevitable expressions of surprise with which young alpinists and ballooners expecting the rim of the visible circle to fall away see it rising around them in saucershape the cause is simply that which breaks the stick in water and which elevates the sharr every morningrefraction  after a march of seven hours  twentytwo miles we debouched viâ the wady hárr upon our old sharm the latter showing for the first time since its creation two warsteamers with their tender a large sambúk the boats did not long keep us waiting and we were delighted to tread once more the quarterdeck of the corvette sinnár captain ali bey shukris place had been taken by captain hasanbey an osmanli of cavala who having been fortyeight years in the service sighed for his pension he did however everything in his power to make us feel at home and the evening ended with a fantasia of a more pronounced character than anything that i had yet seenen28           résumé of the march through eastern or central midian    our journey through eastern or central midian lasted eighteen days february 19march 8 with an excursion of six march 1318 to its apex the mighty shárr which i would add to our exploration of central midian despite enforced slow marches at the beginning of the first section we visited in round numbers according to my itinerary 197 miles lieutenant amirs map gives a linear length of 222 miles not including the offsets the second part covered fiftyfive miles besides the ascent of the mountain to a height of about five thousand feet the mapper also increased this figure to 59 23 thus the routeline shows a grand total of 252 to 281 23 in direct statute miles the number of camels engaged from shaykhs alayán and hasan was sixtyone and the hire according to mr clarke represented £147 6s 6d not including the £40 of which we were plundered by the bandit maázah the ascent of the shárr also cost £40 making a grand total of £187 6s 6d  the march to the hismá gave us a fair idea of the three main formations of madyan which lie parallel and east of one another1 the sandy and stony maritime region the foothills of the gháts granites and traps with large veins and outcrops of quartz and wadys lined with thick beds of conglomerate 2 the jibál eltihámah the majestic range that bounds the seaboard inland with its broad valleys and narrow gorges forming the only roads 3 the jibál elshafah or interior ridge the lip of northwestern arabia in fact the boundarywall of the nejd plateau  the main object of this travel was to ascertain the depth from west to east of the quartzformations which had been worked by the ancients i had also hoped to find a virgin region lying beyond elharrah the volcanic tract subtending the east of the hismá or plateau of new red sandstone we ascertained by inquiry that the former has an extent wholly unsuspected by dr wallin and by the first expedition and that a careful examination of it is highly desirable but we were stopped upon the very threshold of the hismá by the maázah a tribe of brigands which must be subjected to discipline before the province of madyan can be restored to its former status  this northern portion had been visited by dr wallin the other twothirds of the march lay i believe over untrodden ground we brought back details concerning the three great parallel wadys the salmá the dámah that arabian arcadia and the aslahaznab we dug into and made drawings and plans of the two principal ruined cities shuwák and shaghab which probably combined to form the classical greek and of the two less important sites elkhandaki and umm Ámil  the roads of this region and indeed of all midian are those of iceland without her bogs and snows for riding considerations we may divide them into four kinds  1 wadythe fiumara or nullah called by travellers winterbrook and dry riverbed it is a channel without water formed probably by secular cooling and contraction of the earths surface like the fissures which became true streams in the tropics and in the higher temperate zones its geological age would be the same as the depressions occupied by the ocean and the massive eruptions forming the mountainskeleton of the globe both the climate and the vegetation of midian must have changed immensely if these huge features many of them five miles broad were ever full of water in modern days after the heaviest rains a thin thread meanders down a wilderness of bed  the wadyformation shows great regularity near the mouth its loose sands are comfortable to camels and distressing to man and mule the gravel of the higher section is good riding the upper part is often made impassable by large stones and overfalls of rock and the head is a mere couloir flaked clay or mud show the thalweg and the honeycombed ground always above the line of highest water the homes of the ant beetle jerboa lizard and girdi rat will throw even the cautious camel  2 ghadírthe basin where rainwater sinks it is mostly a shining bald flat of hard yellow clay as admirable in dry as it is detestable in wet weather  3 majráhere pronounced maghráhen29the divide literally the place of flowing it is the best ground of all especially where the yellow or brown sands are overlaid by hard gravel or by a natural metalling of trap and other stones  4 warthe broken stony surface over which camels either cannot travel or travel with difficulty it is the horror of the bedawi and when he uses the word it usually means that it causes man to dismount it may be of two kinds either the majrá proper divide or the nakb pass and the latter may safely be left to the readers imagination  the partial ascent of the mighty shárr gave an admirable study of the mode in which the granites have been enfolded and enveloped by the later eruptions of trap nor less curious also was it to remark how upon this arabian alp vegetation became more important increasing contrary to the general rule not only in quantity but in size and changing from the date and the daum to the strong smelling ferula the homely hawthorn and the tall and balmy junipertree there is game ibex and leopard in these mountains but the traveller unless a man of leisure must not expect to shoot or even to sight it                                chapter xiv down southto elwijhnotes on the quarantinethe hutaym tribe    there remained work to do before we could leave elmuwaylah the two shaykhs alayán and hasan elukbi were to be paid off end dismissed with due ceremony provisions were to be brought from the fort to the cove useless implements to be placed in store mules to be embarkedno joke without a pierand last but not least the ballastless mukhbir was to be despatched with a mail for suez the whole expedition except only the sick left at the fort was now bound southwards the sayyid and our friend furayj accepted formal invitations to accompany us bukhayt my shadow with husayn chef and romancergeneral were shipped as their henchmen and a score of soldiers and quarrymen represented the escort and the workinghands briefly the sinnár though fretting her vitals out at the delay was detained two days march 1920 in the sharm yáhárr amongst other things that consoled us for quitting the snug dock was the total absence of fish at this season the shoals leave the coast and gather round their wonted spawninggrounds the deep waters near the shab reefs where they find luxuriant growths of seaweed and where no ships disturb them  bidding a temporary adieu to our old fellow voyagers on board the mukhbir including the excellent engineer mr david duguid we steamed out of the quiet cove at a somewhat late hour 630 am on march 21st and dashing into the dark and slaty sea stood to the southeast for two days the equinoctial weather had been detestable dark cloudy and so damp that the dry and the wet bulbs showed a difference of only 4°5° this morning too the fire of colour had suddenly gone out and the heavens were hung with a gloomy curtain the great shárr looming unusually large and tall in the scandinavian mountainscene grey of shadow and glancing with sungleams that rent the thick veils of mistcloud assumed a manner of ossianic grandeur after three hours and a half we were abreast of zibá around whose dumpy tower all the population had congregated thence the regular coralline bank whose beach is the bab runs some distance down coast allowing passage to our ugly old friend wady salmá the next important mouth is the wady amúd showing two sambúks at anchor and a long line of vegetation like the palmstrips of the akabah gulf this valley i have said receives the mutadán into which the abú marwah gorge dischargesen30  it would appear that this amúd represents the wady elaúníd a name utterly unknown to the modern arabs citizens and bedawin at least as far south as elhaurá yet it is famed amongst mediaeval geographers for its fine haven with potable water and for its flourishing city where honey was especially abundant elidrísí settles the question of its site by placing it on the coast opposite the island elnamán numán but can elidrísí be trusted sprenger p 24 induced it would appear by similarity of sound and justly observing that in arabic the letters ayn and ghayn are often interchanged would here place the greek rhaunathi vicus of ptolemy north lat 25 degrees 40 according to my friend also the ras abú masárib the long thin point north of which the wady dámah halfway to the wady azlam falls in represents the greek chersónesi extrema on the same parallel i cannot help suspecting that both lie further southin fact somewhere about el hauráen31  here the maritime heights known as the jibál mountains of the tihámatbalawiyyah of the baliyy tribe recede from the sea and become mere hills and hillocks yet the continuity of the chain is never completely broken at noon we slipped into the channel about a mile and a half broad which separates the mainland from the jebel mount numán as the island is called so the arabs speak of jebel never jezírat hassánien32 the surface of the water was like oil after the cross seas on all sides the tail of an old gale which the arab pilots call bahr madfún buried sea corresponding with the italian mar vecchio on our return northwards we landed upon numán whose name derives from the redflowered euphorbia retusa bathed despite the school of sharks occupying the waters around collected botany and examined the ground carefully like the dalmatian archipelago it once formed part of the mainland probably separated by the process that raised the maritime range the rolling sandy plateau and the dwarf wadys are strewed with trap and quartz neither of which could have been generated by the new sandstones and the yellow corallines it has two fine bays facing the shore and admirably defended from all winds the southern not a little resembles sináfircove  the top or dwarf plateau commands a fine view of the coast scenery the pins of the shárr the mutadán mountain twin ridges of grey white granite and further south the darker forms of raydán and zigláb here during springtide the huwaytát transport their flocks in the light craft called katirah and feed them till the pasture is browsed down we made extensive inquiries but could hear of no ruins yet the islet some three to four miles long by one broad forming a natural breakwater to the coast is important enough to bear according to sprenger a classical name the greek timagenis insula of ptolemy if this be the case either the pelusian or his manuscripts are greatly in error he places the bank in north lat 25° 45 whilst its centre would be in north lat 27° 5 and the sixty miles of distance from the coast evidently the blunder of a copyist must be reduced to a maximum of three  passing another old friend the aslahaznab down whose head we had ridden to shaghab about two pm we steamed along the mouth of the wady azlam the ezlam of wellsteden33 which he unduly makes the southern frontier of the huwaytát and the northern of the baliyy tribes beyond it is the gape of the once populous wady dukhánof the furnace smokefaced by a large splay of treegrown sand ruins are reported in its upper bed beyond marsá zubaydah not zebaider the sea is bordered by the redyellow coastrange and the fretted sky line of peaks and cones horses and hogsbacks is cut by deep valleys and drained by dark gates the background presents a long regular curtain of black hill whose white sheets and veins may be granite and quartz we were then shown the mínat elmarrah one of the many wadymouths grown with vegetation and here the ruins elnabagah nabakah are spoken of at four pm we doubled the ras labayyiz not lebayhad a long flat tongue projecting from the coast range and defending its valley to the south in the farat or upper part some five hours march from the mouth lie important remains of the mutakkadimín ancients the report was confirmed by an old arab báshbuzúk at elwijh he declared that in his youth he had seen a tall furnace and a quantity of scoriæ from which copper could be extracted lying northwards at a distance of eighteen hours march and five by sea  the next important feature is the wady salbah the telbah of the chart up whose inland continuation the wady elnejd we shall travel here the coastrange again veers off eastward and the regular line is cut up into an outbreak of dwarf cones mere thimbles above the gloomy range that bounds it southwards appear the granitic peaks and pins of jebel libn gleaming white and pale in the livid halflight of a cloudy sunset after twelve hours steaming over seventy to seventytwo knots of reefy sea we ran carefully into the sharm dumayghahen34 this lakelike landlocked cove is by far the best of the many good dockharbours which break the midian coast its snug retreat gave hospitality to half a dozen juhayni sambúks fishers and divers for motherofpearl riding beyond sight of the outer world and utterly safe from the lighthouse dues of elwijh  i resolved to pass a day at these old quarters of a certain háji abdullah the hydrographers have given enlarged plans of yáhárr and jibbah ports close to each other while they have ignored the far more deserving sharm dumayghah distant only thirty miles of coasting navigation a line almost clear of reefs and shoals it is the natural harbour for the pilgrimships which ever run the danger of being wrecked at elwijh and it deserves more notice than we have hitherto vouchsafed to it the weather also greatly improved on the next day march 22nd the cloudcanopy the excessive moisture and the still sultriness which had afflicted us since march 19th were in process of being swept away by the strong cool bright norther  the survey of the egyptian officers shows an oval extending from northwest to southeast with four baylets or bulges in the northern shore the length is upwards of a knot and the breadth twelve hundred yards it may be described as the embouchure of the wady dumayghah which falls into its head and which doubtless in olden times when the land was wooded used to roll a large and turbulent stream as is often seen on this coast the entrance is defended by a natural breakwater which appears like a dot upon the chart capped with brown crust falling bluff inland and sloping towards the main where the usual stoneheaps act as seamarks this bank of yellowishwhite coralline measuring 310 metres by half that width may be the remains of the bed in which the torrents carved out the port the northern inlet is a mere ford of green water my pilgrimage made the mistake of placing a fairway passage on either side of the islet the southern channel twentyfive fathoms deep and three hundred metres broad is garnished on both flanks with a hundred metres of dangerous shallow easily distinguished by green blazoned upon blue the bay is shoal to the southeast the best anchorage for ships lies to the northwest almost touching land a reef or rock is reported to be in the middle ground where we lay with ten fathoms under us it was seen they say at night by the aid of lanterns but next morning lieutenants amir and yusuf were unable to find it native craft usually make fast in three fathoms to a lumpy natural mole of modern sandstone north of the entrance a little trimming would convert it into a firstrate pier  at this place we landed to prospect the country and to gather information from the sambúk crews before they had time to hoist sail and be off the owners of the land are not juhaynah the wild men with whom the rais of the golden wire had threatened us in 1853 the country belongs to the baliyy now an inoffensive tribe well subject to egypt mixed with a few kuraánhuwaytát and karáizahhutaym the fishermen complained that no fish was to be caught and the strong tides setting upon the stony flank of the mole had broken most of the shells not including however the oysters the usual eightribbed turtle appeared to be common on the sands to the north m lacaze picked up a large old and bleached skull which went into my collection we failed to find any neighbouring burialground striking inland however towards the dotted square marked fort ruin in the chart we came upon an ancient cemetery to the north of the bay and concluded that these graves had been mistaken for remains of building  we then bent eastward towards the jibál elsalbah and examined the two dwarf valleys which threading the heights feed the wady dumayghah that to the south showed us a perfectly familiar formation conglomerates of waterrolled pebbles in the lower levels and hills of the normal dark porphyries with large quartzseams of many colours trending in every direction the mouth of the northern gorge was blocked by a vein of finely crystallized carbonate of lime containing geodes and bunches the taste is astringent probably from the alumina and it is based upon outcrops of a sandy calcaire apparently fit for hydraulic cement the only novelty in the vegetation was the fashaktree a creeper like a gigantic constrictor with sweet yellow wood somewhat resembling liquorice  signs of arab everywhere appeared but there were no tents consequently we were unable to ascertain the extent of the watersupplyan important matter if this is to become the port of elwijh the sambúks might bring it but the people on shore would be dependent upon what they can find the hajjroad running some miles inland is doubtless supplied with it even however were the necessary wanting the pilgrimships whilst taking refuge here could easily transport it from the south shaykh furayj pointed out to us the far northern blue peaks of the amúd zafar in whose branchwady lie the ruins of mjirmah the day ended with a sudden trembling of the ship as if straining at anchor but the crew was again performing fantasia and the earthquake or seaquake rolled unheededly away apparently the direction was from north to south i noted the hour 910 pm and the duration twenty seconds according to the arabs the zilzilah is not uncommon in midian especially about the vernal equinox on this occasion it ended the spell of damp and muggy weather which began on march 19th and which may have been connected with it  the survey soundings were not finished till nearly eight am march 23rd when the old corvette swung round on her heel and with the black hills of salbah to port resumed her rolling rollicking way southwards her only ballast consisted of some six hundred conical shot or twelve tons for a ship of eight hundred after one hour of steaming  seven miles we passed the green mouth of the wady antar in whose istabl stable or upper valleycourse the pilgrimagecaravan camps it drains a small inland feature to the northeast the true jebel antar which the hydrographic chart has confounded with the great block applying moreover the term istabl to the height instead of the hollow this jebel libn along which we are now steaming is a counterpart on a small scale a little brother of the shárr measuring 3733 instead of 6000 to 6500 feet we first see from the north a solid block capped with a mural crown of three peaks when abreast of us the range becomes a tall fissured and perpendicular wall this apical comb bluff to the west reposes upon a base sloping at the angle of rest to the environing sandy wady to complete the resemblance even the queer pins are not wanting and i should expect to find in it all the accidents of the giant of elmuwaylah  the complexion of the libn which the people pronounce libin suggests grey granite profusely intersected with white quartz hence probably the name identical with lebanon and libanusthe milk mountain the title covers a multitude of peaks the bedawin have doubtless their own terms for every head and every hollow the citizens comprehensively divide the block into two elÁli the upper being its southern and elasfal the lower its northern section it is said to abound in water and a nakhil dategrove is described as growing near the summit the hutaym who own most of it claim the lover and heropoet antar as one of their despised tribehence probably his connection with the adjoining mountain and the stable  jebel libin is the great feature of the tihámatbalawíyyah for many days it will appear to follow us and this is the proper place for assigning its rank and status to it about elakabah the northern head of the gháts or coastrange we have prospected the single chain of jebel shará the saar of the tribes of the shasu bedawinen35 in the papyri and the hebrew mount seir the rough or rugged further south we have noted how this tall eastern bulwark of the great wady elarabah bifurcates forming the shafah chain to the east and westward of it in madyan proper the jibál eltihámah of which the shárr is perhaps the culmination we have noted the accidents of the latter as far as dumayghah cove and now we descry in the offing the misty formshow small they lookof the jebel elward the jibál elsafhah the two blocks south of the wady hamz known as the jibál elrál and their neighbours still included in the tihámatbalawíyyah lastly we shall sight behind elhaurá the abú ghurayr and a number of blocks which like the former are laid down but are not named in the chart  beyond elhaurá the chain stretches southwards its mighty links with smaller connections the first is the bold range jebel radwah the yambo hills of the british sailor some six thousand feet high and lying twentyfive miles behind the new porten36 passing it to left on the route to elmedínah i heard the fables which imposed upon abyssinian bruce all sorts of arabian fruits grew to perfection on the summit of these hills it is the paradise of the people of yenbo those of any substance having countryhouses there this was hardly probable in bruces day and now it is impossible the mountain is held by the beni harb a most turbulent tribe for which see my pilgrimageen37 their head shaykh sad the robber who still flourished in 1853 is dead but he has been succeeded by one of his sons shaykh hudayfah who is described with simple force as being a dog more biting than his sire between these illfamed haunts of the beni harb and jeddah rises the jebel subh a mountain remarkable for its magnitude 4500 feet inhabited by the beni subh a fighting clan of the sons of battle  the largest links of these westarabian gháts are of whitegrey granite veined and striped with quartz and they are subtended inland by the porphyritic traps of the jibál elshafah which we shall trace to the parallel of elhamz the end of egypt i cannot however agree with wellsted ii xii that the ridges increase in height as they recede from the sea nor that the veins of quartz run horizontally through the dark granite the greater altitudes three to six thousand feet are visible from an offing of forty to seventy miles and they are connected by minor heights some of these however are considerable and here and there they break into detached pyramids all are maritime now walling the shore like the tayyib ism then sheering away from it where a broad false coast has been built by time  these western gháts then run down either in single or in double line the whole length of occidental arabia and meeting a similar and equally important eastern line they form a mighty nucleus the mountains of elyemen after carefully inspecting and making close inquiries concerning a section of some five hundred miles i cannot but think that the mines of precious ores mentioned by the mediæval arabian geographersen38 lay and lie in offsets from the flanks either of the maritime or the inland chain that is either in the tihámah the coast lowlands or in the elnejd the highland plateau of the interior  what complicates the apparently simple ground is the long line of volcanic action which forming the eastern frontier of the plutonic granites and of the modern grits may put forth veins even to the shores of the akabah gulf and the red seaen39 the length known to me by inquiry would be about three degrees between north lat 28° and 25° the latter being the parallel of elmedínah others make them extend to near yambú in north lat 24° 5 they may stretch far to the north and connect as has been suggested with the syrian centres of eruption discovered by the palestine exploration i have already explaineden40 how and why we were unable to visit the harrah lying east of the hismá but we repeatedly saw its outlines and determined that the lay is from northwest to southeast further south as will be noticed at elhaurá the vertebrae curve seawards or to the southwest and seem to mingle with the main range the mountains of the tihámatjahaníyyah of the juhaynah thus the formation assumes an importance which has never yet been attributed to it and the five several harrahs reported to me by the bedawin must be studied in connection with the mineralogical deposits of the chains in contact with them it must not be forgotten that a fragment of porous basalt picked up by the first expedition near makná yielded a small button of golden41  dreadfully rolled the sinnár as she ran close inshore before the long heavy swell from the northwest and the old saying bon rouleur bon marcheur is cold consolation to an active man made to idle malgré lui this section of the coast unlike that to the north is remarkably free from reefs a little relief was felt while sheltered by the short tract of channel between the mainland and the shoals but the nuisance returned in force as doubling the ras muraybit not marabat we sighted the two towers of elwijh both beflagged the round burj of the fort and the cubical whitewashed lighthouse crowning its rocky point and we were quiet once more when the sinnár having covered the thirty miles in four hours and thirty minutes cast anchor in the usual place southeast of the northern jaw the main objection to our berth is that the prevailing north wind drives in a rolling sea from the open west the log showed a total of 102 miles between the sharms yáhárr and elwijh or 107 from the latter to elmuwaylah  elwijh meaning the face a word which the egyptian fellah perverts to wish lies in north lat 26° 14 it is the northernmost of the townlets on the west arabian shore which gain importance as you go south eg yambá jeddah mocha and aden it was not wholly uncivilized during my first visit a quarter of a century ago when i succeeded in buying opium for feeble patients distant six stations from yambá and ten from elmedínah it has been greatly altered and improved the pilgrimcaravan which here did penance of quarantine till the last two years has given it a masonry pier for landing the unfortunates to encamp upon the southern or uninhabited side of the cove a tall and wellbuilt lighthouse now five years old boasts of a good french lantern wanting only soap and decent oil finally guardhouses and bakehouses already falling to ruins like the mole and an establishment for condensing water still kept in working order are the principal and costly novelties of the southern shore  the site of elwijh is evidently old although the ruins have been buried under modern buildings sprenger p 21 holds the townlet to be the port of egra a village elhajar or the town the townlet in the territory of obodas whence according to strabo xvi c 4 § 24 Ælius gallus embarked his baffled troops for myus hormusen42 formerly he believed elaúníd to be strabos egra the haven for the north as elhaurá was for the south and elwijh for the central regions pliny vi 32 also mentions the tamudæi with their towns of domata and hegra and the town of badanatha it is generally remarked that egra does not appear in ptolemys lists yet one of the best texts nobbe lipsia 1843 reads greek instead of the negran which pirckheymerus lugduni mdxxxv and others placed in north lat 26°  my learned friend writes to meelwijh on the coast of arabia is opposite to qoçayr elkusayr where Ælius gallus landed his troops we know that egra is the name of a town in the interior and it was the constant habit to call the port after the capital of the country eg arabia emporium  aden we have now only to inquire whether elwijh had claims to be considered the seaport of elhijr this difficulty is easily settled elwijh is still the main indeed the only harbour in south midian and during our stay there a large caravan brought goods as will be seen from the upper wady hamz  under the influence of the quarantine elwijh the town on the northern bank of its cove has blossomed into a hauteville dating from the last dozen years the ancient basseville probably the site of many former settlements is now used chiefly for shops and stores another and a more pretentious mosque has supplanted the little old záwiyah chapel with its barbarous minaret whose finial a series of inverted crescents might be taken for a cross while a jámi or cathedral begun in the upper town has stopped short through want of funds some of the best houses now extend towards the northern point as usual in arab settlements they are long tall claretcases of coralrag and burnt lime flatroofed whitewashed in front and provided with wooden doors and shutters lastly on the slope still appears the smoky coffeeshed that witnessed the memorable encounter between its surly proprietor and saad the devilen43  stony ramps stiff as those of gibraltar connect the low with the high town the cool breezy new settlement upon the crest of the northern cliff whose noble view of the jebel libn and the palmscattered wady elwijh were formerly monopolized by the fort and its round tower this work only sixtyfive years old now stands so perilously near the undermined edge of the rockcornice that some day it will come down with a run it is used by the garrison and serves as a jail but lately a bedawi prisoner like a certain mamlúk bey jumped down the precipitous coveface and effected his escape behind it are the doctors quarters empty and desolate because the sanitary officers have been removed they are sheds of whitewashed boarding brought from the crimea like those of the suez canal and comfortably distributed into harem kitchens offices and other necessaries  the inhabitants of elwijh may number twelve hundred without including chance travellers and the few wretched bedawin hutaym and others who pitch their black tents like those of alexandrian ramleh about and beyond the town the people live well and the merchants are large and portly men who evidently thrive upon meat and rice flesh is retailed in the bazar and mutton is cheap especially when the bedawin are near a fine large sheep being dear at ten shillings water is exceptionally abundant even without the condensers aid the poorer classes and animals are watered at the pits and the two regular wells near the valleys mouth half an hours trudge from the town the wealthy are supplied by the inland fort which we shall presently visit the distance going and coming would be about four slow hours and the skinful costs five khurdah or copper piastres  three halfpence the inner gardens grow a small quantity of green meat watermelons are brought from yambá opium and hashísh abound but no spirits are for sale since the one greek bakkál or petty shopkeeper made tracks he borrowed from a certain surúr selámah negro merchant and head miser 150 napoleons in order to buy on commission certain bales of cotton shipwrecked up coast he left in pledge the keys of his miserable store which bytheby la loi refuses to open he was never seen again and poor rich surur is in the depths of despair  one of the small industries of elwijh is the pearl trade mr clarke bought for £4 twenty dollars a specimen of good round form but rather yellow colour and presently refused £5 for it those of pearshape easily fetch thirtysix to forty dollars turquoises set in sealingwax are sold cheap by the returning persian pilgrims the zib elbahr seawolf an egyptian cruiser had carried off the best shortly before our arrival the people speak of an akík carnelian which rubbed down in vinegar enters into the composition of a favourite philtrewe could not however find any for sale on our return an anezah caravan of some ninety camels driven by a hundred or so of spearmen and matchlockmen came in loaded with valuable samn or clarified butter the fact suggests that the time has come for establishing a gumruk customhouse at elwijh another source of wealth will be elmelláhah the salina along which we shall travel every man who has a donkey may carry off what he pleases and sell to pilgrims and bedawin the kilogramme for four piastres copper  one piastre currency  five farthings this again should be taken in hand by government and regular salterns like those of triestine capodistria would greatly increase the quantity nothing can be better than the quality except rocksalt there is another salina about one hour down the coast formed by a reef near the ras elmallah  the afternoon of arrival was spent in receiving visits the muháfiz or civil governor hasan bey calls himself a circassian he is a handsome old man whose straight features suggest the greek slave and who served in the syrian campaigns under ibrahim pasha forty years ago he left his home he has been here six years and yet he knows absolutely nothing of the interior he ought to reside at the inland fort but he prefers the harbourtown and he had not the commonsense to ride out with us he shows his zeal by inventing obstacles for instance he suggests that the bedawin should leave during our journey hostages at the fort this is wholly unnecessary and means only piastres the yuzbáshi or military commandant sidahmed effendi has charge of the fortyfive regulars half a company who garrison the post and outpost the chief merchant who afterwards volunteered to be our travelling companion is mohammed shahádah formerly wakil agent of the fort a charge now abolished by a poundfoolish policy he is an honest and intelligent a charitable and companionable man who has travelled far and wide over the interior and who knows the tribes by heart i strongly recommended him to his highness the viceroy his brothers bedawi and ali shahádah are also openhanded to the poor very unlike their brotherinlaw surúr selámah formerly a slave to the father of mohammed selámah whom we had met at zibá the list of notables ends with the sayyid ibrahim elmaraí and with the sturdy abd elhakk pearl and general merchant all recognized our friend the sayyid whom even the gutterboys saluted by name and although the arab manner is blunt and independent all showed perfect civility it is needless to say that our late work and our future plans were known to everybody at elwijh as well as to ourselves and that the tariffs of pay and hire established in the north country at once became the norm of the south  our favourite walk at old egra was to the quarantineground and the lighthouse the situation of the town is by no means satisfactory and the heavy dews of april wetting the streets cause frequent fevers en revanche nothing can be more healthy or exhilarating than the air of the tall plateau to the south of the cove the quarantineground with its grand view of the mountains inland ends seawards in the pharos that commands an horizon of blue water the latter according to the charts is one hundred and six feet above sealevel and is theoretically visible for fourteen miles practice would reduce this radius to ten and the least haze to six and even five  the lighthousecharges are strongly objected to by the skippers of arab fishingboats although very small in their case squarerigged vessels pay per ton twenty parahs tariff thus it costs a ship of five hundred tons £2 10s turkish the keeper under admiral mkillop pasha a young greek named gurjí as george here sounds is assisted by a moslem lad mohammed effendi of alexandria they serve for three years and they look forward to the end of them the former also superintends the condensing establishment this office is a sinecure except during the three months of pilgrimpassage the machine can distil eighteen tons per diem and there is another watermagazine an old paddlewheeler moored to the beach under the town behind the establishment lies the pilgrimcemetery frequented by hyenas that prowl around the lighthouse threatening the canine guard i found a new use for this vermins brain it is administered by the fair ones at elwijh to jealous husbands upon whom they tell me it acts as a sedative  elwijh has been heard of in england as the prophylactic against the infected hejaz it is admirably suited for quarantine purposes and it has been abolished very unwisely in favour of tor harbour the latter inhabited by a ring of thievish syrogreek traders backed by a wretched wilderness alternately swampy and sandy is comfortless to an extent calculated to make the healthiest lose health moreover its climate says professor palmer p 222 is very malarious owing to the low and marshy nature of the ground there is a great deal of miasma even in the winter season finally and worst of all it is near enough to suez for infection to travel easily a wealthy pilgrim has only to pay a few gold pieces his escape to the mountains is winked at and thence he travels or voyages comfortably to suez and cairo even without such irregularities the transmission of contaminated clothing or other articles would suffice to spread cholera typhus and smallpox tor is in fact an excellent medium for focussing and for propagating contagious disease and its vicinity to egypt and consequently to europe suggests that it should at once be abolished  at first i lent ear to the popular statement at elwijh namely that the visiting doctors and the resident sanitary officers naturally prefer the shorter to the longer voyage and the nearer station to that further from home moreover inasmuch as if inclined to be dishonest they find more opportunities in the north it was their interest to transfer the establishment to tor the local authorities the people assured me were induced to report that the single fortwell had run dry that the condensers had proved a failure and that the old steamermagazine into which they had poured brine was leaky and inefficient but what was my astonishment when after return to cairo i was told that the change had been strongly advocated by the english government  the objections to elwijh are two both equally invalid the port is dangerous especially when westerly winds are blowing ships during the pilgrimageseason must bank their fires ever ready to run out true but it has been shown that sharm dumayghah the best of its kind lies only thirty knots to the north the second want of water or of good water is even less cogent we have seen that the seaboard wells supply the poorer classes and animals and we shall presently see the fortwells which in their day have watered caravans containing twenty to thirty thousand thirsty men and beasts so far from the condensers being a failure the tank still holds about twenty tons of distilled water although it gives drink to some thirty mouths composing the establishment finally the old steamer has done its duty well and like the proverbial marine is still ready to do its duty againen44  thus the expense of laying out the quarantineground at elwijh has been pitifully wasted that however is a very small matter the neglect of choosing a proper position is serious even ominous unlike tor nothing can be healthier or freer from fever than the pilgrims plateau from elwijh too escape is hopeless the richest would not give a piastre to levant because if a solitary traveller left the caravan a bedawi bullet would soon prevail on him to stop this then should be the first long halt for the compromised travelling northwards when contagious disease has completely disappeared the second precautionary delay might be either at tor or better still at the wells of moses uyun músá near the head of the suez gulf here sanitary conditions are far more favourable and here supplies including medical comforts would be cheaper as well as more abundant briefly it is my conviction that under present circumstances tor is a standing danger not only to egypt but to universal europe  the coast about elwijh is famed for shells the numerous reefs and shoals favouring the development of the molluscs we were promised a heavy haul by the citizens who however contented themselves with picking up the washedout specimens found everywhere on the shore unfortunately we had no time to superintend the work a caseful was submitted to the british museum and a few proved interesting on account of their locality the list printed at the end of this chapter was kindly supplied to me by mr edgar a smith superintendent of the conchological department  i will conclude this chapter with a short notice the hutaym or hitaym a people extremely interesting to me they are known to travellers only as a low caste wellsted ii xii tells us that the huteimi whom he would make the descendants of the ichthyophagi described by diodorus siculus and other classics are noticed by several arabian authorities in one the kitab elmush serifen45 musharrif they are styled hooteïn the descendants of hooter a servant of moses he also relates a legend that the apostle of allah pronounced them polluted because they ate the flesh of dogs others declare that they opposed mohammed when he was rebuilding the kabah and thereby drew upon themselves the curse that they should be held the basest of the arabs these tales serve to prove one fact the antiquity of the race  the hutaym meaning the broken tribe hold in midian and egypt the position of pariahs like the akhdám serviles or helots of maskat and elyemen no clan of pure arabs will intermarry with them and when the fellahs say tatahattim tatamaskin or tatazalli they mean thou cringest thou makest thyself contemptible as a hutaymi moreover they must pay the dishonouring akháwat or brothertax to all the bedawin amongst whom they settle  the hutaym are scattered as they are numerous they have extended probably in ancient times to upper egypt and occupy parts of nubia about sawákin they are an important clan they number few in the sinaitic peninsula and in midian but they occupy the very heart of the arabian peninsula those settled on jebel libn we have seen claim as their kinsman the legendary antar who was probably a negro of the noble semitic stock a few are camped about elwijh and they become more important down coast in the eastern regions bordering upon midian they form large and powerful bodies such as the nawámisah and the sharárát whose numbers and bravery secure for them the respect of their fighting equestrian neighbours the ruwaláanezah  like other arabs the hutaym tribe is divided into a multitude of clans septs and families each under its own shaykh all are moslems after the desert pattern a very rude and inchoate article wellsted knew them by their remarkably broad chins the bedawi recognize them by their look by their peculiar accent and by the use of certain peculiar words as harr when donkeydriving the men are unwashed and filthy the women walk abroad unveiled and never refuse themselves i am told to the higher blood  the arabs of midian always compare the hutaym with the ghagar ghajar or gypsies of egypt and this is the point which gives the outcasts a passing interest i have not yet had an opportunity of carefully studying the race nor can i say whether it shows any traces of skill in metalworking meanwhile we must inquire whether these helots now so dispersed are not old immigrants of indian descent who have lost their aryan language like the egyptian ghajar in that case they would represent the descendants of the wandering tribes who worked the most ancient ateliers perhaps they may prove to be congeners of the men of the bronze age and of the earliest waves of gypsyimmigration into europe                                   note    a list of the shells collected by the second khedivial expedition on the shore of midian and the gulf of akabah by edgar a smith

hurried letter of invitation to mohammed afnán shaykh of the baliyy tribe inviting him to visit the expedition and to bring with him seventy camels and dromedaries his tents being pitched at a distance of three days long march in the interior i determined not to waste a precious week at the end of the cold season and the party was once more divided anton the greek was left as storekeeper with orders to pitch a camp to collect as much munition de bouche as possible and to prepare for this years last journey into the interior mm marie and philipin with lieutenant yusuf cook giorji and bodyservant ali marie were directed to march along the shore southwards after inspecting a third jebel elkibrít they would bring back notices of the wady hamz near whose banks i had heard vague reports of a gasr kasr palace or castle built by one gurayyim saíd meanwhile the rest of us would proceed in the sinnár to elhaurá a roundabout cruise of a hundred miles to the south  m philipin lost time in shoeing very imperfectly his four mules and m marie who could have set out with eight camels at any moment delayed moving till march 26th the party was composed of a single báshbuzúk from the fort and two quarrymen the ras káfilah was young shaykh sulaymán bin afnánof whom more presentlywhile his brotherinlaw hammád acted guide at 640 am they struck to the southeast of the town and passed the two brackish pits or wells bir elismaíl and elsannúsi which supply the poor of the port thence crossing the broad wady elwijh they reached after a miles ride wady melláhah or the salina it is an oval measuring some eighteen hundred yards from north to south the banks are padded with brown slush frosted white which in places bogs the donkeys and admits men to the knee beyond it lie dazzling blocks of pure crystallized salt and the middle of the pond is open tenanted by ducks and waterfowl and visited by doves and partridges at the lower or northern end a short divide separates it from the sea and the waves during the high westerly gales run far inland it would be easy to open a regular communication between the harbour and its saltern the head is formed by the large wady surrah whose many feeders at times discharge heavy torrents the walls of the valleymouth are marked somewhat like the hárr with caverned and corniced cliffs of white canaryyellow and lightpink sandstone  they then left to the right the long point ras elmallah fronting mardúnah island here as at elakabah and makná sweet water springs from the salt sands of the shore a freak of drainage a kind of irish bull of nature so common upon the dangerous somali seaboard the tract leads to the southeast never further from the shore than four or five miles but separated by rolling ground which hides the main for the same reason the travellers were unable to sight the immense development of graniteembedded quartz which lurks amongst the hills to the inland or east and which here subtends the whole coastline they imagined themselves to be in a purely secondary formation of gypsum and conglomerates cut by a succession of wadybeds like the section between elmuwaylah and aynúnah thus they crossed the mouths of the watercourses whose heads we shall sight during the inland march and whose midlengths we shall pass when marching back to elwijh  these exceedingly broad beds are divided as usual by long lines of naturemetalled ground the first important feature is the wady surrah which falls into the wady elwijh a little above the harbourpier its proper and direct mouth elgáh káh or the hall runs alongshore into the melláhah it drains the hamíratayn or two reds the hamírat surrah in the rughám or secondary formation and the granitic mass hamírat elnabwah where the plutonic outbreaks begin amongst the number of important formations arethe wady elmiyáh which has a large saltwell near the sea and down whose upper bed we shall travel after leaving umm elkaráyát the wady elkurr whose acquaintance we shall make in the eastern region and the wady elargah arjah the latter is the most interesting near its head we shall find knots of ruins and the quartzreef abálmarú while lower down the bed on the northeast side of a hill facing the valley lieutenant yusuf came upon a rock scrawled over with religious formulæ tawakkaltu al allah i rely upon allah and so forth all in a comparatively modern arabic character the inscriptions lie to the left of the shore road and to the right of the pilgrimhighway thus showing that miners not passing travellers have here left their mark  after riding five hours and forty minutes  seventeen miles the party reached the base of the third sulphurhill discovered by the expedition on the coast of midian also known as the tuwayyil elkibrít the littlelong ridge of brimstone it appears from afar a reddish pyramid rising about two miles inland of an inlet which is said to be safe navigation thus far it resembles the jibbah find on the other hand it is not plutonic but chalky like those of makná and sinai the crystals being similarly diffused throughout the matrix in the adjoining hills and cliffs the secondaries and the conglomerates take all shades of colour marvellous to behold when the mirage raises to giant heights the white coastbanks patched with pink red mauve and dark brown moreover the quarries of mottled alabaster which the ancients worked for constructions still show themselves  the travellers slept at the base of the tuwayyil next morning m philipin proceeded to collect specimens of the sulphur and of the chalcedonyagate strewed over the plain and here seen for the first time m marie and lieutenant yusuf rode on to the banks of the wady hamz and after three hours  nine miles they came upon the castle and unexpectedly turned up trumps i had carelessly written for them the name of a ruin which all naturally enough believed would prove to be one of the normal barbarous hawáwít they brought back specimens of civilized architecture and these at once determined one of the objectives of our next journey the party returned to elwijh on the next day in the highest of spirits after a successful trip of more than fifty miles  meanwhile i steamed southwards accompanied by the rest of the party including the sayyid shaykh furayj and the exwakíl mohammed shahádah who is trusted by the bedawin and who brought with him a guide of the fawáidahjuhaynah one rájih ibn ayid this fellow was by no means a fair specimen of his race the cynocephalous countenance the cobweb beard and the shifting treacherous eyes were exceptional the bellowing voice and the greed of gain were not he had a free passage for himself his child and eight sacks of rice with the promise of a napoleon by way of bakhshísh yet he complained aloud that he had no meat to break his fast at dawnan arab of pure blood would rather have starved he shirked answering questions concerning the number of his tribe many many was all the information we could get from him and his arabic wanted the pure pronunciation and the choice vocabulary that usually distinguish the juhayni pilots arrived at his own shore he refused to make arrangements for disembarking his rice he ordered with bawling accents and pointed stick the sailors of the manofwar to land it at the place chosen by himself and he bit his finger when informed that a sound flogging was the normal result of such impudence  we set out at 430 pm march 24th and steamed due west till we had rounded the northern head of elraykhah a long low island which lying westsouthwest of elwijh may act breakwater in that direction then we went southwest and passed to port the white rocks of mardunah isle which fronts the ras elmallah capping the ugly reefs and shoals that forbid tall ships to hug this section of the shore it is described as a narrow ridge of coralline broken into pointed masses two to three hundred feet high whose cliffs and hollows form breedingplaces for wild pigeons the unusually rugged appearance is explained by the fact that here the jinns amuse themselves with hurling rocks at one another before night we had sighted the ras kurkumah so called from its curcuma turmeric hue the yellow point facing the islettomb of shaykh marbaten46 upon this part of the shore i was told are extensive ruins as yet unvisited by europeans the dangerous juhaynah being the obstacle to the southeast towered tall and misty forms the gháts of the tihámatjahaníyyah northernmost and prolonging the libn that miniature shárr is the regular wall of the jebel elward then come the peaks and pinnacles of the jibál elsafhah and lastly the twin blocks elrál between which passes the egyptian hajj when returning from elmedínah faint resemblances of these features sprawl like huge caterpillars over the hydrographic chart but all sprawl unnamed  by way of extra precaution we stood to the south instead of the southeast thus lengthening to one hundred and twenty knots the normal hundred dir geog sixtyeight separating elwijh from the jebel hassáni moreover we caught amidships a fine lumpy sea that threatened to roll the masts out of the stout old corvette as the sinnár which always reminded me of her majestys steamship zebra is notably the steadiest ship in the egyptian navy the captain was asked about his ballast he replied i have just taken command but i dont think there is any the engine eliddah is our saburraevidently he had never seen the hold this state of things which combined with open ports foundered her majestys sailing frigate eurydice appears the rule of the egyptian warnavy i commend the consideration to english sailors  the steering also was detestable and the man at the wheel could not see the wavesa sine quâ non to the mariner in these latitudes who broaches to whenever he can a general remark the egyptian sailor is firstrate in a dahabiyyah nileboat which he may capsize once in a generation and ditto in a red sea sambúk where he is also thoroughly at home the same was the case with the sultan of maskats araboenglish navy the arabs and sídís negroes were excellent at working their mtepecraft on frigates they were monkeys poor copies of men our european vessels are beyond and above the west asiatic and the african he becomes at the best a kind of imitation jack tar he will not or rather he cannot take the necessary trouble concentrate his attention fix his mind upon his duties he says inshallah he relies upon allah and he prays five times a day when he should be giving or receiving orders the younger generation of officers it is true drinks wine and does not indulge in orisons whilst it should be working but its efficiency is impaired by the difficulties and delay in granting pensions the many grey beards however carefully dyed suggest an equipage de vétérans  the consequence of yawing and of running halfspeed by night was that we reached jebel hassáni just before noon instead of eight am on the 25th the island whose profile slopes to the southeastward is a long yellowwhite ridge a lump of coralline four hundred feet high bare and waterless in summer yet it feeds the bedawi flocks at certain seasons it is buttressed and bluff to the southwest whence the strongest winds blow and it is prolonged by a flat spit to the southeast and by a long tail of two vertebrae a big and a little joint trending northwest thus it gives safe shelter from the wester to arab barquesen47 and still forms a landmark for those navigating between jeddah kusayr and suez its parallel runs a few miles north of the dædalus light north lat 24° 55 30 to the west and it lies a little south of elhaurá on the coast and of elmedínah distant about one hundred and thirty direct miles in the interior if ptolemys latitudes are to be consulted jebel hassáni would be the timagenes island in north lat 25° 40 and the corresponding chersónesus point is represented by the important and wellmarked projection abú madd which intercepts the view to the south  after rounding the southern spit we turned to northeast and by east and passed with a minimum of seven fathoms under keel between hassáni the giant and the dwarf umm sahr a flat sandbank hardly visible from the shore this is the only good approach to the secure and spacious bay that bore the southernmost nabathæan porttown there are northern and northwestern passages but both require skilful pilots and every other adit though apparently open is sealed by reefs and shoals with the blue and regularlined curtain of abú elghurayr in front stretching down coast to ras abú madd we bent gradually round to the northeast and east we then left to starboard the settlement elamlij a long line of separate ushash the usual ichthyophagan huts dull darkbrown wigwams they were apparently deserted at least only two women appeared upon the shore but sundry katírahs and canoes warned us that fishermen were about we ran for safety a mile and threequarters north of the exposed ras elhaurá and at 130 pm  twentyone hours we anchored in nine fathoms under the kutáat elwazamah the peagreen shallows which defended us to the north and south had lately given protection to the khedivíyyahen48 steamer elhidayyidah compelled by an accident to creep alongshore like a sambúk  elhaura is not found either in the charts or in ptolemys and sprengers maps it lies in north lat 25° 6 about the same parallel as elmedínah and in east long gr 37° 13 30en49 wellsted ii x heard of its ruins but never saw it at least he says in the vicinity of elhaurá according to the arabs are some remains of buildings and columns but our stay on the coast was too limited to permit our examining the spot he is however greatly in error when he adds near this station the encampments of the bili baliyy tribe to the southward terminate and those of the joheïnah commence as has been seen the frontier is nearly fifty miles further north he notices chap ix the white village to differ with vincent who would place it at elmuwaylah but he translates the word ii 461 the brighteyed girl instead of albus vicus he quotes however the other name dár elishrin twentieth station so called because the cairo caravan formerly reached it in a score of days now reduced to nineteen he seems finally to have landed in order to inspect a ruined town on the main and to have missed it  according to sprenger the white village or castle was not a thamudite but a nabathæan port here Æelius gallius disembarked his troops from egypt strabo xvi c 4 § 24 shows that greek was the startingplace of the caravans which before the nile route to alexandria was opened carried to petra the merchandise of india and of southern arabia thence the imports were passed on to phoenicia and egyptthese pages have shown why the journey would be preferred to the voyage northward he is confirmed by the periplus which relates chap xix that from the port and the castellum of leukè kóme a road leads to petra the capital of the malicha elmalik king of the nabathæans it also serves as an emporium to those who bring wares in smaller ships from arabia mocha múza and aden for the latter reason a perceptor or tolltaker who levies twentyfive per cent ad valorem and a hekatontarches centurion with a garrison are there stationed as the nabatæ were vassals of rome and the whole region had been ceded to the romans byzantines by a chief of the beni kudá tribe this yuzbáshi or military commandant was probably a roman  elhaurá like most of the ruined settlements upon this coast shows two distinct quarters a harbourtown and what may be called a countrytown the latter whose site is by far the more picturesque and amene lay upon a long tongue of land backing the slope of the seacliff and attached to the low whitish hillocks and pitons rising down south it is now a luxuriant orchard of emerald palms forming three large patches behind it swells a dorsum of goldenyellow sand and the horizon is closed by ranges of hills and highlands red and white blue and black our eyes are somewhat startled by the amount of bright and vivid green for some reason unknown to us the shore is far more riant than the northern section and the land might be called quasiagricultural the whole coast seems to be broken with verdant valleys from the wady elayn with its numerous branches beautifying the north to the wady eldaghaybaj in the south supplying water between its two paps  on the evening of our arrival we landed in a shallow bay bearing northnortheast 30° mag from the roads where the corvette lay at anchor and walked a few yards inland to the left bank of the wady elsamnah the unimportant fiumara draining low hills of the same name the loose sand is everywhere strewed with bits of light porous lava which comes from the harrat elbuhayr a bluff quoin to the northwest about elhaurá i have said the volcanic formations some sixty miles inland on the parallel of elmuwaylah approach the coast  we were guided to the ruins by the shouts of sundry arabs defending their harvest against a dangerous enemy the birdsrattles and scarecrows were anything but scarce apparently the sand contains some fertilizing matter a field of dry and stunted dukhn holcus dochna or small millet nearly covers the site of the old castle whose outline nearly buried under the drift of ages we could still trace there are two elevations eastern and western and a third lies to the north on the right side of the wady samnah scatters of the usual fragments lay about and the blocks of white coralline explained the old nameswhitton whitworth whitby the bedawin preserve the tradition that this was the most important part of the settlement which extended southwards nearly four miles the dwarf valleymouth is still a roadstead where two small craft were anchored and here doubtless was the corner of the hive allotted to the communitys workingbees an old fibster hámid elfáidi declared that he would bring us from the adjacent hills a stone which when heated would pour forth metal like waterand never appeared again it was curious to remark how completely the acute furayj believed him because both were arabs and brother bedawin  next morning we set out shortly after the red and dewy sunrise to visit the south end of leukè kóme the party consisted of twenty marines under an officer besides our escort of ten negro remingtons the land was open and with these thirty i would willingly have met three hundred bedawin our repulse from the hismá had rankled in our memories and we only wanted an opportunity of showing fight after rowing a mile we landed southeast of the anchorage 127° mag at a modern ruin four blocks of the rudest masonry built as a store by a yambú merchant unfortunately he had leased the ground from the fawáidah clan when the hámidah claim it the result was a faction fightand nothing done  a few minutes walking over unpleasantly deep sand placed us upon the hajjroad it is paved like the shore with natural slabs and ledges of soft modern sandstone and being footworn it makes a far better road than that which connects alexandria with ramleh the broad highway scattered with quartz and basalt greenstone and serpentine crossed one of the many branches of the wady elayn in the rich and saltish sand grew crops of dukhn and the halfágrass cynosures durus of the nile valley with tamariskthickets and tufts of fanpalm on its left bank a lampblack vein of starknaked basalt capped by jagged blocks ran down to the sea and formed a conspicuous buttress the guides spoke of a similar volcanic outcrop above point abú madd to the south and of a third close to yambá harbour  an hour of stravaguing walk showed us the first sign of the ruins wallbases built with fine cement crowning the summit of a dwarf mound to the left of the road wellworked scoriæ were also scattered over its slopes we now entered the date orchards conspicuous from the sea on both sides of us were fences of thorn tamped earth and dry stone young trees had been planted and beyond the dates large fields of dukhn again gave an agricultural touch to the scene flocks of sheep and goats were being grazed all around us and the owners made no difficulty as they would have done further north in selling us half a dozen  we then entered the wady haurá where the caravan camps it is a cheery charming site for rich citizens with its plain of rich vegetation everywhere say the natives undermined by water its open seaview to the west its mound of clean yellow sand behind extending to the rocky horizon and its pure fresh breezes blowing from the nejd with an indescribable sense of lightness and health and enjoyment in fact it has all the accessories of an eligible position at the third or southern palm patch we found the only public work which remains visible in the great nabathaean port it was formerly a káríz the undergroundaqueduct so common in persia and it conducted towards the sea the drainage of the jebel turham a round knob shown in the chart which bears southeast 121° mag from the conduithead the line has long ago been broken down by the arabs and the open waters still supply the hajjcaravan the ayn fountain may be seen issuing from a dark cavern of white coralline the water then hides itself under several filledup pits which represent the old airholes and after flowing below sundry natural arches the remains of the conduitceiling it emerges in a deep fissure of saltish stone from this part of its banks we picked up fair specimens of saltpetre the lower course abounds in waterbeetles and is choked with three kinds of aquatic weeds after flowing a few yards it ends in a shallow pool surrounded by palms and paved with mud which attracts flights of snipes sandpipers and sandgrouse  the turbulent dogs sonsen50 were mostly in the upper lands but a few wretched fellows with swords old spears and ridiculous matchlocks assembled and managed to get up a squabble about the right of leading strangers into our country biládná the doughty rájih ibn ayid who mounted upon a mean dromedary affected to be chief guide seemed to treat their pretensions as a serious matter when we laughed them to scorn he and all the other experts gave us wholly discouraging details concerning a ruin represented to lie some hours off in the nearest of the southern harrah according to them the kasr elbint maidens palace was in the same condition as elhaurá showing only a single pillar perhaps the columns to which wellsted alludes we could learn nothing concerning the young person whose vague name it bears except that she preferred settling on the mainland whereas her brother built a corresponding castle upon the islet jebel hassánien51 he is locally called warakat ibn naufal a venerated name in the fatrah or interval between jesus and mohammed he was the uncle of khadijah the widow and he is popularly supposed to have been a christian here as at other places i inquired at the suggestion of a friend but of course in vain about the human skeleton which ibn mujáwar some six centuries ago found embedded in a rock near the seashore  such is the present condition of the once famous emporium leukè kóme we returned along the shore to embark and shortly after noon the old corvette of crimean date again swung round on her heel and resumed her wanderings this time northwards the run of eighteen hours and fifteen minutes was semicircular but the sea had subsided to a dead calm the return to elwijh felt like being restored to civilization we actually had a salad of radish leavesdelicious  our travel will now lie through the baliyy country and a few words concerning this ancient and noble tribe may here be given although they apparently retain no traditions of their origin they are known to genealogists as a branch of the beni kudá who some fifteen centuries ago emigrated from southern arabia and eventually exterminated the thamudites i have noted their northern and southern frontiers to the northeast they are bounded by the vicious maázah and the ruwaláanezahs and to the southeast by the alaydánanezahs under shaykh mutlak like their northern nomadic neighbours they have passed over to egypt and even the guidebooks speak of the billi in the valley of the nile  the baliyy modestly rate their numbers at four thousand muskets by which understand four hundred yet they divide themselves into a multitude of clans our companion the wakíl mohammed shahádah can enumerate them by the score and i wrote down the twentythree principal which are common both to south midian and to egypt the chief shaykh mohammed afnán ibn ammár can reckon backwards seven generations beginning from a certain shaykh sultán about ten years ago he allowed the tribe to indulge in such dangerous amusements as cutting the road and plundering merchants it is even asserted privily that they captured the fort of elwijh by bribing the turkish topji head gunner to fire highlike the halfcaste artilleryman who commanded the talpúr cannoneers at sir charles napiers battle of meeanee a regiment of eight hundred bayonets was sent from egypt and the shaykh was secured by a hílah or stratagem that is he was promised safe conduct he trusted himself like a fool he was seized clapped in irons and sent to jail in the citadel of cairo here he remained some seven months in carcere duro daily expecting death when fate suddenly turned in his favour he was sent for by the authorities pardoned for the past cautioned for the future and restored to his home with a murátibah regular pension of eight hundred piastres per mensem besides rations and raiment the remedy was like cutting off the nose of a wicked hindú wife sharp but effective shaykh afnan and his tribe are now models of courtesy to strangers and the traveller must devoutly wish that every shaykh in arabia could be subjected to the same discipline  the baliyy are a good study of an arab tribe in the rough the huwaytát for example know their way to suez and to cairo they have seen civilization they have learned after a fashion the outlandish ways of the frank the fellah and the turkfellow the baliyy have to be taught all these rudiments cunning tricky and dodgy as is all the wildmanrace they lie like the childishfoolish deceiving nobody but themselves an instance hours and miles are of course unknown to them but they began with us by affecting an extreme ignorance of comparative distances they could not or rather they would not adopt as a standard the two short hours march between the port and the inland fort of elwijh when however the trick was pointed out to them they at once threw it aside as useless no pretext was too flimsy to shorten a march or to cause a haltthe northerners did the same but with them we had a controlling power in the shape of shaykh furayj and like the citizens they hate our manner of travelling they love to sit up and chat through half the night and to rise before dawn is an abomination to them  at first their manners gentle and pliable contrast pleasantly with the roughness of the halfbreds huwaytát and maknáwi who have many of the demerits of the fellah without acquiring the merits of the bedawi as camelmen they were not difficult to deal with nor did they wrangle about their hire presently they turned out to be poor devils badly armed and not trained to the use of matchlocks their want of energy in beating the bushes and providing forage for their camels compared with that of the northerners struck us strongly on the other hand they seem to preserve a flavour of ancient civilization which it is not easy to describe and they certainly have inherited the instincts and tastes of the old metalworkers they are a race of born miners that sharpest of tests the experience of travel at last suggested to us that the baliyy is too old a breed and that its blue blood wants a racial baptism a large infusion of something newer and stronger                      note on the harrahs of arabia    the learned dr j g wetzstein in the appendix to his reisebericht etcen52 records a conversation with a von humboldt and carl ritter april 1859 respecting the specimens which he had brought from the classical trachonitis their appearance led the latter to question whether the latest eruptions of the harrat rájil as it is called from an adjoining valley may not have taken place within the historic period and he referred to psalm xviii as seeming to note the occurrence during davids reign of such a phenomenon in or near palestine humboldt deemed it probable that the koranic legend chap iv of the abyssinian host under abraha destroyed by a shower of stones baked in hellfire referred not to smallpox as is generally supposed but to an actual volcanic eruption in arabia  with what interest would that great man have learnt writes dr wetzstein that as i was turning over the leaves of yákúts geographical lexicon only a few days ago i found that the arabians knew of the existence of twentyeight different volcanic regions between hauran and bab elmandeb later still dr otto loth published an elaborate paper on the volcanic regions harras of arabia according to yakut thirteenth century in which these eruptive sites are nearly all identified and described  among the numerous volcanoes thus found to exist within the arabian peninsula remarks dr bekeen53 the only one recorded as having been in activity within the historic period is the harratelnar fire harra situate to the northeast

consequently between it and the northernmost harra of the râdjil or trachonitis is the harra radjlâ    its designation which means rough pathless seems to indicate its peculiarly rugged surface and

consideration he told all the secrets of his employers and it is my firm conviction that he was liberally paid for so doing by both parties of wiseacres  the immediate objective of this our last march was the badá plain of which we first heard at shaghab i purposed subsequently to collect specimens of a traditional coalmine to which his highness the viceroy had attached the highest importance then we would march upon the móchoura of the ancients the mediaeval elmarwah or zú marwah the modern marwátcumabálmarú finally we would return to elwijh viâ the wady hamz inspecting both it and the ruins first sighted by mm marie and philipin  on friday march 29th i gave a breakfast in the wooden barracks to the officers of the sinnár and the officials of the port after which some took their opium and went to sleep while others it being churchday went to mosque we ran out of elwijh at 145 pm our convoy consisting of fiftyeight camels fortyfour of which were loaded seven were dromedaries and an equal number carried water all had assured us that the rains of the two past years had been wanting last winter they were scanty this cold season they were nil in truth the land was suffering terribly from drought our afternoon was hot and unpleasant about later march the hawá eluwwah a violent sandraising norther sets in and lasts through a fortnight it is succeeded in early april by the calms of elniám the blessings which divided into the greater and the less last forty days after that the summerjehannum  from the raised and metalled bank upon which the burj stands we descended to the broad mouth of the wijh valley draining the low rolling bluebrown line of porphyritic hillocks on the east to our right lay the sparkling glittering white plain and pool elmelláhah the salina after an hour and a quarter of sandy and dusty ride we passed through a gate formed by the hamíratwijh the red range which backing the gape of the valley and apparently close behind the town strikes the eye from the offing here the gypsum ruddy and mauve white and black was underlaid by granite in rounded masses and the secondary formation is succeeded by the usual red and green traps though this part of our route lies in eltihámah which in fact we shall not leave we are again threading the wady sadr of the northern shafahrange a pleasant surprise was a fine vein of sugary quartz trending northsouth at that period we little suspected the subrange to the southperhaps also the northernof being in places one mighty mass of white stone  after covering six miles in an hour and threequarters exaggerated by the guides to three we suddenly sighted the inland fort its approach is that of a large encampingground and such indeed it is the egyptian pilgrimcaravan here halts on the fourth day from elmuwaylah the broken untidy environs strewed with bones and rubbish show low mounds that mean ovens stone rings where tents are pitched and the usual graves amongst which a reverend man shaykh sálih rests in a manner of round tower the site is in one point at least admirably wellchosen a kind of carrefour where four valleys and as many roads meet and thus it commands the mouths of all the gorges leading inland  riding up to the fort we were welcomed by its commandant lieutenant násir ahmed a peculiarly good specimen of his arm the infantry his garrison consists of thirteen regulars whose clean uniforms show discipline and whose hale and hearty complexions testify to the excellence of the water and the air the men are paid annually by the treasurer of the hajjcaravan they are supposed to be relieved after seven years but they have wives and families and like the british soldier in india half a century ago they are content to pass their working lives in local service the commandant showed us over his castle which was in excellent order and brewed coffee which we drank in the cool porch of the single gate he then led us about the neighbourhood and ended with inviting the sáyyid furayj and the wakíl mohammed shahádah to a copious feast  the fort is the usual square straightcurtained work of solid masonry with a circular bastion at each angle and a huge arched mainentrance in the western façade it is in fact one of the buildings that belong to the solid sturdy age of sultán selim and of the sinnán pasha so well known about damascus an inscription with an illegible date bears the name of ahmed ibn taylún the founder of the taylunide dynasty in ad 868884 this is another proof that the mamlúk soldans were lords of the soil and that even in the ninth century south midian was a province or a dependency of egypt moreover we picked up to the northeast of the work old and welltreated scoriæ suggesting a more ancient settlement perhaps it was the locale preferred by the proprietors of the slaves who worked the inner mines hidden from view and from the seabreeze by the hills  the castle being perfectly commanded by the heights behind the circular towers to the east have crests raised in that direction giving them a spoonshape and a peculiar aptitude for arresting every cannonball coming from the west the bedawin however have no great guns and apparently this shelter has been added since wellsteds dayen54 to the curtains are attached the usual hovels mat palmleaf and walls of dry stone or mud which here as at palmyra inevitably suggest waspnests the northern side is subtended by three large cisterns all strengthened at the inner angles by the stepped buttresses first noticed when we were exploring magháir shuayb  up the valley and behind the fort or to the northeast lie the palmplantations the small kitchengardens and the farfamed wells which dug by sultán selim and repaired by ibrahim pasha in ad 1524  supply the hajjcaravan the sandy bed disposed eastwest is streaked dotted and barred with walls and outcrops of the hardest greenstone porphyry and those which run northsouth must arrest like dykes the flow of water underground one of these reefs is laboriously scraped with bedawi wusúm and with moslem inscriptions comparatively modern the material is heavy but shows no quartz whereas the smaller valleys which debouch upon the northern or right bank of the main line display a curious conformation of the white stone contorted like oyster shells and embedded in the trap  of the six wells revetted with masonry and resembling in all points those of ziba four including eltawílah the deepest supply brackish water and the same is the case with a fifth inside the fort close to the chapel of his holiness shaykh abubakr the water however appeared potable and perhaps cleaning out and deepening might increase the quantity the sweet element drunk by the richards of elwijh comes from the bir elzafaráníyyah of saffron and from its northeastern neighbour elajwah the datepaste the latter measures four or five fathoms and the water appears under a boulder in situ that projects from the southern side the reader will now agree with me that elwijh is not too drouthy for a quarantineground  the plots of green meat lie about the water sheltered from the burning sun by a luxuriant growth of datetrees the egyptian is the best man in the world for dabbling in mud and here by scraping away the surfacesand he has come upon a clayey soil sufficiently fertile to satisfy his wants the growth is confined to tobacco potatoes and cabbages purslain portulaca pourpier radishes the edible hibiscus and tomatoes which are small and green lettuces do not thrive cucumbers and watermelons have been tried here and up country andman wants little in midian  we set out early on the next day 530 am march 30th in disorderly style the night had been cool and comfortable dry and dewless but the shaykhs were torpid after the feast and the escort and quarrymen had been demoralized by a week of sweet donothing striking up the wady elwijh which now becomes narrow and gorgelike with old and new wells and waterpits dotting the sole we were stopped after half an hours walk by a written rock on the right side of the bed none of the guides seemed to know or at any rate to care for it although i afterwards learnt that admiral mkillop pasha during his last visit to elwijh obtained a squeeze of the inscriptions wellsted ii x erroneously calls this valley wádí elmoyah the name of a feature further souththus leading me to expect the find elsewhere moreover he has copied the scrawls with a carelessness so prodigious that we failed at first to recognize the original he has hit upon the notable expedient of massing together in a single dwarf woodcut vol ii p 189 what covers many square feet of stone and i was fool enough to republish his copyen55  a tall fissured rock of the hardest porphyritic greenstone high raised from the valleysole facing northwest and reducible to two main blocks is scattered over with these inscriptions that spread in all directions most of them are arab wusum others are rude drawings of men and beasts amongst which are conspicuous the artless camel and the serpent and there is a duello between two funny warriors armed with sword and shield these efforts of art resemble not a little the totem attempts of the red indians in north and south america there are however two scrapings evidently alphabetic and probably nabathæan which are offered to the specialists in epigraphy six appear in wellsteds illustration especially that with a long line above it near the left and lower corner of the cut m lacaze and i copied the most striking features in our carnets he taking the right or southern side and leaving the other block to me but the results did not satisfy us and on april 10th i sent him with m philipin to make photographs the latter again are hardly as satisfactory as they might be because the inscriptions have not been considered the central points of interest we shall pass during our present journey many of these oriental john joneses and bill browns they will suggest the similar features of sinaitic wady mukattib which begot those monstrous growths the one primaeval language and the voice of israel from mount sinaien56 from the written rock the caravan travelled westward up an easy watercourse elkhaur distinguished as elshimálí the northern it winds round by the north and we shall descend it tomorrow the muleriders left the wady elwijh which extends some two hours eastward and struck to the eastsoutheast the bridlepath running up the left bank of an ugly rocky torrent the wady zurayb presently reaches a plateau undulating in low rises burnt with heat almost bare of trees and utterly waterless it is the model of a mining country elevate it from five hundred to nine thousand feet and it would be the living or dead likeness of a peruvian cerro the staple material porphyritic trap shows scatters of quartz and huge veins mostly trending northsouth large trenches made according to the guides by the ancients and small cairns or stone piles modern work were also pointed out to us  crossing the heads of sundry watercourses we fell into the wady umm elkaráyaten57 it begins as is here the rule with a gravelly bed nice riding enough it then breaks into ugly rocky drops and slides especially at the hill shoulders where thorntrees and other obstacles often suggest that it is better to dismount and finally when nearing the mouth it becomes a matured copy of its upper self on an enlarged scale presently we turned to the left over a short divide and stared with astonishment at the airy white heap some two hundred feet high which capped and strewed with snowy boulders seemed to float above our heads the wadybed at our feet lined along the left bank with immense blocks of similar quartz showed the bases of black wallsruins behold umm elkaráyát exclaimed nájí the guide pointing with a wave of the arm his usual theatrical gesture to the scene before us we could hardly believe our eyes he had just assured us that the march from the fort is four hours and we had ridden it in two hours and fifteen minutes  six miles and a quarter  dismounting at once and ordering the camp to be pitched near the ruins we climbed up the southeastern face of the quartzhill whose appearance was a novelty to us instead of being a regular roundheaded cone like the jebel elabyaz for instance the summit was distinctly crateriform the greater part of the day was spent in examining it and the following are the results this jebel elmarú showed for the first time during the whole journey signs of systematic and civilized work in many parts the hill has become a mere shell we found on the near side a line of airholes cut in the quartz rock disposed northsouth of one another and preserving a rim sunk like that of a sarcophagus to receive a cover possibly it was a precaution against the plunder which ruined brazilian gongo soco the arabs have no fear of these places as in wellsteds day and abdullah the mulatto readily descended into one about twelve feet below the surface messrs clarke and marie explored the deepest by means of ropes and declared that it measured sixty feet they had to be ready with their bayonets as sign of hyenas was common and the beast which slinks away in the open is apt when brought to bay in caverns to rush past the intruder carrying off a jawful of calf or thigh  this pit had two main galleries both choked with rubbish leading to the east and west and the explorers could see light glimmering through the cracks and crevices of the roofthese doubtless gave passage to the wild carnivore in other parts the surface especially where the earth is red was pitted with shallow basins and a large depression showed the sinking of the hollowed crust negro quartz was evidently abundant but we came to the conclusion that the rock mostly worked was like that of shuwák a rosy mauvecoloured schist with a deepred fracture and brilliant colours before they are tarnished by atmospheric oxygen it abounds in mica which silvery as fishscales overspreads it in patches and the precious metal had probably been sought in the veinlets between the schist and its quartzwalling in two pieces specks or rather paillettes of gold were found lightly and loosely adhering to the marú  so lightly indeed that they fell off when carelessly pocketed veins of schist still remained but in the galleries they had been followed out to the uttermost fibril  reaching the crateriform summit we found that the head of the cone had either caved in or had been carried off bodily to be worked here traces of fire seen on the rock suggested that it had been split by cold affusion a view from the summit of this burrowed mound gave us at once the measure of the past work and a most encouraging prospect for the future we determined that the marwah or quartzhill of umm elkaráyát was the focus and centre of the southern mining region even as the northern culminates in the jebel elabyaz further experience rejected the theory and showed us half a dozen foci and centres in this true quartzregion the main hill projects a small southern spur also bearing traces of the miner the block of green trap to the southwest has a capping and a veinnetwork of quartz here also the surface is artificially pitted moreover there are detached whiteyellow pitons to the northeast the east and the south whilst a promising hillock bearing nearly due north adjoins the great outcrop all have rounded conical summits and smooth sides proving that they are yet virgin and here perhaps i should prefer to begin work  at our feet and in north lat 26° 13 lies the settlement in a short gravelly reach disposed northwest to southeast and the bed is enclosed by a rim of trap and quartz hills the ruins lie upon a fork where two gorges running to the east and the northeast both fall into the broad wady elkhaur and the latter feeds the great wady elmiyáh the fiumara of the waters of which more presently the remains on the upper eastern branchvalley show where the rock was pulverized by the number of grinding implements large and small coarse and fine all save the most solid broken to pieces by the mischievous bedawi some are of the normal basalt which may also have served for crushing grain others are cut out of grey and ruddy granites a few are the common mahrákah or rubstones and the many are handmills of which we shall see admirable specimens further on one was an upper stone with holes for the handle and for feeding the mill these articles are rare i also secured the split half of a ball or rather an oblate spheroid of serpentine with depressions probably where held by finger and thumb the same form is still used for grinding in the istrian island of veglia this is one of the few rude stone implements that rewarded our careful search  the northeastern which is the main wady has a sole uneven with low swells and falls it was dry as summer dust i had expected much in the way of botanical collection but the plants were not in flower and the trees stripped of their leaves looked black as negroes out of holiday suits here lie the principal ruins forming a rude parallelogram from northeast to southwest the ground plan shows the usual formless heaps of stones and pebbles with the bases of squares and oblongs regular and irregular large and small there were no signs of wells or aqueducts and the few furnaces were betrayed only by ashen heaps thin scatters of scoriæ and bits of fluxdark carbonate of lime here and there mounds of the rosy micaceous schist still unworked looked as if it had been washed out by the showers of ages the general appearance is that of an ergastulum like umm Ámil here perhaps the ore was crushed and smelted when not rich enough to be sent down the wady for waterworking at the place where the inland fort now is  the quarrymen placed at the most likely spots were ordered to spall rock for specimens with their usual perversity they picked up when unwatched broken bits of useless stuff they spent the whole day dawdling over three camelloads and they protested against being obliged to carry the sacks to their tents meanwhile nájí who had told marvellous tales concerning a well in the neighbouring hills which showed the foundations of houses in its bowels was directed to guide lieutenant amir he objected that the enormous distance would be trying to the stoutest mule and yet he did not blush when it was reached after a miles ride to the southwest 240° mag it proved to be a longmouthed pit sunk in the trap hillslope some four fathoms deep but much filled up and so far from being built in it had not even the usual wooden platform eastward of it and at the head of the wady shuwaytanah the devilling lay a square ruin like a small mashghal of white quartz here also were three stones scribbled with pious ejaculations such as yá allah and bismillah in a modern kufic character  umm elkaráyát the mother of the villages derives her title according to the baliyy from the numerous offspring of minor settlements scattered around her we shall pass several on the next days march and i am justified in setting down the number at a dozen the wady elkibli the southern valley was visited by lieutenants amir and yusuf on april 8th when we were encamped below it at abálmarúen58 after riding about six miles to the northnorthwest down the wady elmismáh and up the wady elargah they reached on the left bank of the latter the ruins known as marú elkhaur the remains of the daughter are those of the mother there are two large heaps of quartz to the north and to the southeast of the irregular triangle whose blunted apex faces northwards the southeastern hill shows an irregular fahr pit in the reef of white stone leading to a number of little tunnels  i lost all patience with wellsteden59 whose blunders concerning the umm elkaráyát are really surprising even for a sailor on camelback he reaches the ruins after ten miles from the fort when they lie between twelve and thirteen from elwijh he calls the porphyritic trap dark granite he makes the grand quartz formation limestone of which the materials used for constructing the town coralline appear to have been chiefly derived he descends the caves with ropes and lights yet he does not perceive that they are mining shafts and tunnels puits dair adits for the workmen and pits by which the ore was brought to grass and the hydrographic chart is as bad it locates the inland fort six miles and threequarters from the anchorage but the mine is thrust eastwards ten miles and a quarter from the fort the latter distance being as has been seen little more than the former moreover the ruins are placed to the north when they lie nearly on the same parallel of latitude as elwijh ahmed kaptán fixed them by solar observations in north lat 26° 13 so that we made only one mile of southing it ignores the porphyritic subrange in which the mother of the villages lies and it brings close to the east of it the tall peaks of the tihámatbalawíyyah which from this point rise like azure shadows on the horizon finally it corrupts umm elkaráyát to feyrabat impossible but true  the night at the ruins was dry and cool even cold disturbed only by the coughing of the men the moaning of the camels and the bleating of the sheep we would willingly have spent here another day but water and forage were absolutely wanting and the guides assured us that even greater marvels in the shape of ruins and quartzreefs lay ahead we set out shortly after five am march 31st the morning was pearly and rosy but puffs of a warmer wind announced the dufún local khamsin which promised us three days of ugly working weather leaving umm elkaráyát by the upper or eastern valleyfork we soon fell into and descended its absorbent the broad northern wady elkhaur upon the right bank of the latter rose the lesser mountain of quartz a cone white as snow looking shadowy and ghostly in the petit jour the dim light of morning for the next two hours  seven miles we saw on both sides nothing but veins and outcrops of marú worked as well as unworked all was bare and barren as the gypsum the hardy aushaz lycium allied to the teatree is the only growth that takes root in humusfilled hollows of the stone  presently the quartz made way for long lines and broad patches of a yellowwhite heataltered clay often revetted with iron and passably aping the nobler rock from one reef i picked up what appeared to be trachyte white like that of shaghab the hillcasing of the valley forms no regular line the heaps of black red and rusty trap are here detached and pyramidal there cliffing as if in presence of the sea the vegetation improved as we advanced the trees were no longer black and heatblasted and we recognized once more the dandelion the thistle the senna the aristida grass and other familiar growths tents shepherds and large flocks of goats and kids showed that water was not distant and here in baliyyland even the few young women seemed to have no fear of the white face  after a slow dull ride in the burning and sickly wind we crossed the head of our former route wady zurayb the ugly and presently entered the wady elkubbah of the cupola where our immediate destination rose before us it is a grisly black saddleback banded with two perpendicular stripes of dark stone that shines like specular iron and upon its tall northern end the pommel stands a small ruin the oft spoken of dome sketches of paths wind up the western flank but upon this line we were assured no ruins are seen save a few pits so we rounded the block by the north following the broad wady to the máyat elkubbah waterpits in the sand whose produce had not been libelled when described as salt scanty and stinking the track then turned up a short broad branchwady running from south to north and falling into the left bank of the dome valley a few yards brought us to a halt at the ruins of elkubbah we had pushed on sharply during the last half of the way and our mornings ride had lasted four hours  thirteen miles  the remains lie in the uneven quartzose basin at the head of the little lateral watercourse they are built with good cement and they evidently belong to the race that worked the mother of the villages but there is nothing to distinguish them except the ruins of a large sákiyah drawwell with its basin of weathered alabaster we were perplexed by the shallow conical pits in the porphyritic trap to the east and west of the dome hill the ground is too porous for rain cisterns and the depth is not sufficient for quarrying the furnaces showed the normal slag but the only metals lying around them were poor ironclay and a shining black porphyry onyxed with the whitest quartz there were however extensive scatters of negro which had evidently been brought there and presently we found large heaps of rosycoloured washedout schisten60 these explained the raison dêtre of this dreary and dismal hole  meanwhile the juniors ascended the rocky kubbah hill which proved to be a small matter of 120 feet aner 2934 above the valleysole aner 2946 the dome was nothing but a truncated circle of wall porphyry and cement just large enough to hold a man the cupolaroof if there ever had been one was clean gone and adjoining it yawned a rockcut pit some fifteen feet deep i came to the conclusion that here might have been a lookout where possibly the balefire was also lit the ascensionists brought back a very healthy thirst  we rested till noon in the filmy shade of the thorntrees the caravan was at once sent forward to reach the only good water lying said the guides many a mile beyond we had made up our minds for a good long march and i was not a little vexed when after half an hour we were led out of the wady elkubbah whose head our proper line lies to the north into its eastern influent the wady eldasnah here after an afternoon spell of fortyfive minutes  two miles and a half and a total of four hours and fortyfive minutes  fifteen miles and a half a day nearly half wasted we found the tents pitched the heat had strewed the wady with soldiers and quarrymen and the large pit in the bed supplying water sweet as the nile showed a swarm of struggling blacks which the egyptian officers compared with aráfít or demons we with large pismires a sentinel was placed to prevent waste and pollution at the máyat eldasnah whose position is in north lat 26° 23  april fools day was another that deserved to be marked with a white stone i aroused the camp at 330 am in order that the camels might load with abundance of water we were to reach the springs of umm gezáz but a presentiment told me that we might want drink at that hour the camp was a melancholy sight the europeans surly because they had discussed a bottle of cognac when they should have slept the good sayyid without his coffee and perhaps without his prayers wakíl mohammed sorrowfully attempting to gnaw toothbreaking biscuit and the bedawin working and walking like somnambules however at 510 am we struck north over a low divide of trap hill by a broad and evidently made road and regained the wady elkubbah here it is a pleasant spectacle rich in trees and vocal with the cooing of the turtledove after an hours sharp riding we reached its head a fair round plain some two miles across and rimmed with hills of red green and black plutonics the latter much resembling coal it was a replica of the sadrbasin below the hismá even to the khuraytah or pass at the northern end here however the col is a mere bogus that is no raised plateau lies beyond it  we crossed a shallow prism and a feedingbasin an ugly little gorge then led to the important wady sirr we are now in the hydrographic area of the wady nejden61 which numbering influents by the dozen falls into the salbah thalbah of sharm dumaghah the sirr though still far from its mouth is at least three miles broad and the guides speak of it as the asl elbalawíyyah or old home of the baliyy the view from its bed is varied and extensive behind us lies the tihámatbalawíyyah the equivalent of the gháts of north midian from the zahd to the shárr the items are the little jebel antar which peeping over the fiumaras high left bank is continued south by the lower libn the latter attaches to the higher libn whose triad of peaks the central and highest built of three distinct castellations flush and blush with a delicate pinkwhite cheek as it receives the hot caresses of the sun we are now haunted by the libn which like its big brother the shárr seems everywhere to accompany us  beyond the neutral ground over which we are travelling appear in front the paleblue heights bordering the wady nejd to the northwest and apparently connected with the jebelayn eljayy in the far north 30° mag to the northeast the view is closed by the lumpy jebel elkurr the qorh of arabian geographers followed southwards by the peaked wall of the jebel elward and by elsafhah with its pins for the last eighteen miles we had seen no quartz which however might have veined the undergroundrock the sole of the sirr now appeared spread with snow streaked and patched with thin white paint the stones were mostly waterrolled the discharge of valleys draining from afar the ground was unpleasantly pitted and holed the camels were weak with semistarvation and the depressing southwester lieutenant amir put his dromedary to speed resulting in a noseflattening fall and the sayyid nearly followed suit  this is our second day of khamsin yet on the northern slope of the great fiumara we meet the cool landwind either it or the seabreeze generally sets in between seven and eight am when the stony sandy world has been thoroughly sunned the short divide beyond the far bank of the sirr is strewn with glittering micaschist that takes the forms of treetrunks and rotten wood and with dark purpleblue fragments of clayslate looking as if they had been worked a counterslope of the same material which makes excellent pathmetal placed us in the wady rubayyigh the little rábigh or greengrown spring a short and proportionally very broad branch draining to the sirr here large outcrops of quartz mingled with the clay slate a few yards further it abutted upon a small gravelly basin with ruins and a huge white reef of mará which caused a precipitate dismounting we had marched only four hours  thirteen miles but the loss of time has its compensations our arabs who consider this a fair days work will now in hopes of a halt show us every strew of quartz and every fragment of wall they congratulated us upon reaching a part of their country absolutely unvisited by europeans  the site of our discovery was the waterparting of the wady rubayyigh with the wady rábigh both feeders of the sirr this to the north that to the south the ruins known as umm elharáb mother of desolation are the usual basementlines they lie in the utterly waterless basin our campingground stretching west of mará rubayyigh the big white reef this mother bears nearly north of umm elkaráyát in north lat 26° 33 36 ahmed kaptán her altitude was made upwards of a thousand feet above sealevel aner 2892  at umm elharáb we saw for the first time an open mine scientifically worked by the men of old they chose a pearshaped quartzreef the upper dome exposed the converging slopes set and hidden in green trap to the east and west and the invisible stalk extending downwards probably deep into earths bowels they began by sinking as we see from certain rounded apertures a line of shafts striking northnortheast 45°50° mag to southsouthwest across the summit which may measure one hundred and twenty yards the intervening sections of the roof are now broken away and a great yawning crevasse in the hilltop gives this saddleback of bare creamcoloured rock spangled with white where recently fractured the semblance of a comb or cresting reef  we descended into this chasm whose slope varies from a maximum of 45° to a minimum of 36° at the south the depth apparently did not exceed thirty feet making allowance for the filling up of centuries but in places the hollow sound of the hammer suggested profounder pits and wells i should greatly doubt that such shallow sinking as this could have worked out any beyond the upper part of the vein here it measures from six to eight feet in diameter diminishing to four and a half and even three below the sloping roof has been defended from collapse by large pillars of the rock left standing as in the old egyptian quarries it shows the clumsy but efficient practice that preceded timbering the material worked was evidently the pinkcoloured and silverscaled micaceous schist but there was also a whitish quartz rich in geodes and veinlets of darkbrown and black dust the only inhabitants of the cave bats and lizards gongylus ocellatus l etc did not prevent m lacaze making careful study of the excavation the necessity of brown shadows however robs the scene of its charm the delicate white which still shimmers under its transparent veil of shade similar features exist at elmuwaylah and elaujah in the wilderness of kadesh but those are latomiæ these are gold minesen62  another sign of superior labour is shown by the quartzcrushing implements here they are of three kinds coarse and rough basaltic lava for the first and rudest work red granite and syenitic granite for the next stage and lastly an admirable handmill of the compactest grey granite smooth as glass and hard as iron around the pinhole are raised and depressed concentric circles intended for ornament and the dishing towards the rim is regular as if turned by machinery we have seen as yet nothing like this work nor shall we see anything superior to it all are nether millstones so carefully smashed that one can hardly help suspecting the kind of superstitious feeling which suggested iconoclasm the venerable shaykh afnán showed a touching ignorance concerning the labours of the ancients and when lectured about the nabat nabathæans only exclaimed allah allah  in the evening we ascended the porphyry hills to the north of the little campingbasin and we found the heights striped by two large vertical bands of quartz the eastern vein like the jebel elmarú has a northeast to southwest strike 45° mag the western runs eastwest with a dip to south from the summit we could see that the quartzmountain as usual an exaggerated vein is hemmed in on both sides by outcrops and hills of trap black green and yellow which culminate eastward in the jebel elguráb juráb we had a fine birdseye view of the wady rábigh and of our next days march towards the shafah mountains the former was white with quartz as if hailstrewn far beyond its right bank rose an ashhab or grey head which seemed to promise quartzose granite it will prove an important feature before sleeping i despatched to elwijh two boxes of micaceous schist and two bags of quartz loads for a pair of camels                               chapter xvii the march continued to elbadádescription of the plain badais    after the exciting scenes of the last three days this stage was dull riding and consequently i fear it will be dull reading as well as writing we set off afoot betimes 510 am in the still warm morning that augured khamsín the third day was now telling heavily on man and beast a walk of ten minutes led down the rough line of the little watercourse draining the marú rubayyigh to the wady rábigh at a reentering angle of the junction a shallow pit was sunk the sand became moist and red and presently it was underlaid by a rubble of porphyritic trap nothing more  we then crossed the wady rábigh another of the short broad valleys which distinguish this section of south midian the bed sides especially the right are heaps and mounds of snowy quartz with glittering crowns of block and boulder all prove to be veins in the grey granite whose large coarse elements are decomposed by weather the dark and rusty walls of the valley also discharge the white stone in shunts and shoots here and there they might be mistaken for goz sandbanks heaped up by the wind except that these are clad in thin vegetation whereas the maru is mostly mothernaked we halted here for rest and to examine these features despite the khamsín the great gaster became querulous hunger was now the chief complaint and even the bon ordinaire had lost much of its attraction a harmless snake was killed and bottled its silver robe was beautifully banded with a line pink as the circles of the cobra coral which ran along the whole length of the back it proved to be a new species and dr gunther named it zamenis elegantissimus  beyond the rábigh we ascended a lateral valley whence a low divide led to the wady elbahrah of the basin another feeder of the sirr it was also snowwhite and on the right of the path lay black heaps hawáwít ruins not worth the delay of a visit then began a short upslope with a longer counterslope on which we met a party of huwaytát camelmen and footmen going to buy grain at elwigh another apparition was a spearman bestriding a barebacked colt after reconnoitering us for some time he yielded to the temptations of curiosity it afterwards struck us that mounted on our mules preceded and followed by the shaykhs riding their dromedaries we must have looked mighty like a party of prisoners being marched inland the horseman was followed by a roughcoated beareared hound of the kind described by wellsteden63 as resembling the english mastiffhe did not know how common is the beast further north the kalb gasúr jasur or bold dog also called kalb elhámi or the hot tempered is found even amongst the bedawin to the east of the suez canal but there the halfbred is more common than the wholeblood it is trained to tend the flocks it never barks nor bites its charges and it is said to work as well as the shepherddog of europe  the wady mulaybij shows fine specimens of mica dorí in the quartzvein streaking the slate it deceived all the caravan save those who tested it with their daggers the bed after forming a basin narrows to a sandy gut smooth and pleasant riding and after crossing several valleyheads the path debouches upon the wady abálgezaz this father of glass though a day and a halfs march from the sea is even broader than the great sirr to which it is tributary its line which reminded us of the dámah is well marked by unusually fine vegetation and the basin bears large clumps of fanpalm scattered daumtrees the giant asclepiad elushren64 thickets of tamarisk and scatters of the wild castorplant whose use is unknown to the arabs water wells up abundantly from a dozen shallow pits old and new in the sand of the southern or left bank here the flow is apparently arrested by a tall buttress of coarse granite red with orthose and sliced by a trapdyke striking northsouth  our days work had been only four slow hours but we were compelled to await the caravan which did not arrive till after noon it had passed round by the wady rábigh into and up the father of glass in fact it had described an easy semicircle while we had ridden in a series of zigzags over rough and difficult short cuts a delay was also necessary for our mappers to connect this march with their itinerary of the central region already the wady mulaybij had shown us the familiar peak and dorsum of jebel raydán and we had chaffed furayj about his sudden return home from our camp in the abálgezáz the zigláb block of shaghab bore nearly north 350° mag and the adjoining jebel elaslah also a blue cone on the horizon rose about two degrees further north  after the big messtent had been duly blown down and the usual discipline had been administered for washing in the drinkingpool we crossed to the left of the wady by way of an evening stroll and at once came upon an atelier of some importance the guides seemed to ignore its existence so we christened it mashghal alálgezáz on the slope of a traphill facing the wady elghamis the southern valley which we had last crossed stood a square of masonry scattered round with fragments of pottery glass and basalt below it on the mesopotamian plain lay the foundations of houses still showing their cemented floors the lowlands and highlands around the settlement looked whitepatched with mounds veins and scatters of quartz the evening was stillness itself broken only by the cries of the katás which are now nesting as they flocked to drink and the night was coola promise and a false promise that the khamsín had ended on its usual third day  the next morning april 3rd showed us elbada the whole march lying up the wady abálgezáz which changes its name with every water the early air was delightfully fresh and brisk and the cattle stepped out as if walking were a pleasure yet the arabs declared that neither camels nor mules had found a full feed in the apparently luxuriant vegetation of the fiumarabed the tract began badly over loose sandy soil so honeycombed that neither man nor beast could tread safely the girdi jirdi or field rat is evidently nocturnal like the jerboa during the whole journey we never saw a specimen of either a yellow wolf was descried skulking among the bushes and a fine large hare was shot porcupinequills were common and we picked up the mummy of a little hedgehog the birds were swiftwinged hawks and owls pigeons and ringdoves crows again became common and the waterwagtail was tame as the brazilian thrush joão de barros it hopped about within a few feet of us quite ignoring the presence of frenchmen armed with murderous guns i cannot discern the origin of the pseudooriental legend which declares that the crow of the wilderness raven taught cain to bury his brother by slaying a brother crow and scraping a grave for it with beak and claw the murderous bird then perched upon a palmtree whose branches before erect have ever drooped and croaked the truth into adams ear hence it has ever been of evil augury to mankind the hoopoe which the french absurdly call coq de montagne also trotted by the pathside without timidity and the butcherbird impudently reviewed the caravan from its vantageground a commanding tree the large swift shot screaming overhead and the cries of the troops of merops with silverlined wings resembled those of the sandgrouse  after some five miles the father of glass changed his name to abú daumah of the one theban palm porphyritic trap lay on both sides of us to the right rose the jebel ukbal whose grey form elashhab we had seen from the heights above umm elharáb the whole range of four heads forming the southwestern rim of the badá saucer is known as elakábil below these blocks the wadysides were cut into buttresses of yellow clay powdered white with sabkh or impure salt charred circlets in the sand showed where alkali had been burned the ashes packed in skins are shipped at elwijh for syria where they serve to make soap the bedawin call it aslah athlah the egyptians ghassálah the washer because when rubbed in the hands its succulent shoots clean the skin camels eat it whereas mules refuse it unless halfstarved this plant apparently did not extend all up the wady the water where there is any swings under the left bank an ample supply had been promised to us with the implied condition that we should camp at this mahattat elurbán halting place of the arabs after a marching day of two hours seeing that we rode on the baliyy declared that they had searched for the two principal pools and that both were dry or rather had been buried by the bedawin but with characteristic futility they had allowed me to overhear their conversation and the word was passed to the soldiers who at once filled themselves and their waterskins  hitherto we had been marching south of east presently where the pretty green wady elsurám falls into the left bank we turned a corner and sighted in front or to the north the great plain of badá the block elakábil had projected a loop of some ten miles to be rounded whereas a short cut across it would not have exceeded three and now the wady abá daumah abruptly changed formation the red and green traps of the right side made way for grey granite known by its rounded bulging blocks on the sides and summit by its false stratification by its veins of quartz that strewed the sand and by its quaint weatheringone rock exactly resembled a sitting eagle a second was a turtle and a third showed a sphinx in the rough the badá plain is backed by a curtain so tall that we seemed by a common optical delusion to be descending when we were really ascending rapidly  anxiety to begin our studies of the spot made the ride across the basin soled with rises comfortably metalled and with falls of sand unpleasantly loose and honeycombed appear very long the palmclump where men camp with its two datetrees towering over the rest receded as it were at last after a total of four hours and fortyfive minutes  sixteen miles we dismounted at the celebrated groves just before the ugly khamsín arose and made the world look dull as though all its colours had been washed out  the dates form a kind of square with a sharp triangle to the south upon the left bank of the thalweg which overflows them during floods the enceinte is the normal arab snakefence of dry and barked branches which imperfectly defends the nurseries of young trees and the plots of khubbayzah edible mallows from the adjoining campingplace of bald yellow clay the wells inside and outside the enclosure are nine three stonerevetted and the rest mere pits in the inchoate modern sandstone the trees want thinning the undergrowth is so dense as to be impenetrable but the heads are all carefully trimmed the first time we have seen such industry in midian the shade attracts vipers chiefly the echis and i was startled by hearing the gay warble of the bulbula nightingale in arabia  the next day was devoted to inspecting this farfamed site with the following results we have already seen a bada arabic and a badía arabic whilst there is a badíah arabicen65 further north we are now at a badá arabic which fulfils all the conditions required by the centre and headquarters of thamuditis the site of the bújat badá the wide plain of badá as it is distinguished by the arabs represents topographically speaking a bulge in the wady nejd before it becomes the wady abú daumah between the shafah mountains to the east and the tihámah range seawards the latitude is 26° 45 30  0° 31 30 north of elwijh footnote ahmed kaptáns observation of polaris the greek bades of ptolemy is in north lat 25° 30 from its centre a little south of our campingplace the jebel zigláb of shaghab distant according to yákút one march bears 32° and the aslah athlah cone 30° both mag it lies therefore south of shuwák with a little westing the altitude is upwards of twelve hundred feet above sealevel aner 2872 the size of the oval is about nine statute miles from north to south where the main watercourse breaks and twelve miles from east to west giving an area of some 108 square miles the general aspect of the basin suggests that of elhaurá the growth is richer than the northern but not equal to that of the southern country the ruins belong to the magháir shuayb category and the guides compare the hawáwít with those of madáin sálih  such is the great station on the nabathæan overland highway between leukè kóme and petra the commercial and industrial the agricultural and mineral centre which the greeks called greek the romans badanatha pliny vi 32 and the mediæval arab geographers badá yakúb in the days when the hajjcaravan used to descend the wadys nejd and the father of glass now it is simply elbadá the name of the prophet jacob supposed to have visited it from egypt or syria being clean forgotten  the rolling plain is floored with grey granite underlying sandstones not unlike coralrag and still in course of formation through this crust outcrop curious hillocks or rather piles of hard red and ironrevetted rock with a white or a rusty fracturethese are the characteristics of the basin the lower levels are furrowed with their threads of sand beds of raintorrents discharged from the mountains and each is edged by brighter growths of thorn and fanpalm the fattening salíb grass is scattered about the water the large sorrel hugs the fiumarasides the hardy aushazthorn lycium spangled with white bloom and red currants which the arabs say taste like grapes affects the drier levels and tanzubs almost all timber when old become trees as large as the jujube  the bújat is everywhere set in a regular rim of mountains the

sight its neighbour is the bluffheaded jebel elwásil of marwát whilst the trapblocks already mentioned as the jibál elakábil finish the circle  the better to understand the shape of the ruins we will ascend the irregular block which rises a few furlongs to the northeast of the palmorchard it has only three names araygat badá veinlet of badá zebayat badá the lowlying hill of badá and shahíb elbúm the ashcoloured hill of the owl i will prefer the latter as we actually sighted one of those dear birds on its western flank it is an outcrop of grey granite pigeonholed by weather and veined by a variety of dykes here we find greenstone brecciad with the blackest hornblende there huge filons of hard red heataltered clays faced with iron whilst the fracture is white as trachyte and there filets of quartz traversing large curtains and sheets of lightcoloured argils this was evidently the main quarry the sides still show signs of made zigzags and the red blocks and boulders all round the hill bear the prayers and pious ejaculations of the faithful the characters range between square kufic hardly antedating four centuries and the cursive form of our day some are merely scraped others are deeply and laboriously cut in the hard material a work more appropriate for the miner than for the passing pilgrim  from the ruined lookout on the summit the shape of the city shows a highly irregular triangle of nine facets forming an apex at the east end of our owls hill the rises and falls of the ground have evidently determined the outline the palmorchard whose total circumference is five hundred and thirtysix metres occupies a small portion of its southeastern corner and our campingplace further east was evidently included in the ancient enceinte the emplacement extending along the eastern bank of the main watercourse is marked by a number of mounds scattered over with broken glass and pottery of all kinds no coins were found but rude bits of metal all verdigris were picked up north of the palmorchard here too lay queer fishbones with tusks and teeth chiefly the jaws of scaridæ and sparidæ seabreamsen67  descending the shahíb elbúm and passing a smaller black and white block appended to its southsouthwestern side we now cross to the left bank of the main drain here lies the broken tank the normal construction of elislams flourishing days it is a square of thirtytwo metres whose faces and angles do not front the cardinal points at each corner a flight of steps has been two have almost disappeared and the others are very shaky the floor originally stonepaved is now a sheet of hard silt growing trees and bush dense tanzubclumps sodada decidua with edible red berries sheltering a couple of birdsnests suggested a comparison between the present and the past at the east end is the makhzan elmáyah or smaller reservoir an oblong of 780 by 660 metres the waggontilt roof has disappeared and the fissures show brick within the ashlar along the eastern side are huge standing slabs of the coarse new sandstone with which the tank is lined these may be remains of a conduit around the cistern lies a ruined graveyard whose yawning graves supplied a couple of skulls a broken line of masonry probably an aqueduct runs southsoutheast 143° mag towards the palms after two hundred metres all traces of it are lost  the mining industry could not have been a prominent feature at badá or we should have found as in shaghab and shuwák furnaces and scoriæ yet about the tank we lit upon large scatters of spalled quartz which according to the baliyy is brought from the neighbouring mountains some of it was rosy outside other specimens bore stains of copper and others showed when broken little pyramids of ore tested in england it proved to be pure lead a metal so rare that some metallurgists have doubted its existence the finds have been mostly confined to auriferous lands the blowpipe soon showed that it was not galena the sulphide but some of it contained traces of silver without knowing the rarity of these specimens certain american officers at the citadel cairo compared them with the true galenas of the dárforian mines called mahattat elrisás the deposit of lead in the wady gotam three days northeast of the capital elfashr the african metal is rich large quantities analyzed by gastinel bey gave fifty per cent of lead and of silver fifty dollars per ton but the distance from any possible market will reserve these diggings for the use of the future some were sanguine enough to propose smelting the metal at khartúm where risás is ever in demand and accordingly for a time darfor was run by a mild ring against midian  the plain i have said is everywhere broken by piles of stone forming knobby hills leaving the outlined sphinx to the right we ascended a second block which rises on the west of the chief watercourse further down than the owls hill this tell elahmar red hill alias jadat badá the curved hill of bada is a quoin of grey granite bluff to the southwest the northeastern flank shows the normal revetment of ruddy and black heataltered grit which gives a red back to the palesided drabcoloured heap over the easy ascent is run a zigzag path halfway up it passes piles of stone that denote building and it abuts at the summit upon one of those lookouts which are essentially arab  again to the southeast of the palms is the huzaybat badá the isolated hillock of badá a low ridge of naked grey granite much scaled and pigeonholed on the plain to its north stretch regular lines of stone probably the remnants of a work intended to defend the citys eastern approach south of the huzaybah appear the usual signs of an atelier these workshops are doubtless scattered all around the centre but a week not a day would be required to examine them on the very eve of our departure the guides pointed northwards 350° mag to a mountain of marú called elarayfát and declared that it contained a zaríbat elnasárá or enclosure made by the nazarenes i offered a liberal present for specimens all however swore that the distance ranged from two to three hours of dromedary and that no mounted messenger could catch us unless we halted the next day  the bedawin still relegated to the upper country were sending their scouts to ascertain if the watersupply was sufficient in badá plain the adjacent valleys were dotted with shecamels and their colts the adult animal here sells for twelve to thirty dollars during the cottonfull in egypt and the cottonfamine of the united states they fetched as many pounds sterling at the frontier and the traders of elwijh own to having made two hundred per cent which we may safely double i asked them why they did not import good stallions from the banks of the nile and the reply was that of the north countrythe experiment had ended in the death of the more civilized brutes this is easily understood the baliyy camel seems to live on sand  the camp was visited by a few bedawi stragglers and the reports of their immense numbers were simply absurd the males were not to be distinguished in costume and weapons from their neighbours and the females were all dark and dressed in amorphous blue shirts at last came an old man and woman of the huwaytát tribe bringing for sale a quantity of liquefied butter they asked a price which would have been dear on the seaboard and naively confessed that they had taken us for pilgrimsbirds to be plucked but sheep and goats were not to be found in the neighbourhood yesterday we had failed to buy meat and today the young shaykh sulaymán was compelled to mount his dromedary and ride afar in quest of it the results were seven small sheep which lean with walking cost eleven dollars and all were slaughtered before they had time to put on fat  during our stay a pitiable object with a hide bandaged lower leg often limped past the tents and thinking the limb broken i asked the history of the accident our hero it appears was a doughty personage famed for valour who had lately slipped into the juhayni country with the laudable intention of lifting a camel he had indeed taken his sword and went his way to rob and steal under the profound conviction that nothing could be more honourablein case of success he was driving off the booty when its master sallied out to recover the stolen goods by force and by arms both bared their blades and exchanged cuts when the baliyy found that his old flamberge was too blunt to do damage consequently he had the worse of the affair a slicing of the right hand forced him to drop his silly sword he then closed with his adversary who again proved himself the better man throwing the assailant and at the same time slashing open his left leg the wounded man lay in the bush till he gathered strength to dot and go one homewards amongst these tribes the diyat or bloodmoney reaches eight hundred dollars consequently men will maim but carefully avoid killing one another  the evening of our halt with its lurid haze and its ominous brooding stillness was distinguished by a storm a regular arab affair consisting of dust by the ton to water by the drop this infliction of the fearful fiend samiel fatal to caravans began in the west a cloud of red sand advanced like a prairiefire at headlong speed before the mighty rushing wind whose damp breath smelt of rain and presently the mountainrim was veiled in brown and ruddy and purple earthhaze a bow in the eastern sky strongly suggested in the apparent absence of a shower refraction by dustif such thing be possible we were disappointed by the sinister wind in our hopes of collecting a bottle of rainwater for the photographer nor did the storm though it had all the diffused violence of a wintry gale materially alter the weather the next two nights were brisk and cool but the afternoons blew either the khamsín southwester or the azyab southeaster  the only bedawi tradition concerning the bada plain is the following many centuries ago some say before the apostle the baliyy held the land which was a valley of gardens a foretaste of irem the people were happy as the martyrs of paradise and the datetrees numbered two thousand the grove then belonged to a certain ibn mukarrib who dwelt in it with his son and a slave not caring to maintain a large guard of arabs consequently he became on bad terms with the ahámidahbaliyy tribe who began systematically to rob his orchard at last one of a large plundering party said to him o ibn mukarrib wilt thou sell this place of two thousand trees and not retreat from thy bargain he responded buy ie make an offer the other taking off his sandal exclaimed with this and the proprietor in wrath rejoined i have sold  ibn mukarrib then arose and went forth with his son and the slave to the place whence came the water that fed the palms this he closed up and fared towards the north one day it so happened that the three were sitting under the shade of a marakhtree and eating its berries quoth the sire to the son say which is the sweeter the eating of the marakh fruit or the dates of our orchard and the youth rejoined o my father far sweeter is the eating of the fruit of our palmyard when his sire at once arose and slew him with the sword to wipe away the disgrace of such want of manliness  then ibn mukarrib turned to the slave and asked him the question which he had asked of his son whereupon the slave replied in this quatrain        eating wild grain in the house of respect       and not eating dates in the house of contempt       and walking in honour but a single day       and not sitting in disgrace for a thousand years  ibn mukarrib pleased with these words forthwith adopted the slave both marched to the north and dwelt there till the end of their days the palmtrees deprived of irrigation all died and bújatbadá the beautiful became a wilderness about twenty years ago the wells were reopened and the dates were replanted so much for the past as for the future we may safely predict that unless occupied by a civilized people the badá plain will again see worse times nothing would be easier than to rebuild the town and to prepare the basin for irrigation and cultivation but destruction is more in the bedawi line                               chapter xviii    coal a mythmarch to marwátarrival at the wady hamz    before leaving badá i was careful to make all manner of inquiries concerning stonecoal and the guides confirmed the suspicions which had long suggested themselves his highness the viceroy had laid great stress upon the search the first question to me on return was whether the fuel had been found and a shade of disappointment appeared when the answer distinctly declared it a myth  this coal it appears is an old story my learned friend sprenger wrote to me june 13 1877 it is likely that west of marwa on the way to hawrá which lies on the seashore coal is found i confess that the prospect of discovering much coal in arabia does not appear to me very great still it would be worth while to make inquiries subsequently december 8 1877 he gave up all hopes of the pure mineral but he still clave to bituminous schist elmukaddasi p 103en68 treating of the marvels of the land has the following passage unconnected with those which precede and succeed ita fire arose between elmarwat and elhaurá and it burned even as charcoal elfahm burns probably sprenger had read and it the stone burned as charcoal burns suggesting that the houses and huts were built of inflammable material like the bituminous schist of the brazil and that the arabs were surprised to find them taking fire evidently however the text refers to an eruption in one of the many harrahs or volcanic districts elmukaddasi describes the houses artful farihín alluding to the thamúdites in the koran xxvi 149 and made of admirable stone alabaster over the doors were knots ukúd and ornaments turúh and carvings nukúsh  landing at elwijh i at once consulted our intelligent friend the wakíl mohammed shahádah he had sent for a camelload of the stuff which he declared would not burn although it had burned his money he then travelled in person to the jebel elmuharrak burnt mountain five short marches inland from elbadá plain and behind its northern curtain the jibál elshafah according to him elmuharrak is part of the great harrah and the unexplored jaww which lies north  of it is a prolongation of the hismá plateau here belonging to the balawíyyah or baliyyland the mountain is tall and black apparently consisting of the coal near its summit lies the bir elshifá well of healing a pit of cold sulphurwater excellent for the eyes and generally a pool of bethesda whither arabs flock from afar at abálgezáz mohammed destroyed all our surviving hopes by picking up a black stone which he declared belonged to elmuharrak it was schist with a natural fracture not unlike coal and weathered into the semblance of wood unfortunately it was hard as iron and it did not contain an atom of bitumen  at badá old shaykh afnán whose tents are now pitched one day ahead of us was taken into consultation upon the subject he confirmed these statements of the wakíl adding that the shafah mountains are a mere ridge not the seaward walls of a plateau and that the land east of them is exactly that which we have already traversed he had bathed in the sulphurwater he spoke of brimstone being picked up on the hillflanks and he had heard of elkohl stibium collyrium antimony being found about elmuharraken69  these details apparently authentic did not tempt me to waste precious time upon elmuharrak i do not yet despair as has been said of finding coal in arabia but we must hardly expect volcanic ground to yield it  our preparations for a march southwards were made under difficulties the baliyy evidently like the prospect of some £6 per diem and do not like the idea of approaching the frontier where their camels may be stolen every silly childish pretext was used to suggest delay we ought not to move without seeing the nazarenes ruin at elarayfát again i had sent a certain salim a cousin of the shaykh with orders for fresh supplies from elwijh he was certain to miss us if we marched still again old afnáns dromedary had a thorn in the footu s w  nevertheless an order was given for the return march on april 5th  no matter how philosophical the traveller may be i defy him not to feel some emotion when his desert work being duly done he throws his leg over the saddle and turn the animals head homewardstowards london such was our pleasant predicament for though the détour would be considerable and the delay still more so i could distinguish the bourne at the far end of the very long perspective  we were now in excellent marching order not however including the mules of which two had broken down with sore backs and the others were breaking fast the réveillé sounded at 3 to 330 pm the general followed at four and the start took place immediately afterwards the camels are wretched animals that work equally badly full and fasting when hungry they break their halters to graze along the path and when gorged they are too lazy to go beyond a saunter of two miles an hour yet they can work well when pushed the man salim came up with us on the evening of the fourth day after a forced march of thirtytwo hours  we took the track which crosses the bújatbadá to the southeast for a short way it was vilely rateaten presently it issued upon good hard stony ground and after four miles it entered the wady elmarwát this gorge marked by the jebel wásil a round head to the north is a commonplace affair of trap and white clay broad rough and unpicturesque the sole shows many piles of dry stone ruins of boxes in which the travelling arab passes the night whilst his camels are tethered outside the watercourse heads in a khuraytah the usual rockladder we reached it after eleven miles riding nájí the sealawyer of the party assured us that we had not finished a third of the way when twothirds would have been nearer the truth  the wady sides and head showed traces of hard work especially where three veins of snowy quartz had been deeply cut into the summit of the col some 2100 feet above sealevel carried a fine reef of marú measuring eight feet at the widest and trending 332° mag around it lay the usual barbarous ruins mere basements surrounded by spalled stone from this place i carried off a portable kufic inscription the view down the regular and treedotted slope of the wady elmarwát as far as the flats of badá was charming an argelèz without its oververdure  from the col two roads lead to our days destination the short cut to the right was reported stony as most of our mules were casting their irons and falling lame i avoided it by the advice of furayj thereby giving huge offence to old afnán we followed the long slope trending to the wady elkurr which drains the notable block of that name seeing the wakíl and the others in front cutting over the root to prevent rounding a prodigiously long tonguetip i was on the qui vive for the normal dodge and presently the mulatto abdullah screamed out that the nakb must be avoided as it was all rock we persisted and found the path almost as smooth as a main road the object was to halt for the night at a neighbouring waterhole in the rocks and when their trick failed the baliyy with a naive infantine candour talked and laughed over their failure sans vergogne and within earshot  despite the many zawábahs dustdevils this was one of our finest travelling days after the usual antemeridian halt we pushed on down the valley meeting only a few donkeydrivers at 215 pm seven hours  twenty miles and a half we reached the beautiful ayn elkurr some ten direct miles east of the wady rábigh and the caravan was only one hour behind us this wady is a great and important affluent of the wady elmiyáh already mentioned the reach where we camped runs from north to south and the gate of porphyritic trap red green yellow and white with clay almost envelops the quartzstreaked granite the walls are high enough to give shade between eight am and 215 pm and the level sole of the cleanest sand is dotted near the right side with holes and pools of the sweetest water here green grow the rushes especially the bigheaded kasbá arundo donax the yellowtipped namas or flags scirpus holoschænus form a dense thicket the ushr with its corklike bark which makes the best tinder is a tree not a shrub and there are large natural plantations of the saffronflowered tobaccolike verbascum the arabs uzn elhumár donkeys ear add scattered clusters of datetrees domineering over clumps of fanpalm and lastly marvellous to relate a few hundred feet of greensward of regular turfa luxury not expected in northwestern arabiaa paradise for frogs and toads bufo vulgaris grasshoppers and white pigeons and you will sympathize with our enjoyment at the ayn elkurr in such a place extensive ruins of the old ones were to be expected apparently there is no trace of man beyond wasm on the rocks a few old bedawi graves in a dwarf wady inflowing from the west a rude modern watercourse close above its mouth and arab fences round the trimmed dates and newly set palm shoots  during the afternoon the shaykhs came to us with very long faces at this season and as long as the baliyy are in the shafah uplands the almost deserted frontier districts which we are about to enter suffer from the gaum or razzia of the neighbouring anezah and the juhaynahthe two tribes however not mixing the bandits numbering they say from fifty to sixty mounted on horses and dromedaries only aspire to plunder some poor devilshepherd of a few camels goats and muttons they never attack in rear they always sleep at night save when every moment is precious for lootdriving and their weapons which may be deadly in the narrows are despicable in the open country  i suspected at first that this was another dodge to enhance the services of our arabs but the amount of risk we were to run was soon found out by consulting furayj he said that we must march in rear of the caravan for a day or two and that such attacks were possible but only once in a hundred cases there might have been treachery in camp the egyptian officers suggested that a baliyy scout could have been sent on to announce the approach of a rich caravan accordingly i ordered an evening review of our remingtons and chose a large mark purposely that the bedawi lookerson might not have cause to scoff the escort redeemed many a past lâche by showing that their weapons had been kept bright and clean and by firing neatly enough the baliyy who had never seen a breechloader were delighted but one of our party so disliked the smell of powder that he almost quarrelled with me for bringing him into such imminent deadly risk he was hardly to be blamed his nerves had been terribly shaken by a viper killed in his tent  next morning april 6th saw the most unpleasant of our marches the young shaykh sulaymán accompanied by his cousin sálim set out in the dark as éclaireurs they were supposed to lead eight or ten of the best matchlockmen whereas i doubt whether the whole camp contained that total presently it appeared that they were alone and the farce was hardly kept up through the next day at 515 am we followed them marching militairement as my friend sefer pasha had strongly advised at cairo it is no joke to follow starveling beasts whose best speed seldom attains two miles and a half per hour however the effect was excellent never had there been so little straggling never had the haltingplaces been reached in such good time and good order  a pleasant surprise awaited us in the grandest display of quartz that we had yet seen the descent of the wady elkurr seemed to be as flat stale and profitless as possible when mará appeared on the left side in mounds veins and strews presently we turned south and passed the brackish well elhufayrah the little pit in a bay of the left bank distant about eight miles from our last camp here the whole wady some two miles broad was barred with quartz in gravel of the same rock and in veins which protruding from the dark schist suggested that it underlies the whole surface nothing more remarkable than the variety of forms and tints mingling in the mighty massthe amorphous the crystallized the hyaline the burnt here mottled and banded there plain red and pink green and brown slaty and chocolate purple kaolinwhite and rarest of all honeycombyellow the richest part was at the majrá elkabsh divide of the ram where we alighted and secured specimens  from this point the wady elkurr flows down the right side of its valley and disappears to the west while the far side of the majrá shows the wady gámirah kámirah another influent of the wady elmiyáh various minor divides led to the wady ellaylah where ruins were spoken of by our confidant audah although his information was discredited by the shaykhs quartzhills now appeared on either side creamycoated cones each capped by its own sparkle whose brilliancy was set off by the gloomy traps which they sheeted and topped in some places the material may have been the usual hard white heataltered clay but the valleysole showed only the purest marú the height of several hills was nearly double that of the northern jebel elabyaz and the reefcrests were apparently unworked  after the march had extended to seven hours  18 miles there were loud complaints about its length the venerable afnán himself begging us to spare his camelswhich being interpreted meant spoiling our pockets i therefore gave orders to camp in the broad and open wady laylah we were far from water but the evening was pleasant and the night was still more agreeable  at five am next day april 7th we rode up the wady laylah which gave us another surprise and an unexpected joy in the shifting scenery of the jibál elsafhah the mountains of the plain so called because they start suddenly from a dead level are a section of the tihámatbalawíyyah range yet they are worthy links of a chain which boasts of a shárr rising hard on our left beyond the dull traps that hem in the wadys these blocks especially the lower features the mere foothills assume every quaintest nuance of hue and form the fawngrey colour here shining as if polished by slickensides there dull and roughened by the rude touch of time is a neutral ground that takes all the tints with which sun and moon mist and cloud paint and glaze the world changeable as the chameleons the coating is never the same for two brief hours the protean shape seen in profile and foreshortened from the north or south appears a block bristling with pins and points horns and beaks viewed from the east the range splits into a double line whose ranks have never been dressed nor sized whilst a diagonal prospect so alters their forms and relations that they apparently belong to another range  the background lying upon the most distant visible plane is the whitestreaked and regular wall of the jebel elward which we have already seen from the sea its northern footranges are the palewhite and jagged afayr whose utter isolation makes it interesting and the low and long the dark and dumpy jebel tufayyah it is separated by a broad valley from its southern neighbour the jebel elughlub or elghalab as some call it this typical block consists chiefly of a monstrous parrots beak of granite continued by a long dorsum to the south its outliers number four these are first the umm natash two sets of perpendicular buttresses pressed together like sausages or cigars then comes the talát muhajjah a broken saddleback whose cantle from the southeast appears split into a pair of steeplelike bouldersan architect of alexander the greats day would have easily cut and trimmed them into such towers as the world has never seen follows the umm elnatákah bristling like the fretful porcupine and apparently disdaining to receive the foot of man while the last item the jebel elkhausilah has outlines so thoroughly architectural that we seem to gaze upon a pile of building  about five miles behind or south of elkhausilah runs the wady hamz thus the two blocks elward and elughlub form the safhah proper the line is continued after a considerable break by the two blue and conical peaks in the tihámatjahaníyyah known as the jebelayn elrál they are divided and drained to the wady hamz by the broad wady elsula and the latter is the short cut down which the egyptian hajj returning northwards from elmedínah debouches upon the maritime plain of south midian  the wady laylah draining both the shafah and the tihámah ranges including the block elward assumes as usual various names we shall follow it till it is received into the mighty arms of the wady hamz some three miles from the sea after riding eight hours we sighted the long line of daumpalms which announce the approach to elbirkah the tank here the huge fiumara sweeping grandly from northeast to southwest forms a charming narrow and a riverlike run about a mile and a half longphenomenal again in sunscorched arabia the water collecting under the masses of trap which wall in the left bank flows down for some distance in threads à ciel ouvert and finally combines in a single large bluegreen pool on the right side a turquoise set in enamel of the brightest verdure it attracts by its dense and shady beds of rushes a variety of waterfowlone of our bedawin killed a blackheaded duck with a bullet which spoilt it as a specimen about the waterrun are dwarf enclosures and even watermelons were sown unhappily the torrent came down and carried all away  we halted near the upper spring at 820 am after the usual accident which now occurred daily about that hour on this occasion lieutenant yusufs shoe stuck in the stirrup when he was dismounting from an unsteady mule the animal threw him and he had a somewhat narrow escape from being dragged to death man and beast would have lingered long over the pleasures of watering and refection but i forced them onwards at nine am whilst the hot sunrays were still tempered by the cool landbreeze the threads of water and the wet ground extended some two kilometres beyond the birkat further on was another fine gate whose eastern or right jamb was the jibál eltibgh fronting the wady mjirmah the narrows showed two arab wells with the usual platform of dry trunks that make a footing round the mouth there was no break in the continuity of the quartz the black trap enclosed here sheets there veins and there almonds in puddings  at the haltingplace a cerastes echis carinata merr so called from the warty hollows over the eyes  was brought to me in a waterbag the bearer transferred it to the spiritbottle by neatly thrusting a packingneedle through the head the pretty specimen of an amiable and much oppressed race did not show an atom of vice i cannot conceive what has caused the absurd prejudice against snakes even the most harmless perhaps we must trace it to the curious resemblance of the profile with the flattened forehead the steely bright eye the formidable biting apparatus and the vanishing chin to the genus woman species lorette it is hard to imagine that this little beast which some one called a cleopatras hasp could be fatal its small bag can hardly contain a couple of drops yet the vox populi is distinctly against me  the shaykhs were anxious to push on for another halfhour where they declared a rainhole is found in the next ravine the shab elkahafah but we had been privily told of another further down the valley at the shab elhárr and although we much wanted a bottleful for photography we determined to run the risk the result is curious showing how jealously watersecrets are kept in these lands the next thing i heard was that the water had waxed salt then it had dried up and lastly it was in the best condition the truth being that there was none at all consequently we were compelled to send back four camels and two cameleers from our next campingground to the kahafah venerable afnán made many a difficulty and an uncommon favour of risking the plundering of the dromedaries and the lives of his caterans by a razzia the fellows set off after nightfall towards the upper ravine distant some two hours slow march they must there have had a pleasant refreshing sleep and they did not return doubtless by order till late next morning this gave the shaykhs a good opportunity of fearing greatly for the safety of their people and of delaying our march as much as possible  resuming the road at 230 pm we entered the western prolongation of the wady elbirkah here it becomes the wady abálagág ajáj and preserves that name till it anastomoses with the hamz there have been some wells in the bed but all are now filled up and water must be carried from elbirkah we camped at a noble reach garnished with a mimic forest of old tamarisks whose small voices united in chorus passably imitated the mighty murmur of the sea our days march had covered a score of miles hard work considering the condition of the mules  after a splendid night we set out londonwards at five am april 8th delayed as has been said by the politiké of the shaykhs moreover one of the party whose motto should have been halts maul had remarked that the camels appeared fewer than beforeanother reason for stopping to count them half an hour placed us at a lower and a grander carrefour abounding in fuel and seducing with tamariskshade its water is known as the máyat elbadíah presently the hilly encasement of the wady elajáj ended with eladrá a red butte to the left and the jebel elyakhmúm on the right this knob was copiously veined with quartz of which a prodigious depôt explored on the next day exists in the heights behind it the wady now flares out we have done with the tihámah mountains and we are again in maritime south midian  although we were standing some four hundred feet above the wassersspiegel there was no view of the sea and we had to cross a wave of ground before we pulled off our hats to father neptune as he lay smiling in front of us there was nothing monotonous in the scene the mirage raised high in air the yellow mound of ras kurkumah turmeric head which bounded the waterline to the south nearer but still far to the left ran the high right bank of the wady hamz sweeping with a great curve from northeast to west till it stood athwart our path knobby hills were scattered over the plain and on our right rose eljuwayy a black mound with whitesided and scarred head whose peculiar shape a crest upon a slope showed us once more the familiar secondary formation of northwestern arabia thus the gypsum has been traced from the sinaitic shore as far south as the wady hamz  we rode sharply forwards impatient to see the classical ruins leaving the caravan to follow us the girdi sandrat had ceased to burrow the banks but the jerboa had made regular rabbitwarrens at halfpast seven we crossed a winding and broadspreading track the upper hajjroad by which the egyptian mahmal passes when returning from elmedinah viâ the wady hamz a few yards further on showed us a similar line the route taken by the caravan when going to meccah viâ yambú now distant five marches the two meet at the wady wafdíyyah to the northeast of the abálmarú range which we shall visit tomorrow  shortly after 10 am we crossed the deepest vein of the wady hamz urged the mules up the stiff left bank and sprang from the saddle to enjoy a first view of the gasr kasr gurayyim said                                chapter xix    the wady hamzthe classical ruinabálmarú the mine of   marwahreturn to elwijhrésumé of the southern journey    before describing the palace of saíd the brave i must devote a few lines to a notice of the wady hamz the wady hamz which has been mentioned as the southern frontier of egyptian midian and the northern limit of the ottoman hejaz is the most notable feature of its kind upon the northwestern arabian shore yet wallin has unjustifiably described and inscribed it wady nejd confusing it with a northern basin whose mouth the salbah thalbah we passed before reaching sharm dumayghah he appears to identify it with the classical wady elkura sprenger clean ignores the name although he mentions its branches and of course it is utterly neglected by the hydrographic chart this main approach to the arabian interior is not a fissure like the vulgar wadys but rather an opening where the gháts or maritime chain break to the north and south distant one long or two short marches from elwijh its mouth is in north lat 25° 55 and it is said to head fifteen days inland in fact beyond elmedínah towards which it curves with a southeasterly bend it receives a multitude of important secondary valleys amongst which is the wady eluwaynid universally so pronounced i cannot help thinking that this is elaúníd of elmukaddasi which elidrísí erroneously throws into the sea opposite numan island if my conjecture prove true we thus have a reason why this important line has been inexplicably neglected another branch is the wady elis sprengers alys pp 28 29 which he calls a valley in the juhaynah country and makes the northern boundary of that tribe  ethnologically considered the lower wady hamz is now the southern boundary of the balawíyyah baliyy country and the northern limit of the jahaníyyah or juhaynahland the latter is popularly described as stretching down coast to wady burmah one march beyond yambú  higher up it belongs to the alaydánanezahs under shaykh mutlakthese were the bedawin who during our stay at the port brought their caravan to elwijh both tribes are unsafe and they will wax worse as they go south yet there is no difficulty in travelling up the hamz at least for those who can afford time and money to engage the escort of shaykh mutlak a delay of twelve days to a fortnight would be necessary and common prudence would suggest the normal precaution of detaining as hostage in the seaboard settlement one of his alaydán cousins water is to be found the whole way and the usual provisions are to be bought at certain places  the following notes upon the ruins of the wady hamz were supplied to me by the baliyy bedawin and the citizens of elwijh six stages up the lower valley whose direction lies nearly northeast lead to elilá wallins ela which belongs to the anezah thence a short day to the north with easting places the traveller at madáin not madyan nor medínat sálihthe cities of sálih the site is described to be somewhat off the main valley which is here broken by a nakb  and those who have visited both declared that it exactly resembles nabathæan magháir shuayb in extensive ruins and in catacombs caverning the hillsides  also called elhijr it is made by sprenger p 20 the capital of thamuditis this province was the headquarters of the giant race termed the sons of anak joshua xi 21 the thamudeni and thamudæ of agatharkides and diodorus the tamudæi of pliny the thamyditæ of ptolemy and the arabian tamúd thamúd who extinct before the origin of elislam occupied the seaboard between elmuwaylah and elwijh their great centre was the plain elbadá and they were destroyed by a terrible sound from heaven the bethkol of the hebrews after sinfully slaughtering the miraculously produced camel of elsálih the righteous prophet koran cap vii the exploration of sálihs cities will be valuable if it lead to the collection of inscriptions sufficiently numerous to determine whether the tamúd were edomites or kin to the edomites also which of the two races is the more ancient the horites of idumæa or the horites in elhijr  and now to inspect the gasr the first sensation was one of surprise of the mental state which gave rise to the italians        dear columns what do you here       not knowing cant say mynheer  and this incongruous bit of greece or rome in the arabian wild kept its mystery to the last the more we looked at it the less we could explain its presence not a line of inscription not even a masons markall dark as the grave deafdumb as the olden gods  the site of the gasr is in north lat 25° 55 15en70 and the centre of the libn block bears from it 339° mag it stands upon the very edge of its wadys left bank a clifflet some twentyfive feet high sloping inland with the usual dark metal disposed upon loose yellow sand thus it commands a glorious view of the treegrown valley or rather valleys beneath it and of the picturesque peaks of the tihámatbalawíyyah in the background the distance from the sea is now a little over three milesin ancient days it may have been much less  the condition of the digging proves that the remains have not long been opened the baliyy state less than half a century ago but exactly when or by whom is apparently unknown to them before that time the locale must have shown a mere tumulus a mound somewhat larger than the many which pimple the raised valleybank behind the building a wall is said to have projected above ground as at uriconium near the wrekinen71 this may have suggested excavation besides supplying material for the bedawi cemetery to the southwest the torrent waters have swept away the whole of the northern wall and the treasureseeker has left his mark upon the interior columns and pilasters and bevelled stones have been hurled into the wady below the large pavementslabs have been torn up and tossed about to a chaos and the restless drifting of the loose yellow desertsand will soon bury it again in oblivion the result of all such ruthless ruining was simply null the imaginative nájí declared it is true that a stone dog had been found but this animal went the way of the iron fish which all at elmuwaylah asserted to have been dug up at elwijhthe latter place never having heard of it wallin p 316 was also told of a black dog which haunts the ruins of karáyyá and acts guardian to its hidden treasures years ago when i visited the mouth of the volta river on the gold coast the negroes of cape coast castle were pleased to report that i had unearthed a silver dog at whose appearance my companion colonel de ruvignes and myself fell dead but why always a dog the palace is a roman building of pure style whether temple or nymphæum we had no means of ascertaining the material is the rughám or alabaster supplied by the secondary formation and this as we saw readily crumbles to a white powder when burnt the people who in such matters may be trusted declare that the quarries are still open at abú makhárír under the hills embosoming abálmarú we should have been less surprised had the ruin been built of marble which might have been transported from egypt but this careful and classical treatment of the common country stone only added to the marvel  it must have been a bright and brilliant bit of colouring in its best dayshence possibly the local tradition that the stone sweats oil the whole building from the pavement to the coping notched to receive the roofjoists is of alabaster plainwhite and streaked with ruddy mauve and dark bands whose mottling gives the effect of marble perhaps in places the gypsum has been subjected to plutonic action and we thought that the coloured was preferred to the clear for the bases of the columns the exposed foundations of the eastern and western walls where the torrent has washed away the northern enceinte show that after the fashion of ancient egypt sandstone slabs have been laid underground the calcaire being reserved for the hypaethral part the admirable hydraulic cement is here and there made to take the place of broken corners and flaws have been remedied by carefully letting in small cubes of sound stone there are also crampholes for metal which of course has been carried off by the bedawin the rusty stains suggest iron  the building is squareshaped as we see from the western wall and it evidently faced eastward with 25° mag of southing this orientation probably borrowed from the jews was not thoroughly adopted in christendom till the early fifth century when it became a mos the southern wall whose basement is perfect shows everywhere a thickness of 095 centimetre and a total length of 8 metres 30 centimetres at 2 metres 87 centimetres from the southwestern corner is a slightly raised surface measuring in length 2 metres 15 centimetres mr james fergusson supposes that this projection which directly fronts the eastern entrance was the base of the niche intended for the image on each side of the latter might have been a smaller colonette which would account for the capital carried off by us to egypt thus adding 2 metres 87 centimetres for the northern end swept into the valley we have a length of 7 metres 89 centimetres and the additional half thickness of the east wall would bring it to a total of 8 metres 30 centimetres  the shrine was not in antis and the site hardly admits of a peristyle besides which excavations failed to find it that it might have had a small external atrium is made probable by the peculiarity of the entrance two rounded pilasters worked with the usual care inside but left rough in other parts because they could not be seen were engaged in the enceinte wall measuring here as elsewhere 095 centimetre in thickness nothing remained of them but their bases whose lower diameters were 095 centimetre and the upper 065 the drums found elsewhere also measured 065 the interval between the lowest rings was 1 metre 63 centimetres and this would give the measure of the doorway here probably a parallelogram lying on the sandslope to the north a single capital showed signs of double brackets although both have been broken offen72 the maximum diameter across the top was 060 centimetre diminishing below to 050 and 044 whilst the height was 040 the encircling wall was probably adorned with pilasters measuring 062 centimetre below 045 above and 011 in height they are not shown in the plan and i leave experts to determine whether they supported the inside or the outside surface several stones probably copings are cut with three morticejoints or joistholes each measuring 015 centimetre at intervals of 014 to 015  in the tossed and tumbled interior of this maison carrée the pavementslabs especially along the southwestern side appear in tolerable order and not much disturbed whilst further east a long trench from north to south had been sunk by the treasure seeker the breadth of the free passage is 1 metre 92 centimetres and the disposal suggested an inner peristyle forming an impluvium thus the cube could not have been a heroön or tomb four bases of columns with a number of drums lie in the heap of ruins and in the torrentbed six of which we carried off four they are much smaller than the pilasters of the entrance the lower tori of the bases measure 060 centimetre in diameter and 020 in height to 090 and 025 while the drums are 045 instead of 065 it is an enormous apparatus to support what must have been a very light matter of a roof the only specimen of a colonettecapital has an upper diameter of 026 a lower of 017 and a height of 016  although the meccan kabah is as its name denotes a cube this square alabaster box did not give the impression of being either arab or nabathæan the work is far too curiously and conscientiously done the bases and drums as the sundries carried to cairo prove look rather as if turned by machinery than chiselled in the usual way i could not but conjecture that it belongs to the days of such roman invasions as that of Ælius gallus straboen73 tells us of his unfortunate friend and companion that on the return march after destroying negránen74 pliny vi 32 he arrived at egra or hegra elwijh where he must have delayed some time before he could embark as much of his army as could be saved for the opposite african harbour myus hormus it is within the limits of probability that this historical personageen75 might have built the gasr either for a shrine or for a nymphæum a votiveoffering to the great wady which must have cheered his heart after so many days of desert country with only a few wateringplaces perhaps an investigation of the ruins at ras kurkumah and the remains of madáin sálih may throw some light upon the mystery in our travel this bit of classical temple was unique  mr fergusson whose authority in such matters will not readily be disputed calls the building a small shrine and determines that it can hardly be a tomb as it is hypæthral the only similar temple known to him is that of soueideh suwaydah in the haurán de vogüé syrie centrale plate iv the latter which is roman and belonging to the days of herod augustus has a peristyle here wanting in other respects the resemblance is striking  m lacaze photographed under difficulties such as bad water and a most unpleasant drift of sanddust the interior of the building the stones lying in the wady below and the various specimens which we carried off for the inspection of his highness the viceroy meanwhile we pottered about making small discoveries the exposed foundations of the northwestern wall where the slabs of grit rest upon the sands of the cliff afforded signs of man in the shape of a jawbone with teeth apparently modern and above it in the terreplein we dug down upwards of a yard without any result beyond unearthing a fine black scorpion the adjoining arab graveyard adorned with the mutilated spoils of the classical building gave two imperfect skulls and four fragments we opened one of the many mounds that lie behind the gasr showing where most probably stood the ruined town and we found the interior traversed by a crumbling wall of cut alabasterregular excavation may some day yield important results a little to the southwest lies a kind of ossuary a tumulus slightly raised above the wavy level and showing a central pit choked with camels bones at least we could find no other  and here i was told the arab legend by the wakíl who openly deriding the bedawi idea that the building could be a castle opined that it was a kanísah a christian or pagan place of worship gurayyim saíd saíd the brave was an african slave belonging to an arab shaykh whose name is forgotten one day it so happened that a razzia came to plunder his lord when the black whose strength and stature were equal to his courage and let us add his appetite did more than his duty thus he obtained as a reward the promise of a bride his masters daughter but when the day of danger was past and the slave applied for the fair guerdon the shaykh traitorously refused to keep his word the brave finding a fit opportunity naturally enough carried off the girl to the mountains solemnly thrashed every pursuing party and having established a reign of terror came to the banks of the wady hamz and built the palace for himself and his wife but his love for butchersmeat did not allow him to live happily ever after as the land yielded little game he took to sallying out every day and carrying off a camel which in the evening he slew and roasted and ate

subaudi of gold one stage and lastly to elmarwah two stages and thou takest from elbadr to eljáren79 one stage thence to eljahfah  or to elyambu two stages each and thou takest from eljiddah jedda to eljár or to elsurrayn  four stages each and thou takest from elyasrib jatrippa or elmedínah to elsuwaydíyyah  or to batn elnakhil  two stages each and from elsuwaydíyyah to elmarwah an equal distance ie four marches and from the batn elnakhil to the mine of silver a similar distance and if thou seek the jáddat misren80 then take from elmarwah to elsukyáen81  and thence to badá yakúben82 three marches and thence to elaúníd one march hence sprenger would place zúlmarwah four days from elhijr on the western road to medina alluding to the western syrian road now abandoned  and now for our march on the finest possible morning april 9th when the world was all ablaze with living light i walked down the wady hamz it has been abundantly supplied with water in fact the whole vein thalweg subtending the left bank would respond to tapping the well elkusayr just below the ruin though at present closed yielded till lately a large quantity about half a mile to the westward is or rather was a saltish pit surrounded by four sweet almost all are now dry and filled up with fuel a sharp trudge of threequarters of an hour leads to the bir elgurnah kurnah the well of the broad in a district of the same name lying between the ruin and the shore it is a great gash in the sandy bed the taste of the turbid produce is distinctly sulphurous and my old white mule being dainty in her drink steadfastly refused to touch it the distinct accents of the red sea told us that we were not more than a mile from its marge  we then struck northeast over the salt maritime plain till we hit the lower course of the wady umm gilifayn jilifayn it heads from the seaward base of the neighbouring hills and its mouth forms a marsá or anchorageplace for native craft a little to the north stands the small pyramidal tuwayyil elkibrít the little sulphur hill which had been carefully examined by mm marie and philipin a slow ride of eight miles placed us in a safe gorge draining a dulllooking unpromising block here we at once found and found in situ for the first time the chalcedony which strews the seaboardflat this agate of which amulets and signetrings were and are still made and which takes many varieties of tints lies in veins mostly striking eastwest and varying in thickness from an inch to several feet the sequence is grey granite below the band of chalcedony and above it a curious schistose gneissformation the latter composing the greater part of these hills is striped darkbrown and yellow and in places it looks exactly like rotten wood the small specimens of chalcedony in my private collection were examined at trieste and one of them contained dendritic gold visible to the naked eye unfortunately the engineer had neglected this most important rock and only a few ounces of it instead of as many tons were brought back for analysis  a short and easy ascent led to a little counterslope the majrá mujayrah mukayrah whose whitening sides spoke of quartz we rode down towards a granite island where the bed mouths into the broad wady mismáh a feeder of the wady argah here after some ten miles the guide naji who thus far had been very misty in the matter of direction suddenly halted and in his showman style pointed to the left bank of the watercourse exclaiming behold abálmarú the father of quartz it was another surprise and our last this snowy reef with jagged crest at least 500 metres long forming the finest display of an exposed filon we had as yet seen butthe first glance told us that it had been worked  we gave the rest of the day to studying and blasting the quartzwall it proved to be the normal vein in grey granite running southnorth and gradually falling towards the valleyplain here a small white outlier disappears below the surface rising again in filets upon the further side the dip is easterly in this direction a huge strew of oremass and rubbish covers the slope which serves as base to the perpendicular reef the negro quartz which must have formed half the thickness had been carried bodily away if anything be left for the moderns it is hidden underground the stone blasted in the little outlier looked barren not the least curious part of this outcrop is the black thread of iron silicate which broken in places subtends it to the east some specimens have geodes yielding brown powder and venal cavities lined with botryoidal quartz of amethystine tinge in other parts of the same hills we found running along the mará single and double lines of this material which looked uncommonly like slag  the open wady mismáh showed to the east of our camp the ruins of a large settlement which has extended right across the bed as the guides seemed to ignore its existence we named it the kharábat abálmarú some of the buildings had been on a large scale and one square measured twenty yards here the peculiarity was the careful mining of a granitic hillock on the southern bank the whole vein of negro quartz had been cut out of three sides leaving caves that simulated catacombs further west another excavation in the same kind of rock was probably the townquarry the two lieutenants were directed next morning to survey this place and also a second ruin and reef reported to be found on the left bank a little below camp  we have now seen lying within short distances three several quartzfields known asmarwah the single place or hill of maú quartz marwát the places of quartz and abálmarú the father of quartz not to speak of a nakb abú marwahen83 further north the conclusion forced itself upon me that the name of the celebrated arab mine zúl marwah or elmarwah the more ancient greek mochura which ptolemy places in north lat 24° 30 applied to the whole district in south midian and then came to denote the chief place and centre of work to judge by the extent of the ruins and the signs of labour this focus was at umm elkaráyát the mother of the villages which as has been shown is surrounded by a multitude of minertowns and ateliers and the produce of the diggings would naturally gravitate to elbadá the great commercial station upon the nabathæan overland  thus elmarwah would signify the place of marú or quartzland even as ophir means red land a reviewer of my first book on midian objects to the latter derivation as seetzen among others has conclusively shown that ophir the true translation of which is riches is to be looked for in southern arabia connu but i question the true translation and whilst owning that one of the ophirs or red lands lay in the modern yemen somewhere between sheba sabá and havilah khaulán i see no reason for concluding that this was the only ophir had it been a single large emporium on the red sea which collected the produce of arabia and the exports of india and of west africa the traditional site could hardly have escaped the notice of the inquiring arabian geographers of our middle ages the ruins of a port would have been found and we should not be compelled theoretically to postulate its existence                                   and now nothing remained but to escape as quickly as possible from the ugly wady mismáh with its violent dusty wester or seabreeze and its sunglare which reflected and reverberated by the quartz burned the grass and made the trees resemble standing timber  april 10th saw the last of our marches a hurry back to the stable a sauve qui peut the camelmen reckless of orders began to load and to slip away shortly after midnight ali marie who as usual had lost his head when ordered to enjoin silence gave the vain and vague direction tell the arabs to tell the camels not to make so much noise even the bugler sounded the general of his own accord and the mules now become painfully intelligent walked as if they knew themselves to be walking homewards our last stage lay over the upper skirts of the maritime plain which has already been noticed at 1015 am after riding five hours and thirty minutes  seventeen miles we found ourselves once more upon the seaboard our kind host captain hasan bey came to meet us in his gig the quarterdeck had been dressed with flags as for a ball and before twelve bells struck we had applied ourselves to an excellent breakfast in the gunroom of our old favourite the sinnár the auspicious day of course ended with a fantasia                        résumé of our last journey    we had left the sharm yáhárr on march 21st and returned to it on april 13th a total of twentyfour days our actual march through south midian which had lasted thirteen days march 29april 10 described a semicircle with elwijh about the middle of the chord the length is represented by 170 miles in round numbers as usual this does not include the various offsets and the bypaths explored by the members nor do the voyages to elwijh and elhaurá going and coming figure in the line of route the camels varied from fiftyeight to sixtyfour when specimens were forwarded to the harbourtown the expenditure amounted to£92 13s including pay and bakhshísh to the baliyy shaykhs but not including our friends the sayyid furayj and the wakíl mohammed shahádah  this southern region differs essentially from the northern which was twice visited and which occupied us two months mostly wasted had we known what we do now i should have begun with the south and should have devoted to it the greater part of our time both are essentially mining countries but whilst the section near egypt preserves few traces of the miner here we find the country carefully and conscientiously worked the whole eastern counterslope of the outliers that project from the ghátsection known as the mountains of the tihámatbalawíyyah is one vast outcrop of quartz the parallelogram between north lat 26 degrees including the mouth of the wady hamz and north lat 27° which runs some fifteen miles north of the badá plain would form a southern grant sufficiently large to be divided and subdivided as soon as judged advisable  if the characteristics of north midian madyan proper are its argentiferous and especially its cupriferous ores south midian worked chiefly gold and silver both metals being mentioned by the mediaeval geographers of arabia free gold in paillettes was noticed by the expedition in the micaceous schists veining the quartz and in the chalcedony which parts the granite from the gneiss the argentiferous negro quartz everywhere abounds and near the ruins of badá lie strews of spalled marú each fragment showing its little block of pure lead saltpetre is plentiful and a third sulphur hill rises from the maritime plain north of the wady hamz  the principal ruins and ateliers number five these beginning from the north are the umm elkaráyát the umm elharáb the bújatbadá the kharábat abálmarú and the old nabathean port e1haurá amongst them is not included the gem of our discovery the classical shrine known as gasr gurayyim saíd nor the minor ateliers elkubbah abálgezáz and the remains upon the marwát ridge good work was done by the egyptian staffofficers in surveying the fine harbour of eldumayghah so well fitted as a refuge for pilgrimships when doing quarantine and i venture upon recommending to the english and egyptian governments my remarks concerning the advisability of at once retransferring the station to elwijh it is now at tor and as has been said it forms a standing menace not only to the nile valley but to the whole of europe  whilst abounding in wood the southern country is not so well watered as are central and northern midian on the other hand the tenants confined to the baliyy tribe with a few scatters of the despised hutaym are milder and more tractable than the huwaytát as i have remarked they are of ancient strain and they still conserve the instincts of their predecessors or their forefathers the old mining race it will be necessary to defend them against the raids and incursions of the juhaynah or sons of dogs who border upon them to the south and from the alaydánanezah to the southeast but nothing would be easier than to come to terms with the respective shaykhs and the sooner we explore the jaww or sandstone region in the interior with its adjacent harrahs the better for geography and perhaps not less for mineralogy the great ruins of madáin sálih upon the wady hamz still i repeat await the discoverer                                conclusion    the next day saw us at elwijh dispensing pay and bakhshísh to the companions of our desert march and shipping the men and mules with the material collected during the southern journey the venerable shaykh afnán and his baliyy were not difficult to deal with and they went their way homewards fully satisfied we exchanged a friendly adieu or rather an au revoir with our excellent travelling companion mohammed shahádah and i expressed my sincere hopes to find him at no distant time governor of the restored quarantinestation  on the morning of april 12th we set out betimes and anchored for the night in one of the snug bays of jebel numan the next day placed us at the sharm yáhárr where the process of general distribution happily ended here the final parting took place with the gallant companions of our four months travel shaykh furayj delighted with the gift in addition to his pay of a styrian skeandhu and an austrian werndlcarbine at once set off to rejoin the tribe upcountry while the sayyid steadfastly stayed with us to the last these men had become our friends and my sorrow at leaving them was softened only by the prospect of presently seeing them again  immediately after my return to cairo i strongly recommended the sayyid for promotion in these wordsfirst and foremost is the sayyid abd elrahím the head of a noble family settled for generations at elmuwayláh where he is now kátib accountant to the fort he knows thoroughly the whole land of midian he is loved and respected by all the arabs and both he and his are devoted to the government of your highness evidently it would be advantageous to promote such a man to the post of governor of the placea post which will presently become of high importance and which is actually held by an old officer almost bedridden  the second is shaykh mohammed shahádah of elwijh a man of family and position known far and wide and made generally popular by his generous and charitable actions he was formerly wakíl or agent to the fort elwijh until that office was abolished the port will presently have its customhouse and i propose forwarding to her britannic majestys government my notes upon the subject of the quarantinestation which has imprudently been transferred from arabia to tor in the sinaitic peninsula meanwhile it would i venture to suggest be most advantageous if mohammed shahádah were named governor of his native place  the expedition in its urgent desire to return northwards was not seconded by weather despite an ugly gale the sinnár boldly attempted giving the slip to arabia on april 16th but she was beaten back before she reached elmuwaylah after another stormy day we again got up steam and fighting hard against adverse winds and waves greatly to the distress of the unfortunate mules and gazelles we reached suez on april 20th  at suez my wife had been awaiting me for long weeks preferring the simplicity of the desert to the complex life of cairo some delay was again necessary in order to telegraph our arrival to apply for a special train and to sort and pack in the travellingcases our twentyfive tons of specimens as often happens the return to civilization was in nowise cheery everything seemed to go wrong for instance the dragoman despatched to town from the new docks in order to lay in certain comforts such as beef and beer prudently laid out the coin in a brandnew travelling suit intended for his own service such an apology for a dinner had not been seen during the last four months of wild travelunpleasant when guests have been bidden to a feast the night at the docks also was a trifle mortuary oversilent and tranquil all hands officers and men who could not get leave to sleep ashore simply took leavei believe myself to have been for a time both captain and crew of the sinnár and lastly we heard that both our dogcompanions juno and páijí had died of some canine epidemic  the next day ended our halt at suez with visits to slopshops and a general discussion of choppes the old hotel under the charge of mr and mrs adams had greatly improved by the elimination of the offensive hindi element and my old friends of a quartercenturys standing received me with all their wonted heartiness saíd bey was still a bey but none the less jovial and genial captain ali bey who had commanded the sinnár was now acting commodore and my only regret was having again missed colonel gordon pasha  april 22nd convinced us that even in these prosaic regions our misadventures and accidents had not reached their fated end a special train had been organized by hanafi effendi for eight am about ten miles from suez one of the thirdclass carriages began running hot and before we could dismount the axlebox of a truck became a young vesuvius in the matter of vomiting smoke i ordered the driver who was driving furiously to make half speed but even with this precaution there were sundry stoppages and at the naffíshah station where my bolognese acquaintances still throve we could not be supplied with a change of rollingstock about tell elkabír the brakevan also waxed unsafely warm but it reached zagázig without developing more caloric briefly we caught fire three times in one morning  these accidents must always be expected where spare carriages are placed for months upon sidings to become tinder in the sun and where the cracks and crevices of the woodwork fill up with the silicious sand of the desert an admirable succedaneum for flint and steel one consolation however remained to us the dragoman brandnew clothes and all was left behind at suez his last chef duvre of blundering has already been noticeden84the barrel of midianitish oysters sent to admiral mkillop pasha had been so carelessly headed up and so carefully turned topsyturvy that the result was to use my friends words they could be nosed from the halfway station the kyrios had probably passed a bacchanalian night with his hellenic friends and he subsequently made act of presence at cairo with a very britishlooking black eye his accident at suez was a bit of poetical justice which almost convinced one of the moral government  a succulent breakfast à la fourchette in the charming garden of our friend m vetter of zagázig duly discussed we again went on board amusing the lookerson by our naive enjoyment of the nilevalley they had not been in arabia and they found the emeraldgreen dusty and yellow we reached cairo at 530 pm more troubles ten minutes after arrival we found ourselves in possession in sole charge of the gare the train was loaded with government property officers soldiers and escort mules boxes and bags of specimens whose collecting had cost money yet stationmaster agent and employés at once went their ways declining even to show the room allotted to our goods although a telegram from the railway authorities had advised me that one had been made ready the assistantagent when at last hunted up declared before vanishing once more that the porters for whom we applied were busy loading cotton and that we must een do the best we could for ourselves so the waggons were shunted and unloaded by their tenants and the minerals were deposited under a kind of shed whose key was not forthcoming we failed to find even a light till the local train from suez was announced and when it began whistling the officials who had returned like rats from their holes gave us peremptory directions to shunt again this time however i had the game in my hands and replied by taking due precautions against being turned out  at first the soldierescort worked as well as could be expected but the numbers fell off every quarter of an hour till we were left with a very select party the only recipients bytheby of bakhshísh the sublieutenant mohammed effendi mounted a donkey the moment he stepped out of the rr carriage and utterly disregarding so vexatious a frivolity as asking leave rode off to his home at torah his example was followed by the sergeant mabrúk awaz and yet both these men had the impudence to call upon me at the hotel and to apply for especial shahádahs or testimonials of good conduct in short we were detained at the station for three mortal hours working with our own hands if this be a fair specimen of european management in egypt and i am told that it has now become worse much worse in every way the sooner we return to egyptian mismanagement the better the latter is at any rate cheap and civil  on the next day the viceroy graciously sent his junior master of ceremonies his excellency tonino bey to welcome me back and i was at once honoured with audiences at the khedivial palace abidin and by prince husayn kámil pasha at gizah jízah the khediv was pleased to express satisfaction with my past exertions and ordered several measures to be carried out at once amongst them was a little exhibition of mineralogy and archaeology maps and plans sketches and croquis at the hippodrome  i need hardly say that his highness at once saw the gist of the matter many concessions had been applied for even from australia but the viceroy determined that before any could be granted careful analyses of the specimens must be made at his highnesss private expense in london m ferdinand de lesseps of worldwide fame volunteered in the most friendly way to submit échantillons of the rocks to the parisian académie des sciences of which he is a distinguished member the viceroy was also pleased spontaneously to remind me of and to renew the verbal promise made upon my return from the first expedition to midian namely that i should be honoured with a concession or that a royalty of five per cent on the general produce of the mines should be the reward of discovery the young minister of finance prince husayn kámil pasha after courteously congratulating me upon the successful result of our labours put as usual the most pertinent of questions  the opening of our little exposition was delayed by sundry difficulties the greek easter set in with its usual severity about later april a general shopshutting a carouse unlimited catholic universal and despite stringent police orders a bombardment of the town by squibs and crackers were the principal features of the fête the 29th was the classical shamm elnasin or the smelling of the zephyr a local mayday religiously kept with utter idleness mr w e hayns and i utilized it by going a flinthunting on the left bank of the nileen85 then the terrible may coupon gave immense trouble and annoyance to the rulers who so far from making merry with the lieges had to work in person between five am and midnight after such exertion as this rest was of course necessary subsequently a grand review monopolized one day another was spent by the court in despatching the young prince fuád to switzerland and yet another was given to his highness the prince hasan pasha commanderinchief of the egyptian auxiliaries who on the conclusion of the war had returned to cairo en route for europe   briefly it was not before may 9th that the khediv accompanied by the prince héritier taufík pasha found leisure personally to open the exhibitionthe first bytheby ever honoured with the viceregal presence despite all my efforts the rooms which should have been kept clear till his highness had passed through were crowded at an early hour the maps prepared at the citadel by lieutenants amir and yusuf with the aid of three extra hands were very imperfect half finished at the last moment and abounding in such atrocities as ouorh for elwijh the engineer m marie when asked aloud and with all publicity by the khediv whether he was sure that such and such specimens contained gold shirked a direct reply evasively declaring that midian is a fine mining country he had pointed out to me the precious metal during our exploration of umm elkaráyat but such is the wretched result of knowing the people instead of telling the truth like a man and one of the many jealous a mild mephisto whispered in the viceregal ear there cant be much gold there or ces messieurs would have said more about it  despite these small contretemps the exhibitionen86 was pronounced a success and served as such things do for a nine days wonder several travellers from england and australia took the opportunity of inspecting the rocks and i was much encouraged to find the general opinion so highly favourable locally there were dissidents but this must be expected where interests differ  meanwhile his highness kept me hard at work i was directed to draw up a concise general description of the province to report upon the political and other measures by which the midian country would be benefited and lastly to suggest the means which in my humble opinion were best calculated for successfully working the mines in former days the viceroy would at once have undertaken the task and probably would have sent down five thousand men to open the diggings now however the endless trickery of european adventurers and speculators has made a wise precaution absolutely necessary during the last audience his highness ably and lucidly resumed the history of the past measures and the steps which he proposed for the future the first khedivial expedition had been simply one of exploration sent to ascertain whether the precious metals really existed the second was intrusted with the charge of laying down the probable limits of the mining formation and of bringing back varied specimens in quantities sufficient for scientific analysis the third and next step would be to organize a compagnie de recherche with the object of beginning a serious exploitation the future thus settled i was kindly and courteously dismissed with a desire that i should take charge of the specimens and personally superintend the work of assaying mr charles clarke received pay and leave for three months and was ordered to convey the boxes by long sea  on may 10th we left cairo in company with our friend mr garwood ce at alexandria a great repose fell upon my spirit it was like gliding into a smooth port after a storm at sea all the petty troubles and worries of cairo the cancans the intrigues the silly reports of the envious and the jealous with the buzz and sting of mosquitoes the weary waiting the visits of friends whose main object in life seemed to be tuer le ver and the exigencies of my late fellowtravellers who after liberal pay and free living for four months seemed determined to quarter themselves upon the egyptian government for the rest of their natural livesall these small cares not the less annoying because they were small disappeared like magic at the first glimpse of blue water i had barely time to pass an afternoon at ramleh the sandheap with an intimate of twentyfive years standing hartley john gisborne an old servant of the egyptian crown for whom new men and new measures have i regret to see made the valley of the nile no longer habitable  the next sunday placed us on board the austrohungarian lloyds screwsteamer austria capitano rossol as usual the commander and officers did all they could to make their voyagers comfortable the company did the contrary at this spring season true the migratory host of unfeathered bipeds crowds northwards even as in autumn it accompanies the birds southwards but when berths are full passengers should be refused and if the commercial director prefers dead to live goods travellers should be duly warned the accommodation would have been tolerable in a secondclass or thirdclass english steamer which charges fifteen shillings to a sovereign per diem here however we were paying between £2 and £3  the alexandrian agent had been asked to lodge us decently my wife found herself in a cabin occupied by two nurses i was placed in a manner of omnibus a loose box for six of whom one was an armenian and two were circassians from daghistángood men enough but not pleasant as bedroom fellows no extra service had been engaged for an extra cargo of seventytwo that is fortytwo first and thirty second class there were only three stewards including the stewardess and the sick were left to serve themselves at least half a dozen were required and in such places as trieste and alexandria a large staff of cooks and waiters can always be engaged in a few hours on board any english ship some of the smartest and handiest seamen would have been converted into temporary attendantshere no one seemed to think of a proceeding so far out of the usual way there was only one instead of three or four cooks and the unfortunate had to fill a total of one hundred and thirtyfive mouths the crew included three times a day the other tenant of the close and wretched little galley lay sick with spotted typhus and after barbarous neglect he died on the day following our arrival at triestei did not hear that the surgeon of the screwsteamer austria had met with his deserts by summary dismissal from the service the austrohungarian lloyds was once famed for good living overeconomy and high dividends have now made the cuisine worse than the cheapest of tables dhôte provisions as well as their preparation were so bad that sefer pasha an invalid confined himself to a diet of potatoes and eggs  add the quasiimpossibility of obtaining a bath the uncleanliness of the offices the hard narrowness of the sofas the small basins or rather bowls and the tiny towels like napkins the clamorous pets of the small fry cats and dogs the crowding of secondclass passengers on the quarterdeck and the noise of the armenian lady beating her maid who objected to the process in truly dreadful language throw in an engine which despite the efforts of her energetic english engineer mr wilkinson managed only nine instead of eleven and a half knots an hour an ugly northeaster off cape matapan bringing tropical downfalls of rain and a muggy scirocco off istria when we breathed almost as much water as air and i think that the short entry in my journal horridly uncomfortable was to a certain extent justified by the conduct of the poor austria yet the austrohungarian lloyds boasts a dividend of seven per cent she shall see no more of my money until she mend her ways i shall prefer the genoese rubattino  but as the persian poet has it Ín níz bugzaredeven these things pass away at corfu we were cheered by once more meeting sir charles sebright who looked hale and hearty as of yore when we reached trieste his excellency baron pino von friendenthall accompanied by the most amiable of better halves came off in his galley happily unconscious of typhus and carried us away without the usual troubles and delays of landing in harbour bumboats friendly faces smiled a welcome and after an absence of some seven months i found myself once more in the good town which has given us a home during the last five years  at trieste i was delayed for some time awaiting the report that the specimens collected by the expedition had arrived at their destination the warehouses of the london docks mr clarke met with obstacles at suez and consequently did not reach england till june 20th after twentythree rough days as her majestys foreign office had been pleased to accord me two months of leave to england i determined to make the voyage by long sea both suffering from the same complaint want of rest and of roastbeef as opposed to rosbif we resolved to ship on board the english steamer hecla of the b and n a r m s p company the old cunard line famous for never having lost a life a ship or a letter we left trieste on july 7 1878 in charge of our excellent commander captain james brown and after a cruise of twenty days viâ venice palermo and gibraltara comfortable cheery hygienic cruise in charming weather over summer seaswe found ourselves once more july 26th in the city of the liver

first volume may 25 1878 has the following remarksthe arabs talk of some  nazarenes and a king of the franks having built the stone huts and the tombs in a neighbouring cemetery aynúnah but there can be no local tradition worth repeating in this instance here we differ completely and those will agree with me who know how immutable and in certain cases imperishable arab tradition is the reviewer true speaks of north midian where all the tribes except the beni ukbah are new yet legend can survive the destruction and disappearance of a race witness the folktraditions of the northeastern
