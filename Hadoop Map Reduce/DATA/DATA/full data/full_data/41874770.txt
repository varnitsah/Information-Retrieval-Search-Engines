41874770	the house of pride   contents  the house of pride koolau the leper goodbye jack aloha oe chun ah chun the sheriff of kona jack london     the house of pride   percival ford wondered why he had come  he did not dance  he did not care much for army people  yet he knew them allgliding and revolving there on the broad lanai of the seaside the officers in their fresh starched uniforms of white the civilians in white and black and the women bare of shoulders and arms  after two years in honolulu the twentieth was departing to its new station in alaska and percival ford as one of the big men of the islands could not help knowing the officers and their women  but between knowing and liking was a vast gulf  the army women frightened him just a little  they were in ways quite different from the women he liked bestthe elderly women the spinsters and the bespectacled maidens and the very serious women of all ages whom he met on church and library and kindergarten committees who came meekly to him for contributions and advice  he ruled those women by virtue of his superior mentality his great wealth and the high place he occupied in the commercial baronage of hawaii  and he was not afraid of them in the least  sex with them was not obtrusive  yes that was it  there was in them something else or more than the assertive grossness of life  he was fastidious he acknowledged that to himself and these army women with their bare shoulders and naked arms their straightlooking eyes their vitality and challenging femaleness jarred upon his sensibilities  nor did he get on better with the army men who took life lightly drinking and smoking and swearing their way through life and asserting the essential grossness of flesh no less shamelessly than their women  he was always uncomfortable in the company of the army men  they seemed uncomfortable too  and he felt always that they were laughing at him up their sleeves or pitying him or tolerating him  then too they seemed by mere contiguity to emphasize a lack in him to call attention to that in them which he did not possess and which he thanked god he did not possess  faugh  they were like their women  in fact percival ford was no more a womans man than he was a mans man a glance at him told the reason  he had a good constitution never was on intimate terms with sickness nor even mild disorders but he lacked vitality  his was a negative organism  no blood with a ferment in it could have nourished and shaped that long and narrow face those thin lips lean cheeks and the small sharp eyes  the thatch of hair dust coloured straight and sparse advertised the niggard soil as did the nose thin delicately modelled and just hinting the suggestion of a beak  his meagre blood had denied him much of life and permitted him to be an extremist in one thing only which thing was righteousness  over right conduct he pondered and agonized and that he should do right was as necessary to his nature as loving and being loved were necessary to commoner clay  he was sitting under the algaroba trees between the lanai and the beach  his eyes wandered over the dancers and he turned his head away and gazed seaward across the mellowsounding surf to the southern cross burning low on the horizon  he was irritated by the bare shoulders and arms of the women  if he had a daughter he would never permit it never but his hypothesis was the sheerest abstraction  the thought process had been accompanied by no inner vision of that daughter  he did not see a daughter with arms and shoulders  instead he smiled at the remote contingency of marriage  he was thirtyfive and having had no personal experience of love he looked upon it not as mythical but as bestial anybody could marry  the japanese and chinese coolies toiling on the sugar plantations and in the ricefields married  they invariably married at the first opportunity  it was because they were so low in the scale of life  there was nothing else for them to do  they were like the army men and women  but for him there were other and higher things he was different from themfrom all of them  he was proud of how he happened to be  he had come of no petty lovematch  he had come of lofty conception of duty and of devotion to a cause  his father had not married for love  love was a madness that had never perturbed isaac ford  when he answered the call to go to the heathen with the message of life he had had no thought and no desire for marriage  in this they were alike his father and he  but the board of missions was economical with new england thrift it weighed and measured and decided that married missionaries were less expensive per capita and more efficacious  so the board commanded isaac ford to marry  furthermore it furnished him with a wife another zealous soul with no thought of marriage intent only on doing the lords work among the heathen  they saw each other for the first time in boston  the board brought them together arranged everything and by the end of the week they were married and started on the long voyage around the horn  percival ford was proud that he had come of such a union  he had been born high and he thought of himself as a spiritual aristocrat  and he was proud of his father  it was a passion with him  the erect austere figure of isaac ford had burned itself upon his pride  on his desk was a miniature of that soldier of the lord  in his bedroom hung the portrait of isaac ford painted at the time when he had served under the monarchy as prime minister  not that isaac ford had coveted place and worldly wealth but that as prime minister and later as banker he had been of greater service to the missionary cause  the german crowd and the english crowd and all the rest of the trading crowd had sneered at isaac ford as a commercial soulsaver but he his son knew different when the natives emerging abruptly from their feudal system with no conception of the nature and significance of property in land were letting their broad acres slip through their fingers it was isaac ford who had stepped in between the trading crowd and its prey and taken possession of fat vast holdings  small wonder the trading crowd did not like his memory  but he had never looked upon his enormous wealth as his own  he had considered himself gods steward  out of the revenues he had built schools and hospitals and churches  nor was it his fault that sugar after the slump had paid forty per cent that the bank he founded had prospered into a railroad and that among other things fifty thousand acres of oahu pasture land which he had bought for a dollar an acre grew eight tons of sugar to the acre every eighteen months  no in all truth isaac ford was an heroic figure fit so percival ford thought privately to stand beside the statue of kamehameha i in front of the judiciary building  isaac ford was gone but he his son carried on the good work at least as inflexibly if not as masterfully  he turned his eyes back to the lanai  what was the difference he asked himself between the shameless grassgirdled hula dances and the decollete dances of the women of his own race  was there an essential difference or was it a matter of degree  as he pondered the problem a hand rested on his shoulder  hello ford what are you doing here  isnt this a bit festive  i try to be lenient dr kennedy even as i look on percival ford answered gravely  wont you sit down  dr kennedy sat down clapping his palms sharply  a whiteclad japanese servant answered swiftly  scotch and soda was kennedys order then turning to the other he said  of course i dont ask you  but i will take something ford said firmly  the doctors eyes showed surprise and the servant waited  boy a lemonade please  the doctor laughed at it heartily as a joke on himself and glanced at the musicians under the hau tree  why its the aloha orchestra he said  i thought they were with the hawaiian hotel on tuesday nights  some rumpus i guess  his eyes paused for a moment and dwelt upon the one who was playing a guitar and singing a hawaiian song to the accompaniment of all the instruments  his face became grave as he looked at the singer and it was still grave as he turned it to his companion  look here ford isnt it time you let up on joe garland  i understand you are in opposition to the promotion committees sending him to the states on this surfboard proposition and ive been wanting to speak to you about it  i should have thought youd be glad to get him out of the country  it would be a good way to end your persecution of him  persecution  percival fords eyebrows lifted interrogatively  call it by any name you please kennedy went on  youve hounded that poor devil for years  its not his fault  even you will admit that  not his fault  percival fords thin lips drew tightly together for the moment  joe garland is dissolute and idle  he has always been a wastrel a profligate  but thats no reason you should keep on after him the way you do  ive watched you from the beginning  the first thing you did when you returned from college and found him working on the plantation as outside luna was to fire himyou with your millions and he with his sixty dollars a month  not the first thing percival ford said judicially in a tone he was accustomed to use in committee meetings  i gave him his warning  the superintendent said he was a capable luna  i had no objection to him on that ground  it was what he did outside working hours  he undid my work faster than i could build it up  of what use were the sunday schools the night schools and the sewing classes when in the evenings there was joe garland with his infernal and eternal tumtumming of guitar and ukulele his strong drink and his hula dancing  after i warned him i came upon himi shall never forget itcame upon him down at the cabins  it was evening  i could hear the hula songs before i saw the scene  and when i did see it there were the girls shameless in the moonlight and dancingthe girls upon whom i had worked to teach clean living and right conduct  and there were three girls there i remember just graduated from the mission school  of course i discharged joe garland  i know it was the same at hilo  people said i went out of my way when i persuaded mason and fitch to discharge him  but it was the missionaries who requested me to do so  he was undoing their work by his reprehensible example  afterwards when he got on the railroad your railroad he was discharged without cause kennedy challenged  not so was the quick answer  i had him into my private office and talked with him for half an hour  you discharged him for inefficiency  for immoral living if you please  dr kennedy laughed with a grating sound  who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury  does landlordism give you control of the immortal souls of those that toil for you  i have been your physician  am i to expect tomorrow your ukase that i give up scotch and soda or your patronage  bah  ford you take life too seriously  besides when joe got into that smuggling scrape he wasnt in your employ either and he sent word to you asked you to pay his fine you left him to do his six months hard labour on the reef  dont forget you left joe garland in the lurch that time  you threw him down hard and yet i remember the first day you came to schoolwe boarded you were only a day scholaryou had to be initiated  three times under in the swimming tankyou remember it was the regular dose every new boy got  and you held back you denied that you could swim  you were frightened hysterical  yes i know percival ford said slowly  i was frightened  and it was a lie for i could swim    and i was frightened  and you remember who fought for you who lied for you harder than you could lie and swore he knew you couldnt swim  who jumped into the tank and pulled you out after the first under and was nearly drowned for it by the other boys who had discovered by that time that you could swim  of course i know the other rejoined coldly  but a generous act as a boy does not excuse a lifetime of wrong living  he has never done wrong to youpersonally and directly i mean  no was percival fords answer  that is what makes my position impregnable  i have no personal spite against him  he is bad that is all  his life is bad  which is another way of saying that he does not agree with you in the way life should be lived the doctor interrupted  have it that way  it is immaterial  he is an idler  with reason was the interruption considering the jobs out of which you have knocked him  he is immoral  oh hold on now ford  dont go harping on that  you are pure new england stock  joe garland is half kanaka  your blood is thin  his is warm  life is one thing to you another thing to him  he laughs and sings and dances through life genial unselfish childlike everybodys friend  you go through life like a perambulating prayerwheel a friend of nobody but the righteous and the righteous are those who agree with you as to what is right  and after all who shall say  you live like an anchorite  joe garland lives like a good fellow  who has extracted the most from life  we are paid to live you know  when the wages are too meagre we throw up the job which is the cause believe me of all rational suicide  joe garland would starve to death on the wages you get from life  you see he is made differently  so would you starve on his wages which are singing and love  lust if you will pardon me was the interruption  dr kennedy smiled  love to you is a word of four letters and a definition which you have extracted from the dictionary  but love real love dewy and palpitant and tender you do not know  if god made you and me and men and women believe me he made love too  but to come back  its about time you quit hounding joe garland  it is not worthy of you and it is cowardly the thing for you to do is to reach out and lend him a hand  why i any more than you the other demanded  why dont you reach him a hand  i have  im reaching him a hand now  im trying to get you not to down the promotion committees proposition of sending him away  i got him the job at hilo with mason and fitch  ive got him half a dozen jobs out of every one of which you drove him  but never mind that  dont forget one thingand a little frankness wont hurt youit is not fair play to saddle another fault on joe garland and you know that you least of all are the man to do it  why man its not good taste  its positively indecent  now i dont follow you percival ford answered  youre up in the air with some obscure scientific theory of heredity and personal irresponsibility  but how any theory can hold joe garland irresponsible for his wrongdoings and at the same time hold me personally responsible for themmore responsible than any one else including joe garlandis beyond me  its a matter of delicacy i suppose or of taste that prevents you from following me dr kennedy snapped out  its all very well for the sake of society tacitly to ignore some things but you do more than tacitly ignore  what is it pray that i tacitly ignore  dr kennedy was angry  a deeper red than that of constitutional scotch and soda suffused his face as he answered  your fathers son  now just what do you mean  damn it man you cant ask me to be plainer spoken than that  but if you will all rightisaac fords sonjoe garlandyour brother  percival ford sat quietly an annoyed and shocked expression on his face kennedy looked at him curiously then as the slow minutes dragged by became embarrassed and frightened  my god he cried finally you dont mean to tell me that you didnt know  as in answer percival fords cheeks turned slowly grey  its a ghastly joke he said a ghastly joke  the doctor had got himself in hand  everybody knows it he said  i thought you knew it  and since you dont know it its time you did and im glad of the chance of setting you straight  joe garland and you are brothershalfbrothers  its a lie ford cried  you dont mean it  joe garlands mother was eliza kunilio  dr kennedy nodded  i remember her well with her duck pond and taro patch  his father was joseph garland the beach comber  dr kennedy shook his head  he died only two or three years ago  he used to get drunk  theres where joe got his dissoluteness theres the heredity for you  and nobody told you kennedy said wonderingly after a pause  dr kennedy you have said something terrible which i cannot allow to pass  you must either prove or or      prove it yourself  turn around and look at him  youve got him in profile  look at his nose  thats isaac fords  yours is a thin edition of it  thats right  look  the lines are fuller but they are all there  percival ford looked at the kanaka halfbreed who played under the hau tree and it seemed as by some illumination that he was gazing on a wraith of himself  feature after feature flashed up an unmistakable resemblance  or rather it was he who was the wraith of that other full muscled and generously moulded man  and his features and that other mans features were all reminiscent of isaac ford  and nobody had told him  every line of isaac fords face he knew  miniatures portraits and photographs of his father were passing in review through his mind and here and there over and again in the face before him he caught resemblances and vague hints of likeness  it was devils work that could reproduce the austere features of isaac ford in the loose and sensuous features before him  once the man turned and for one flashing instant it seemed to percival ford that he saw his father dead and gone peering at him out of the face of joe garland  its nothing at all he could faintly hear dr kennedy saying they were all mixed up in the old days  you know that  youve seen it all your life  sailors married queens and begat princesses and all the rest of it  it was the usual thing in the islands  but not with my father percival ford interrupted  there you are  kennedy shrugged his shoulders  cosmic sap and smoke of life  old isaac ford was straitlaced and all the rest and i know theres no explaining it least of all to himself  he understood it no more than you do  smoke of life thats all  and dont forget one thing ford  there was a dab of unruly blood in old isaac ford and joe garland inherited itall of it smoke of life and cosmic sap while you inherited all of old isaacs ascetic blood  and just because your blood is cold wellordered and welldisciplined is no reason that you should frown upon joe garland  when joe garland undoes the work you do remember that it is only old isaac ford on both sides undoing with one hand what he does with the other  you are isaac fords right hand let us say joe garland is his left hand  percival ford made no answer and in the silence dr kennedy finished his forgotten scotch and soda  from across the grounds an automobile hooted imperatively  theres the machine dr kennedy said rising  ive got to run  im sorry ive shaken you up and at the same time im glad  and know one thing isaac fords dab of unruly blood was remarkably small and joe garland got it all  and one other thing  if your fathers left hand offend you dont smite it off  besides joe is all right  frankly if i could choose between you and him to live with me on a desert isle id choose joe  little barelegged children ran about him playing on the grass but percival ford did not see them  he was gazing steadily at the singer under the hau tree  he even changed his position once to get closer the clerk of the seaside went by limping with age and dragging his reluctant feet  he had lived forty years on the islands  percival ford beckoned to him and the clerk came respectfully and wondering that he should be noticed by percival ford  john ford said i want you to give me some information  wont you sit down  the clerk sat down awkwardly stunned by the unexpected honour  he blinked at the other and mumbled yes sir thank you  john who is joe garland  the clerk stared at him blinked cleared his throat and said nothing  go on percival ford commanded  who is he  youre joking me sir the other managed to articulate  i spoke to you seriously  the clerk recoiled from him  you dont mean to say you dont know he questioned his question in itself the answer  i want to know  why hes john broke off and looked about him helplessly  hadnt you better ask somebody else  everybody thought you knew  we always thought      yes go ahead  we always thought that that was why you had it in for him  photographs and miniatures of isaac ford were trooping through his sons brain and ghosts of isaac ford seemed in the air about hint i wish you good night sir he could hear the clerk saying and he saw him beginning to limp away  john he called abruptly  john came back and stood near him blinking and nervously moistening his lips  you havent told me yet you know  oh about joe garland  yes about joe garland  who is he  hes your brother sir if i say it who shouldnt  thank you john  good night  and you didnt know the old man queried content to linger now that the crucial point was past  thank you john  good night was the response  yes sir thank you sir  i think its going to rain  good night sir  out of the clear sky filled only with stars and moonlight fell a rain so fine and attenuated as to resemble a vapour spray  nobody minded it the children played on running barelegged over the grass and leaping into the sand and in a few minutes it was gone  in the southeast diamond head a black blot sharply defined silhouetted its craterform against the stars  at sleepy intervals the surf flung its foam across the sands to the grass and far out could be seen the black specks of swimmers under the moon  the voices of the singers singing a waltz died away and in the silence from somewhere under the trees arose the laugh of a woman that was a lovecry  it startled percival ford and it reminded him of dr kennedys phrase  down by the outrigger canoes where they lay hauled out on the sand he saw men and women kanakas reclining languorously like lotuseaters the women in white holokus and against one such holoku he saw the dark head of the steersman of the canoe resting upon the womans shoulder  farther down where the strip of sand widened at the entrance to the lagoon he saw a man and woman walking side by side  as they drew near the light lanai he saw the womans hand go down to her waist and disengage a girdling arm  and as they passed him percival ford nodded to a captain he knew and to a majors daughter  smoke of life that was it an ample phrase  and again from under the dark algaroba tree arose the laugh of a woman that was a lovecry and past his chair on the way to bed a barelegged youngster was led by a chiding japanese nursemaid  the voices of the singers broke softly and meltingly into an hawaiian lovesong and officers and women with encircling arms were gliding and whirling on the lanai and once again the woman laughed under the algaroba trees  and percival ford knew only disapproval of it all  he was irritated by the lovelaugh of the woman by the steersman with pillowed head on the white holoku by the couples that walked on the beach by the officers and women that danced and by the voices of the singers singing of love and his brother singing there with them under the hau tree  the woman that laughed especially irritated him  a curious train of thought was aroused  he was isaac fords son and what had happened with isaac ford might happen with him  he felt in his cheeks the faint heat of a blush at the thought and experienced a poignant sense of shame  he was appalled by what was in his blood  it was like learning suddenly that his father had been a leper and that his own blood might bear the taint of that dread disease  isaac ford the austere soldier of the lordthe old hypocrite  what difference between him and any beachcomber  the house of pride that percival ford had builded was tumbling about his ears  the hours passed the army people laughed and danced the native orchestra played on and percival ford wrestled with the abrupt and overwhelming problem that had been thrust upon him  he prayed quietly his elbow on the table his head bowed upon his hand with all the appearance of any tired onlooker  between the dances the army men and women and the civilians fluttered up to him and buzzed conventionally and when they went back to the lanai he took up his wrestling where he had left it off  he began to patch together his shattered ideal of isaac ford and for cement he used a cunning and subtle logic  it was of the sort that is compounded in the brain laboratories of egotists and it worked  it was incontrovertible that his father had been made of finer clay than those about him but still old isaac had been only in the process of becoming while he percival ford had become  as proof of it he rehabilitated his father and at the same time exalted himself  his lean little ego waxed to colossal proportions  he was great enough to forgive  he glowed at the thought of it  isaac ford had been great but he was greater for he could forgive isaac ford and even restore him to the holy place in his memory though the place was not quite so holy as it had been  also he applauded isaac ford for having ignored the outcome of his one step aside  very well he too would ignore it  the dance was breaking up  the orchestra had finished aloha oe and was preparing to go home  percival ford clapped his hands for the japanese servant  you tell that man i want to see him he said pointing out joe garland tell him to come here now  joe garland approached and halted respectfully several paces away nervously fingering the guitar which he still carried  the other did not ask him to sit down  you are my brother he said  why everybody knows that was the reply in tones of wonderment  yes so i understand percival ford said dryly  but i did not know it till this evening  the halfbrother waited uncomfortably in the silence that followed during which percival ford coolly considered his next utterance  you remember that first time i came to school and the boys ducked me he asked  why did you take my part  the halfbrother smiled bashfully  because you knew  yes that was why  but i didnt know percival ford said in the same dry fashion  yes the other said  another silence fell  servants were beginning to put out the lights on the lanai  you know    now the halfbrother said simply  percival ford frowned  then he looked the other over with a considering eye  how much will you take to leave the islands and never come back he demanded  and never come back joe garland faltered  it is the only land i know  other lands are cold  i do not know other lands  i have many friends here  in other lands there would not be one voice to say aloha joe my boy  i said never to come back percival ford reiterated  the alameda sails tomorrow for san francisco  joe garland was bewildered  but why he asked  you know now that we are brothers  that is why was the retort  as you said yourself everybody knows  i will make it worth your while  all awkwardness and embarrassment disappeared from joe garland  birth and station were bridged and reversed  you want me to go he demanded  i want you to go and never come back percival ford answered  and in that moment flashing and fleeting it was given him to see his brother tower above him like a mountain and to feel himself dwindle and dwarf to microscopic insignificance  but it is not well for one to see himself truly nor can one so see himself for long and live and only for that flashing moment did percival ford see himself and his brother in true perspective  the next moment he was mastered by his meagre and insatiable ego  as i said i will make it worth your while  you will not suffer  i will pay you well  all right joe garland said  ill go  he started to turn away  joe the other called  you see my lawyer tomorrow morning  five hundred down and two hundred a month as long as you stay away  you are very kind joe garland answered softly  you are too kind  and anyway i guess i dont want your money  i go tomorrow on the alameda  he walked away but did not say goodbye  percival ford clapped his hands  boy he said to the japanese a lemonade  and over the lemonade he smiled long and contentedly to himself     koolau the leper   because we are sick they take away our liberty  we have obeyed the law we have done no wrong  and yet they would put us in prison  molokai is a prison  that you know  niuli there his sister was sent to molokai seven years ago  he has not seen her since  nor will he ever see her she must stay there until she dies  this is not her will  it is not niulis will  it is the will of the white men who rule the land  and who are these white men  we know  we have it from our fathers and our fathers fathers  they came like lambs speaking softly  well might they speak softly for we were many and strong and all the islands were ours  as i say they spoke softly  they were of two kinds  the one kind asked our permission our gracious permission to preach to us the word of god  the other kind asked our permission our gracious permission to trade with us  that was the beginning  today all the islands are theirs all the land all the cattleeverything is theirs  they that preached the word of god and they that preached the word of rum have foregathered and become great chiefs  they live like kings in houses of many rooms with multitudes of servants to care for them  they who had nothing have everything and if you or i or any kanaka be hungry they sneer and say well why dont you work  there are the plantations  koolau paused  he raised one hand and with gnarled and twisted fingers lifted up the blazing wreath of hibiscus that crowned his black hair  the moonlight bathed the scene in silver  it was a night of peace though those who sat about him and listened had all the seeming of battlewrecks  their faces were leonine  here a space yawned in a face where should have been a nose and there an armstump showed where a hand had rotted off  they were men and women beyond the pale the thirty of them for upon them had been placed the mark of the beast  they sat flowergarlanded in the perfumed luminous night and their lips made uncouth noises and their throats rasped approval of koolaus speech  they were creatures who once had been men and women  but they were men and women no longer  they were monstersin face and form grotesque caricatures of everything human  they were hideously maimed and distorted and had the seeming of creatures that had been racked in millenniums of hell  their hands when they possessed them were like harpy claws  their faces were the misfits and slips crushed and bruised by some mad god at play in the machinery of life  here and there were features which the mad god had smeared half away and one woman wept scalding tears from twin pits of horror where her eyes once had been some were in pain and groaned from their chests  others coughed making sounds like the tearing of tissue  two were idiots more like huge apes marred in the making until even an ape were an angel  they mowed and gibbered in the moonlight under crowns of drooping golden blossoms one whose bloated earlobe flapped like a fan upon his shoulder caught up a gorgeous flower of orange and scarlet and with it decorated the monstrous ear that flipflapped with his every movement  and over these things koolau was king  and this was his kingdoma flowerthrottled gorge with beetling cliffs and crags from which floated the blattings of wild goats  on three sides the grim walls rose festooned in fantastic draperies of tropic vegetation and pierced by cave entrancesthe rocky lairs of koolaus subjects  on the fourth side the earth fell away into a tremendous abyss and far below could be seen the summits of lesser peaks and crags at whose bases foamed and rumbled the pacific surge  in fine weather a boat could land on the rocky beach that marked the entrance of kalalau valley but the weather must be very fine  and a coolheaded mountaineer might climb from the beach to the head of kalalau valley to this pocket among the peaks where koolau ruled but such a mountaineer must be very cool of head and he must know the wildgoat trails as well  the marvel was that the mass of human wreckage that constituted koolaus people should have been able to drag its helpless misery over the giddy goattrails to this inaccessible spot  brothers koolau began  but one of the mowing apelike travesties emitted a wild shriek of madness and koolau waited while the shrill cachination was tossed back and forth among the rocky walls and echoed distantly through the pulseless night  brothers is it not strange  ours was the land and behold the land is not ours  what did these preachers of the word of god and the word of rum give us for the land  have you received one dollar as much as one dollar any one of you for the land  yet it is theirs and in return they tell us we can go to work on the land their land and that what we produce by our toil shall be theirs  yet in the old days we did not have to work  also when we are sick they take away our freedom  who brought the sickness koolau demanded kiloliana a lean and wiry man with a face so like a laughing fauns that one might expect to see the cloven hoofs under him  they were cloven it was true but the cleavages were great ulcers and livid putrefactions  yet this was kiloliana the most daring climber of them all the man who knew every goattrail and who had led koolau and his wretched followers into the recesses of kalalau  ay well questioned koolau answered  because we would not work the miles of sugarcane where once our horses pastured they brought the chinese slaves from overseas  and with them came the chinese sicknessthat which we suffer from and because of which they would imprison us on molokai  we were born on kauai  we have been to the other islands some here and some there to oahu to maui to hawaii to honolulu  yet always did we come back to kauai  why did we come back there must be a reason  because we love kauai  we were born here  here we have lived  and here shall we dieunlessunlessthere be weak hearts amongst us  such we do not want  they are fit for molokai  and if there be such let them not remain  tomorrow the soldiers land on the shore  let the weak hearts go down to them  they will be sent swiftly to molokai  as for us we shall stay and fight  but know that we will not die  we have rifles  you know the narrow trails where men must creep one by one  i alone koolau who was once a cowboy on niihau can hold the trail against a thousand men  here is kapalei who was once a judge over men and a man with honour but who is now a hunted rat like you and me  hear him  he is wise  kapalei arose  once he had been a judge  he had gone to college at punahou  he had sat at meat with lords and chiefs and the high representatives of alien powers who protected the interests of traders and missionaries  such had been kapalei  but now as koolau had said he was a hunted rat a creature outside the law sunk so deep in the mire of human horror that he was above the law as well as beneath it  his face was featureless save for gaping orifices and for the lidless eyes that burned under hairless brows  let us not make trouble he began  we ask to be left alone  but if they do not leave us alone then is the trouble theirs and the penalty my fingers are gone as you see  he held up his stumps of hands that all might see  yet have i the joint of one thumb left and it can pull a trigger as firmly as did its lost neighbour in the old days  we love kauai  let us live here or die here but do not let us go to the prison of molokai  the sickness is not ours  we have not sinned  the men who preached the word of god and the word of rum brought the sickness with the coolie slaves who work the stolen land  i have been a judge  i know the law and the justice and i say to you it is unjust to steal a mans land to make that man sick with the chinese sickness and then to put that man in prison for life  life is short and the days are filled with pain said koolau  let us drink and dance and be happy as we can  from one of the rocky lairs calabashes were produced and passed round the calabashes were filled with the fierce distillation of the root of the tiplant and as the liquid fire coursed through them and mounted to their brains they forgot that they had once been men and women for they were men and women once more  the woman who wept scalding tears from open eyepits was indeed a woman apulse with life as she plucked the strings of an ukulele and lifted her voice in a barbaric lovecall such as might have come from the dark forestdepths of the primeval world  the air tingled with her cry softly imperious and seductive  upon a mat timing his rhythm to the womans song kiloliana danced  it was unmistakable  love danced in all his movements and next dancing with him on the mat was a woman whose heavy hips and generous breast gave the lie to her diseasecorroded face  it was a dance of the living dead for in their disintegrating bodies life still loved and longed  ever the woman whose sightless eyes ran scalding tears chanted her lovecry ever the dancers of love danced in the warm night and ever the calabashes went around till in all their brains were maggots crawling of memory and desire  and with the woman on the mat danced a slender maid whose face was beautiful and unmarred but whose twisted arms that rose and fell marked the diseases ravage  and the two idiots gibbering and mouthing strange noises danced apart grotesque fantastic travestying love as they themselves had been travestied by life  but the womans lovecry broke midway the calabashes were lowered and the dancers ceased as all gazed into the abyss above the sea where a rocket flared like a wan phantom through the moonlit air  it is the soldiers said koolau  tomorrow there will be fighting  it is well to sleep and be prepared  the lepers obeyed crawling away to their lairs in the cliff until only koolau remained sitting motionless in the moonlight his rifle across his knees as he gazed far down to the boats landing on the beach  the far head of kalalau valley had been well chosen as a refuge  except kiloliana who knew backtrails up the precipitous walls no man could win to the gorge save by advancing across a knifeedged ridge  this passage was a hundred yards in length  at best it was a scant twelve inches wide  on either side yawned the abyss  a slip and to right or left the man would fall to his death  but once across he would find himself in an earthly paradise  a sea of vegetation laved the landscape pouring its green billows from wall to wall dripping from the clifflips in great vinemasses and flinging a spray of ferns and airplants in to the multitudinous crevices  during the many months of koolaus rule he and his followers had fought with this vegetable sea  the choking jungle with its riot of blossoms had been driven back from the bananas oranges and mangoes that grew wild  in little clearings grew the wild arrowroot on stone terraces filled with soil scrapings were the taro patches and the melons and in every open space where the sunshine penetrated were papaia trees burdened with their golden fruit  koolau had been driven to this refuge from the lower valley by the beach and if he were driven from it in turn he knew of gorges among the jumbled peaks of the inner fastnesses where he could lead his subjects and live  and now he lay with his rifle beside him peering down through a tangled screen of foliage at the soldiers on the beach  he noted that they had large guns with them from which the sunshine flashed as from mirrors  the knifeedged passage lay directly before him  crawling upward along the trail that led to it he could see tiny specks of men  he knew they were not the soldiers but the police  when they failed then the soldiers would enter the game  he affectionately rubbed a twisted hand along his rifle barrel and made sure that the sights were clean  he had learned to shoot as a wildcattle hunter on niihau and on that island his skill as a marksman was unforgotten  as the toiling specks of men grew nearer and larger he estimated the range judged the deflection of the wind that swept at right angles across the line of fire and calculated the chances of overshooting marks that were so far below his level  but he did not shoot  not until they reached the beginning of the passage did he make his presence known  he did not disclose himself but spoke from the thicket  what do you want he demanded  we want koolau the leper answered the man who led the native police himself a blueeyed american  you must go back koolau said  he knew the man a deputy sheriff for it was by him that he had been harried out of niihau across kauai to kalalau valley and out of the valley to the gorge  who are you the sheriff asked  i am koolau the leper was the reply  then come out  we want you  dead or alive there is a thousand dollars on your head  you cannot escape  koolau laughed aloud in the thicket  come out the sheriff commanded and was answered by silence  he conferred with the police and koolau saw that they were preparing to rush him  koolau the sheriff called  koolau i am coming across to get you  then look first and well about you at the sun and sea and sky for it will be the last time you behold them  thats all right koolau the sheriff said soothingly  i know youre a dead shot  but you wont shoot me  i have never done you any wrong  koolau grunted in the thicket  i say you know ive never done you any wrong have i the sheriff persisted  you do me wrong when you try to put me in prison was the reply  and you do me wrong when you try for the thousand dollars on my head  if you will live stay where you are  ive got to come across and get you  im sorry  but it is my duty  you will die before you get across  the sheriff was no coward  yet was he undecided  he gazed into the gulf on either side and ran his eyes along the knifeedge he must travel  then he made up his mind  koolau he called  but the thicket remained silent  koolau dont shoot  i am coming  the sheriff turned gave some orders to the police then started on his perilous way  he advanced slowly  it was like walking a tight rope  he had nothing to lean upon but the air  the lava rock crumbled under his feet and on either side the dislodged fragments pitched downward through the depths  the sun blazed upon him and his face was wet with sweat still he advanced until the halfway point was reached  stop koolau commanded from the thicket  one more step and i shoot  the sheriff halted swaying for balance as he stood poised above the void  his face was pale but his eyes were determined  he licked his dry lips before he spoke  koolau you wont shoot me  i know you wont  he started once more  the bullet whirled him half about  on his face was an expression of querulous surprise as he reeled to the fall  he tried to save himself by throwing his body across the knifeedge but at that moment he knew death  the next moment the knifeedge was vacant then came the rush five policemen in single file with superb steadiness running along the knifeedge  at the same instant the rest of the posse opened fire on the thicket  it was madness  five times koolau pulled the trigger so rapidly that his shots constituted a rattle  changing his position and crouching low under the bullets that were biting and singing through the bushes he peered out  four of the police had followed the sheriff  the fifth lay across the knifeedge still alive  on the farther side no longer firing were the surviving police  on the naked rock there was no hope for them  before they could clamber down koolau could have picked off the last man  but he did not fire and after a conference one of them took off a white undershirt and waved it as a flag  followed by another he advanced along the knife edge to their wounded comrade  koolau gave no sign but watched them slowly withdraw and become specks as they descended into the lower valley  two hours later from another thicket koolau watched a body of police trying to make the ascent from the opposite side of the valley  he saw the wild goats flee before them as they climbed higher and higher until he doubted his judgment and sent for kiloliana who crawled in beside him  no there is no way said kiloliana  the goats koolau questioned  they come over from the next valley but they cannot pass to this  there is no way  those men are not wiser than goats  they may fall to their deaths  let us watch  they are brave men said koolau  let us watch  side by side they lay among the morningglories with the yellow blossoms of the hau dropping upon them from overhead watching the motes of men toil upward till the thing happened and three of them slipping rolling sliding dashed over a clifflip and fell sheer half a thousand feet  kiloliana chuckled  we will be bothered no more he said  they have war guns koolau made answer  the soldiers have not yet spoken  in the drowsy afternoon most of the lepers lay in their rock dens asleep  koolau his rifle on his knees freshcleaned and ready dozed in the entrance to his own den  the maid with the twisted arms lay below in the thicket and kept watch on the knifeedge passage  suddenly koolau was startled wide awake by the sound of an explosion on the beach  the next instant the atmosphere was incredibly rent asunder  the terrible sound frightened him  it was as if all the gods had caught the envelope of the sky in their hands and were ripping it apart as a woman rips apart a sheet of cotton cloth  but it was such an immense ripping growing swiftly nearer  koolau glanced up apprehensively as if expecting to see the thing  then high up on the cliff overhead the shell burst in a fountain of black smoke  the rock was shattered the fragments falling to the foot of the cliff  koolau passed his hand across his sweaty brow  he was terribly shaken he had had no experience with shellfire and this was more dreadful than anything he had imagined  one said kapahei suddenly bethinking himself to keep count  a second and a third shell flew screaming over the top of the wall bursting beyond view  kapahei methodically kept the count  the lepers crowded into the open space before the caves  at first they were frightened but as the shells continued their flight overhead the leper folk became reassured and began to admire the spectacle  the two idiots shrieked with delight prancing wild antics as each air tormenting shell went by  koolau began to recover his confidence  no damage was being done  evidently they could not aim such large missiles at such long range with the precision of a rifle  but a change came over the situation  the shells began to fall short one burst below in the thicket by the knifeedge  koolau remembered the maid who lay there on watch and ran down to see  the smoke was still rising from the bushes when he crawled in  he was astounded  the branches were splintered and broken  where the girl had lain was a hole in the ground  the girl herself was in shattered fragments  the shell had burst right on her  first peering out to make sure no soldiers were attempting the passage koolau started back on the run for the caves  all the time the shells were moaning whining screaming by and the valley was rumbling and reverberating with the explosions  as he came in sight of the caves he saw the two idiots cavorting about clutching each others hands with their stumps of fingers  even as he ran koolau saw a spout of black smoke rise from the ground near to the idiots  they were flung apart bodily by the explosion  one lay motionless but the other was dragging himself by his hands toward the cave  his legs trailed out helplessly behind him while the blood was pouring from his body  he seemed bathed in blood and as he crawled he cried like a little dog  the rest of the lepers with the exception of kapahei had fled into the caves  seventeen said kapahei  eighteen he added  this last shell had fairly entered into one of the caves  the explosion caused the caves to empty  but from the particular cave no one emerged koolau crept in through the pungent acrid smoke  four bodies frightfully mangled lay about  one of them was the sightless woman whose tears till now had never ceased  outside koolau found his people in a panic and already beginning to climb the goattrail that led out of the gorge and on among the jumbled heights and chasms  the wounded idiot whining feebly and dragging himself along on the ground by his hands was trying to follow  but at the first pitch of the wall his helplessness overcame him and he fell back  it would be better to kill him said koolau to kapahei who still sat in the same place  twentytwo kapahei answered  yes it would be a wise thing to kill him  twentythreetwentyfour  the idiot whined sharply when he saw the rifle levelled at him  koolau hesitated then lowered the gun  it is a hard thing to do he said  you are a fool twentysix twentyseven said kapahei  let me show you  he arose and with a heavy fragment of rock in his hand approached the wounded thing  as he lifted his arm to strike a shell burst full upon him relieving him of the necessity of the act and at the same time putting an end to his count  koolau was alone in the gorge  he watched the last of his people drag their crippled bodies over the brow of the height and disappear  then he turned and went down to the thicket where the maid had keen killed  the shellfire still continued but he remained for far below he could see the soldiers climbing up  a shell burst twenty feet away  flattening himself into the earth he heard the rush of the fragments above his body  a shower of hau blossoms rained upon him  he lifted his head to peer down the trail and sighed  he was very much afraid  bullets from rifles would not have worried him but this shellfire was abominable each time a shell shrieked by he shivered and crouched but each time he lifted his head again to watch the trail  at last the shells ceased  this he reasoned was because the soldiers were drawing near  they crept along the trail in single file and he tried to count them until he lost track  at any rate there were a hundred or so of themall come after koolau the leper  he felt a fleeting prod of pride  with war guns and rifles police and soldiers they came for him and he was only one man a crippled wreck of a man at that  they offered a thousand dollars for him dead or alive  in all his life he had never possessed that much money  the thought was a bitter one  kapahei had been right  he koolau had done no wrong because the haoles wanted labour with which to work the stolen land they had brought in the chinese coolies and with them had come the sickness  and now because he had caught the sickness he was worth a thousand dollarsbut not to himself  it was his worthless carcass rotten with disease or dead from a bursting shell that was worth all that money  when the soldiers reached the knifeedged passage he was prompted to warn them  but his gaze fell upon the body of the murdered maid and he kept silent  when six had ventured on the knifeedge he opened fire nor did he cease when the knifeedge was bare  he emptied his magazine reloaded and emptied it again  he kept on shooting  all his wrongs were blazing in his brain and he was in a fury of vengeance  all down the goattrail the soldiers were firing and though they lay flat and sought to shelter themselves in the shallow inequalities of the surface they were exposed marks to him  bullets whistled and thudded about him and an occasional ricochet sang sharply through the air  one bullet ploughed a crease through his scalp and a second burned across his shoulderblade without breaking the skin  it was a massacre in which one man did the killing  the soldiers began to retreat helping along their wounded  as koolau picked them off he became aware of the smell of burnt meat  he glanced about him at first and then discovered that it was his own hands  the heat of the rifle was doing it  the leprosy had destroyed most of the nerves in his hands though his flesh burned and he smelled it there was no sensation  he lay in the thicket smiling until he remembered the war guns  without doubt they would open upon him again and this time upon the very thicket from which he had inflicted the danger  scarcely had he changed his position to a nook behind a small shoulder of the wall where he had noted that no shells fell than the bombardment recommenced  he counted the shells  sixty more were thrown into the gorge before the warguns ceased  the tiny area was pitted with their explosions until it seemed impossible that any creature could have survived  so the soldiers thought for under the burning afternoon sun they climbed the goattrail again  and again the knifeedged passage was disputed and again they fell back to the beach  for two days longer koolau held the passage though the soldiers contented themselves with flinging shells into his retreat  then pahau a leper boy came to the top of the wall at the back of the gorge and shouted down to him that kiloliana hunting goats that they might eat had been killed by a fall and that the women were frightened and knew not what to do  koolau called the boy down and left him with a spare gun with which to guard the passage  koolau found his people disheartened the majority of them were too helpless to forage food for themselves under such forbidding circumstances and all were starving  he selected two women and a man who were not too far gone with the disease and sent them back to the gorge to bring up food and mats  the rest he cheered and consoled until even the weakest took a hand in building rough shelters for themselves  but those he had dispatched for food did not return and he started back for the gorge  as he came out on the brow of the wall half a dozen rifles cracked  a bullet tore through the fleshy part of his shoulder and his cheek was cut by a sliver of rock where a second bullet smashed against the cliff  in the moment that this happened and he leaped back he saw that the gorge was alive with soldiers  his own people had betrayed him  the shellfire had been too terrible and they had preferred the prison of molokai  koolau dropped back and unslung one of his heavy cartridgebelts  lying among the rocks he allowed the head and shoulders of the first soldier to rise clearly into view before pulling trigger  twice this happened and then after some delay in place of a head and shoulders a white flag was thrust above the edge of the wall  what do you want he demanded  i want you if you are koolau the leper came the answer  koolau forgot where he was forgot everything as he lay and marvelled at the strange persistence of these haoles who would have their will though the sky fell in  aye they would have their will over all men and all things even though they died in getting it  he could not but admire them too what of that will in them that was stronger than life and that bent all things to their bidding  he was convinced of the hopelessness of his struggle  there was no gainsaying that terrible will of the haoles  though he killed a thousand yet would they rise like the sands of the sea and come upon him ever more and more  they never knew when they were beaten  that was their fault and their virtue  it was where his own kind lacked  he could see now how the handful of the preachers of god and the preachers of rum had conquered the land  it was because  well what have you got to say  will you come with me  it was he voice of the invisible man under the white flag  there he was like any haole driving straight toward the end determined  let us talk said koolau  the mans head and shoulders arose then his whole body  he was a smooth faced blueeyed youngster of twentyfive slender and natty in his captains uniform  he advanced until halted then seated himself a dozen feet away  you are a brave man said koolau wonderingly  i could kill you like a fly  no you couldnt was the answer  why not  because you are a man koolau though a bad one  i know your story  you kill fairly  koolau grunted but was secretly pleased  what have you done with my people he demanded  the boy the two women and the man  they gave themselves up as i have now come for you to do  koolau laughed incredulously  i am a free man he announced  i have done no wrong  all i ask is to be left alone  i have lived free and i shall die free  i will never give myself up  then your people are wiser than you answered the young captain lookthey are coming now  koolau turned and watched the remnant of his band approach  groaning and sighing a ghastly procession it dragged its wretchedness past  it was given to koolau to taste a deeper bitterness for they hurled imprecations and insults at him as they went by and the panting hag who brought up the rear halted and with skinny harpyclaws extended shaking her snarling deaths head from side to side she laid a curse upon him  one by one they dropped over the lipedge and surrendered to the hiding soldiers  you can go now said koolau to the captain  i will never give myself up  that is my last word  goodbye  the captain slipped over the cliff to his soldiers  the next moment and without a flag of truce he hoisted his hat on his scabbard and koolaus bullet tore through it  that afternoon they shelled him out from the beach and as he retreated into the high inaccessible pockets beyond the soldiers followed him  for six weeks they hunted him from pocket to pocket over the volcanic peaks and along the goattrails  when he hid in the lantana jungle they formed lines of beaters and through lantana jungle and guava scrub they drove him like a rabbit  but ever he turned and doubled and eluded there was no cornering him  when pressed too closely his sure rifle held them back and they carried their wounded down the goattrails to the beach  there were times when they did the shooting as his brown body showed for a moment through the underbrush  once five of them caught him on an exposed goattrail between pockets  they emptied their rifles at him as he limped and climbed along his dizzy way  afterwards they found bloodstains and knew that he was wounded  at the end of six weeks they gave up  the soldiers and police returned to honolulu and kalalau valley was left to him for his own though headhunters ventured after him from time to time and to their own undoing  two years later and for the last time koolau crawled into a thicket and lay down among the tileaves and wild ginger blossoms  free he had lived and free he was dying  a slight drizzle of rain began to fall and he drew a ragged blanket about the distorted wreck of his limbs  his body was covered with an oilskin coat  across his chest he laid his mauser rifle lingering affectionately for a moment to wipe the dampness from the barrel  the hand with which he wiped had no fingers left upon it with which to pull the trigger  he closed his eyes for from the weakness in his body and the fuzzy turmoil in his brain he knew that his end was near  like a wild animal he had crept into hiding to die  halfconscious aimless and wandering he lived back in his life to his early manhood on niihau  as life faded and the drip of the rain grew dim in his ears it seemed to him that he was once more in the thick of the horsebreaking with raw colts rearing and bucking under him his stirrups tied together beneath or charging madly about the breaking corral and driving the helping cowboys over the rails  the next instant and with seeming naturalness he found himself pursuing the wild bulls of the upland pastures roping them and leading them down to the valleys  again the sweat and dust of the branding pen stung his eyes and bit his nostrils  all his lusty wholebodied youth was his until the sharp pangs of impending dissolution brought him back  he lifted his monstrous hands and gazed at them in wonder  but how  why  why should the wholeness of that wild youth of his change to this  then he remembered and once again and for a moment he was koolau the leper  his eyelids fluttered wearily down and the drip of the rain ceased in his ears  a prolonged trembling set up in his body  this too ceased  he halflifted his head but it fell back  then his eyes opened and did not close  his last thought was of his mauser and he pressed it against his chest with his folded fingerless hands     goodbye jack   hawaii is a queer place  everything socially is what i may call topsy turvy  not but what things are correct  they are almost too much so but still things are sort of upside down  the most ultraexclusive set there is the missionary crowd  it comes with rather a shock to learn that in hawaii the obscure martyrdomseeking missionary sits at the head of the table of the moneyed aristocracy  but it is true  the humble new englanders who came out in the third decade of the nineteenth century came for the lofty purpose of teaching the kanakas the true religion the worship of the one only genuine and undeniable god  so well did they succeed in this and also in civilizing the kanaka that by the second or third generation he was practically extinct  this being the fruit of the seed of the gospel the fruit of the seed of the missionaries the sons and the grandsons was the possession of the islands themselvesof the land the ports the town sites and the sugar plantations  the missionary who came to give the bread of life remained to gobble up the whole heathen feast  but that is not the hawaiian queerness i started out to tell  only one cannot speak of things hawaiian without mentioning the missionaries there is jack kersdale the man i wanted to tell about he came of missionary stock  that is on his grandmothers side  his grandfather was old benjamin kersdale a yankee trader who got his start for a million in the old days by selling cheap whiskey and squareface gin theres another queer thing  the old missionaries and old traders were mortal enemies  you see their interests conflicted  but their children made it up by intermarrying and dividing the island between them  life in hawaii is a song  thats the way stoddard put it in his hawaii noi     thy life is musicfate the notes prolong    each isle a stanza and the whole a song  and he was right  flesh is golden there  the native women are sunripe junos the native men bronzed apollos  they sing and dance and all are flowerbejewelled and flowercrowned  and outside the rigid missionary crowd the white men yield to the climate and the sun and no matter how busy they may be are prone to dance and sing and wear flowers behind their ears and in their hair  jack kersdale was one of these fellows  he was one of the busiest men i ever met  he was a severaltimes millionaire  he was a sugarking a coffee planter a rubber pioneer a cattle rancher and a promoter of three out of every four new enterprises launched in the islands  he was a society man a club man a yachtsman a bachelor and withal as handsome a man as was ever doted upon by mammas with marriageable daughters  incidentally he had finished his education at yale and his head was crammed fuller with vital statistics and scholarly information concerning hawaii nei than any other islander i ever encountered  he turned off an immense amount of work and he sang and danced and put flowers in his hair as immensely as any of the idlers he had grit and had fought two duelsboth politicalwhen he was no more than a raw youth essaying his first adventures in politics  in fact he played a most creditable and courageous part in the last revolution when the native dynasty was overthrown and he could not have been over sixteen at the time  i am pointing out that he was no coward in order that you may appreciate what happens later on  ive seen him in the breaking yard at the haleakala ranch conquering a fouryearold brute that for two years had defied the pick of von tempskys cowboys and i must tell of one other thing  it was down in konaor up rather for the kona people scorn to live at less than a thousand feet elevation we were all on the lanai of doctor goodhues bungalow  i was talking with dottie fairchild when it happened  a big centipedeit was seven inches for we measured it afterwardsfell from the rafters overhead squarely into her coiffure  i confess the hideousness of it paralysed me  i couldnt move  my mind refused to work  there within two feet of me the ugly venomous devil was writhing in her hair  it threatened at any moment to fall down upon her exposed shoulderswe had just come out from dinner  what is it she asked starting to raise her hand to her head  dont i cried  dont  but what is it she insisted growing frightened by the fright she read in my eyes and on my stammering lips  my exclamation attracted kersdales attention  he glanced our way carelessly but in that glance took in everything  he came over to us but without haste  please dont move dottie he said quietly  he never hesitated nor did he hurry and make a bungle of it  allow me he said  and with one hand he caught her scarf and drew it tightly around her shoulders so that the centipede could not fall inside her bodice  with the other handthe righthe reached into her hair caught the repulsive abomination as near as he was able by the nape of the neck and held it tightly between thumb and forefinger as he withdrew it from her hair  it was as horrible and heroic a sight as man could wish to see  it made my flesh crawl  the centipede seven inches of squirming legs writhed and twisted and dashed itself about his hand the body twining around the fingers and the legs digging into the skin and scratching as the beast endeavoured to free itself  it bit him twicei saw itthough he assured the ladies that he was not harmed as he dropped it upon the walk and stamped it into the gravel  but i saw him in the surgery five minutes afterwards with doctor goodhue scarifying the wounds and injecting permanganate of potash  the next morning kersdales arm was as big as a barrel and it was three weeks before the swelling went down  all of which has nothing to do with my story but which i could not avoid giving in order to show that jack kersdale was anything but a coward  it was the cleanest exhibition of grit i have ever seen  he never turned a hair  the smile never left his lips  and he dived with thumb and forefinger into dottie fairchilds hair as gaily as if it had been a box of salted almonds  yet that was the man i was destined to see stricken with a fear a thousand times more hideous even than the fear that was mine when i saw that writhing abomination in dottie fairchilds hair dangling over her eyes and the trap of her bodice  i was interested in leprosy and upon that as upon every other island subject kersdale had encyclopedic knowledge  in fact leprosy was one of his hobbies  he was an ardent defender of the settlement at molokai where all the island lepers were segregated  there was much talk and feeling among the natives fanned by the demagogues concerning the cruelties of molokai where men and women not alone banished from friends and family were compelled to live in perpetual imprisonment until they died  there were no reprieves no commutations of sentences abandon hope was written over the portal of molokai  i tell you they are happy there kersdale insisted  and they are infinitely better off than their friends and relatives outside who have nothing the matter with them  the horrors of molokai are all poppycock i can take you through any hospital or any slum in any of the great cities of the world and show you a thousand times worse horrors  the living death  the creatures that once were men  bosh  you ought to see those living deaths racing horses on the fourth of july  some of them own boats  one has a gasoline launch  they have nothing to do but have a good time  food shelter clothes medical attendance everything is theirs  they are the wards of the territory  they have a much finer climate than honolulu and the scenery is magnificent  i shouldnt mind going down there myself for the rest of my days  it is a lovely spot  so kersdale on the joyous leper  he was not afraid of leprosy  he said so himself and that there wasnt one chance in a million for him or any other white man to catch it though he confessed afterward that one of his school chums alfred starter had contracted it gone to molokai and there died  you know in the old days kersdale explained there was no certain test for leprosy  anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to molokai  the result was that dozens were sent there who were no more lepers than you or i  but they dont make that mistake now  the board of health tests are infallible  the funny thing is that when the test was discovered they immediately went down to molokai and applied it and they found a number who were not lepers  these were immediately deported  happy to get away  they wailed harder at leaving the settlement than when they left honolulu to go to it  some refused to leave and really had to be forced out  one of them even married a leper woman in the last stages and then wrote pathetic letters to the board of health protesting against his expulsion on the ground that no one was so well able as he to take care of his poor old wife  what is this infallible test i demanded  the bacteriological test  there is no getting away from it  doctor herveyhes our expert you knowwas the first man to apply it here  he is a wizard  he knows more about leprosy than any living man and if a cure is ever discovered hell be that discoverer  as for the test it is very simple  they have succeeded in isolating the bacillus leprae and studying it  they know it now when they see it  all they do is to snip a bit of skin from the suspect and subject it to the bacteriological test  a man without any visible symptoms may be chock full of the leprosy bacilli  then you or i for all we know i suggested may be full of it now  kersdale shrugged his shoulders and laughed  who can say  it takes seven years for it to incubate  if you have any doubts go and see doctor hervey  hell just snip out a piece of your skin and let you know in a jiffy  later on he introduced me to dr hervey who loaded me down with board of health reports and pamphlets on the subject and took me out to kalihi the honolulu receiving station where suspects were examined and confirmed lepers were held for deportation to molokai  these deportations occurred about once a month when the last goodbyes said the lepers were marched on board the little steamer the noeau and carried down to the settlement  one afternoon writing letters at the club jack kersdale dropped in on me  just the man i want to see was his greeting  ill show you the saddest aspect of the whole situationthe lepers wailing as they depart for molokai  the noeau will be taking them on board in a few minutes but let me warn you not to let your feelings be harrowed  real as their grief is theyd wail a whole sight harder a year hence if the board of health tried to take them away from molokai  weve just time for a whiskey and soda  ive a carriage outside  it wont take us five minutes to get down to the wharf  to the wharf we drove  some forty sad wretches amid their mats blankets and luggage of various sorts were squatting on the stringer piece  the noeau had just arrived and was making fast to a lighter that lay between her and the wharf  a mr mcveigh the superintendent of the settlement was overseeing the embarkation and to him i was introduced also to dr georges one of the board of health physicians whom i had already met at kalihi  the lepers were a woebegone lot  the faces of the majority were hideoustoo horrible for me to describe  but here and there i noticed fairly goodlooking persons with no apparent signs of the fell disease upon them  one i noticed a little white girl not more than twelve with blue eyes and golden hair  one cheek however showed the leprous bloat  on my remarking on the sadness of her alien situation among the brownskinned afflicted ones doctor georges replied  oh i dont know  its a happy day in her life  she comes from kauai her father is a brute  and now that she has developed the disease she is going to join her mother at the settlement  her mother was sent down three years agoa very bad case  you cant always tell from appearances mr mcveigh explained  that man there that big chap who looks the pink of condition with nothing the matter with him i happen to know has a perforating ulcer in his foot and another in his shoulderblade  then there are othersthere see that girls hand the one who is smoking the cigarette  see her twisted fingers  thats the anaesthetic form  it attacks the nerves  you could cut her fingers off with a dull knife or rub them off on a nutmeggrater and she would not experience the slightest sensation  yes but that finelooking woman there i persisted surely surely there cant be anything the matter with her  she is too glorious and gorgeous altogether  a sad case mr mcveigh answered over his shoulder already turning away to walk down the wharf with kersdale  she was a beautiful woman and she was pure polynesian  from my meagre knowledge of the race and its types i could not but conclude that she had descended from old chief stock  she could not have been more than twenty three or four  her lines and proportions were magnificent and she was just beginning to show the amplitude of the women of her race  it was a blow to all of us dr georges volunteered  she gave herself up voluntarily too  no one suspected  but somehow she had contracted the disease  it broke us all up i assure you  weve kept it out of the papers though  nobody but us and her family knows what has become of her  in fact if you were to ask any man in honolulu hed tell you it was his impression that she was somewhere in europe  it was at her request that weve been so quiet about it  poor girl she has a lot of pride  but who is she i asked  certainly from the way you talk about her she must be somebody  did you ever hear of lucy mokunui he asked  lucy mokunui i repeated haunted by some familiar association  i shook my head  it seems to me ive heard the name but ive forgotten it  never heard of lucy mokunui  the hawaiian nightingale  i beg your pardon  of course you are a malahini 1 and could not be expected to know  well lucy mokunui was the best beloved of honoluluof all hawaii for that matter  you say was i interrupted  and i mean it  she is finished  he shrugged his shoulders pityingly a dozen haolesi beg your pardon white menhave lost their hearts to her at one time or another  and im not counting in the ruck  the dozen i refer to were haoles of position and prominence  she could have married the son of the chief justice if shed wanted to you think shes beautiful eh  but you should hear her sing  finest native woman singer in hawaii nei  her throat is pure silver and melted sunshine  we adored her  she toured america first with the royal hawaiian band  after that she made two more trips on her ownconcert work  oh i cried  i remember now  i heard her two years ago at the boston symphony  so that is she  i recognize her now  i was oppressed by a heavy sadness  life was a futile thing at best  a short two years and this magnificent creature at the summit of her magnificent success was one of the leper squad awaiting deportation to molokai  henleys lines came into my mind     the poor old tramp explains his poor old ulcers    life is i think a blunder and a shame  i recoiled from my own future  if this awful fate fell to lucy mokunui what might my lot not beor anybodys lot  i was thoroughly aware that in life we are in the midst of deathbut to be in the midst of living death to die and not be dead to be one of that draft of creatures that once were men aye and women like lucy mokunui the epitome of all polynesian charms an artist as well and well beloved of men  i am afraid i must have betrayed my perturbation for doctor georges hastened to assure me that they were very happy down in the settlement  it was all too inconceivably monstrous  i could not bear to look at her a short distance away behind a stretched rope guarded by a policeman were the lepers relatives and friends  they were not allowed to come near  there were no last embraces no kisses of farewell  they called back and forth to one anotherlast messages last words of love last reiterated instructions  and those behind the rope looked with terrible intensity  it was the last time they would behold the faces of their loved ones for they were the living dead being carted away in the funeral ship to the graveyard of molokai  doctor georges gave the command and the unhappy wretches dragged themselves to their feet and under their burdens of luggage began to stagger across the lighter and aboard the steamer  it was the funeral procession  at once the wailing started from those behind the rope  it was bloodcurdling it was heartrending  i never heard such woe and i hope never to again  kersdale and mcveigh were still at the other end of the wharf talking earnestlypolitics of course for both were head overheels in that particular game  when lucy mokunui passed me i stole a look at her  she was beautiful  she was beautiful by our standards as wellone of those rare blossoms that occur but once in generations and she of all women was doomed to molokai  she straight on board and aft on the open deck where the lepers huddled by the rail wailing now to their dear ones on shore  the lines were cast off and the noeau began to move away from the wharf  the wailing increased  such grief and despair  i was just resolving that never again would i be a witness to the sailing of the noeau when mcveigh and kersdale returned  the latters eyes were sparkling and his lips could not quite hide the smile of delight that was his  evidently the politics they had talked had been satisfactory the rope had been flung aside and the lamenting relatives now crowded the stringer piece on either side of us  thats her mother doctor georges whispered indicating an old woman next to me who was rocking back and forth and gazing at the steamer rail out of tearblinded eyes  i noticed that lucy mokunui was also wailing she stopped abruptly and gazed at kersdale  then she stretched forth her arms in that adorable sensuous way that olga nethersole has of embracing an audience  and with arms outspread she cried  goodbye jack  goodbye  he heard the cry and looked  never was a man overtaken by more crushing fear  he reeled on the stringer piece his face went white to the roots of his hair and he seemed to shrink and wither away inside his clothes he threw up his hands and groaned my god  my god  then he controlled himself by a great effort  goodbye lucy  goodbye he called  and he stood there on the wharf waving his hands to her till the noeau was clear away and the faces lining her afterrail were vague and indistinct  i thought you knew said mcveigh who had been regarding him curiously you of all men should have known  i thought that was why you were here  i know now kersdale answered with immense gravity  wheres the carriage  he walked rapidlyhalfranto it  i had to halfrun myself to keep up with him  drive to doctor herveys he told the driver  drive as fast as you can  he sank down in a seat panting and gasping  the pallor of his face had increased  his lips were compressed and the sweat was standing out on his forehead and upper lip  he seemed in some horrible agony  for gods sake martin make those horses go he broke out suddenly lay the whip into themdo you hearlay the whip into them  theyll break sir the driver remonstrated  let them break kersdale answered  ill pay your fine and square you with the police  put it to them  thats right  faster  faster  and i never knew i never knew he muttered sinking back in the seat and with trembling hands wiping the sweat away  the carriage was bouncing swaying and lurching around corners at such a wild pace as to make conversation impossible  besides there was nothing to say  but i could hear him muttering over and over and i never knew i never knew     aloha oe   never are there such departures as from the dock at honolulu  the great transport lay with steam up ready to pull out  a thousand persons were on her decks five thousand stood on the wharf  up and down the long gangway passed native princes and princesses sugar kings and the high officials of the territory  beyond in long lines kept in order by the native police were the carriages and motorcars of the honolulu aristocracy  on the wharf the royal hawaiian band played aloha oe and when it finished a stringed orchestra of native musicians on board the transport took up the same sobbing strains the native woman singers voice rising birdlike above the instruments and the hubbub of departure it was a silver reed sounding its clear unmistakable note in the great diapason of farewell  forward on the lower deck the rail was lined six deep with khakiclad young boys whose bronzed faces told of three years campaigning under the sun  but the farewell was not for them  nor was it for the white clad captain on the lofty bridge remote as the stars gazing down upon the tumult beneath him  nor was the farewell for the young officers farther aft returning from the philippines nor for the whitefaced climateravaged women by their sides  just aft the gangway on the promenade deck stood a score of united states senators with their wives and daughtersthe senatorial junketing party that for a month had been dined and wined surfeited with statistics and dragged up volcanic hill and down lava dale to behold the glories and resources of hawaii  it was for the junketing party that the transport had called in at honolulu and it was to the junketing party that honolulu was saying goodbye  the senators were garlanded and bedecked with flowers  senator jeremy sambrookes stout neck and portly bosom were burdened with a dozen wreaths  out of this mass of bloom and blossom projected his head and the greater portion of his freshly sunburned and perspiring face  he thought the flowers an abomination and as he looked out over the multitude on the wharf it was with a statistical eye that saw none of the beauty but that peered into the labour power the factories the railroads and the plantations that lay back of the multitude and which the multitude expressed  he saw resources and thought development and he was too busy with dreams of material achievement and empire to notice his daughter at his side talking with a young fellow in a natty summer suit and straw hat whose eager eyes seemed only for her and never left her face  had senator jeremy had eyes for his daughter he would have seen that in place of the young girl of fifteen he had brought to hawaii a short month before he was now taking away with him a woman  hawaii has a ripening climate and dorothy sambrooke had been exposed to it under exceptionally ripening circumstances  slender pale with blue eyes a trifle tired from poring over the pages of books and trying to muddle into an understanding of lifesuch she had been the month before but now the eyes were warm instead of tired the cheeks were touched with the sun and the body gave the first hint and promise of swelling lines during that month she had left books alone for she had found greater joy in reading from the book of life  she had ridden horses climbed volcanoes and learned surf swimming  the tropics had entered into her blood and she was aglow with the warmth and colour and sunshine  and for a month she had been in the company of a manstephen knight athlete surfboard rider a bronzed god of the sea who bitted the crashing breakers leaped upon their backs and rode them in to shore  dorothy sambrooke was unaware of the change  her consciousness was still that of a young girl and she was surprised and troubled by steves conduct in this hour of saying goodbye  she had looked upon him as her playfellow and for the month he had been her playfellow but now he was not parting like a playfellow  he talked excitedly and disconnectedly or was silent by fits and starts  sometimes he did not hear what she was saying or if he did failed to respond in his wonted manner  she was perturbed by the way he looked at her  she had not known before that he had such blazing eyes  there was something in his eyes that was terrifying  she could not face it and her own eyes continually drooped before it  yet there was something alluring about it as well and she continually returned to catch a glimpse of that blazing imperious yearning something that she had never seen in human eyes before  and she was herself strangely bewildered and excited  the transports huge whistle blew a deafening blast and the flowercrowned multitude surged closer to the side of the dock  dorothy sambrookes fingers were pressed to her ears and as she made a moue of distaste at the outrage of sound she noticed again the imperious yearning blaze in steves eyes  he was not looking at her but at her ears delicately pink and transparent in the slanting rays of the afternoon sun  curious and fascinated she gazed at that strange something in his eyes until he saw that he had been caught  she saw his cheeks flush darkly and heard him utter inarticulately  he was embarrassed and she was aware of embarrassment herself  stewards were going about nervously begging shoregoing persons to be gone  steve put out his hand  when she felt the grip of the fingers that had gripped hers a thousand times on surfboards and lava slopes she heard the words of the song with a new understanding as they sobbed in the hawaiian womans silver throat     ka halia ko aloha kai hiki mai    ke hone ae nei i kuu manawa    o oe no kan aloha    a loko e hana nei  steve had taught her air and words and meaningso she had thought till this instant and in this instant of the last finger clasp and warm contact of palms she divined for the first time the real meaning of the song  she scarcely saw him go nor could she note him on the crowded gangway for she was deep in a memory maze living over the four weeks just past rereading events in the light of revelation  when the senatorial party had landed steve had been one of the committee of entertainment  it was he who had given them their first exhibition of surf riding out at waikiki beach paddling his narrow board seaward until he became a disappearing speck and then suddenly reappearing rising like a seagod from out of the welter of spume and churning whiterising swiftly higher and higher shoulders and chest and loins and limbs until he stood poised on the smoking crest of a mighty mile long billow his feet buried in the flying foam hurling beachward with the speed of an express train and stepping calmly ashore at their astounded feet  that had been her first glimpse of steve  he had been the youngest man on the committee a youth himself of twenty  he had not entertained by speechmaking nor had he shone decoratively at receptions  it was in the breakers at waikiki in the wild cattle drive on manna kea and in the breaking yard of the haleakala ranch that he had performed his share of the entertaining  she had not cared for the interminable statistics and eternal speechmaking of the other members of the committee  neither had steve and it was with steve that she had stolen away from the openair feast at hamakua and from abe louisson the coffee planter who had talked coffee coffee nothing but coffee for two mortal hours  it was then as they rode among the tree ferns that steve had taught her the words of aloha oe the song that had been sung to the visiting senators at every village ranch and plantation departure  steve and she had been much together from the first  he had been her playfellow  she had taken possession of him while her father had been occupied in taking possession of the statistics of the island territory she was too gentle to tyrannize over her playfellow yet she had ruled him abjectly except when in canoe or on horse or surfboard at which times he had taken charge and she had rendered obedience  and now with this last singing of the song as the lines were cast off and the big transport began backing slowly out from the dock she knew that steve was something more to her than playfellow  five thousand voices were singing aloha oemy love be with you till we meet againand in that first moment of known love she realized that she and steve were being torn apart  when would they ever meet again  he had taught her those words himself  she remembered listening as he sang them over and over under the hau tree at waikiki  had it been prophecy  and she had admired his singing had told him that he sang with such expression  she laughed aloud hysterically at the recollection  with such expressionwhen he had been pouring his heart out in his voice  she knew now and it was too late  why had he not spoken  then she realized that girls of her age did not marry  but girls of her age did marryin hawaiiwas her instant thought  hawaii had ripened herhawaii where flesh is golden and where all women are ripe and sunkissed  vainly she scanned the packed multitude on the dock  what had become of him  she felt she could pay any price for one more glimpse of him and she almost hoped that some mortal sickness would strike the lonely captain on the bridge and delay departure  for the first time in her life she looked at her father with a calculating eye and as she did she noted with newborn fear the lines of will and determination  it would be terrible to oppose him  and what chance would she have in such a struggle  but why had steve not spoken  now it was too late  why had he not spoken under the hau tree at waikiki  and then with a great sinking of the heart it came to her that she knew why  what was it she had heard one day  oh yes it was at mrs stantons tea that afternoon when the ladies of the missionary crowd had entertained the ladies of the senatorial party  it was mrs hodgkins the tall blonde woman who had asked the question  the scene came back to her vividlythe broad lanai the tropic flowers the noiseless asiatic attendants the hum of the voices of the many women and the question mrs hodgkins had asked in the group next to her  mrs hodgkins had been away on the mainland for years and was evidently inquiring after old island friends of her maiden days  what has become of susie maydwell was the question she had asked  oh we never see her any more she married willie kupele another island woman answered and senator behrends wife laughed and wanted to know why matrimony had affected susie maydwells friendships  hapahaole was the answer he was a halfcaste you know and we of the islands have to think about our children  dorothy turned to her father resolved to put it to the test  papa if steve ever comes to the united states maynt he come and see us some time  who  steve  yes stephen knightyou know him  you said goodbye to him not five minutes ago  maynt he if he happens to be in the united states some time come and see us  certainly not jeremy sambrooke answered shortly  stephen knight is a hapahaole and you know what that means  oh dorothy said faintly while she felt a numb despair creep into her heart  steve was not a hapahaoleshe knew that but she did not know that a quarterstrain of tropic sunshine streamed in his veins and she knew that that was sufficient to put him outside the marriage pale  it was a strange world  there was the honourable a s cleghorn who had married a dusky princess of the kamehameha blood yet men considered it an honour to know him and the most exclusive women of the ultraexclusive missionary crowd were to be seen at his afternoon teas  and there was steve  no one had disapproved of his teaching her to ride a surfboard nor of his leading her by the hand through the perilous places of the crater of kilauea  he could have dinner with her and her father dance with her and be a member of the entertainment committee but because there was tropic sunshine in his veins he could not marry her  and he didnt show it  one had to be told to know  and he was so good looking  the picture of him limned itself on her inner vision and before she was aware she was pleasuring in the memory of the grace of his magnificent body of his splendid shoulders of the power in him that tossed her lightly on a horse bore her safely through the thundering breakers or towed her at the end of an alpenstock up the stern lava crest of the house of the sun  there was something subtler and mysterious that she remembered and that she was even then just beginning to understandthe aura of the male creature that is man all man masculine man  she came to herself with a shock of shame at the thoughts she had been thinking  her cheeks were dyed with the hot blood which quickly receded and left them pale at the thought that she would never see him again  the stem of the transport was already out in the stream and the promenade deck was passing abreast of the end of the dock  theres steve now her father said  wave goodbye to him dorothy  steve was looking up at her with eager eyes and he saw in her face what he had not seen before  by the rush of gladness into his own face she knew that he knew  the air was throbbing with the song     my love to you    my love be with you till we meet again  there was no need for speech to tell their story  about her passengers were flinging their garlands to their friends on the dock  steve held up his hands and his eyes pleaded  she slipped her own garland over her head but it had become entangled in the string of oriental pearls that mervin an elderly sugar king had placed around her neck when he drove her and her father down to the steamer  she fought with the pearls that clung to the flowers  the transport was moving steadily on  steve was already beneath her  this was the moment the next moment and he would be past  she sobbed and jeremy sambrooke glanced at her inquiringly  dorothy he cried sharply  she deliberately snapped the string and amid a shower of pearls the flowers fell to the waiting lover  she gazed at him until the tears blinded her and she buried her face on the shoulder of jeremy sambrooke who forgot his beloved statistics in wonderment at girl babies that insisted on growing up  the crowd sang on the song growing fainter in the distance but still melting with the sensuous lovelanguor of hawaii the words biting into her heart like acid because of their untruth     aloha oe aloha oe e ke onaona no ho ika lipo    a fond embrace ahoi ae au until we meet again     chun ah chun   there was nothing striking in the appearance of chun ah chun  he was rather undersized as chinese go and the chinese narrow shoulders and spareness of flesh were his  the average tourist casually glimpsing him on the streets of honolulu would have concluded that he was a goodnatured little chinese probably the proprietor of a prosperous laundry or tailorshop  in so far as good nature and prosperity went the judgment would be correct though beneath the mark for ah chun was as goodnatured as he was prosperous and of the latter no man knew a tithe the tale  it was well known that he was enormously wealthy but in his case enormous was merely the symbol for the unknown  ah chun had shrewd little eyes black and beady and so very little that they were like gimletholes  but they were wide apart and they sheltered under a forehead that was patently the forehead of a thinker for ah chun had his problems and had had them all his life  not that he ever worried over them  he was essentially a philosopher and whether as coolie or multimillionaire and master of many men his poise of soul was the same  he lived always in the high equanimity of spiritual repose undeterred by good fortune unruffled by ill fortune  all things went well with him whether they were blows from the overseer in the cane field or a slump in the price of sugar when he owned those cane fields himself  thus from the steadfast rock of his sure content he mastered problems such as are given to few men to consider much less to a chinese peasant  he was precisely thata chinese peasant born to labour in the fields all his days like a beast but fated to escape from the fields like the prince in a fairy tale  ah chun did not remember his father a small farmer in a district not far from canton nor did he remember much of his mother who had died when he was six  but he did remember his respected uncle ah kow for him had he served as a slave from his sixth year to his twentyfourth  it was then that he escaped by contracting himself as a coolie to labour for three years on the sugar plantations of hawaii for fifty cents a day  ah chun was observant  he perceived little details that not one man in a thousand ever noticed  three years he worked in the field at the end of which time he knew more about canegrowing than the overseers or even the superintendent while the superintendent would have been astounded at the knowledge the weazened little coolie possessed of the reduction processes in the mill  but ah chun did not study only sugar processes  he studied to find out how men came to be owners of sugar mills and plantations  one judgment he achieved early namely that men did not become rich from the labour of their own hands  he knew for he had laboured for a score of years himself  the men who grew rich did so from the labour of the hands of others  that man was richest who had the greatest number of his fellow creatures toiling for him  so when his term of contract was up ah chun invested his savings in a small importing store going into partnership with one ah yung  the firm ultimately became the great one of ah chun and ah yung which handled anything from india silks and ginseng to guano islands and blackbird brigs  in the meantime ah chun hired out as cook  he was a good cook and in three years he was the highestpaid chef in honolulu his career was assured and he was a fool to abandon it as dantin his employer told him but ah chun knew his own mind best and for knowing it was called a triplefool and given a present of fifty dollars over and above the wages due him  the firm of ah chun and ah yung was prospering  there was no need for ah chun longer to be a cook  there were boom times in hawaii  sugar was being extensively planted and labour was needed  ah chun saw the chance and went into the labourimporting business  he brought thousands of cantonese coolies into hawaii and his wealth began to grow he made investments  his beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy  he bought a fishpond for a song which later paid five hundred per cent and was the opening wedge by which he monopolized the fish market of honolulu  he did not talk for publication nor figure in politics nor play at revolutions but he forecast events more clearly and farther ahead than did the men who engineered them  in his minds eye he saw honolulu a modern electriclighted city at a time when it straggled unkempt and sandtormented over a barren reef of uplifted coral rock  so he bought land  he bought land from merchants who needed ready cash from impecunious natives from riotous traders sons from widows and orphans and the lepers deported to molokai and somehow as the years went by the pieces of land he had bought proved to be needed for warehouses or coffee buildings or hotels  he leased and rented sold and bought and resold again  but there were other things as well  he put his confidence and his money into parkinson the renegade captain whom nobody would trust  and parkinson sailed away on mysterious voyages in the little vega parkinson was taken care of until he died and years afterward honolulu was astonished when the news leaked out that the drake and acorn guano islands had been sold to the british phosphate trust for threequarters of a million  then there were the fat lush days of king kalakaua when ah chun paid three hundred thousand dollars for the opium licence  if he paid a third of a million for the drug monopoly the investment was nevertheless a good one for the dividends bought him the kalalau plantation which in turn paid him thirty per cent for seventeen years and was ultimately sold by him for a million and a half  it was under the kamehamehas long before that he had served his own country as chinese consula position that was not altogether unlucrative and it was under kamehameha iv that he changed his citizenship becoming an hawaiian subject in order to marry stella allendale herself a subject of the brownskinned king though more of anglosaxon blood ran in her veins than of polynesian  in fact the random breeds in her were so attenuated that they were valued at eighths and sixteenths  in the latter proportions was the blood of her great grandmother paahaothe princess paahao for she came of the royal line stella allendales greatgrandfather had been a captain blunt an english adventurer who took service under kamehameha i and was made a tabu chief himself  her grandfather had been a new bedford whaling captain while through her own father had been introduced a remote blend of italian and portuguese which had been grafted upon his own english stock  legally a hawaiian ah chuns spouse was more of any one of three other nationalities  and into this conglomerate of the races ah chun introduced the mongolian mixture  thus his children by mrs ah chun were one thirtysecond polynesian onesixteenth italian one sixteenth portuguese onehalf chinese and eleven thirtyseconds english and american  it might well be that ah chun would have refrained from matrimony could he have foreseen the wonderful family that was to spring from this union  it was wonderful in many ways  first there was its size  there were fifteen sons and daughters mostly daughters  the sons had come first three of them and then had followed in unswerving sequence a round dozen of girls  the blend of the race was excellent  not alone fruitful did it prove for the progeny without exception was healthy and without blemish  but the most amazing thing about the family was its beauty  all the girls were beautifuldelicately ethereally beautiful  mamma ah chuns rotund lines seemed to modify papa ah chuns lean angles so that the daughters were willowy without being lathy roundmuscled without being chubby  in every feature of every face were haunting reminiscences of asia all manipulated over and disguised by old england new england and south of europe  no observer without information would have guessed the heavy chinese strain in their veins nor could any observer after being informed fail to note immediately the chinese traces  as beauties the ah chun girls were something new  nothing like them had been seen before  they resembled nothing so much as they resembled one another and yet each girl was sharply individual  there was no mistaking one for another  on the other hand maud who was blueeyed and yellowhaired would remind one instantly of henrietta an olive brunette with large languishing dark eyes and hair that was blueblack the hint of resemblance that ran through them all reconciling every differentiation was ah chuns contribution  he had furnished the groundwork upon which had been traced the blended patterns of the races he had furnished the slimboned chinese frame upon which had been builded the delicacies and subtleties of saxon latin and polynesian flesh  mrs ah chun had ideas of her own to which ah chun gave credence though never permitting them expression when they conflicted with his own philosophic calm  she had been used all her life to living in european fashion  very well  ah chun gave her a european mansion  later as his sons and daughters grew able to advise he built a bungalow a spacious rambling affair as unpretentious as it was magnificent  also as time went by there arose a mountain house on tantalus to which the family could flee when the sick wind blew from the south  and at waikiki he built a beach residence on an extensive site so well chosen that later on when the united states government condemned it for fortification purposes an immense sum accompanied the condemnation  in all his houses were billiard and smoking rooms and guest rooms galore for ah chuns wonderful progeny was given to lavish entertainment  the furnishing was extravagantly simple  kings ransoms were expended without displaythanks to the educated tastes of the progeny  ah chun had been liberal in the matter of education  never mind expense he had argued in the old days with parkinson when that slack mariner could see no reason for making the vega seaworthy you sail the schooner i pay the bills  and so with his sons and daughters  it had been for them to get the education and never mind the expense harold the eldestborn had gone to harvard and oxford albert and charles had gone through yale in the same classes  and the daughters from the eldest down had undergone their preparation at mills seminary in california and passed on to vassar wellesley or bryn mawr  several having so desired had had the finishing touches put on in europe  and from all the world ah chuns sons and daughters returned to him to suggest and advise in the garnishment of the chaste magnificence of his residences  ah chun himself preferred the voluptuous glitter of oriental display but he was a philosopher and he clearly saw that his childrens tastes were correct according to western standards  of course his children were not known as the ah chun children  as he had evolved from a coolie labourer to a multimillionaire so had his name evolved  mamma ah chun had spelled it achun but her wiser offspring had elided the apostrophe and spelled it achun  ah chun did not object  the spelling of his name interfered no whit with his comfort nor his philosophic calm  besides he was not proud  but when his children arose to the height of a starched shirt a stiff collar and a frock coat they did interfere with his comfort and calm  ah chun would have none of it  he preferred the looseflowing robes of china and neither could they cajole nor bully him into making the change  they tried both courses and in the latter one failed especially disastrously they had not been to america for nothing  they had learned the virtues of the boycott as employed by organized labour and he their father chun ah chun they boycotted in his own house mamma achun aiding and abetting  but ah chun himself while unversed in western culture was thoroughly conversant with western labour conditions  an extensive employer of labour himself he knew how to cope with its tactics promptly he imposed a lockout on his rebellious progeny and erring spouse  he discharged his scores of servants locked up his stables closed his houses and went to live in the royal hawaiian hotel in which enterprise he happened to be the heaviest stockholder  the family fluttered distractedly on visits about with friends while ah chun calmly managed his many affairs smoked his long pipe with the tiny silver bowl and pondered the problem of his wonderful progeny  this problem did not disturb his calm  he knew in his philosophers soul that when it was ripe he would solve it  in the meantime he enforced the lesson that complacent as he might be he was nevertheless the absolute dictator of the achun destinies  the family held out for a week then returned along with ah chun and the many servants to occupy the bungalow once more  and thereafter no question was raised when ah chun elected to enter his brilliant drawingroom in blue silk robe wadded slippers and black silk skullcap with red button peak or when he chose to draw at his slenderstemmed silverbowled pipe among the cigaretteand cigarsmoking officers and civilians on the broad verandas or in the smoking room  ah chun occupied a unique position in honolulu  though he did not appear in society he was eligible anywhere  except among the chinese merchants of the city he never went out but he received and he always was the centre of his household and the head of his table  himself peasant born chinese he presided over an atmosphere of culture and refinement second to none in all the islands  nor were there any in all the islands too proud to cross his threshold and enjoy his hospitality  first of all the achun bungalow was of irreproachable tone  next ah chun was a power  and finally ah chun was a moral paragon and an honest business man  despite the fact that business morality was higher than on the mainland ah chun outshone the business men of honolulu in the scrupulous rigidity of his honesty  it was a saying that his word was as good as his bond  his signature was never needed to bind him  he never broke his word  twenty years after hotchkiss of hotchkiss morterson company died they found among mislaid papers a memorandum of a loan of thirty thousand dollars to ah chun  it had been incurred when ah chun was privy councillor to kamehameha ii  in the bustle and confusion of those heyday moneymaking times the affair had slipped ah chuns mind  there was no note no legal claim against him but he settled in full with the hotchkiss estate voluntarily paying a compound interest that dwarfed the principal  likewise when he verbally guaranteed the disastrous kakiku ditch scheme at a time when the least sanguine did not dream a guarantee necessarysigned his cheque for two hundred thousand without a quiver gentlemen without a quiver was the report of the secretary of the defunct enterprise who had been sent on the forlorn hope of finding out ah chuns intentions  and on top of the many similar actions that were true of his word there was scarcely a man of repute in the islands that at one time or another had not experienced the helping financial hand of ah chun  so it was that honolulu watched his wonderful family grow up into a perplexing problem and secretly sympathized with him for it was beyond any of them to imagine what he was going to do with it  but ah chun saw the problem more clearly than they  no one knew as he knew the extent to which he was an alien in his family  his own family did not guess it  he saw that there was no place for him amongst this marvellous seed of his loins and he looked forward to his declining years and knew that he would grow more and more alien  he did not understand his children their conversation was of things that did not interest him and about which he knew nothing  the culture of the west had passed him by  he was asiatic to the last fibre which meant that he was heathen  their christianity was to him so much nonsense  but all this he would have ignored as extraneous and irrelevant could he have but understood the young people themselves  when maud for instance told him that the housekeeping bills for the month were thirty thousandthat he understood as he understood alberts request for five thousand with which to buy the schooner yacht muriel and become a member of the hawaiian yacht club  but it was their remoter complicated desires and mental processes that obfuscated him  he was not slow in learning that the mind of each son and daughter was a secret labyrinth which he could never hope to tread  always he came upon the wall that divides east from west  their souls were inaccessible to him and by the same token he knew that his soul was inaccessible to them  besides as the years came upon him he found himself harking back more and more to his own kind  the reeking smells of the chinese quarter were spicy to him  he sniffed them with satisfaction as he passed along the street for in his mind they carried him back to the narrow tortuous alleys of canton swarming with life and movement  he regretted that he had cut off his queue to please stella allendale in the prenuptial days and he seriously considered the advisability of shaving his crown and growing a new one  the dishes his highly paid chef concocted for him failed to tickle his reminiscent palate in the way that the weird messes did in the stuffy restaurant down in the chinese quarter  he enjoyed vastly more a halfhours smoke and chat with two or three chinese chums than to preside at the lavish and elegant dinners for which his bungalow was famed where the pick of the americans and europeans sat at the long table men and women on equality the women with jewels that blazed in the subdued light against white necks and arms the men in evening dress and all chattering and laughing over topics and witticisms that while they were not exactly greek to him did not interest him nor entertain  but it was not merely his alienness and his growing desire to return to his chinese fleshpots that constituted the problem  there was also his wealth  he had looked forward to a placid old age  he had worked hard his reward should have been peace and repose  but he knew that with his immense fortune peace and repose could not possibly be his  already there were signs and omens  he had seen similar troubles before  there was his old employer dantin whose children had wrested from him by due process of law the management of his property having the court appoint guardians to administer it for him  ah chun knew and knew thoroughly well that had dantin been a poor man it would have been found that he could quite rationally manage his own affairs  and old dantin had had only three children and half a million while he chun ah chun had fifteen children and no one but himself knew how many millions  our daughters are beautiful women he said to his wife one evening there are many young men  the house is always full of young men  my cigar bills are very heavy  why are there no marriages  mamma achun shrugged her shoulders and waited  women are women and men are menit is strange there are no marriages perhaps the young men do not like our daughters  ah they like them well enough mamma chun answered but you see they cannot forget that you are your daughters father  yet you forgot who my father was ah chun said gravely  all you asked was for me to cut off my queue  the young men are more particular than i was i fancy  what is the greatest thing in the world ah chun demanded with abrupt irrelevance  mamma achun pondered for a moment then replied  god  he nodded  there are gods and gods  some are paper some are wood some are bronze  i use a small one in the office for a paperweight  in the bishop museum are many gods of coral rock and lava stone  but there is only one god she announced decisively stiffening her ample frame argumentatively  ah chun noted the danger signal and sheered off  what is greater than god then he asked  i will tell you  it is money  in my time i have had dealings with jews and christians mohammedans and buddhists and with little black men from the solomons and new guinea who carried their god about them wrapped in oiled paper they possessed various gods these men but they all worshipped money there is that captain higginson  he seems to like henrietta  he will never marry her retorted mamma achun  he will be an admiral before he dies  a rearadmiral ah chun interpolated  yes i know  that is the way they retire  his family in the united states is a high one  they would not like it if he married    if he did not marry an american girl  ah chun knocked the ashes out of his pipe thoughtfully refilling the silver bowl with a tiny pleget of tobacco  he lighted it and smoked it out before he spoke  henrietta is the oldest girl  the day she marries i will give her three hundred thousand dollars  that will fetch that captain higginson and his high family along with him  let the word go out to him  i leave it to you  and ah chun sat and smoked on and in the curling smokewreaths he saw take shape the face and figure of toy shueytoy shuey the maid of all work in his uncles house in the cantonese village whose work was never done and who received for a whole years work one dollar  and he saw his youthful self arise in the curling smoke his youthful self who had toiled eighteen years in his uncles field for little more  and now he ah chun the peasant dowered his daughter with three hundred thousand years of such toil  and she was but one daughter of a dozen  he was not elated at the thought  it struck him that it was a funny whimsical world and he chuckled aloud and startled mamma achun from a revery which he knew lay deep in the hidden crypts of her being where he had never penetrated  but ah chuns word went forth as a whisper and captain higginson forgot his rearadmiralship and his high family and took to wife three hundred thousand dollars and a refined and cultured girl who was one thirtysecond polynesian onesixteenth italian onesixteenth portuguese eleven thirtyseconds english and yankee and onehalf chinese  ah chuns munificence had its effect  his daughters became suddenly eligible and desirable  clara was the next but when the secretary of the territory formally proposed for her ah chun informed him that he must wait his turn that maud was the oldest and that she must be married first  it was shrewd policy  the whole family was made vitally interested in marrying off maud which it did in three months to ned humphreys the united states immigration commissioner  both he and maud complained for the dowry was only two hundred thousand  ah chun explained that his initial generosity had been to break the ice and that after that his daughters could not expect otherwise than to go more cheaply  clara followed maud and thereafter for a space of two years there was a continuous round of weddings in the bungalow  in the meantime ah chun had not been idle  investment after investment was called in  he sold out his interests in a score of enterprises and step by step so as not to cause a slump in the market he disposed of his large holdings in real estate  toward the last he did precipitate a slump and sold at sacrifice  what caused this haste were the squalls he saw already rising above the horizon  by the time lucille was married echoes of bickerings and jealousies were already rumbling in his ears  the air was thick with schemes and counterschemes to gain his favour and to prejudice him against one or another or all but one of his sonsinlaw  all of which was not conducive to the peace and repose he had planned for his old age  he hastened his efforts  for a long time he had been in correspondence with the chief banks in shanghai and macao  every steamer for several years had carried away drafts drawn in favour of one chun ah chun for deposit in those far eastern banks  the drafts now became heavier  his two youngest daughters were not yet married  he did not wait but dowered them with a hundred thousand each which sums lay in the bank of hawaii drawing interest and awaiting their wedding day  albert took over the business of the firm of ah chun and ah yung harold the eldest having elected to take a quarter of a million and go to england to live charles the youngest took a hundred thousand a legal guardian and a course in a keeley institute  to mamma achun was given the bungalow the mountain house on tantalus and a new seaside residence in place of the one ah chun sold to the government  also to mamma achun was given half a million in money well invested  ah chun was now ready to crack the nut of the problem  one fine morning when the family was at breakfasthe had seen to it that all his sonsin law and their wives were presenthe announced that he was returning to his ancestral soil  in a neat little homily he explained that he had made ample provision for his family and he laid down various maxims that he was sure he said would enable them to dwell together in peace and harmony  also he gave business advice to his sonsinlaw preached the virtues of temperate living and safe investments and gave them the benefit of his encyclopedic knowledge of industrial and business conditions in hawaii  then he called for his carriage and in the company of the weeping mamma achun was driven down to the pacific mail steamer leaving behind him a panic in the bungalow  captain higginson clamoured wildly for an injunction  the daughters shed copious tears one of their husbands an exfederal judge questioned ah chuns sanity and hastened to the proper authorities to inquire into it  he returned with the information that ah chun had appeared before the commission the day before demanded an examination and passed with flying colours there was nothing to be done so they went down and said goodbye to the little old man who waved farewell from the promenade deck as the big steamer poked her nose seaward through the coral reef  but the little old man was not bound for canton  he knew his own country too well and the squeeze of the mandarins to venture into it with the tidy bulk of wealth that remained to him  he went to macao  now ah chun had long exercised the power of a king and he was as imperious as a king when he landed at macao and went into the office of the biggest european hotel to register the clerk closed the book on him  chinese were not permitted  ah chun called for the manager and was treated with contumely  he drove away but in two hours he was back again  he called the clerk and manager in gave them a months salary and discharged them  he had made himself the owner of the hotel and in the finest suite he settled down during the many months the gorgeous palace in the suburbs was building for him  in the meantime with the inevitable ability that was his he increased the earnings of his big hotel from three per cent to thirty  the troubles ah chun had flown began early  there were sonsinlaw that made bad investments others that played ducks and drakes with the achun dowries  ah chun being out of it they looked at mamma ah chun and her half million and looking engendered not the best of feeling toward one another  lawyers waxed fat in the striving to ascertain the construction of trust deeds  suits crosssuits and countersuits cluttered the hawaiian courts  nor did the police courts escape  there were angry encounters in which harsh words and harsher blows were struck  there were such things as flower pots being thrown to add emphasis to winged words  and suits for libel arose that dragged their way through the courts and kept honolulu agog with excitement over the revelations of the witnesses  in his palace surrounded by all dear delights of the orient ah chun smokes his placid pipe and listens to the turmoil overseas  by each mail steamer in faultless english typewritten on an american machine a letter goes from macao to honolulu in which by admirable texts and precepts ah chun advises his family to live in unity and harmony  as for himself he is out of it all and well content  he has won to peace and repose  at times he chuckles and rubs his hands and his slant little black eyes twinkle merrily at the thought of the funny world  for out of all his living and philosophizing that remains to himthe conviction that it is a very funny world     the sheriff of kona   you cannot escape liking the climate cudworth said in reply to my panegyric on the kona coast  i was a young fellow just out of college when i came here eighteen years ago  i never went back except of course to visit  and i warn you if you have some spot dear to you on earth not to linger here too long else you will find this dearer  we had finished dinner which had been served on the big lanai the one with a northerly exposure though exposure is indeed a misnomer in so delectable a climate  the candles had been put out and a slim whiteclad japanese slipped like a ghost through the silvery moonlight presented us with cigars and faded away into the darkness of the bungalow  i looked through a screen of banana and lehua trees and down across the guava scrub to the quiet sea a thousand feet beneath  for a week ever since i had landed from the tiny coastingsteamer i had been stopping with cudworth and during that time no wind had ruffled that unvexed sea  true there had been breezes but they were the gentlest zephyrs that ever blew through summer isles  they were not winds they were sighslong balmy sighs of a world at rest  a lotus land i said  where each day is like every day and every day is a paradise of days he answered  nothing ever happens  it is not too hot  it is not too cold  it is always just right  have you noticed how the land and the sea breathe turn and turn about  indeed i had noticed that delicious rhythmic breathing  each morning i had watched the seabreeze begin at the shore and slowly extend seaward as it blew the mildest softest whiff of ozone to the land  it played over the sea just faintly darkening its surface with here and there and everywhere long lanes of calm shifting changing drifting according to the capricious kisses of the breeze  and each evening i had watched the sea breath die away to heavenly calm and heard the land breath softly make its way through the coffee trees and monkeypods  it is a land of perpetual calm i said  does it ever blow hereever really blow  you know what i mean  cudworth shook his head and pointed eastward  how can it blow with a barrier like that to stop it  far above towered the huge bulks of mauna kea and mauna loa seeming to blot out half the starry sky  two miles and a half above our heads they reared their own heads white with snow that the tropic sun had failed to melt  thirty miles away right now ill wager it is blowing forty miles an hour  i smiled incredulously  cudworth stepped to the lanai telephone  he called up in succession waimea kohala and hamakua  snatches of his conversation told me that the wind was blowing  ripsnorting and backjumping eh    how long    only a week    hello abe is that you    yes yes    you will plant coffee on the hamakua coast    hang your wind breaks  you should see my trees  blowing a gale he said to me turning from hanging up the receiver  i always have to joke abe on his coffee  he has five hundred acres and hes done marvels in windbreaking but how he keeps the roots in the ground is beyond me  blow  it always blows on the hamakua side  kohala reports a schooner under double reefs beating up the channel between hawaii and maui and making heavy weather of it  it is hard to realize i said lamely  doesnt a little whiff of it ever eddy around somehow and get down here  not a whiff  our landbreeze is absolutely of no kin for it begins this side of mauna kea and mauna loa  you see the land radiates its heat quicker than the sea and so at night the land breathes over the sea  in the day the land becomes warmer than the sea and the sea breathes over the land    listen  here comes the landbreath now the mountain wind  i could hear it coming rustling softly through the coffee trees stirring the monkeypods and sighing through the sugarcane  on the lanai the hush still reigned  then it came the first feel of the mountain wind faintly balmy fragrant and spicy and cool deliciously cool a silken coolness a winelike coolnesscool as only the mountain wind of kona can be cool  do you wonder that i lost my heart to kona eighteen years ago he demanded  i could never leave it now  i think i should die  it would be terrible  there was another man who loved it even as i  i think he loved it more for he was born here on the kona coast  he was a great man my best friend my more than brother  but he left it and he did not die  love i queried  a woman  cudworth shook his head  nor will he ever come back though his heart will be here until he dies  he paused and gazed down upon the beachlights of kailua  i smoked silently and waited  he was already in love    with his wife  also he had three children and he loved them  they are in honolulu now  the boy is going to college  some rash act i questioned after a time impatiently  he shook his head  neither guilty of anything criminal nor charged with anything criminal  he was the sheriff of kona  you choose to be paradoxical i said  i suppose it does sound that way he admitted and that is the perfect hell of it  he looked at me searchingly for a moment and then abruptly took up the tale  he was a leper  no he was not born with itno one is born with it it came upon him  this manwhat does it matter  lyte gregory was his name  every kamaina knows the story  he was straight american stock but he was built like the chieftains of old hawaii  he stood six feet three  his stripped weight was two hundred and twenty pounds not an ounce of which was not clean muscle or bone  he was the strongest man i have ever seen  he was an athlete and a giant  he was a god  he was my friend  and his heart and his soul were as big and as fine as his body  i wonder what you would do if you saw your friend your brother on the slippery lip of a precipice slipping slipping and you were able to do nothing  that was just it  i could do nothing  i saw it coming and i could do nothing  my god man what could i do  there it was malignant and incontestable the mark of the thing on his brow  no one else saw it  it was because i loved him so i do believe that i alone saw it  i could not credit the testimony of my senses  it was too incredibly horrible  yet there it was on his brow on his ears  i had seen it the slight puff of the earlobesoh so imperceptibly slight  i watched it for months  then next hoping against hope the darkening of the skin above both eyebrowsoh so faint just like the dimmest touch of sunburn  i should have thought it sunburn but that there was a shine to it such an invisible shine like a little highlight seen for a moment and gone the next  i tried to believe it was sunburn only i could not i knew better  no one noticed it but me  no one ever noticed it except stephen kaluna and i did not know that till afterward  but i saw it coming the whole damnable unnamable awfulness of it but i refused to think about the future  i was afraid  i could not  and of nights i cried over it  he was my friend  we fished sharks on niihau together  we hunted wild cattle on mauna kea and mauna loa  we broke horses and branded steers on the carter ranch  we hunted goats through haleakala  he taught me diving and surfing until i was nearly as clever as he and he was cleverer than the average kanaka  i have seen him dive in fifteen fathoms and he could stay down two minutes  he was an amphibian and a mountaineer  he could climb wherever a goat dared climb  he was afraid of nothing  he was on the wrecked luga and he swam thirty miles in thirtysix hours in a heavy sea  he could fight his way out through breaking combers that would batter you and me to a jelly  he was a great glorious mangod  we went through the revolution together  we were both romantic loyalists  he was shot twice and sentenced to death but he was too great a man for the republicans to kill  he laughed at them  later they gave him honour and made him sheriff of kona  he was a simple man a boy that never grew up  his was no intricate brain pattern  he had no twists nor quirks in his mental processes  he went straight to the point and his points were always simple  and he was sanguine  never have i known so confident a man nor a man so satisfied and happy  he did not ask anything from life  there was nothing left to be desired  for him life had no arrears  he had been paid in full cash down and in advance  what more could he possibly desire than that magnificent body that iron constitution that immunity from all ordinary ills and that lowly wholesomeness of soul  physically he was perfect  he had never been sick in his life  he did not know what a headache was  when i was so afflicted he used to look at me in wonder and make me laugh with his clumsy attempts at sympathy  he did not understand such a thing as a headache  he could not understand sanguine  no wonder  how could he be otherwise with that tremendous vitality and incredible health  just to show you what faith he had in his glorious star and also what sanction he had for that faith  he was a youngster at the timei had just met himwhen he went into a poker game at wailuku  there was a big german in it schultz his name was and he played a brutal domineering game  he had had a run of luck as well and he was quite insufferable when lyte gregory dropped in and took a hand  the very first hand it was schultzs blind  lyte came in as well as the others and schultz raised them outall except lyte  he did not like the germans tone and he raised him back  schultz raised in turn and in turn lyte raised schultz  so they went back and forth  the stakes were big  and do you know what lyte held  a pair of kings and three little clubs  it wasnt poker  lyte wasnt playing poker  he was playing his optimism  he didnt know what schultz held but he raised and raised until he made schultz squeal and schultz held three aces all the time  think of it  a man with a pair of kings compelling three aces to see before the draw  well schultz called for two cards  another german was dealing schultzs friend at that  lyte knew then that he was up against three of a kind  now what did he do  what would you have done  drawn three cards and held up the kings of course  not lyte  he was playing optimism  he threw the kings away held up the three little clubs and drew two cards  he never looked at them  he looked across at schultz to bet and schultz did bet big  since he himself held three aces he knew he had lyte because he played lyte for threes and necessarily they would have to be smaller threes  poor schultz  he was perfectly correct under the premises  his mistake was that he thought lyte was playing poker  they bet back and forth for five minutes until schultzs certainty began to ooze out  and all the time lyte had never looked at his two cards and schultz knew it  i could see schultz think and revive and splurge with his bets again  but the strain was too much for him  hold on gregory he said at last  ive got you beaten from the start  i dont want any of your money  ive got  never mind what youve got lyte interrupted  you dont know what ive got  i guess ill take a look  he looked and raised the german a hundred dollars  then they went at it again back and forth and back and forth until schultz weakened and called and laid down his three aces  lyte faced his five cards  they were all black  he had drawn two more clubs  do you know he just about broke schultzs nerve as a poker player  he never played in the same form again  he lacked confidence after that and was a bit wobbly  but how could you do it i asked lyte afterwards  you knew he had you beaten when he drew two cards  besides you never looked at your own draw  i didnt have to look was lytes answer  i knew they were two clubs all the time  they just had to be two clubs  do you think i was going to let that big dutchman beat me  it was impossible that he should beat me  it is not my way to be beaten  i just have to win  why id have been the most surprised man in this world if they hadnt been all clubs  that was lytes way and maybe it will help you to appreciate his colossal optimism  as he put it he just had to succeed to fare well to prosper  and in that same incident as in ten thousand others he found his sanction  the thing was that he did succeed did prosper  that was why he was afraid of nothing  nothing could ever happen to him  he knew it because nothing had ever happened to him  that time the luga was lost and he swam thirty miles he was in the water two whole nights and a day  and during all that terrible stretch of time he never lost hope once never once doubted the outcome  he just knew he was going to make the land  he told me so himself and i know it was the truth  well that is the kind of a man lyte gregory was  he was of a different race from ordinary ailing mortals  he was a lordly being untouched by common ills and misfortunes  whatever he wanted he got  he won his wifeone of the caruthers a little beautyfrom a dozen rivals  and she settled down and made him the finest wife in the world  he wanted a boy  he got it  he wanted a girl and another boy  he got them  and they were just right without spot or blemish with chests like little barrels and with all the inheritance of his own health and strength  and then it happened  the mark of the beast was laid upon him  i watched it for a year  it broke my heart  but he did not know it nor did anybody else guess it except that cursed hapahaole stephen kaluna  he knew it but i did not know that he did  andyesdoc strowbridge knew it  he was the federal physician and he had developed the leper eye  you see part of his business was to examine suspects and order them to the receiving station at honolulu  and stephen kaluna had developed the leper eye  the disease ran strong in his family and four or five of his relatives were already on molokai  the trouble arose over stephen kalunas sister  when she became suspect and before doc strowbridge could get hold of her her brother spirited her away to some hidingplace  lyte was sheriff of kona and it was his business to find her  we were all over at hilo that night in ned austins  stephen kaluna was there when we came in by himself in his cups and quarrelsome  lyte was laughing over some jokethat huge happy laugh of a giant boy kaluna spat contemptuously on the floor  lyte noticed so did everybody but he ignored the fellow  kaluna was looking for trouble  he took it as a personal grudge that lyte was trying to apprehend his sister  in half a dozen ways he advertised his displeasure at lytes presence but lyte ignored him  i imagined lyte was a bit sorry for him for the hardest duty of his office was the apprehension of lepers  it is not a nice thing to go in to a mans house and tear away a father mother or child who has done no wrong and to send such a one to perpetual banishment on molokai  of course it is necessary as a protection to society and lyte i do believe would have been the first to apprehend his own father did he become suspect  finally kaluna blurted out  look here gregory you think youre going to find kalaniweo but youre not  kalaniweo was his sister  lyte glanced at him when his name was called but he made no answer  kaluna was furious  he was working himself up all the time  ill tell you one thing he shouted  youll be on molokai yourself before ever you get kalaniweo there  ill tell you what you are  youve no right to be in the company of honest men  youve made a terrible fuss talking about your duty havent you  youve sent many lepers to molokai and knowing all the time you belonged there yourself  id seen lyte angry more than once but never quite so angry as at that moment  leprosy with us you know is not a thing to jest about  he made one leap across the floor dragging kaluna out of his chair with a clutch on his neck  he shook him back and forth savagely till you could hear the halfcastes teeth rattling  what do you mean lyte was demanding  spit it out man or ill choke it out of you  you know in the west there is a certain phrase that a man must smile while uttering  so with us of the islands only our phrase is related to leprosy  no matter what kaluna was he was no coward  as soon as lyte eased the grip on his throat he answered  ill tell you what i mean  you are a leper yourself  lyte suddenly flung the halfcaste sideways into a chair letting him down easily enough  then lyte broke out into honest hearty laughter but he laughed alone and when he discovered it he looked around at our faces  i had reached his side and was trying to get him to come away but he took no notice of me  he was gazing fascinated at kaluna who was brushing at his own throat in a flurried nervous way as if to brush off the contamination of the fingers that had clutched him  the action was unreasoned genuine  lyte looked around at us slowly passing from face to face  my god fellows  my god he said  he did not speak it  it was more a hoarse whisper of fright and horror it was fear that fluttered in his throat and i dont think that ever in his life before he had known fear  then his colossal optimism asserted itself and he laughed again  a good jokewhoever put it up he said  the drinks are on me  i had a scare for a moment  but fellows dont do it again to anybody its too serious  i tell you i died a thousand deaths in that moment  i thought of my wife and the kids and      his voice broke and the halfcaste still throatbrushing drew his eyes  he was puzzled and worried  john he said turning toward me  his jovial rotund voice rang in my ears  but i could not answer  i was swallowing hard at that moment and besides i knew my face didnt look just right  john he called again taking a step nearer  he called timidly and of all nightmares of horrors the most frightful was to hear timidity in lyte gregorys voice  john john what does it mean he went on still more timidly its a joke isnt it  john heres my hand  if i were a leper would i offer you my hand  am i a leper john  he held out his hand and what in high heaven or hell did i care  he was my friend  i took his hand though it cut me to the heart to see the way his face brightened  it was only a joke lyte i said  we fixed it up on you  but youre right  its too serious  we wont do it again  he did not laugh this time  he smiled as a man awakened from a bad dream and still oppressed by the substance of the dream  all right then he said  dont do it again and ill stand for the drinks  but i may as well confess that you fellows had me going south for a moment  look at the way ive been sweating  he sighed and wiped the sweat from his forehead as he started to step toward the bar  it is no joke kaluna said abruptly  i looked murder at him and i felt murder too  but i dared not speak or strike  that would have precipitated the catastrophe which i somehow had a mad hope of still averting  it is no joke kaluna repeated  you are a leper lyte gregory and youve no right putting your hands on honest mens fleshon the clean flesh of honest men  then gregory flared up  the joke has gone far enough  quit it  quit it i say kaluna or ill give you a beating  you undergo a bacteriological examination kaluna answered and then you can beat meto death if you want to  why man look at yourself there in the glass  you can see it  anybody can see it  youre developing the lion face  see where the skin is darkened there over your eyes  lyte peered and peered and i saw his hands trembling  i can see nothing he said finally then turned on the hapahaole you have a black heart kaluna  and i am not ashamed to say that you have given me a scare that no man has a right to give another  i take you at your word  i am going to settle this thing now  i am going straight to doc strowbridge  and when i come back watch out  he never looked at us but started for the door  you wait here john he said waving me back from accompanying him  we stood around like a group of ghosts  it is the truth kaluna said  you could see it for yourselves  they looked at me and i nodded  harry burnley lifted his glass to his lips but lowered it untasted  he spilled half of it over the bar  his lips were trembling like a child that is about to cry  ned austin made a clatter in the icechest  he wasnt looking for anything  i dont think he knew what he was doing  nobody spoke  harry burnleys lips were trembling harder than ever  suddenly with a most horrible malignant expression he drove his fist into kalunas face  he followed it up  we made no attempt to separate them  we didnt care if he killed the half caste  it was a terrible beating  we werent interested  i dont even remember when burnley ceased and let the poor devil crawl away  we were all too dazed  doc strowbridge told me about it afterward  he was working late over a report when lyte came into his office  lyte had already recovered his optimism and came swinging in a trifle angry with kaluna to be sure but very certain of himself  what could i do doc asked me  i knew he had it  i had seen it coming on for months  i couldnt answer him  i couldnt say yes  i dont mind telling you i broke down and cried  he pleaded for the bacteriological test  snip out a piece doc he said over and over  snip out a piece of skin and make the test  the way doc strowbridge cried must have convinced lyte  the claudine was leaving next morning for honolulu  we caught him when he was going aboard  you see he was headed for honolulu to give himself up to the board of health  we could do nothing with him  he had sent too many to molokai to hang back himself  we argued for japan  but he wouldnt hear of it  ive got to take my medicine fellows was all he would say and he said it over and over  he was obsessed with the idea  he wound up all his affairs from the receiving station at honolulu and went down to molokai  he didnt get on well there  the resident physician wrote us that he was a shadow of his old self  you see he was grieving about his wife and the kids  he knew we were taking care of them but it hurt him just the same  after six months or so i went down to molokai  i sat on one side a plateglass window and he on the other we looked at each other through the glass and talked through what might be called a speaking tube  but it was hopeless  he had made up his mind to remain  four mortal hours i argued  i was exhausted at the end  my steamer was whistling for me too  but we couldnt stand for it  three months later we chartered the schooner halcyon  she was an opium smuggler and she sailed like a witch  her master was a squarehead who would do anything for money and we made a charter to china worth his while  he sailed from san francisco and a few days later we took out landhouses sloop for a cruise  she was only a fiveton yacht but we slammed her fifty miles to windward into the northeast trade  seasick  i never suffered so in my life  out of sight of land we picked up the halcyon and burnley and i went aboard  we ran down to molokai arriving about eleven at night  the schooner hove to and we landed through the surf in a whaleboat at kalawaothe place you know where father damien died  that squarehead was game with a couple of revolvers strapped on him he came right along  the three of us crossed the peninsula to kalaupapa something like two miles just imagine hunting in the dead of night for a man in a settlement of over a thousand lepers  you see if the alarm was given it was all off with us  it was strange ground and pitch dark  the lepers dogs came out and bayed at us and we stumbled around till we got lost  the squarehead solved it  he led the way into the first detached house we shut the door after us and struck a light  there were six lepers  we routed them up and i talked in native  what i wanted was a kokua  a kokua is literally a helper a native who is clean that lives in the settlement and is paid by the board of health to nurse the lepers dress their sores and such things  we stayed in the house to keep track of the inmates while the squarehead led one of them off to find a kokua he got him and he brought him along at the point of his revolver  but the kokua was all right  while the squarehead guarded the house burnley and i were guided by the kokua to lytes house  he was all alone  i thought you fellows would come lyte said  dont touch me john hows ned and charley and all the crowd  never mind tell me afterward  i am ready to go now  ive had nine months of it  wheres the boat  we started back for the other house to pick up the squarehead  but the alarm had got out  lights were showing in the houses and doors were slamming  we had agreed that there was to be no shooting unless absolutely necessary and when we were halted we went at it with our fists and the butts of our revolvers  i found myself tangled up with a big man  i couldnt keep him off me though twice i smashed him fairly in the face with my fist  he grappled with me and we went down rolling and scrambling and struggling for grips  he was getting away with me when some one came running up with a lantern  then i saw his face  how shall i describe the horror of it  it was not a faceonly wasted or wasting featuresa living ravage noseless lipless with one ear swollen and distorted hanging down to the shoulder  i was frantic  in a clinch he hugged me close to him until that ear flapped in my face then i guess i went insane  it was too terrible  i began striking him with my revolver  how it happened i dont know but just as i was getting clear he fastened upon me with his teeth  the whole side of my hand was in that lipless mouth  then i struck him with the revolver butt squarely between the eyes and his teeth relaxed  cudworth held his hand to me in the moonlight and i could see the scars it looked as if it had been mangled by a dog  werent you afraid i asked  i was  seven years i waited  you know it takes that long for the disease to incubate  here in kona i waited and it did not come  but there was never a day of those seven years and never a night that i did not look out on    on all this      his voice broke as he swept his eyes from the moonbathed sea beneath to the snowy summits above  i could not bear to think of losing it of never again beholding kona seven years  i stayed clean  but that is why i am single  i was engaged  i could not dare to marry while i was in doubt  she did not understand  she went away to the states and married  i have never seen her since  just at the moment i got clear of the leper policeman there was a rush and clatter of hoofs like a cavalry charge  it was the squarehead  he had been afraid of a rumpus and he had improved his time by making those blessed lepers he was guarding saddle up four horses  we were ready for him  lyte had accounted for three kokuas and between us we untangled burnley from a couple more  the whole settlement was in an uproar by that time and as we dashed away somebody opened upon us with a winchester  it must have been jack mcveigh the superintendent of molokai  that was a ride  leper horses leper saddles leper bridles pitchblack darkness whistling bullets and a road none of the best  and the squareheads horse was a mule and he didnt know how to ride either  but we made the whaleboat and as we shoved off through the surf we could hear the horses coming down the hill from kalaupapa  youre going to shanghai  you look lyte gregory up  he is employed in a german firm there  take him out to dinner  open up wine  give him everything of the best but dont let him pay for anything  send the bill to me  his wife and the kids are in honolulu and he needs the money for them  i know  he sends most of his salary and lives like an anchorite  and tell him about kona  theres where his heart is  tell him all you can about kona     jack london by himself   i was born in san francisco in 1876  at fifteen i was a man among men and if i had a spare nickel i spent it on beer instead of candy because i thought it was more manly to buy beer  now when my years are nearly doubled i am out on a hunt for the boyhood which i never had and i am less serious than at any other time of my life  guess ill find that boyhood  almost the first things i realized were responsibilities  i have no recollection of being taught to read or writei could do both at the age of fivebut i know that my first school was in alameda before i went out on a ranch with my folks and as a ranch boy worked hard from my eighth year  the second school were i tried to pick up a little learning was an irregular hit or miss affair at san mateo  each class sat in a separate desk but there were days when we did not sit at all for the master used to get drunk very often and then one of the elder boys would thrash him to even things up the master would then thrash the younger lads so you can think what sort of school it was  there was no one belonging to me or associated with me in any way who had literary tastes or ideas the nearest i can make to it is that my greatgrandfather was a circuit writer a welshman known as priest jones in the backwoods where his enthusiasm led him to scatter the gospel  one of my earliest and strongest impressions was of the ignorance of other people  i had read and absorbed washington irvings alhambra before i was nine but could never understand how it was that the other ranchers knew nothing about it  later i concluded that this ignorance was peculiar to the country and felt that those who lived in cities would not be so dense  one day a man from the city came to the ranch  he wore shiny shoes and a cloth coat and i felt that here was a good chance for me to exchange thoughts with an enlightened mind  from the bricks of an old fallen chimney i had built an alhambra of my own towers terraces and all were complete and chalk inscriptions marked the different sections  here i led the city man and questioned him about the alhambra but he was as ignorant as the man on the ranch and then i consoled myself with the thought that there were only two clever people in the worldwashington irving and myself  my other readingmatter at that time consisted mainly of dime novels borrowed from the hired men and newspapers in which the servants gloated over the adventures of poor but virtuous shopgirls  through reading such stuff my mind was necessarily ridiculously conventional but being very lonely i read everything that came my way and was greatly impressed by ouidas story signa which i devoured regularly for a couple of years  i never knew the finish until i grew up for the closing chapters were missing from my copy so i kept on dreaming with the hero and like him unable to see nemesis at the end my work on the ranch at one time was to watch the bees and as i sat under a tree from sunrise till late in the afternoon waiting for the swarming i had plenty of time to read and dream  livermore valley was very flat and even the hills around were then to me devoid of interest and the only incident to break in on my visions was when i gave the alarm of swarming and the ranch folks rushed out with pots pans and buckets of water  i think the opening line of signa was it was only a little lad yet he had dreams of becoming a great musician and having all europe at his feet  well i was only a little lad too but why could not i become what signa dreamed of being  life on a californian ranch was then to me the dullest possible existence and every day i thought of going out beyond the skyline to see the world  even then there were whispers promptings my mind inclined to things beautiful although my environment was unbeautiful the hills and valleys around were eyesores and aching pits and i never loved them till i left them        before i was eleven i left the ranch and came to oakland where i spent so much of my time in the free public library eagerly reading everything that came to hand that i developed the first stages of st vitus dance from lack of exercise  disillusions quickly followed as i learned more of the world  at this time i made my living as a newsboy selling papers in the streets and from then on until i was sixteen i had a thousand and one different occupationswork and school school and workand so it ran  then the adventurelust was strong within me and i left home  i didnt run i just leftwent out in the bay and joined the oyster pirates  the days of the oyster pirates are now past and if i had got my dues for piracy i would have been given five hundred years in prison  later i shipped as a sailor on a schooner and also took a turn at salmon fishing  oddly enough my next occupation was on a fishpatrol where i was entrusted with the arrest of any violators of the fishing laws numbers of lawless chinese greeks and italians were at that time engaged in illegal fishing and many a patrolman paid his life for his interference  my only weapon on duty was a steel tablefork but i felt fearless and a man when i climbed over the side of a boat to arrest some marauder  subsequently i shipped before the mast and sailed for the japanese coast on a sealhunting expedition later going to behring sea  after sealing for seven months i came back to california and took odd jobs at coal shovelling and longshoring and also in a jute factory where i worked from six in the morning until seven at night  i had planned to join the same lot for another sealing trip the following year but somehow i missed them  they sailed away on the mary thomas which was lost with all hands  in my fitful schooldays i had written the usual compositions which had been praised in the usual way and while working in the jute mills i still made an occasional try  the factory occupied thirteen hours of my day and being young and husky i wanted a little time for myself so there was little left for composition  the san francisco call offered a prize for a descriptive article  my mother urged me to try for it and i did taking for my subject typhoon off the coast of japan  very tired and sleepy knowing i had to be up at halfpast five i began the article at midnight and worked straight on until i had written two thousand words the limit of the article but with my idea only half worked out  the next night under the same conditions i continued adding another two thousand words before i finished and then the third night i spent in cutting out the excess so as to bring the article within the conditions of the contest  the first prize came to me and the second and third went to students of the stanford and berkeley universities  my success in the san francisco call competition seriously turned my thoughts to writing but my blood was still too hot for a settled routine so i practically deferred literature beyond writing a little gush for the call which that journal promptly rejected  i tramped all through the united states from california to boston and up and down returning to the pacific coast by way of canada where i got into jail and served a term for vagrancy and the whole tramping experience made me become a socialist  previously i had been impressed by the dignity of labour and without having read carlyle or kipling i had formulated a gospel of work which put theirs in the shade  work was everything  it was sanctification and salvation  the pride i took in a hard days work well done would be inconceivable to you  i was as faithful a wageslave as ever a capitalist exploited  in short my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics  i had fought my way from the open west where men bucked big and the job hunted the man to the congested labour centres of the eastern states where men were small potatoes and hunted the job for all they were worth and i found myself looking upon life from a new and totally different angle  i saw the workers in the shambles at the bottom of the social pit  i swore i would never again do a hard days work with my body except where absolutely compelled to and i have been busy ever since running away from hard bodily labour  in my nineteenth year i returned to oakland and started at the high school which ran the usual school magazine  this publication was a weeklyno i guess a monthlyone and i wrote stories for it very little imaginary just recitals of my sea and tramping experiences  i remained there a year doing janitor work as a means of livelihood and leaving eventually because the strain was more than i could bear  at this time my socialistic utterances had attracted considerable attention and i was known as the boy socialist a distinction that brought about my arrest for streettalking  after leaving the high school in three months cramming by myself i took the three years work for that time and entered the university of california  i hated to give up the hope of a university education and worked in a laundry and with my pen to help me keep on  this was the only time i worked because i loved it but the task was too much and when halfway through my freshman year i had to quit  i worked away ironing shirts and other things in the laundry and wrote in all my spare time  i tried to keep on at both but often fell asleep with the pen in my hand  then i left the laundry and wrote all the time and lived and dreamed again  after three months trial i gave up writing having decided that i was a failure and left for the klondike to prospect for gold  at the end of the year owing to the outbreak of scurvy i was compelled to come out and on the homeward journey of 1900 miles in an open boat made the only notes of the trip  it was in the klondike i found myself  there nobody talks  everybody thinks  you get your true perspective  i got mine  while i was in the klondike my father died and the burden of the family fell on my shoulders  times were bad in california and i could get no work  while trying for it i wrote down the river which was rejected during the wait for this rejection i wrote a twentythousand word serial for a news company which was also rejected  pending each rejection i still kept on writing fresh stuff  i did not know what an editor looked like  i did not know a soul who had ever published anything  finally a story was accepted by a californian magazine for which i received five dollars  soon afterwards the black cat offered me forty dollars for a story  then things took a turn and i shall probably not have to shovel coal for a living for some time to come although i have done it and could do it again  my first book was published in 1900  i could have made a good deal at newspaper work but i had sufficient sense to refuse to be a slave to that mankilling machine for such i held a newspaper to be to a young man in his forming period  not until i was well on my feet as a magazine writer did i do much work for newspapers  i am a believer in regular work and never wait for an inspiration  temperamentally i am not only careless and irregular but melancholy still i have fought both down the discipline i had as a sailor had full effect on me  perhaps my old sea days are also responsible for the regularity and limitations of my sleep  five and a half hours is the precise average i allow myself and no circumstance has yet arisen in my life that could keep me awake when the time comes to turn in  i am very fond of sport and delight in boxing fencing swimming riding yachting and even kiteflying  although primarily of the city i like to be near it rather than in it  the country though is the best the only natural life  in my grownup years the writers who have influenced me most are karl marx in a particular and spencer in a general way  in the days of my barren boyhood if i had had a chance i would have gone in for music now in what are more genuinely the days of my youth if i had a million or two i would devote myself to writing poetry and pamphlets  i think the best work i have done is in the league of the old men and parts of the kemptonwace letters  other people dont like the former  they prefer brighter and more cheerful things  perhaps i shall feel like that too when the days of my youth are behind me     footnotes   1  malahininewcomer
