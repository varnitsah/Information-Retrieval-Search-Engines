impression 1985  printed and bound in great britain by william clowes limited beccles and london     illustration  once upon a time there was a pussycat called ribby who invited a little dog called duchess to tea  come in good time my dear duchess said ribbys letter and we will have something so very nice i am baking it in a piedisha piedish with a pink rim you never tasted anything so good and you shall eat it all i will eat muffins my dear duchess wrote ribby  duchess read the letter and wrote an answeri will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four but it is very strange i was just going to invite you to come here to supper my dear ribby to eat something most delicious  i will come very punctually my dear ribby wrote duchess and then at the end she addedi hope it isnt mouse  illustration the invitation  and then she thought that did not look quite polite so she scratched out isnt mouse and changed it to i hope it will be fine and she gave her letter to the postman  but she thought a great deal about ribbys pie and she read ribbys letter over and over again  i am dreadfully afraid it will be mouse said duchess to herselfi really couldnt couldnt eat mouse pie and i shall have to eat it because it is a party and my pie was going to be veal and ham a pink and white piedish and so is mine just like ribbys dishes they were both bought at tabitha twitchits  duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it  illustration  it is all ready to put into the oven such lovely piecrust and i put in a little tin pattypan to hold up the crust and i made a hole in the middle with a fork to let out the steamoh i do wish i could eat my own pie instead of a pie made of mouse  duchess considered and considered and read ribbys letter again  a pink and white piedishand you shall eat it all you means methen ribby is not going to even taste the pie herself a pink and white piedish ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins oh what a good idea why shouldnt i rush along and put my pie into ribbys oven when ribby isnt there  illustration  duchess was quite delighted with her own cleverness  ribby in the meantime had received duchesss answer and as soon as she was sure that the little dog could comeshe popped her pie into the oven there were two ovens one above the other some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open ribby put the pie into the lower oven the door was very stiff  the top oven bakes too quickly said ribby to herself it is a pie of the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon and i have taken out all the bones because duchess did nearly choke herself with a fishbone last time i gave a party she eats a little fastrather big mouthfuls but a most genteel and elegant little dog infinitely superior company to cousin tabitha twitchit  illustration the pie made of mouse  ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth then she went out with a can to the well for water to fill up the kettle  then she began to set the room in order for it was the sittingroom as well as the kitchen she shook the mats out at the frontdoor and put them straight the hearthrug was a rabbitskin she dusted the clock and the ornaments on the mantelpiece and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs  then she spread a very clean white tablecloth and set out her best china teaset which she took out of a wallcupboard near the fireplace the teacups were white with a pattern of pink roses and the dinnerplates were white and blue  illustration  when ribby had laid the table she took a jug and a blue and white dish and went out down the field to the farm to fetch milk and butter  when she came back she peeped into the bottom oven the pie looked very comfortable  ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket to the village shop to buy a packet of tea a pound of lump sugar and a pot of marmalade  and just at the same time duchess came out of her house at the other end of the village  illustration the veal and ham pie  ribby met duchess halfway down the street also carrying a basket covered with a cloth they only bowed to one another they did not speak because they were going to have a party  as soon as duchess had got round the corner out of sightshe simply ran straight away to ribbys house  illustration  ribby went into the shop and bought what she required and came out after a pleasant gossip with cousin tabitha twitchit  illustration  cousin tabitha was disdainful afterwards in conversation  a little dog indeed just as if there were no cats in sawrey and a pie for afternoon tea the very idea said cousin tabitha twitchit  ribby went on to timothy bakers and bought the muffins then she went home  there seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage as she was coming in at the front door  i trust that is not that pie the spoons are locked up however said ribby  but there was nobody there ribby opened the bottom oven door with some difficulty and turned the pie there began to be a pleasing smell of baked mouse  illustration where is the pie made of mouse  duchess in the meantime had slipped out at the back door  it is a very odd thing that ribbys pie was not in the oven when i put mine in and i cant find it anywhere i have looked all over the house i put my pie into a nice hot oven at the top i could not turn any of the other handles i think that they are all shams said duchess but i wish i could have removed the pie made of mouse i cannot think what she has done with it i heard ribby coming and i had to run out by the back door  illustration  duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for ribby and passed the time until the clock struck four  ribbyhaving assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larderwent upstairs to change her dress  she put on a lilac silk gown for the party and an embroidered muslin apron and tippet  it is very strange said ribby i did not think i left that drawer pulled out has somebody been trying on my mittens  she came downstairs again and made the tea and put the teapot on the hob she peeped again into the bottom oven the pie had become a lovely brown and it was steaming hot  illustration ready for the party  she sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog i am glad i used the bottom oven said ribby the top one would certainly have been very much too hot i wonder why that cupboard door was open can there really have been someone in the house  very punctually at four oclock duchess started to go to the party she ran so fast through the village that she was too early and she had to wait a little while in the lane that leads down to ribbys house  i wonder if ribby has taken my pie out of the oven yet said duchess and whatever can have become of the other pie made of mouse  illustration  at a quarter past four to the minute there came a most genteel little taptappity is mrs ribston at home inquired duchess in the porch  come in and how do you do my dear duchess cried ribby i hope i see you well  quite well i thank you and how do you do my dear ribby said duchess ive brought you some flowers what a delicious smell of pie  illustration duchess in the porch  oh what lovely flowers yes it is mouse and bacon  do not talk about food my dear ribby said duchess what a lovely white teacloth is it done to a turn is it still in the oven  i think it wants another five minutes said ribby just a shade longer i will pour out the tea while we wait do you take sugar my dear duchess  oh yes please my dear ribby and may i have a lump upon my nose  with pleasure my dear duchess how beautifully you beg oh how sweetly pretty  illustration  duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed  how good that pie smells i do love veal and hami mean to say mouse and bacon  illustration  she dropped the sugar in confusion and had to go hunting under the teatable so did not see which oven ribby opened in order to get out the pie  ribby set the pie upon the table there was a very savoury smell  duchess came out from under the tablecloth munching sugar and sat up on a chair  i will first cut the pie for you i am going to have muffin and marmalade said ribby  do you really prefer muffin mind the pattypan  illustration  i beg your pardon said ribby  may i pass you the marmalade said duchess hurriedly  the pie proved extremely toothsome and the muffins light and hot they disappeared rapidly especially the pie  i thinkthought the duchess to herselfi think it would be wiser if i helped myself to pie though ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it what very small fine pieces it has cooked into i did not remember that i had minced it up so fine i suppose this is a quicker oven than my own  illustration  how fast duchess is eating thought ribby to herself as she buttered her fifth muffin  illustration  the piedish was emptying rapidly duchess had had four helps already and was fumbling with the spoon a little more bacon my dear duchess said ribby  thank you my dear ribby i was only feeling for the pattypan  illustration where is the pattypan  the pattypan my dear duchess  the pattypan that held up the piecrust said duchess blushing under her black coat  oh i didnt put one in my dear duchess said ribby i dont think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse  duchess fumbled with the spooni cant find it she said anxiously  there isnt a pattypan said ribby looking perplexed  yes indeed my dear ribby where can it have gone to said duchess  illustration  there most certainly is not one my dear duchess i disapprove of tin articles in puddings and pies it is most undesirableespecially when people swallow in lumps she added in a lower voice  duchess looked very much alarmed and continued to scoop the inside of the piedish  my greataunt squintina grandmother of cousin tabitha twitchitdied of a thimble in a christmas plumpudding i never put any article of metal in my puddings or pies  duchess looked aghast and tilted up the piedish  i have only four pattypans and they are all in the cupboard  duchess set up a howl  i shall die i shall die i have swallowed a pattypan oh my dear ribby i do feel so ill  it is impossible my dear duchess there was not a pattypan  duchess moaned and whined and rocked herself about  oh i feel so dreadful i have swallowed a pattypan  there was nothing in the pie said ribby severely  yes there was my dear ribby i am sure i have swallowed it  let me prop you up with a pillow my dear duchess where do you think you feel it  oh i do feel so ill all over me my dear ribby i have swallowed a large tin pattypan with a sharp scalloped edge  illustration  shall i run for the doctor i will just lock up the spoons  oh yes yes fetch dr maggotty my dear ribby he is a pie himself he will certainly understand  ribby settled duchess in an armchair before the fire and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor  she found him at the smithy  he was occupied in putting rusty nails into a bottle of ink which he had obtained at the post office  gammon ha ha said he with his head on one side  ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a pattypan  spinach ha ha said he and accompanied her with alacrity  illustration dr maggottys mixture  he hopped so fast that ribby had to run it was most conspicuous all the village could see that ribby was fetching the doctor  i knew they would overeat themselves said cousin tabitha twitchit  illustration  but while ribby had been hunting for the doctora curious thing had happened to duchess who had been left by herself sitting before the fire sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy  how could i have swallowed it such a large thing as a pattypan  she got up and went to the table and felt inside the piedish again with a spoon  no there is no pattypan and i put one in and nobody has eaten pie except me so i must have swallowed it  illustration  she sat down again and stared mournfully at the grate the fire crackled and danced and something sizzzzled  duchess started she opened the door of the top oven out came a rich steamy flavour of veal and ham and there stood a fine brown pieand through a hole in the top of the piecrust there was a glimpse of a little tin pattypan  duchess drew a long breath  then i must have been eating mouse no wonder i feel ill but perhaps i should feel worse if i had really swallowed a pattypan duchess reflectedwhat a very awkward thing to have to explain to ribby i think i will put my pie in the backyard and say nothing about it when i go home i will run round and take it away she put it outside the backdoor and sat down again by the fire and shut her eyes when ribby arrived with the doctor she seemed fast asleep  illustration  gammon ha ha said the doctor  i am feeling very much better said duchess waking up with a jump  i am truly glad to hear it he has brought you a pill my dear duchess  i think i should feel quite well if he only felt my pulse said duchess backing away from the magpie who sidled up with something in his beak  it is only a bread pill you had much better take it drink a little milk my dear duchess  gammon gammon said the doctor while duchess coughed and choked  dont say that again said ribby losing her temperhere take this bread and jam and get out into the yard  illustration  gammon and spinach ha ha ha shouted dr maggotty triumphantly outside the back door  i am feeling very much better my dear ribby said duchess do you not think that i had better go home before it gets dark  perhaps it might be wise my dear duchess i will lend you a nice warm shawl and you shall take my arm  i would not trouble you for worlds i feel wonderfully better one pill of dr maggotty  indeed it is most admirable if it has cured you of a pattypan i will call directly after breakfast to ask how you have slept  ribby and duchess said goodbye affectionately and duchess started home halfway up the lane she stopped and looked back ribby had gone in and shut her door duchess slipped through the fence and ran round to the back of ribbys house and peeped into the yard  upon the roof of the pigstye sat dr maggotty and three jackdaws the jackdaws were eating piecrust and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a pattypan  gammon ha ha he shouted when he saw duchesss little black nose peeping round the corner  duchess ran home feeling uncommonly silly  when ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the teathings she found a pink and white piedish lying smashed in the middle of the yard the pattypan was under the pump where dr maggotty had considerately left it  illustration so there really was a pattypan  ribby stared with amazementdid you ever see the like so there really was a pattypan but my pattypans are all in the kitchen cupboard well i never did next time i want to give a partyi will invite cousin tabitha twitchit  illustration
