79634860	the adventures of captain bonneville  digested from his journal  by washington irving   originally published in 1837     introductory notice   while engaged in writing an account of the grand enterprise of astoria it was my practice to seek all kinds of oral information connected with the subject nowhere did i pick up more interesting particulars than at the table of mr john jacob astor who being the patriarch of the fur trade in the united states was accustomed to have at his board various persons of adventurous turn some of whom had been engaged in his own great undertaking others on their own account had made expeditions to the rocky mountains and the waters of the columbia  among these personages one who peculiarly took my fancy was captain bonneville of the united states army who in a rambling kind of enterprise had strangely ingrafted the trapper and hunter upon the soldier as his expeditions and adventures will form the leading theme of the following pages a few biographical particulars concerning him may not be unacceptable  captain bonneville is of french parentage his father was a worthy old emigrant who came to this country many years since and took up his abode in new york he is represented as a man not much calculated for the sordid struggle of a moneymaking world but possessed of a happy temperament a festivity of imagination and a simplicity of heart that made him proof against its rubs and trials he was an excellent scholar well acquainted with latin and greek and fond of the modern classics his book was his elysium once immersed in the pages of voltaire corneille or racine or of his favorite english author shakespeare he forgot the world and all its concerns often would he be seen in summer weather seated under one of the trees on the battery or the portico of st pauls church in broadway his bald head uncovered his hat lying by his side his eyes riveted to the page of his book and his whole soul so engaged as to lose all consciousness of the passing throng or the passing hour  captain bonneville it will be found inherited something of his fathers bonhommie and his excitable imagination though the latter was somewhat disciplined in early years by mathematical studies he was educated at our national military academy at west point where he acquitted himself very creditably thence he entered the army in which he has ever since continued  the nature of our military service took him to the frontier where for a number of years he was stationed at various posts in the far west here he was brought into frequent intercourse with indian traders mountain trappers and other pioneers of the wilderness and became so excited by their tales of wild scenes and wild adventures and their accounts of vast and magnificent regions as yet unexplored that an expedition to the rocky mountains became the ardent desire of his heart and an enterprise to explore untrodden tracts the leading object of his ambition  by degrees he shaped his vague daydream into a practical reality having made himself acquainted with all the requisites for a trading enterprise beyond the mountains he determined to undertake it a leave of absence and a sanction of his expedition was obtained from the major general in chief on his offering to combine public utility with his private projects and to collect statistical information for the war department concerning the wild countries and wild tribes he might visit in the course of his journeyings  nothing now was wanting to the darling project of the captain but the ways and means the expedition would require an outfit of many thousand dollars a staggering obstacle to a soldier whose capital is seldom any thing more than his sword full of that buoyant hope however which belongs to the sanguine temperament he repaired to newyork the great focus of american enterprise where there are always funds ready for any scheme however chimerical or romantic here he had the good fortune to meet with a gentleman of high respectability and influence who had been his associate in boyhood and who cherished a schoolfellow friendship for him he took a general interest in the scheme of the captain introduced him to commercial men of his acquaintance and in a little while an association was formed and the necessary funds were raised to carry the proposed measure into effect one of the most efficient persons in this association was mr alfred seton who when quite a youth had accompanied one of the expeditions sent out by mr astor to his commercial establishments on the columbia and had distinguished himself by his activity and courage at one of the interior posts mr seton was one of the american youths who were at astoria at the time of its surrender to the british and who manifested such grief and indignation at seeing the flag of their country hauled down the hope of seeing that flag once more planted on the shores of the columbia may have entered into his motives for engaging in the present enterprise  thus backed and provided captain bonneville undertook his expedition into the far west and was soon beyond the rocky mountains year after year elapsed without his return the term of his leave of absence expired yet no report was made of him at head quarters at washington he was considered virtually dead or lost and his name was stricken from the army list  it was in the autumn of 1835 at the country seat of mr john jacob astor at hellgate that i first met with captain bonneville he was then just returned from a residence of upwards of three years among the mountains and was on his way to report himself at head quarters in the hopes of being reinstated in the service from all that i could learn his wanderings in the wilderness though they had gratified his curiosity and his love of adventure had not much benefited his fortunes like corporal trim in his campaigns he had satisfied the sentiment and that was all in fact he was too much of the frank freehearted soldier and had inherited too much of his fathers temperament to make a scheming trapper or a thrifty bargainer  there was something in the whole appearance of the captain that prepossessed me in his favor he was of the middle size well made and well set and a military frock of foreign cut that had seen service gave him a look of compactness his countenance was frank open and engaging well browned by the sun and had something of a french expression he had a pleasant black eye a high forehead and while he kept his hat on the look of a man in the jocund prime of his days but the moment his head was uncovered a bald crown gained him credit for a few more years than he was really entitled to  being extremely curious at the time about every thing connected with the far west i addressed numerous questions to him they drew from him a number of extremely striking details which were given with mingled modesty and frankness and in a gentleness of manner and a soft tone of voice contrasting singularly with the wild and often startling nature of his themes it was difficult to conceive the mild quietlooking personage before you the actual hero of the stirring scenes related  in the course of three or four months happening to be at the city of washington i again came upon the captain who was attending the slow adjustment of his affairs with the war department i found him quartered with a worthy brother in arms a major in the army here he was writing at a table covered with maps and papers in the centre of a large barrack room fancifully decorated with indian arms and trophies and war dresses and the skins of various wild animals and hung round with pictures of indian games and ceremonies and scenes of war and hunting in a word the captain was beguiling the tediousness of attendance at court by an attempt at authorship and was rewriting and extending his travelling notes and making maps of the regions he had explored as he sat at the table in this curious apartment with his high bald head of somewhat foreign cast he reminded me of some of those antique pictures of authors that i have seen in old spanish volumes  the result of his labors was a mass of manuscript which he subsequently put at my disposal to fit it for publication and bring it before the world i found it full of interesting details of life among the mountains and of the singular castes and races both white men and red men among whom he had sojourned it bore too throughout the impress of his character his bonhommie his kindliness of spirit and his susceptibility to the grand and beautiful  that manuscript has formed the staple of the following work i have occasionally interwoven facts and details gathered from various sources especially from the conversations and journals of some of the captains contemporaries who were actors in the scenes he describes i have also given it a tone and coloring drawn from my own observation during an excursion into the indian country beyond the bounds of civilization as i before observed however the work is substantially the narrative of the worthy captain and many of its most graphic passages are but little varied from his own language  i shall conclude this notice by a dedication which he had made of his manuscript to his hospitable brother in arms in whose quarters i found him occupied in his literary labors it is a dedication which i believe possesses the qualities not always found in complimentary documents of the kind of being sincere and being merited  to james harvey hook major u s a whose jealousy of its honor whose anxiety for its interests and whose sensibility for its wants have endeared him to the service as the soldiers friend and whose general amenity constant cheerfulness disinterested hospitality and unwearied benevolence entitle him to the still loftier title of the friend of man this work is inscribed etc   washington irving     1       state of the fur

john jacob astor to establish an american emporium for the fur trade at the mouth of the columbia or oregon river of the failure of that enterprise through the capture of astoria by the british in 1814 and of the way in which the control of the trade of the columbia and its dependencies fell into the hands of the northwest company we have stated likewise the unfortunate supineness of the american government in neglecting the application of mr astor for the protection of the american flag and a small military force to enable him to reinstate himself in the possession of astoria at the return of peace when the post was formally given up by the british government though still occupied by the northwest company by that supineness the sovereignty in the country has been virtually lost to the united states and it will cost both governments much trouble and difficulty to settle matters on that just and rightful footing on which they would readily have been placed had the proposition of mr astor been attended to we shall now state a few particulars of subsequent events so as to lead the reader up to the period of which we are about to treat and to prepare him for the circumstances of our narrative  in consequence of the apathy and neglect of the american government mr astor abandoned all thoughts of regaining astoria and made no further attempt to extend his enterprises beyond the rocky mountains and the northwest company considered themselves the lords of the country they did not long enjoy unmolested the sway which they had somewhat surreptitiously attained a fierce competition ensued between them and their old rivals the hudsons bay company which was carried on at great cost and sacrifice and occasionally with the loss of life it ended in the ruin of most of the partners of the northwest company and the merging of the relics of that establishment in 1821 in the rival association from that time the hudsons bay company enjoyed a monopoly of the indian trade from the coast of the pacific to the rocky mountains and for a considerable extent north and south they removed their emporium from astoria to fort vancouver a strong post on the left bank of the columbia river about sixty miles from its mouth whence they furnished their interior posts and sent forth their brigades of trappers  the rocky mountains formed a vast barrier between them and the united states and their stern and awful defiles their rugged valleys and the great western plains watered by their rivers remained almost a terra incognita to the american trapper the difficulties experienced in 1808 by mr henry of the missouri company the first american who trapped upon the headwaters of the columbia and the frightful hardships sustained by wilson p hunt ramsay crooks robert stuart and other intrepid astorians in their illfated expeditions across the mountains appeared for a time to check all further enterprise in that direction the american traders contented themselves with following up the head branches of the missouri the yellowstone and other rivers and streams on the atlantic side of the mountains but forbore to attempt those great snowcrowned sierras  one of the first to revive these tramontane expeditions was general ashley of missouri a man whose courage and achievements in the prosecution of his enterprises have rendered him famous in the far west in conjunction with mr henry already mentioned he established a post on the banks of the yellowstone river in 1822 and in the following year pushed a resolute band of trappers across the mountains to the banks of the green river or colorado of the west often known by the indian name of the seedskedee agie this attempt was followed up and sustained by others until in 1825 a footing was secured and a complete system of trapping organized beyond the mountains  it is difficult to do justice to the courage fortitude and perseverance of the pioneers of the fur trade who conducted these early expeditions and first broke their way through a wilderness where everything was calculated to deter and dismay them they had to traverse the most dreary and desolate mountains and barren and trackless wastes uninhabited by man or occasionally infested by predatory and cruel savages they knew nothing of the country beyond the verge of their horizon and had to gather information as they wandered they beheld volcanic plains stretching around them and ranges of mountains piled up to the clouds and glistening with eternal frost but knew nothing of their defiles nor how they were to be penetrated or traversed they launched themselves in frail canoes on rivers without knowing whither their swift currents would carry them or what rocks and shoals and rapids they might encounter in their course they had to be continually on the alert too against the mountain tribes who beset every defile laid ambuscades in their path or attacked them in their night encampments so that of the hardy bands of trappers that first entered into these regions threefifths are said to have fallen by the hands of savage foes  in this wild and warlike school a number of leaders have sprung up originally in the employ subsequently partners of ashley among these we may mention smith fitzpatrick bridger robert campbell and william sublette whose adventures and exploits partake of the wildest spirit of romance the association commenced by general ashley underwent various modifications that gentleman having acquired sufficient fortune sold out his interest and retired and the leading spirit that succeeded him was captain william sublette a man worthy of note as his name has become renowned in frontier story he is a native of kentucky and of game descent his maternal grandfather colonel wheatley a companion of boon having been one of the pioneers of the west celebrated in indian warfare and killed in one of the contests of the bloody ground we shall frequently have occasion to speak of this sublette and always to the credit of his game qualities in 1830 the association took the name of the rocky mountain fur company of which captain sublette and robert campbell were prominent members  in the meantime the success of this company attracted the attention and excited the emulation of the american fur company and brought them once more into the field of their ancient enterprise mr astor the founder of the association had retired from busy life and the concerns of the company were ably managed by mr ramsay crooks of snake river renown who still officiates as its president a competition immediately ensued between the two companies for the trade with the mountain tribes and the trapping of the headwaters of the columbia and the other great tributaries of the pacific beside the regular operations of these formidable rivals there have been from time to time desultory enterprises or rather experiments of minor associations or of adventurous individuals beside roving bands of independent trappers who either hunt for themselves or engage for a single season in the service of one or other of the main companies  the consequence is that the rocky mountains and the ulterior regions from the russian possessions in the north down to the spanish settlements of california have been traversed and ransacked in every direction by bands of hunters and indian traders so that there is scarcely a mountain pass or defile that is not known and threaded in their restless migrations nor a nameless stream that is not haunted by the lonely trapper  the american fur companies keep no established posts beyond the mountains everything there is regulated by resident partners that is to say partners who reside in the tramontane country but who move about from place to place either with indian tribes whose traffic they wish to monopolize or with main bodies of their own men whom they employ in trading and trapping in the meantime they detach bands or brigades as they are termed of trappers in various directions assigning to each a portion of country as a hunting or trapping ground in the months of june and july when there is an interval between the hunting seasons a general rendezvous is held at some designated place in the mountains where the affairs of the past year are settled by the resident partners and the plans for the following year arranged  to this rendezvous repair the various brigades of trappers from their widely separated hunting grounds bringing in the products of their years campaign hither also repair the indian tribes accustomed to traffic their peltries with the company bands of free trappers resort hither also to sell the furs they have collected or to engage their services for the next hunting season  to this rendezvous the company sends annually a convoy of supplies from its establishment on the atlantic frontier under the guidance of some experienced partner or officer on the arrival of this convoy the resident partner at the rendezvous depends to set all his next years machinery in motion  now as the rival companies keep a vigilant eye upon each other and are anxious to discover each others plans and movements they generally contrive to hold their annual assemblages at no great distance apart an eager competition exists also between their respective convoys of supplies which shall first reach its place of rendezvous for this purpose they set off with the first appearance of grass on the atlantic frontier and push with all diligence for the mountains the company that can first open its tempting supplies of coffee tobacco ammunition scarlet cloth blankets bright shawls and glittering trinkets has the greatest chance to get all the peltries and furs of the indians and free trappers and to engage their services for the next season it is able also to fit out and dispatch its own trappers the soonest so as to get the start of its competitors and to have the first dash into the hunting and trapping grounds  a new species of strategy has sprung out of this hunting and trapping competition the constant study of the rival bands is to forestall and outwit each other to supplant each other in the good will and custom of the indian tribes to cross each others plans to mislead each other as to routes in a word next to his own advantage the study of the indian trader is the disadvantage of his competitor  the influx of this wandering trade has had its effects on the habits of the mountain tribes they have found the trapping of the beaver their most profitable species of hunting and the traffic with the white man has opened to them sources of luxury of which they previously had no idea the introduction of firearms has rendered them more successful hunters but at the same time more formidable foes some of them incorrigibly savage and warlike in their nature have found the expeditions of the fur traders grand objects of profitable adventure to waylay and harass a band of trappers with their packhorses when embarrassed in the rugged defiles of the mountains has become as favorite an exploit with these indians as the plunder of a caravan to the arab of the desert the crows and blackfeet who were such terrors in the path of the early adventurers to astoria still continue their predatory habits but seem to have brought them to greater system they know the routes and resorts of the trappers where to waylay them on their journeys where to find them in the hunting seasons and where to hover about them in winter quarters the life of a trapper therefore is a perpetual state militant and he must sleep with his weapons in his hands  a new order of trappers and traders also has grown out of this system of things in the old times of the great northwest company when the trade in furs was pursued chiefly about the lakes and rivers the expeditions were carried on in batteaux and canoes the voyageurs or boatmen were the rank and file in the service of the trader and even the hardy men of the north those great rufflers and game birds were fain to be paddled from point to point of their migrations  a totally different class has now sprung upthe mountaineers the traders and trappers that scale the vast mountain chains and pursue their hazardous vocations amidst their wild recesses they move from place to place on horseback the equestrian exercises therefore in which they are engaged the nature of the countries they traverse vast plains and mountains pure and exhilarating in atmospheric qualities seem to make them physically and mentally a more lively and mercurial race than the fur traders and trappers of former days the selfvaunting men of the north a man who bestrides a horse must be essentially different from a man who cowers in a canoe we find them accordingly hardy lithe vigorous and active extravagant in word and thought and deed heedless of hardship daring of danger prodigal of the present and thoughtless of the future  a difference is to be perceived even between these mountain hunters and those of the lower regions along the waters of the missouri the latter generally french creoles live comfortably in cabins and loghuts well sheltered from the inclemencies of the seasons they are within the reach of frequent supplies from the settlements their life is comparatively free from danger and from most of the vicissitudes of the upper wilderness the consequence is that they are less hardy selfdependent and gamespirited than the mountaineer if the latter by chance comes among them on his way to and from the settlements he is like a gamecock among the common roosters of the poultryyard accustomed to live in tents or to bivouac in the open air he despises the comforts and is impatient of the confinement of the loghouse if his meal is not ready in season he takes his rifle hies to the forest or prairie shoots his own game lights his fire and cooks his repast with his horse and his rifle he is independent of the world and spurns at all its restraints the very superintendents at the lower posts will not put him to mess with the common men the hirelings of the establishment but treat him as something superior  there is perhaps no class of men on the face of the earth says captain bonneville who lead a life of more continued exertion peril and excitement and who are more enamored of their occupations than the free trappers of the west no toil no danger no privation can turn the trapper from his pursuit his passionate excitement at times resembles a mania in vain may the most vigilant and cruel savages beset his path in vain may rocks and precipices and wintry torrents oppose his progress let but a single track of a beaver meet his eye and he forgets all dangers and defies all difficulties at times he may be seen with his traps on his shoulder buffeting his way across rapid streams amidst floating blocks of ice at other times he is to be found with his traps swung on his back clambering the most rugged mountains scaling or descending the most frightful precipices searching by routes inaccessible to the horse and never before trodden by white man for springs and lakes unknown to his comrades and where he may meet with his favorite game such is the mountaineer the hardy trapper of the west and such as we have slightly sketched it is the wild robin hood kind of life with all its strange and motley populace now existing in full vigor among the rocky mountains  having thus given the reader some idea of the actual state of the fur trade in the interior of our vast continent and made him acquainted with the wild chivalry of the mountains we will no longer delay the introduction of captain bonneville and his band into this field of their enterprise but launch them at once upon the perilous plains of the far west     2       departure fromfort osagemodes of transportationpack      horseswagonswalker and cerre their charactersbuoyant      feelings on launching upon the

first of may 1832 that captain bonneville took his departure from the frontier post of fort osage on the missouri he had enlisted a party of one hundred and ten men most of whom had been in the indian country and some of whom were experienced hunters and trappers fort osage and other places on the borders of the western wilderness abound with characters of the kind ready for any expedition  the ordinary mode of transportation in these great inland expeditions of the fur traders is on mules and packhorses but captain bonneville substituted wagons though he was to travel through a trackless wilderness yet the greater part of his route would lie across open plains destitute of forests and where wheel carriages can pass in every direction the chief difficulty occurs in passing the deep ravines cut through the prairies by streams and winter torrents here it is often necessary to dig a road down the banks and to make bridges for the wagons  in transporting his baggage in vehicles of this kind captain bonneville thought he would save the great delay caused every morning by packing the horses and the labor of unpacking in the evening fewer horses also would be required and less risk incurred of their wandering away or being frightened or carried off by the indians the wagons also would be more easily defended and might form a kind of fortification in case of attack in the open prairies a train of twenty wagons drawn by oxen or by four mules or horses each and laden with merchandise ammunition and provisions were disposed in two columns in the center of the party which was equally divided into a van and a rearguard as subleaders or lieutenants in his expedition captain bonneville had made choice of mr j r walker and mr m s cerre the former was a native of tennessee about six feet high strong built dark complexioned brave in spirit though mild in manners he had resided for many years in missouri on the frontier had been among the earliest adventurers to santa fe where he went to trap beaver and was taken by the spaniards being liberated he engaged with the spaniards and sioux indians in a war against the pawnees then returned to missouri and had acted by turns as sheriff trader trapper until he was enlisted as a leader by captain bonneville  cerre his other leader had likewise been in expeditions to santa fe in which he had endured much hardship he was of the middle size light complexioned and though but about twentyfive years of age was considered an experienced indian trader it was a great object with captain bonneville to get to the mountains before the summer heats and summer flies should render the travelling across the prairies distressing and before the annual assemblages of people connected with the fur trade should have broken up and dispersed to the hunting grounds  the two rival associations already mentioned the american fur company and the rocky mountain fur company had their several places of rendezvous for the present year at no great distance apart in pierres hole a deep valley in the heart of the mountains and thither captain bonneville intended to shape his course  it is not easy to do justice to the exulting feelings of the worthy captain at finding himself at the head of a stout band of hunters trappers and woodmen fairly launched on the broad prairies with his face to the boundless west the tamest inhabitant of cities the veriest spoiled child of civilization feels his heart dilate and his pulse beat high on finding himself on horseback in the glorious wilderness what then must be the excitement of one whose imagination had been stimulated by a residence on the frontier and to whom the wilderness was a region of romance  his hardy followers partook of his excitement most of them had already experienced the wild freedom of savage life and looked forward to a renewal of past scenes of adventure and exploit their very appearance and equipment exhibited a piebald mixture half civilized and half savage many of them looked more like indians than white men in their garbs and accoutrements and their very horses were caparisoned in barbaric style with fantastic trappings the outset of a band of adventurers on one of these expeditions is always animated and joyous the welkin rang with their shouts and yelps after the manner of the savages and with boisterous jokes and lighthearted laughter as they passed the straggling hamlets and solitary cabins that fringe the skirts of the frontier they would startle their inmates by indian yells and warwhoops or regale them with grotesque feats of horsemanship well suited to their halfsavage appearance most of these abodes were inhabited by men who had themselves been in similar expeditions they welcomed the travellers therefore as brother trappers treated them with a hunters hospitality and cheered them with an honest god speed at parting  and here we would remark a great difference in point of character and quality between the two classes of trappers the american and french as they are called in contradistinction the latter is meant to designate the french creole of canada or louisiana the former the trapper of the old american stock from kentucky tennessee and others of the western states the french trapper is represented as a lighter softer more selfindulgent kind of man he must have his indian wife his lodge and his petty conveniences he is gay and thoughtless takes little heed of landmarks depends upon his leaders and companions to think for the common weal and if left to himself is easily perplexed and lost  the american trapper stands by himself and is peerless for the service of the wilderness drop him in the midst of a prairie or in the heart of the mountains and he is never at a loss he notices every landmark can retrace his route through the most monotonous plains or the most perplexed labyrinths of the mountains no danger nor difficulty can appal him and he scorns to complain under any privation in equipping the two kinds of trappers the creole and canadian are apt to prefer the light fusee the american always grasps his rifle he despises what he calls the shotgun we give these estimates on the authority of a trader of long experience and a foreigner by birth i consider one american said he equal to three canadians in point of sagacity aptness at resources selfdependence and fearlessness of spirit in fact no one can cope with him as a stark tramper of the wilderness  beside the two classes of trappers just mentioned captain bonneville had enlisted several delaware indians in his employ on whose hunting qualifications he placed great reliance  on the 6th of may the travellers passed the last border habitation and bade a long farewell to the ease and security of civilization the buoyant and clamorous spirits with which they had commenced their march gradually subsided as they entered upon its difficulties they found the prairies saturated with the heavy cold rains prevalent in certain seasons of the year in this part of the country the wagon wheels sank deep in the mire the horses were often to the fetlock and both steed and rider were completely jaded by the evening of the 12th when they reached the kansas river a fine stream about three hundred yards wide entering the missouri from the south though fordable in almost every part at the end of summer and during the autumn yet it was necessary to construct a raft for the transportation of the wagons and effects all this was done in the course of the following day and by evening the whole party arrived at the agency of the kansas tribe this was under the superintendence of general clarke brother of the celebrated traveller of the same name who with lewis made the first expedition down the waters of the columbia he was living like a patriarch surrounded by laborers and interpreters all snugly housed and provided with excellent farms the functionary next in consequence to the agent was the blacksmith a most important and indeed indispensable personage in a frontier community the kansas resemble the osages in features dress and language they raise corn and hunt the buffalo ranging the kansas river and its tributary streams at the time of the captains visit they were at war with the pawnees of the nebraska or platte river  the unusual sight of a train of wagons caused quite a sensation among these savages who thronged about the caravan examining everything minutely and asking a thousand questions exhibiting a degree of excitability and a lively curiosity totally opposite to that apathy with which their race is so often reproached  the personage who most attracted the captains attention at this place was white plume the kansas chief and they soon became good friends white plume we are pleased with his chivalrous soubriquet inhabited a large stone house built for him by order of the american government but the establishment had not been carried out in corresponding style it might be palace without but it was wigwam within so that between the stateliness of his mansion and the squalidness of his furniture the gallant white plume presented some such whimsical incongruity as we see in the gala equipments of an indian chief on a treatymaking embassy at washington who has been generously decked out in cocked hat and military coat in contrast to his breechclout and leathern legging being grand officer at top and ragged indian at bottom  white plume was so taken with the courtesy of the captain and pleased with one or two presents received from him that he accompanied him a days journey on his march and passed a night in his camp on the margin of a small stream the method of encamping generally observed by the captain was as follows the twenty wagons were disposed in a square at the distance of thirtythree feet from each other in every interval there was a mess stationed and each mess had its fire where the men cooked ate gossiped and slept the horses were placed in the centre of the square with a guard stationed over them at night  the horses were side lined as it is termed that is to say the fore and hind foot on the same side of the animal were tied together so as to be within eighteen inches of each other a horse thus fettered is for a time sadly embarrassed but soon becomes sufficiently accustomed to the restraint to move about slowly it prevents his wandering and his being easily carried off at night by lurking indians when a horse that is foot free is tied to one thus secured the latter forms as it were a pivot round which the other runs and curvets in case of alarm the encampment of which we are speaking presented a striking scene the various messfires were surrounded by picturesque groups standing sitting and reclining some busied in cooking others in cleaning their weapons while the frequent laugh told that the rough joke or merry story was going on in the middle of the camp before the principal lodge sat the two chieftains captain bonneville and white plume in soldierlike communion the captain delighted with the opportunity of meeting on social terms with one of the red warriors of the wilderness the unsophisticated children of nature the latter was squatted on his buffalo robe his strong features and red skin glaring in the broad light of a blazing fire while he recounted astounding tales of the bloody exploits of his tribe and himself in their wars with the pawnees for there are no old soldiers more given to long campaigning stories than indian braves  the feuds of white plume however had not been confined to the red men he had much to say of brushes with bee hunters a class of offenders for whom he seemed to cherish a particular abhorrence as the species of hunting prosecuted by these worthies is not laid down in any of the ancient books of venerie and is in fact peculiar to our western frontier a word or two on the subject may not be unacceptable to the reader  the bee hunter is generally some settler on the verge of the prairies a long lank fellow of fever and ague complexion acquired from living on new soil and in a hut built of green logs in the autumn when the harvest is over these frontier settlers form parties of two or three and prepare for a bee hunt having provided themselves with a wagon and a number of empty casks they sally off armed with their rifles into the wilderness directing their course east west north or south without any regard to the ordinance of the american government which strictly forbids all trespass upon the lands belonging to the indian tribes  the belts of woodland that traverse the lower prairies and border the rivers are peopled by innumerable swarms of wild bees which make their hives in hollow trees and fill them with honey tolled from the rich flowers of the prairies the bees according to popular assertion are migrating like the settlers to the west an indian trader well experienced in the country informs us that within ten years that he has passed in the far west the bee has advanced westward above a hundred miles it is said on the missouri that the wild turkey and the wild bee go up the river together neither is found in the upper regions it is but recently that the wild turkey has been killed on the nebraska or platte and his travelling competitor the wild bee appeared there about the same time  be all this as it may the course of our party of bee hunters is to make a wide circuit through the woody river bottoms and the patches of forest on the prairies marking as they go out every tree in which they have detected a hive these marks are generally respected by any other bee hunter that should come upon their track when they have marked sufficient to fill all their casks they turn their faces homeward cut down the trees as they proceed and having loaded their wagon with honey and wax return well pleased to the settlements  now it so happens that the indians relish wild honey as highly as do the white men and are the more delighted with this natural luxury from its having in many instances but recently made its appearance in their lands the consequence is numberless disputes and conflicts between them and the bee hunters and often a party of the latter returning laden with rich spoil from one of their forays are apt to be waylaid by the native lords of the soil their honey to be seized their harness cut to pieces and themselves left to find their way home the best way they can happy to escape with no greater personal harm than a sound ribroasting  such were the marauders of whose offences the gallant white plume made the most bitter complaint they were chiefly the settlers of the western part of missouri who are the most famous bee hunters on the frontier and whose favorite hunting ground lies within the lands of the kansas tribe according to the account of white plume however matters were pretty fairly balanced between him and the offenders he having as often treated them to a taste of the bitter as they had robbed him of the sweets  it is but justice to this gallant chief to say that he gave proofs of having acquired some of the lights of civilization from his proximity to the whites as was evinced in his knowledge of driving a bargain he required hard cash in return for some corn with which he supplied the worthy captain and left the latter at a loss which most to admire his native chivalry as a brave or his acquired adroitness as a trader     3       wide prairies vegetable productions

pursued a western course over vast undulating plains destitute of tree or shrub rendered miry by occasional rain and cut up by deep watercourses where they had to dig roads for their wagons down the soft crumbling banks and to throw bridges across the streams the weather had attained the summer heat the thermometer standing about fiftyseven degrees in the morning early but rising to about ninety degrees at noon the incessant breezes however which sweep these vast plains render the heats endurable game was scanty and they had to eke out their scanty fare with wild roots and vegetables such as the indian potato the wild onion and the prairie tomato and they met with quantities of red root from which the hunters make a very palatable beverage the only human being that crossed their path was a kansas warrior returning from some solitary expedition of bravado or revenge bearing a pawnee scalp as a trophy  the country gradually rose as they proceeded westward and their route took them over high ridges commanding wide and beautiful prospects the vast plain was studded on the west with innumerable hills of conical shape such as are seen north of the arkansas river these hills have their summits apparently cut off about the same elevation so as to leave flat surfaces at top it is conjectured by some that the whole country may originally have been of the altitude of these tabular hills but through some process of nature may have sunk to its present level these insulated eminences being protected by broad foundations of solid rock  captain bonneville mentions another geological phenomenon north of red river where the surface of the earth in considerable tracts of country is covered with broad slabs of sandstone having the form and position of gravestones and looking as if they had been forced up by some subterranean agitation the resemblance says he which these very remarkable spots have in many places to old churchyards is curious in the extreme one might almost fancy himself among the tombs of the preadamites  on the 2d of june they arrived on the main stream of the nebraska or platte river twentyfive miles below the head of the great island the low banks of this river give it an appearance of great width captain bonneville measured it in one place and found it twentytwo hundred yards from bank to bank its depth was from three to six feet the bottom full of quicksands the nebraska is studded with islands covered with that species of poplar called the cottonwood tree keeping up along the course of this river for several days they were obliged from the scarcity of game to put themselves upon short allowance and occasionally to kill a steer they bore their daily labors and privations however with great good humor taking their tone in all probability from the buoyant spirit of their leader if the weather was inclement said the captain we watched the clouds and hoped for a sight of the blue sky and the merry sun if food was scanty we regaled ourselves with the hope of soon falling in with herds of buffalo and having nothing to do but slay and eat we doubt whether the genial captain is not describing the cheeriness of his own breast which gave a cheery aspect to everything around him  there certainly were evidences however that the country was not always equally destitute of game at one place they observed a field decorated with buffalo skulls arranged in circles curves and other mathematical figures as if for some mystic rite or ceremony they were almost innumerable and seemed to have been a vast hecatomb offered up in thanksgiving to the great spirit for some signal success in the chase  on the 11th of june they came to the fork of the nebraska where it divides itself into two equal and beautiful streams one of these branches rises in the westsouthwest near the headwaters of the arkansas up the course of this branch as captain bonneville was well aware lay the route to the camanche and kioway indians and to the northern mexican settlements of the other branch he knew nothing its sources might lie among wild and inaccessible cliffs and tumble and foam down rugged defiles and over craggy precipices but its direction was in the true course and up this stream he determined to prosecute his route to the rocky mountains finding it impossible from quicksands and other dangerous impediments to cross the river in this neighborhood he kept up along the south fork for two days merely seeking a safe fording place at length he encamped caused the bodies of the wagons to be dislodged from the wheels covered with buffalo hide and besmeared with a compound of tallow and ashes thus forming rude boats in these they ferried their effects across the stream which was six hundred yards wide with a swift and strong current three men were in each boat to manage it others waded across pushing the barks before them thus all crossed in safety a march of nine miles took them over high rolling prairies to the north fork their eyes being regaled with the welcome sight of herds of buffalo at a distance some careering the plain others grazing and reposing in the natural meadows  skirting along the north fork for a day or two excessively annoyed by musquitoes and buffalo gnats they reached in the evening of the 17th a small but beautiful grove from which issued the confused notes of singing birds the first they had heard since crossing the boundary of missouri after so many days of weary travelling through a naked monotonous and silent country it was delightful once more to hear the song of the bird and to behold the verdure of the grove it was a beautiful sunset and a sight of the glowing rays mantling the treetops and rustling branches gladdened every heart they pitched their camp in the grove kindled their fires partook merrily of their rude fare and resigned themselves to the sweetest sleep they had enjoyed since their outset upon the prairies  the country now became rugged and broken high bluffs advanced upon the river and forced the travellers occasionally to leave its banks and wind their course into the interior in one of the wild and solitary passes they were startled by the trail of four or five pedestrians whom they supposed to be spies from some predatory camp of either arickara or crow indians this obliged them to redouble their vigilance at night and to keep especial watch upon their horses in these rugged and elevated regions they began to see the blacktailed deer a species larger than the ordinary kind and chiefly found in rocky and mountainous countries they had reached also a great buffalo range captain bonneville ascended a high bluff commanding an extensive view of the surrounding plains as far as his eye could reach the country seemed absolutely blackened by innumerable herds no language he says could convey an adequate idea of the vast living mass thus presented to his eye he remarked that the bulls and cows generally congregated in separate herds  opposite to the camp at this place was a singular phenomenon which is among the curiosities of the country it is called the chimney the lower part is a conical mound rising out of the naked plain from the summit shoots up a shaft or column about one hundred and twenty feet in height from which it derives its name the height of the whole according to captain bonneville is a hundred and seventyfive yards it is composed of indurated clay with alternate layers of red and white sandstone and may be seen at the distance of upward of thirty miles  on the 21st they encamped amidst high and beetling cliffs of indurated clay and sandstone bearing the semblance of towers castles churches and fortified cities at a distance it was scarcely possible to persuade ones self that the works of art were not mingled with these fantastic freaks of nature they have received the name of scotts bluffs from a melancholy circumstance a number of years since a party were descending the upper part of the river in canoes when their frail barks were overturned and all their powder spoiled their rifles being thus rendered useless they were unable to procure food by hunting and had to depend upon roots and wild fruits for subsistence after suffering extremely from hunger they arrived at laramies fork a small tributary of the north branch of the nebraska about sixty miles above the cliffs just mentioned here one of the party by the name of scott was taken ill and his companions came to a halt until he should recover health and strength sufficient to proceed while they were searching round in quest of edible roots they discovered a fresh trail of white men who had evidently but recently preceded them what was to be done by a forced march they might overtake this party and thus be able to reach the settlements in safety should they linger they might all perish of famine and exhaustion scott however was incapable of moving they were too feeble to aid him forward and dreaded that such a clog would prevent their coming up with the advance party they determined therefore to abandon him to his fate accordingly under presence of seeking food and such simples as might be efficacious in his malady they deserted him and hastened forward upon the trail they succeeded in overtaking the party of which they were in quest but concealed their faithless desertion of scott alleging that he had died of disease  on the ensuing summer these very individuals visiting these parts in company with others came suddenly upon the bleached bones and grinning skull of a human skeleton which by certain signs they recognized for the remains of scott this was sixty long miles from the place where they had abandoned him and it appeared that the wretched man had crawled that immense distance before death put an end to his miseries the wild and picturesque bluffs in the neighborhood of his lonely grave have ever since borne his name  amidst this wild and striking scenery captain bonneville for the first time beheld flocks of the ahsahta or bighorn an animal which frequents these cliffs in great numbers they accord with the nature of such scenery and add much to its romantic effect bounding like goats from crag to crag often trooping along the lofty shelves of the mountains under the guidance of some venerable patriarch with horns twisted lower than his muzzle and sometimes peering over the edge of a precipice so high that they appear scarce bigger than crows indeed it seems a pleasure to them to seek the most rugged and frightful situations doubtless from a feeling of security  this animal is commonly called the mountain sheep and is often confounded with another animal the woolly sheep found more to the northward about the country of the flatheads the latter likewise inhabits cliffs in summer but descends into the valleys in the winter it has white wool like a sheep mingled with a thin growth of long hair but it has short legs a deep belly and a beard like a goat its horns are about five inches long slightly curved backwards black as jet and beautifully polished its hoofs are of the same color this animal is by no means so active as the bighorn it does not bound much but sits a good deal upon its haunches it is not so plentiful either rarely more than two or three are seen at a time its wool alone gives a resemblance to the sheep it is more properly of the flesh is said to have a musty flavor some have thought the fleece might be valuable as it is said to be as fine as that of the goat cashmere but it is not to be procured in sufficient quantities  the ahsahta argali or bighorn on the contrary has short hair like a deer and resembles it in shape but has the head and horns of a sheep and its flesh is said to be delicious mutton the indians consider it more sweet and delicate than any other kind of venison it abounds in the rocky mountains from the fiftieth degree of north latitude quite down to california generally in the highest regions capable of vegetation sometimes it ventures into the valleys but on the least alarm regains its favorite cliffs and precipices where it is perilous if not impossible for the hunter to follow     4       an

dreary countrybanks of the sweet waterbuffalo hunting      adventure of tom cain the irish cook  when on the march captain bonneville always sent some of his best hunters in the advance to reconnoitre the country as well as to look out for game on the 24th of may as the caravan was slowly journeying up the banks of the nebraska the hunters came galloping back waving their caps and giving the alarm cry indians indians  the captain immediately ordered a halt the hunters now came up and announced that a large warparty of crow indians were just above on the river the captain knew the character of these savages one of the most roving warlike crafty and predatory tribes of the mountains horsestealers of the first order and easily provoked to acts of sanguinary violence orders were accordingly given to prepare for action and every one promptly took the post that had been assigned him in the general order of the march in all cases of warlike emergency  everything being put in battle array the captain took the lead of his little band and moved on slowly and warily in a little while he beheld the crow warriors emerging from among the bluffs there were about sixty of them fine martiallooking fellows painted and arrayed for war and mounted on horses decked out with all kinds of wild trappings they came prancing along in gallant style with many wild and dexterous evolutions for none can surpass them in horsemanship and their bright colors and flaunting and fantastic embellishments glaring and sparkling in the morning sunshine gave them really a striking appearance  their mode of approach to one not acquainted with the tactics and ceremonies of this rude chivalry of the wilderness had an air of direct hostility they came galloping forward in a body as if about to make a furious charge but when close at hand opened to the right and left and wheeled in wide circles round the travellers whooping and yelling like maniacs  this done their mock fury sank into a calm and the chief approaching the captain who had remained warily drawn up though informed of the pacific nature of the maneuver extended to him the hand of friendship the pipe of peace was smoked and now all was good fellowship  the crows were in pursuit of a band of cheyennes who had attacked their village in the night and killed one of their people they had already been five and twenty days on the track of the marauders and were determined not to return home until they had sated their revenge  a few days previously some of their scouts who were ranging the country at a distance from the main body had discovered the party of captain bonneville they had dogged it for a time in secret astonished at the long train of wagons and oxen and especially struck with the sight of a cow and calf quietly following the caravan supposing them to be some kind of tame buffalo having satisfied their curiosity they carried back to their chief intelligence of all that they had seen he had in consequence diverged from his pursuit of vengeance to behold the wonders described to him now that we have met you said he to captain bonneville and have seen these marvels with our own eyes our hearts are glad in fact nothing could exceed the curiosity evinced by these people as to the objects before them wagons had never been seen by them before and they examined them with the greatest minuteness but the calf was the peculiar object of their admiration they watched it with intense interest as it licked the hands accustomed to feed it and were struck with the mild expression of its countenance and its perfect docility  after much sage consultation they at length determined that it must be the great medicine of the white party an appellation given by the indians to anything of supernatural and mysterious power that is guarded as a talisman they were completely thrown out in their conjecture however by an offer of the white men to exchange the calf for a horse their estimation of the great medicine sank in an instant and they declined the bargain  at the request of the crow chieftain the two parties encamped together and passed the residue of the day in company the captain was well pleased with every opportunity to gain a knowledge of the unsophisticated sons of nature who had so long been objects of his poetic speculations and indeed this wild horsestealing tribe is one of the most notorious of the mountains the chief of course had his scalps to show and his battles to recount the blackfoot is the hereditary enemy of the crow toward whom hostility is like a cherished principle of religion for every tribe besides its casual antagonists has some enduring foe with whom there can be no permanent reconciliation the crows and blackfeet upon the whole are enemies worthy of each other being rogues and ruffians of the first water as their predatory excursions extend over the same regions they often come in contact with each other and these casual conflicts serve to keep their wits awake and their passions alive  the present party of crows however evinced nothing of the invidious character for which they are renowned during the day and night that they were encamped in company with the travellers their conduct was friendly in the extreme they were in fact quite irksome in their attentions and had a caressing manner at times quite importunate it was not until after separation on the following morning that the captain and his men ascertained the secret of all this lovingkindness in the course of their fraternal caresses the crows had contrived to empty the pockets of their white brothers to abstract the very buttons from their coats and above all to make free with their hunting knives  by equal altitudes of the sun taken at this last encampment captain bonneville ascertained his latitude to be 41 47 north the thermometer at six oclock in the morning stood at fiftynine degrees at two oclock p m at ninetytwo degrees and at six oclock in the evening at seventy degrees  the black hills or mountains now began to be seen at a distance printing the horizon with their rugged and broken outlines and threatening to oppose a difficult barrier in the way of the travellers  on the 26th of may the travellers encamped at laramies fork a clear and beautiful stream rising in the westsouthwest maintaining an average width of twenty yards and winding through broad meadows abounding in currants and gooseberries and adorned with groves and clumps of trees  by an observation of jupiters satellites with a dolland reflecting telescope captain bonneville ascertained the longitude to be 102 57 west of greenwich  we will here step ahead of our narrative to observe that about three years after the time of which we are treating mr robert campbell formerly of the rocky mountain fur company descended the platte from this fork in skin canoes thus proving what had always been discredited that the river was navigable about the same time he built a fort or trading post at laramies fork which he named fort william after his friend and partner mr william sublette since that time the platte has become a highway for the fur traders  for some days past captain bonneville had been made sensible of the great elevation of country into which he was gradually ascending by the effect of the dryness and rarefaction of the atmosphere upon his wagons the woodwork shrunk the paint boxes of the wheels were continually working out and it was necessary to support the spokes by stout props to prevent their falling asunder the travellers were now entering one of those great steppes of the far west where the prevalent aridity of the atmosphere renders the country unfit for cultivation in these regions there is a fresh sweet growth of grass in the spring but it is scanty and short and parches up in the course of the summer so that there is none for the hunters to set fire to in the autumn it is a common observation that above the forks of the platte the grass does not burn all attempts at agriculture and gardening in the neighborhood of fort william have been attended with very little success the grain and vegetables raised there have been scanty in quantity and poor in quality the great elevation of these plains and the dryness of the atmosphere will tend to retain these immense regions in a state of pristine wildness  in the course of a day or two more the travellers entered that wild and broken tract of the crow country called the black hills and here their journey became toilsome in the extreme rugged steeps and deep ravines incessantly obstructed their progress so that a great part of the day was spent in the painful toil of digging through banks filling up ravines forcing the wagons up the most forbidding ascents or swinging them with ropes down the face of dangerous precipices the shoes of their horses were worn out and their feet injured by the rugged and stony roads the travellers were annoyed also by frequent but brief storms which would come hurrying over the hills or through the mountain defiles rage with great fury for a short time and then pass off leaving everything calm and serene again  for several nights the camp had been infested by vagabond indian dogs prowling about in quest of food they were about the size of a large pointer with ears short and erect and a long bushy tailaltogether they bore a striking resemblance to a wolf these skulking visitors would keep about the purlieus of the camp until daylight when on the first stir of life among the sleepers they would scamper off until they reached some rising ground where they would take their seats and keep a sharp and hungry watch upon every movement the moment the travellers were fairly on the march and the camp was abandoned these starving hangerson would hasten to the deserted fires to seize upon the halfpicked bones the offal and garbage that lay about and having made a hasty meal with many a snap and snarl and growl would follow leisurely on the trail of the caravan many attempts were made to coax or catch them but in vain their quick and suspicious eyes caught the slightest sinister movement and they turned and scampered off at length one was taken he was terribly alarmed and crouched and trembled as if expecting instant death soothed however by caresses he began after a time to gather confidence and wag his tail and at length was brought to follow close at the heels of his captors still however darting around furtive and suspicious glances and evincing a disposition to scamper off upon the least alarm  on the first of july the band of crow warriors again crossed their path they came in vaunting and vainglorious style displaying five cheyenne scalps the trophies of their vengeance they were now bound homewards to appease the manes of their comrade by these proofs that his death had been revenged and intended to have scalpdances and other triumphant rejoicings captain bonneville and his men however were by no means disposed to renew their confiding intimacy with these crafty savages and above all took care to avoid their pilfering caresses they remarked one precaution of the crows with respect to their horses to protect their hoofs from the sharp and jagged rocks among which they had to pass they had covered them with shoes of buffalo hide  the route of the travellers lay generally along the course of the nebraska or platte but occasionally where steep promontories advanced to the margin of the stream they were obliged to make inland circuits one of these took them through a bold and stern country bordered by a range of low mountains running east and west everything around bore traces of some fearful convulsion of nature in times long past hitherto the various strata of rock had exhibited a gentle elevation toward the southwest but here everything appeared to have been subverted and thrown out of place in many places there were heavy beds of white sandstone resting upon red immense strata of rocks jutted up into crags and cliffs and sometimes formed perpendicular walls and overhanging precipices an air of sterility prevailed over these savage wastes the valleys were destitute of herbage and scantily clothed with a stunted species of wormwood generally known among traders and trappers by the name of sage from an elevated point of their march through this region the travellers caught a beautiful view of the powder river mountains away to the north stretching along the very verge of the horizon and seeming from the snow with which they were mantled to be a chain of small white clouds connecting sky and earth  though the thermometer at midday ranged from eighty to ninety and even sometimes rose to ninetythree degrees yet occasional spots of snow were to be seen on the tops of the low mountains among which the travellers were journeying proofs of the great elevation of the whole region  the nebraska in its passage through the black hills is confined to a much narrower channel than that through which it flows in the plains below but it is deeper and clearer and rushes with a stronger current the scenery also is more varied and beautiful sometimes it glides rapidly but smoothly through a picturesque valley between wooded banks then forcing its way into the bosom of rugged mountains it rushes impetuously through narrow defiles roaring and foaming down rocks and rapids until it is again soothed to rest in some peaceful valley  on the 12th of july captain bonneville abandoned the main stream of the nebraska which was continually shouldered by rugged promontories and making a bend to the southwest for a couple of days part of the time over plains of loose sand encamped on the 14th on the banks of the sweet water a stream about twenty yards in breadth and four or five feet deep flowing between low banks over a sandy soil and forming one of the forks or upper branches of the nebraska up this stream they now shaped their course for several successive days tending generally to the west the soil was light and sandy the country much diversified frequently the plains were studded with isolated blocks of rock sometimes in the shape of a half globe and from three to four hundred feet high these singular masses had occasionally a very imposing and even sublime appearance rising from the midst of a savage and lonely landscape  as the travellers continued to advance they became more and more sensible of the elevation of the country the hills around were more generally capped with snow the men complained of cramps and colics sore lips and mouths and violent headaches the woodwork of the wagons also shrank so much that it was with difficulty the wheels were kept from falling to pieces the country bordering upon the river was frequently gashed with deep ravines or traversed by high bluffs to avoid which the travellers were obliged to make wide circuits through the plains in the course of these they came upon immense herds of buffalo which kept scouring off in the van like a retreating army  among the motley retainers of the camp was tom cain a raw irishman who officiated as cook whose various blunders and expedients in his novel situation and in the wild scenes and wild kind of life into which he had suddenly been thrown had made him a kind of butt or droll of the camp tom however began to discover an ambition superior to his station and the conversation of the hunters and their stories of their exploits inspired him with a desire to elevate himself to the dignity of their order the buffalo in such immense droves presented a tempting opportunity for making his first essay he rode in the line of march all prepared for action his powderflask and shotpouch knowingly slung at the pommel of his saddle to be at hand his rifle balanced on his shoulder while in this plight a troop of buffalo came trotting by in great alarm in an instant tom sprang from his horse and gave chase on foot finding they were leaving him behind he levelled his rifle and pulled the trigger his shot produced no other effect than to increase the speed of the buffalo and to frighten his own horse who took to his heels and scampered off with all the ammunition tom scampered after him hallooing with might and main and the wild horse and wild irishman soon disappeared among the ravines of the prairie captain bonneville who was at the head of the line and had seen the transaction at a distance detached a party in pursuit of tom after a long interval they returned leading the frightened horse but though they had scoured the country and looked out and shouted from every height they had seen nothing of his rider  as captain bonneville knew toms utter awkwardness and inexperience and the dangers of a bewildered irishman in the midst of a prairie he halted and encamped at an early hour that there might be a regular hunt for him in the morning  at early dawn on the following day scouts were sent off in every direction while the main body after breakfast proceeded slowly on its course it was not until the middle of the afternoon that the hunters returned with honest tom mounted behind one of them they had found him in a complete state of perplexity and amazement his appearance caused shouts of merriment in the campbut tom for once could not join in the mirth raised at his expense he was completely chapfallen and apparently cured of the hunting mania for the rest of his life     5       magnificent scenerywind rivermountainstreasury of      watersa

rival traders      fortification of the camptheblackfeetbanditti of the      mountainstheir character and habits  it was on the 20th of july that captain bonneville first came in sight of the grand region of his hopes and anticipations the rocky mountains he had been making a bend to the south to avoid some obstacles along the river and had attained a high rocky ridge when a magnificent prospect burst upon his sight to the west rose the wind river mountains with their bleached and snowy summits towering into the clouds these stretched far to the northnorthwest until they melted away into what appeared to be faint clouds but which the experienced eyes of the veteran hunters of the party recognized for the rugged mountains of the yellowstone at the feet of which extended the wild crow country a perilous though profitable region for the trapper  to the southwest the eye ranged over an immense extent of wilderness with what appeared to be a snowy vapor resting upon its horizon this however was pointed out as another branch of the great chippewyan or rocky chain being the eutaw mountains at whose basis the wandering tribe of hunters of the same name pitch their tents we can imagine the enthusiasm of the worthy captain when he beheld the vast and mountainous scene of his adventurous enterprise thus suddenly unveiled before him we can imagine with what feelings of awe and admiration he must have contemplated the wind river sierra or bed of mountains that great fountainhead from whose springs and lakes and melted snows some of those mighty rivers take their rise which wander over hundreds of miles of varied country and clime and find their way to the opposite waves of the atlantic and the pacific  the wind river mountains are in fact among the most remarkable of the whole rocky chain and would appear to be among the loftiest they form as it were a great bed of mountains about eighty miles in length and from twenty to thirty in breadth with rugged peaks covered with eternal snows and deep narrow valleys full of springs and brooks and rockbound lakes from this great treasury of waters issue forth limpid streams which augmenting as they descend become main tributaries of the missouri on the one side and the columbia on the other and give rise to the seedskedee agie or green river the great colorado of the west that empties its current into the gulf of california  the wind river mountains are notorious in hunters and trappers stories their rugged defiles and the rough tracts about their neighborhood having been lurking places for the predatory hordes of the mountains and scenes of rough encounter with crows and blackfeet it was to the west of these mountains in the valley of the seedskedee agie or green river that captain bonneville intended to make a halt for the purpose of giving repose to his people and his horses after their weary journeying and of collecting information as to his future course this green river valley and its immediate neighborhood as we have already observed formed the main point of rendezvous for the present year of the rival fur companies and the motley populace civilized and savage connected with them several days of rugged travel however yet remained for the captain and his men before they should encamp in this desired restingplace  on the 21st of july as they were pursuing their course through one of the meadows of the sweet water they beheld a horse grazing at a little distance he showed no alarm at their approach but suffered himself quietly to be taken evincing a perfect state of tameness the scouts of the party were instantly on the lookout for the owners of this animal lest some dangerous band of savages might be lurking in the vicinity after a narrow search they discovered the trail of an indian party which had evidently passed through that neighborhood but recently the horse was accordingly taken possession of as an estray but a more vigilant watch than usual was kept round the camp at nights lest his former owners should be upon the prowl  the travellers had now attained so high an elevation that on the 23d of july at daybreak there was considerable ice in the waterbuckets and the thermometer stood at twentytwo degrees the rarefy of the atmosphere continued to affect the woodwork of the wagons and the wheels were incessantly falling to pieces a remedy was at length devised the tire of each wheel was taken off a band of wood was nailed round the exterior of the felloes the tire was then made red hot replaced round the wheel and suddenly cooled with water by this means the whole was bound together with great compactness  the extreme elevation of these great steppes which range along the feet of the rocky mountains takes away from the seeming height of their peaks which yield to few in the known world in point of altitude above the level of the sea  on the 24th the travellers took final leave of the sweet water and keeping westwardly over a low and very rocky ridge one of the most southern spurs of the wind river mountains they encamped after a march of seven hours and a half on the banks of a small clear stream running to the south in which they caught a number of fine trout  the sight of these fish was hailed with pleasure as a sign that they had reached the waters which flow into the pacific for it is only on the western streams of the rocky mountains that trout are to be taken the stream on which they had thus encamped proved in effect to be tributary to the seedskedee agie or green river into which it flowed at some distance to the south  captain bonneville now considered himself as having fairly passed the crest of the rocky mountains and felt some degree of exultation in being the first individual that had crossed north of the settled provinces of mexico from the waters of the atlantic to those of the pacific with wagons mr william sublette the enterprising leader of the rocky mountain fur company had two or three years previously reached the valley of the wind river which lies on the northeast of the mountains but had proceeded with them no further  a vast valley now spread itself before the travellers bounded on one side by the wind river mountains and to the west by a long range of high hills this captain bonneville was assured by a veteran hunter in his company was the great valley of the seedskedee and the same informant would have fain persuaded him that a small stream three feet deep which he came to on the 25th was that river the captain was convinced however that the stream was too insignificant to drain so wide a valley and the adjacent mountains he encamped therefore at an early hour on its borders that he might take the whole of the next day to reach the main river which he presumed to flow between him and the distant range of western hills  on the 26th of july he commenced his march at an early hour making directly across the valley toward the hills in the west proceeding at as brisk a rate as the jaded condition of his horses would permit about eleven oclock in the morning a great cloud of dust was descried in the rear advancing directly on the trail of the party the alarm was given they all came to a halt and held a council of war some conjectured that the band of indians whose trail they had discovered in the neighborhood of the stray horse had been lying in wait for them in some secret fastness of the mountains and were about to attack them on the open plain where they would have no shelter preparations were immediately made for defence and a scouting party sent off to reconnoitre they soon came galloping back making signals that all was well the cloud of dust was made by a band of fifty or sixty mounted trappers belonging to the american fur company who soon came up leading their packhorses they were headed by mr fontenelle an experienced leader or partisan as a chief of a party is called in the technical language of the trappers  mr fontenelle informed captain bonneville that he was on his way from the companys trading post on the yellowstone to the yearly rendezvous with reinforcements and supplies for their hunting and trading parties beyond the mountains and that he expected to meet by appointment with a band of free trappers in that very neighborhood he had fallen upon the trail of captain bonnevilles party just after leaving the nebraska and finding that they had frightened off all the game had been obliged to push on by forced marches to avoid famine both men and horses were therefore much travelworn but this was no place to halt the plain before them he said was destitute of grass and water neither of which would be met with short of the green river which was yet at a considerable distance he hoped he added as his party were all on horseback to reach the river with hard travelling by nightfall but he doubted the possibility of captain bonnevilles arrival there with his wagons before the day following having imparted this information he pushed forward with all speed  captain bonneville followed on as fast as circumstances would permit the ground was firm and gravelly but the horses were too much fatigued to move rapidly after a long and harassing days march without pausing for a noontide meal they were compelled at nine oclock at night to encamp in an open plain destitute of water or pasturage on the following morning the horses were turned loose at the peep of day to slake their thirst if possible from the dew collected on the sparse grass here and there springing up among dry sandbanks the soil of a great part of this green river valley is a whitish clay into which the rain cannot penetrate but which dries and cracks with the sun in some places it produces a salt weed and grass along the margins of the streams but the wider expanses of it are desolate and barren it was not until noon that captain bonneville reached the banks of the seedskedee or colorado of the west in the meantime the sufferings of both men and horses had been excessive and it was with almost frantic eagerness that they hurried to allay their burning thirst in the limpid current of the river  fontenelle and his party had not fared much better the chief part had managed to reach the river by nightfall but were nearly knocked up by the exertion the horses of others sank under them and they were obliged to pass the night upon the road  on the following morning july 27th fontenelle moved his camp across the river while captain bonneville proceeded some little distance below where there was a small but fresh meadow yielding abundant pasturage here the poor jaded horses were turned out to graze and take their rest the weary journey up the mountains had worn them down in flesh and spirit but this last march across the thirsty plain had nearly finished them  the captain had here the first taste of the boasted strategy of the fur trade during his brief but social encampment in company with fontenelle that experienced trapper had managed to win over a number of delaware indians whom the captain had brought with him by offering them four hundred dollars each for the ensuing autumnal hunt the captain was somewhat astonished when he saw these hunters on whose services he had calculated securely suddenly pack up their traps and go over to the rival camp that he might in some measure however be even with his competitor he dispatched two scouts to look out for the band of free trappers who were to meet fontenelle in this neighborhood and to endeavor to bring them to his camp  as it would be necessary to remain some time in this neighborhood that both men and horses might repose and recruit their strength and as it was a region full of danger captain bonneville proceeded to fortify his camp with breastworks of logs and pickets  these precautions were at that time peculiarly necessary from the bands of blackfeet indians which were roving about the neighborhood these savages are the most dangerous banditti of the mountains and the inveterate foe of the trappers they are ishmaelites of the first order always with weapon in hand ready for action the young braves of the tribe who are destitute of property go to war for booty to gain horses and acquire the means of setting up a lodge supporting a family and entitling themselves to a seat in the public councils the veteran warriors fight merely for the love of the thing and the consequence which success gives them among their people  they are capital horsemen and are generally well mounted on short stout horses similar to the prairie ponies to be met with at st louis when on a war party however they go on foot to enable them to skulk through the country with greater secrecy to keep in thickets and ravines and use more adroit subterfuges and stratagems their mode of warfare is entirely by ambush surprise and sudden assaults in the night time if they succeed in causing a panic they dash forward with headlong fury if the enemy is on the alert and shows no signs of fear they become wary and deliberate in their movements  some of them are armed in the primitive style with bows and arrows the greater part have american fusees made after the fashion of those of the hudsons bay company these they procure at the trading post of the american fur company on marias river where they traffic their peltries for arms ammunition clothing and trinkets they are extremely fond of spirituous liquors and tobacco for which nuisances they are ready to exchange not merely their guns and horses but even their wives and daughters as they are a treacherous race and have cherished a lurking hostility to the whites ever since one of their tribe was killed by mr lewis the associate of general clarke in his exploring expedition across the rocky mountains the american fur company is obliged constantly to keep at that post a garrison of sixty or seventy men  under the general name of blackfeet are comprehended several tribes such as the surcies the peagans the blood indians and the gros ventres of the prairies who roam about the southern branches of the yellowstone and missouri rivers together with some other tribes further north  the bands infesting the wind river mountains and the country adjacent at the time of which we are treating were gros ventres of the prairies which are not to be confounded with gros ventres of the missouri who keep about the lower part of that river and are friendly to the white men  this hostile band keeps about the headwaters of the missouri and numbers about nine hundred fighting men once in the course of two or three years they abandon their usual abodes and make a visit to the arapahoes of the arkansas their route lies either through the crow country and the black hills or through the lands of the nez perces flatheads bannacks and shoshonies as they enjoy their favorite state of hostility with all these tribes their expeditions are prone to be conducted in the most lawless and predatory style nor do they hesitate to extend their maraudings to any party of white men they meet with following their trails hovering about their camps waylaying and dogging the caravans of the free traders and murdering the solitary trapper the consequences are frequent and desperate fights between them and the mountaineers in the wild defiles and fastnesses of the rocky mountains  the band in question was at this time on their way homeward from one of their customary visits to the arapahoes and in the ensuing chapter we shall treat of some bloody encounters between them and the trappers which had taken place just before the arrival of captain bonneville among the mountains     6       sublette and his bandrobertcampbellmr wyeth and a

captain bonneville and his band ensconced within their fortified camp in the green river valley we shall step back and accompany a party of the rocky mountain fur company in its progress with supplies from st louis to the annual rendezvous at pierres hole this party consisted of sixty men well mounted and conducting a line of packhorses they were commanded by captain william sublette a partner in the company and one of the most active intrepid and renowned leaders in this half military kind of service he was accompanied by his associate in business and tried companion in danger mr robert campbell one of the pioneers of the trade beyond the mountains who had commanded trapping parties there in times of the greatest peril  as these worthy compeers were on their route to the frontier they fell in with another expedition likewise on its way to the mountains this was a party of regular downeasters that is to say people of new england who with the allpenetrating and allpervading spirit of their race were now pushing their way into a new field of enterprise with which they were totally unacquainted the party had been fitted out and was maintained and commanded by mr nathaniel j wyeth of boston this gentleman had conceived an idea that a profitable fishery for salmon might be established on the columbia river and connected with the fur trade he had accordingly invested capital in goods calculated as he supposed for the indian trade and had enlisted a number of eastern men in his employ who had never been in the far west nor knew anything of the wilderness with these he was bravely steering his way across the continent undismayed by danger difficulty or distance in the same way that a new england coaster and his neighbors will coolly launch forth on a voyage to the black sea or a whaling cruise to the pacific  with all their national aptitude at expedient and resource wyeth and his men felt themselves completely at a loss when they reached the frontier and found that the wilderness required experience and habitudes of which they were totally deficient not one of the party excepting the leader had ever seen an indian or handled a rifle they were without guide or interpreter and totally unacquainted with wood craft and the modes of making their way among savage hordes and subsisting themselves during long marches over wild mountains and barren plains  in this predicament captain sublette found them in a manner becalmed or rather run aground at the little frontier town of independence in missouri and kindly took them in tow the two parties travelled amicably together the frontier men of sublettes party gave their yankee comrades some lessons in hunting and some insight into the art and mystery of dealing with the indians and they all arrived without accident at the upper branches of the nebraska or platte river  in the course of their march mr fitzpatrick the partner of the company who was resident at that time beyond the mountains came down from the rendezvous at pierres hole to meet them and hurry them forward he travelled in company with them until they reached the sweet water then taking a couple of horses one for the saddle and the other as a packhorse he started off express for pierres hole to make arrangements against their arrival that he might commence his hunting campaign before the rival company  fitzpatrick was a hardy and experienced mountaineer and knew all the passes and defiles as he was pursuing his lonely course up the green river valley he described several horsemen at a distance and came to a halt to reconnoitre he supposed them to be some detachment from the rendezvous or a party of friendly indians they perceived him and setting up the warwhoop dashed forward at full speed he saw at once his mistake and his perilthey were blackfeet springing upon his fleetest horse and abandoning the other to the enemy he made for the mountains and succeeded in escaping up one of the most dangerous defiles here he concealed himself until he thought the indians had gone off when he returned into the valley he was again pursued lost his remaining horse and only escaped by scrambling up among the cliffs for several days he remained lurking among rocks and precipices and almost famished having but one remaining charge in his rifle which he kept for selfdefence  in the meantime sublette and campbell with their fellow traveller wyeth had pursued their march unmolested and arrived in the green river valley totally unconscious that there was any lurking enemy at hand they had encamped one night on the banks of a small stream which came down from the wind river mountains when about midnight a band of indians burst upon their camp with horrible yells and whoops and a discharge of guns and arrows happily no other harm was done than wounding one mule and causing several horses to break loose from their pickets the camp was instantly in arms but the indians retreated with yells of exultation carrying off several of the horses under cover of the night  this was somewhat of a disagreeable foretaste of mountain life to some of wyeths band accustomed only to the regular and peaceful life of new england nor was it altogether to the taste of captain sublettes men who were chiefly creoles and townsmen from st louis they continued their march the next morning keeping scouts ahead and upon their flanks and arrived without further molestation at pierres hole  the first inquiry of captain sublette on reaching the rendezvous was for fitzpatrick he had not arrived nor had any intelligence been received concerning him great uneasiness was now entertained lest he should have fallen into the hands of the blackfeet who had made the midnight attack upon the camp it was a matter of general joy therefore when he made his appearance conducted by two halfbreed iroquois hunters he had lurked for several days among the mountains until almost starved at length he escaped the vigilance of his enemies in the night and was so fortunate as to meet the two iroquois hunters who being on horseback conveyed him without further difficulty to the rendezvous he arrived there so emaciated that he could scarcely be recognized  the valley called pierres hole is about thirty miles in length and fifteen in width bounded to the west and south by low and broken ridges and overlooked to the east by three lofty mountains called the three tetons which domineer as landmarks over a vast extent of country  a fine stream fed by rivulets and mountain springs pours through the valley toward the north dividing it into nearly equal parts the meadows on its borders are broad and extensive covered with willow and cottonwood trees so closely interlocked and matted together as to be nearly impassable  in this valley was congregated the motley populace connected with the fur trade here the two rival companies had their encampments with their retainers of all kinds traders trappers hunters and halfbreeds assembled from all quarters awaiting their yearly supplies and their orders to start off in new directions here also the savage tribes connected with the trade the nez perces or chopunnish indians and flatheads had pitched their lodges beside the streams and with their squaws awaited the distribution of goods and finery there was moreover a band of fifteen free trappers commanded by a gallant leader from arkansas named sinclair who held their encampment a little apart from the rest such was the wild and heterogeneous assemblage amounting to several hundred men civilized and savage distributed in tents and lodges in the several camps  the arrival of captain sublette with supplies put the rocky mountain fur company in full activity the wares and merchandise were quickly opened and as quickly disposed of to trappers and indians the usual excitement and revelry took place after which all hands began to disperse to their several destinations  on the 17th of july a small brigade of fourteen trappers led by milton sublette brother of the captain set out with the intention of proceeding to the southwest they were accompanied by sinclair and his fifteen free trappers wyeth also and his new england band of beaver hunters and salmon fishers now dwindled down to eleven took this opportunity to prosecute their cruise in the wilderness accompanied with such experienced pilots on the first day they proceeded about eight miles to the southeast and encamped for the night still in the valley of pierres hole on the following morning just as they were raising their camp they observed a long line of people pouring down a defile of the mountains they at first supposed them to be fontenelle and his party whose arrival had been daily expected wyeth however reconnoitred them with a spyglass and soon perceived they were indians they were divided into two parties forming in the whole about one hundred and fifty persons men women and children some were on horseback fantastically painted and arrayed with scarlet blankets fluttering in the wind the greater part however were on foot they had perceived the trappers before they were themselves discovered and came down yelling and whooping into the plain on nearer approach they were ascertained to be blackfeet  one of the trappers of sublettes brigade a halfbreed named antoine godin now mounted his horse and rode forth as if to hold a conference he was the son of an iroquois hunter who had been cruelly murdered by the blackfeet at a small stream below the mountains which still bears his name in company with antoine rode forth a flathead indian whose once powerful tribe had been completely broken down in their wars with the blackfeet both of them therefore cherished the most vengeful hostility against these marauders of the mountains the blackfeet came to a halt one of the chiefs advanced singly and unarmed bearing the pipe of peace this overture was certainly pacific but antoine and the flathead were predisposed to hostility and pretended to consider it a treacherous movement  is your piece charged said antoine to his red companion  it is  then cock it and follow me  they met the blackfoot chief half way who extended his hand in friendship antoine grasped it  fire cried he  the flathead levelled his piece and brought the blackfoot to the ground antoine snatched off his scarlet blanket which was richly ornamented and galloped off with it as a trophy to the camp the bullets of the enemy whistling after him the indians immediately threw themselves into the edge of a swamp among willows and cottonwood trees interwoven with vines here they began to fortify themselves the women digging a trench and throwing up a breastwork of logs and branches deep hid in the bosom of the wood while the warriors skirmished at the edge to keep the trappers at bay  the latter took their station in a ravine in front whence they kept up a scattering fire as to wyeth and his little band of downeasters they were perfectly astounded by this second specimen of life in the wilderness the men being especially unused to bushfighting and the use of the rifle were at a loss how to proceed wyeth however acted as a skilful commander he got all his horses into camp and secured them then making a breastwork of his packs of goods he charged his men to remain in garrison and not to stir out of their fort for himself he mingled with the other leaders determined to take his share in the conflict  in the meantime an express had been sent off to the rendezvous for reinforcements captain sublette and his associate campbell were at their camp when the express came galloping across the plain waving his cap and giving the alarm blackfeet blackfeet a fight in the upper part of the valleyto arms to arms  the alarm was passed from camp to camp it was a common cause every one turned out with horse and rifle the nez perces and flatheads joined as fast as horseman could arm and mount he galloped off the valley was soon alive with white men and red men scouring at full speed  sublette ordered his men to keep to the camp being recruits from st louis and unused to indian warfare he and his friend campbell prepared for action throwing off their coats rolling up their sleeves and arming themselves with pistols and rifles they mounted their horses and dashed forward among the first as they rode along they made their wills in soldierlike style each stating how his effects should be disposed of in case of his death and appointing the other his executor  the blackfeet warriors had supposed the brigade of milton sublette all the foes they had to deal with and were astonished to behold the whole valley suddenly swarming with horsemen galloping to the field of action they withdrew into their fort which was completely hid from sight in the dark and tangled wood most of their women and children had retreated to the mountains the trappers now sallied forth and approached the swamp firing into the thickets at random the blackfeet had a better sight at their adversaries who were in the open field and a halfbreed was wounded in the shoulder  when captain sublette arrived he urged to penetrate the swamp and storm the fort but all hung back in awe of the dismal horrors of the place and the danger of attacking such desperadoes in their savage den the very indian allies though accustomed to bushfighting regarded it as almost impenetrable and full of frightful danger sublette was not to be turned from his purpose but offered to lead the way into the swamp campbell stepped forward to accompany him before entering the perilous wood sublette took his brothers aside and told them that in case he fell campbell who knew his will was to be his executor this done he grasped his rifle and pushed into the thickets followed by campbell sinclair the partisan from arkansas was at the edge of the wood with his brother and a few of his men excited by the gallant example of the two friends he pressed forward to share their dangers  the swamp was produced by the labors of the beaver which by damming up a stream had inundated a portion of the valley the place was all overgrown with woods and thickets so closely matted and entangled that it was impossible to see ten paces ahead and the three associates in peril had to crawl along one after another making their way by putting the branches and vines aside but doing it with caution lest they should attract the eye of some lurking marksman they took the lead by turns each advancing about twenty yards at a time and now and then hallooing to their men to follow some of the latter gradually entered the swamp and followed a little distance in their rear  they had now reached a more open part of the wood and had glimpses of the rude fortress from between the trees it was a mere breastwork as we have said of logs and branches with blankets buffalo robes and the leathern covers of lodges extended round the top as a screen the movements of the leaders as they groped their way had been descried by the sharpsighted enemy as sinclair who was in the advance was putting some branches aside he was shot through the body he fell on the spot take me to my brother said he to campbell the latter gave him in charge to some of the men who conveyed him out of the swamp  sublette now took the advance as he was reconnoitring the fort he perceived an indian peeping through an aperture in an instant his rifle was levelled and discharged and the ball struck the savage in the eye while he was reloading he called to campbell and pointed out to him the hole watch that place said he and you will soon have a fair chance for a shot scarce had he uttered the words when a ball struck him in the shoulder and almost wheeled him around his first thought was to take hold of his arm with his other hand and move it up and down he ascertained to his satisfaction that the bone was not broken the next moment he was so faint that he could not stand campbell took him in his arms and carried him out of the thicket the same shot that struck sublette wounded another man in the head  a brisk fire was now opened by the mountaineers from the wood answered occasionally from the fort unluckily the trappers and their allies in searching for the fort had got scattered so that wyeth and a number of nez perces approached the fort on the northwest side while others did the same on the opposite quarter a crossfire thus took place which occasionally did mischief to friends as well as foes an indian was shot down close to wyeth by a ball which he was convinced had been sped from the rifle of a trapper on the other side of the fort  the number of whites and their indian allies had by this time so much increased by arrivals from the rendezvous that the blackfeet were completely overmatched they kept doggedly in their fort however making no offer of surrender an occasional firing into the breastwork was kept up during the day now and then one of the indian allies in bravado would rush up to the fort fire over the ramparts tear off a buffalo robe or a scarlet blanket and return with it in triumph to his comrades most of the savage garrison that fell however were killed in the first part of the attack  at one time it was resolved to set fire to the fort and the squaws belonging to the allies were employed to collect combustibles this however was abandoned the nez perces being unwilling to destroy the robes and blankets and other spoils of the enemy which they felt sure would fall into their hands  the indians when fighting are prone to taunt and revile each other during one of the pauses of the battle the voice of the blackfeet chief was heard  so long said he as we had powder and ball we fought you in the open field when those were spent we retreated here to die with our women and children you may burn us in our fort but stay by our ashes and you who are so hungry for fighting will soon have enough there are four hundred lodges of our brethren at hand they will soon be heretheir arms are strongtheir hearts are bigthey will avenge us  this speech was translated two or three times by nez perce and creole interpreters by the time it was rendered into english the chief was made to say that four hundred lodges of his tribe were attacking the encampment at the other end of the valley every one now was for hurrying to the defence of the rendezvous a party was left to keep watch upon the fort the rest galloped off to the camp as night came on the trappers drew out of the swamp and remained about the skirts of the wood by morning their companions returned from the rendezvous with the report that all was safe as the day opened they ventured within the swamp and approached the fort all was silent they advanced up to it without opposition they entered it had been abandoned in the night and the blackfeet had effected their retreat carrying off their wounded on litters made of branches leaving bloody traces on the herbage the bodies of ten indians were found within the fort among them the one shot in the eye by sublette the blackfeet afterward reported that they had lost twentysix warriors in this battle thirtytwo horses were likewise found killed among them were some of those recently carried off from sublettes party in the night which showed that these were the very savages that had attacked him they proved to be an advance party of the main body of blackfeet which had been upon the trail of sublettes party five white men and one halfbreed were killed and several wounded seven of the nez perces were also killed and six wounded they had an old chief who was reputed as invulnerable in the course of the action he was hit by a spent ball and threw up blood but his skin was unbroken his people were now fully convinced that he was proof against powder and ball  a striking circumstance is related as having occurred the morning after the battle as some of the trappers and their indian allies were approaching the fort through the woods they beheld an indian woman of noble form and features leaning against a tree their surprise at her lingering here alone to fall into the hands of her enemies was dispelled when they saw the corpse of a warrior at her feet either she was so lost in grief as not to perceive their approach or a proud spirit kept her silent and motionless the indians set up a yell on discovering her and before the trappers could interfere her mangled body fell upon the corpse which she had refused to abandon we have heard this anecdote discredited by one of the leaders who had been in the battle but the fact may have taken place without his seeing it and been concealed from him it is an instance of female devotion even to the death which we are well disposed to believe and to record  after the battle the brigade of milton sublette together with the free trappers and wyeths new england band remained some days at the rendezvous to see if the main body of blackfeet intended to make an attack nothing of the kind occurring they once more put themselves in motion and proceeded on their route toward the southwest captain sublette having distributed his supplies had intended to set off on his return to st louis taking with him the peltries collected from the trappers and indians his wound however obliged him to postpone his departure several who were to have accompanied him became impatient of this delay among these was a young bostonian mr joseph more one of the followers of mr wyeth who had seen enough of mountain life and savage warfare and was eager to return to the abodes of civilization he and six others among whom were a mr foy of mississippi mr alfred k stephens of st louis and two grandsons of the celebrated daniel boon set out together in advance of sublettes party thinking they would make their way through the mountains  it was just five days after the battle of the swamp that these seven companions were making their way through jacksons hole a valley not far from the three tetons when as they were descending a hill a party of blackfeet that lay in ambush started up with terrific yells the horse of the young bostonian who was in front wheeled round with affright and threw his unskilled rider the young man scrambled up the side of the hill but unaccustomed to such wild scenes lost his presence of mind and stood as if paralyzed on the edge of a bank until the blackfeet came up and slew him on the spot his comrades had fled on the first alarm but two of them foy and stephens seeing his danger paused when they got half way up the hill turned back dismounted and hastened to his assistance foy was instantly killed stephens was severely wounded but escaped to die five days afterward the survivors returned to the camp of captain sublette bringing tidings of this new disaster that hardy leader as soon as he could bear the journey set out on his return to st louis accompanied by campbell as they had a number of packhorses richly laden with peltries to convoy they chose a different route through the mountains out of the way as they hoped of the lurking bands of blackfeet they succeeded in making the frontier in safety we remember to have seen them with their band about two or three months afterward passing through a skirt of woodland in the upper part of missouri their long cavalcade stretched in single file for nearly half a mile sublette still wore his arm in a sling the mountaineers in their rude hunting dresses armed with rifles and roughly mounted and leading their packhorses down a hill of the forest looked like banditti returning with plunder on the top of some of the packs were perched several halfbreed children perfect little imps with wild black eyes glaring from among elf locks these i was told were children of the trappers pledges of love from their squaw spouses in the wilderness     7

visit to the campgood fellowship      and good cheera carousea swagger a brawl and a      reconciliation  the blackfeet warriors when they effected their midnight retreat from their wild fastness in pierres hole fell back into the valley of the seedskedee or green river where they joined the main body of their band the whole force amounted to several hundred fighting men gloomy and exasperated by their late disaster they had with them their wives and children which incapacitated them from any bold and extensive enterprise of a warlike nature but when in the course of their wanderings they came in sight of the encampment of fontenelle who had moved some distance up green river valley in search of the free trappers they put up tremendous warcries and advanced fiercely as if to attack it second thoughts caused them to moderate their fury they recollected the severe lesson just received and could not but remark the strength of fontenelles position which had been chosen with great judgment  a formal talk ensued the blackfeet said nothing of the late battle of which fontenelle had as yet received no accounts the latter however knew the hostile and perfidious nature of these savages and took care to inform them of the encampment of captain bonneville that they might know there were more white men in the neighborhood the conference ended fontenelle sent a delaware indian of his party to conduct fifteen of the blackfeet to the camp of captain bonneville there was sic at that time two crow indians in the captains camp who had recently arrived there they looked with dismay at this deputation from their implacable enemies and gave the captain a terrible character of them assuring him that the best thing he could possibly do was to put those blackfeet deputies to death on the spot the captain however who had heard nothing of the conflict at pierres hole declined all compliance with this sage counsel he treated the grim warriors with his usual urbanity they passed some little time at the camp saw no doubt that everything was conducted with military skill and vigilance and that such an enemy was not to be easily surprised nor to be molested with impunity and then departed to report all that they had seen to their comrades  the two scouts which captain bonneville had sent out to seek for the band of free trappers expected by fontenelle and to invite them to his camp had been successful in their search and on the 12th of august those worthies made their appearance  to explain the meaning of the appellation free trapper it is necessary to state the terms on which the men enlist in the service of the fur companies some have regular wages and are furnished with weapons horses traps and other requisites these are under command and bound to do every duty required of them connected with the service such as hunting trapping loading and unloading the horses mounting guard and in short all the drudgery of the camp these are the hired trappers  the free trappers are a more independent class and in describing them we shall do little more than transcribe the graphic description of them by captain bonneville they come and go says he when and where they please provide their own horses arms and other equipments trap and trade on their own account and dispose of their skins and peltries to the highest bidder sometimes in a dangerous hunting ground they attach themselves to the camp of some trader for protection here they come under some restrictions they have to conform to the ordinary rules for trapping and to submit to such restraints and to take part in such general duties as are established for the good order and safety of the camp in return for this protection and for their camp keeping they are bound to dispose of all the beaver they take to the trader who commands the camp at a certain rate per skin or should they prefer seeking a market elsewhere they are to make him an allowance of from thirty to forty dollars for the whole hunt  there is an inferior order who either from prudence or poverty come to these dangerous hunting grounds without horses or accoutrements and are furnished by the traders these like the hired trappers are bound to exert themselves to the utmost in taking beaver which without skinning they render in at the traders lodge where a stipulated price for each is placed to their credit these though generally included in the generic name of free trappers have the more specific title of skin trappers  the wandering whites who mingle for any length of time with the savages have invariably a proneness to adopt savage habitudes but none more so than the free trappers it is a matter of vanity and ambition with them to discard everything that may bear the stamp of civilized life and to adopt the manners habits dress gesture and even walk of the indian you cannot pay a free trapper a greater compliment than to persuade him you have mistaken him for an indian brave and in truth the counterfeit is complete his hair suffered to attain to a great length is carefully combed out and either left to fall carelessly over his shoulders or plaited neatly and tied up in otter skins or particolored ribands a huntingshirt of ruffled calico of bright dyes or of ornamented leather falls to his knee below which curiously fashioned legging ornamented with strings fringes and a profusion of hawks bells reach to a costly pair of moccasons of the finest indian fabric richly embroidered with beads a blanket of scarlet or some other bright color hangs from his shoulders and is girt around his waist with a red sash in which he bestows his pistols knife and the stem of his indian pipe preparations either for peace or war his gun is lavishly decorated with brass tacks and vermilion and provided with a fringed cover occasionally of buckskin ornamented here and there with a feather his horse the noble minister to the pride pleasure and profit of the mountaineer is selected for his speed and spirit and prancing gait and holds a place in his estimation second only to himself he shares largely of his bounty and of his pride and pomp of trapping he is caparisoned in the most dashing and fantastic style the bridles and crupper are weightily embossed with beads and cockades and head mane and tail are interwoven with abundance of eagles plumes which flutter in the wind to complete this grotesque equipment the proud animal is bestreaked and bespotted with vermilion or with white clay whichever presents the most glaring contrast to his real color  such is the account given by captain bonneville of these rangers of the wilderness and their appearance at the camp was strikingly characteristic they came dashing forward at full speed firing their fusees and yelling in indian style their dark sunburned faces and long flowing hair their legging flaps moccasons and richlydyed blankets and their painted horses gaudily caparisoned gave them so much the air and appearance of indians that it was difficult to persuade ones self that they were white men and had been brought up in civilized life  captain bonneville who was delighted with the game look of these cavaliers of the mountains welcomed them heartily to his camp and ordered a free allowance of grog to regale them which soon put them in the most braggart spirits they pronounced the captain the finest fellow in the world and his men all bons garcons jovial lads and swore they would pass the day with them they did so and a day it was of boast and swagger and rodomontade the prime bullies and braves among the free trappers had each his circle of novices from among the captains band mere greenhorns men unused to indian life mangeurs de lard or porkeaters as such newcomers are superciliously called by the veterans of the wilderness these he would astonish and delight by the hour with prodigious tales of his doings among the indians and of the wonders he had seen and the wonders he had performed in his adventurous peregrinations among the mountains  in the evening the free trappers drew off and returned to the camp of fontenelle highly delighted with their visit and with their new acquaintances and promising to return the following day they kept their word day after day their visits were repeated they became hail fellow well met with captain bonnevilles men treat after treat succeeded until both parties got most potently convinced or rather confounded by liquor now came on confusion and uproar the free trappers were no longer suffered to have all the swagger to themselves the camp bullies and prime trappers of the party began to ruffle up and to brag in turn of their perils and achievements each now tried to outboast and outtalk the other a quarrel ensued as a matter of course and a general fight according to frontier usage the two factions drew out their forces for a pitched battle they fell to work and belabored each other with might and main kicks and cuffs and dry blows were as well bestowed as they were well merited until having fought to their hearts content and been drubbed into a familiar acquaintance with each others prowess and good qualities they ended the fight by becoming firmer friends than they could have been rendered by a years peaceable companionship  while captain bonneville amused himself by observing the habits and characteristics of this singular class of men and indulged them for the time in all their vagaries he profited by the opportunity to collect from them information concerning the different parts of the country about which they had been accustomed to range the characters of the tribes and in short everything important to his enterprise he also succeeded in securing the services of several to guide and aid him in his peregrinations among the mountains and to trap for him during the ensuing season having strengthened his party with such valuable recruits he felt in some measure consoled for the loss of the delaware indians decoyed from him by mr fontenelle     8       plans for the wintersalmon riverabundance of salmon west      of the mountainsnew arrangementscachescerres      detachmentmovements

the      battlenezperceindiansarrival atsalmon river  the information derived from the free trappers determined captain bonneville as to his further movements he learned that in the green river valley the winters were severe the snow frequently falling to the depth of several feet and that there was no good wintering ground in the neighborhood the upper part of salmon river was represented as far more eligible besides being in an excellent beaver country and thither the captain resolved to bend his course  the salmon river is one of the upper branches of the oregon or columbia and takes its rise from various sources among a group of mountains to the northwest of the wind river chain it owes its name to the immense shoals of salmon which ascend it in the months of september and october the salmon on the west side of the rocky mountains are like the buffalo on the eastern plains vast migratory supplies for the wants of man that come and go with the seasons as the buffalo in countless throngs find their certain way in the transient pasturage on the prairies along the fresh banks of the rivers and up every valley and green defile of the mountains so the salmon at their allotted seasons regulated by a sublime and allseeing providence swarm in myriads up the great rivers and find their way up their main branches and into the minutest tributory streams so as to pervade the great arid plains and to penetrate even among barren mountains thus wandering tribes are fed in the desert places of the wilderness where there is no herbage for the animals of the chase and where but for these periodical supplies it would be impossible for man to subsist  the rapid currents of the rivers which run into the pacific render the ascent of them very exhausting to the salmon when the fish first run up the rivers they are fat and in fine order the struggle against impetuous streams and frequent rapids gradually renders them thin and weak and great numbers are seen floating down the rivers on their backs as the season advances and the water becomes chilled they are flung in myriads on the shores where the wolves and bears assemble to banquet on them often they rot in such quantities along the river banks as to taint the atmosphere they are commonly from two to three feet long  captain bonneville now made his arrangements for the autumn and the winter the nature of the country through which he was about to travel rendered it impossible to proceed with wagons he had more goods and supplies of various kinds also than were required for present purposes or than could be conveniently transported on horseback aided therefore by a few confidential men he made caches or secret pits during the night when all the rest of the camp were asleep and in these deposited the superfluous effects together with the wagons all traces of the caches were then carefully obliterated this is a common expedient with the traders and trappers of the mountains having no established posts and magazines they make these caches or deposits at certain points whither they repair occasionally for supplies it is an expedient derived from the wandering tribes of indians  many of the horses were still so weak and lame as to be unfit for a long scramble through the mountains these were collected into one cavalcade and given in charge to an experienced trapper of the name of matthieu he was to proceed westward with a brigade of trappers to bear river a stream to the west of the green river or colorado where there was good pasturage for the horses in this neighborhood it was expected he would meet the shoshonie villages or bands on their yearly migrations with whom he was to trade for peltries and provisions after he had traded with these people finished his trapping and recruited the strength of the horses he was to proceed to salmon river and rejoin captain bonneville who intended to fix his quarters there for the winter  while these arrangements were in progress in the camp of captain bonneville there was a sudden bustle and stir in the camp of fontenelle one of the partners of the american fur company had arrived in all haste from the rendezvous at pierres hole in quest of the supplies the competition between the two rival companies was just now at its height and prosecuted with unusual zeal the tramontane concerns of the rocky mountain fur company were managed by two resident partners fitzpatrick and bridger those of the american fur company by vanderburgh and dripps the latter were ignorant of the mountain regions but trusted to make up by vigilance and activity for their want of knowledge of the country  fitzpatrick an experienced trader and trapper knew the evils of competition in the same hunting grounds and had proposed that the two companies should divide the country so as to hunt in different directions this proposition being rejected he had exerted himself to get first into the field his exertions as have already been shown were effectual the early arrival of sublette with supplies had enabled the various brigades of the rocky mountain company to start off to their respective hunting grounds fitzpatrick himself with his associate bridger had pushed off with a strong party of trappers for a prime beaver country to the northnorthwest  this had put vanderburgh upon his mettle he had hastened on to meet fontenelle finding him at his camp in green river valley he immediately furnished himself with the supplies put himself at the head of the free trappers and delawares and set off with all speed determined to follow hard upon the heels of fitzpatrick and bridger of the adventures of these parties among the mountains and the disastrous effects of their competition we shall have occasion to treat in a future chapter  fontenelle having now delivered his supplies and accomplished his errand struck his tents and set off on his return to the yellowstone captain bonneville and his band therefore remained alone in the green river valley and their situation might have been perilous had the blackfeet band still lingered in the vicinity those marauders however had been dismayed at finding so many resolute and wellappointed parties of white men in the neighborhood they had therefore abandoned this part of the country passing over the headwaters of the green river and bending their course towards the yellowstone misfortune pursued them their route lay through the country of their deadly enemies the crows in the wind river valley which lies east of the mountains they were encountered by a powerful war party of that tribe and completely put to rout forty of them were killed many of their women and children captured and the scattered fugitives hunted like wild beasts until they were completely chased out of the crow country  on the 22d of august captain bonneville broke up his camp and set out on his route for salmon river his baggage was arranged in packs three to a mule or packhorse one being disposed on each side of the animal and one on the top the three forming a load of from one hundred and eighty to two hundred and twenty pounds this is the trappers style of loading packhorses his men however were inexpert at adjusting the packs which were prone to get loose and slip off so that it was necessary to keep a rearguard to assist in reloading a few days experience however brought them into proper training  their march lay up the valley of the seedskedee overlooked to the right by the lofty peaks of the wind river mountains from bright little lakes and fountainheads of this remarkable bed of mountains poured forth the tributary streams of the seedskedee some came rushing down gullies and ravines others tumbled in crystal cascades from inaccessible clefts and rocks and others winding their way in rapid and pellucid currents across the valley to throw themselves into the main river so transparent were these waters that the trout with which they abounded could be seen gliding about as if in the air and their pebbly beds were distinctly visible at the depth of many feet this beautiful and diaphanous quality of the rocky mountain streams prevails for a long time after they have mingled their waters and swollen into important rivers  issuing from the upper part of the valley captain bonneville continued to the eastnortheast across rough and lofty ridges and deep rocky defiles extremely fatiguing both to man and horse among his hunters was a delaware indian who had remained faithful to him his name was buckeye he had often prided himself on his skill and success in coping with the grizzly bear that terror of the hunters though crippled in the left arm he declared he had no hesitation to close with a wounded bear and attack him with a sword if armed with a rifle he was willing to brave the animal when in full force and fury he had twice an opportunity of proving his prowess in the course of this mountain journey and was each time successful his mode was to seat himself upon the ground with his rifle cocked and resting on his lame arm thus prepared he would await the approach of the bear with perfect coolness nor pull trigger until he was close at hand in each instance he laid the monster dead upon the spot  a march of three or four days through savage and lonely scenes brought captain bonneville to the fatal defile of jacksons hole where poor more and foy had been surprised and murdered by the blackfeet the feelings of the captain were shocked at beholding the bones of these unfortunate young men bleaching among the rocks and he caused them to be decently interred  on the 3d of september he arrived on the summit of a mountain which commanded a full view of the eventful valley of pierres hole whence he could trace the winding of its stream through green meadows and forests of willow and cottonwood and have a prospect between distant mountains of the lava plains of snake river dimly spread forth like a sleeping ocean below  after enjoying this magnificent prospect he descended into the valley and visited the scenes of the late desperate conflict there were the remains of the rude fortress in the swamp shattered by rifle shot and strewed with the mingled bones of savages and horses there was the late populous and noisy rendezvous with the traces of trappers camps and indian lodges but their fires were extinguished the motley assemblage of trappers and hunters white traders and indian braves had all dispersed to different points of the wilderness and the valley had relapsed into its pristine solitude and silence  that night the captain encamped upon the battle ground the next day he resumed his toilsome peregrinations through the mountains for upwards of two weeks he continued his painful march both men and horses suffering excessively at times from hunger and thirst at length on the 19th of september he reached the upper waters of salmon river  the weather was cold and there were symptoms of an impending storm the night set in but buckeye the delaware indian was missing he had left the party early in the morning to hunt by himself according to his custom fears were entertained lest he should lose his way and become bewildered in tempestuous weather these fears increased on the following morning when a violent snowstorm came on which soon covered the earth to the depth of several inches captain bonneville immediately encamped and sent out scouts in every direction after some search buckeye was discovered quietly seated at a considerable distance in the rear waiting the expected approach of the party not knowing that they had passed the snow having covered their trail  on the ensuing morning they resumed their march at an early hour but had not proceeded far when the hunters who were beating up the country in the advance came galloping back making signals to encamp and crying indians indians  captain bonneville immediately struck into a skirt of wood and prepared for action the savages were now seen trooping over the hills in great numbers one of them left the main body and came forward singly making signals of peace he announced them as a band of nez perces or piercednose indians friendly to the whites whereupon an invitation was returned by captain bonneville for them to come and encamp with him they halted for a short time to make their toilette an operation as important with an indian warrior as with a fashionable beauty this done they arranged themselves in martial style the chiefs leading the van the braves following in a long line painted and decorated and topped off with fluttering plumes in this way they advanced shouting and singing firing off their fusees and clashing their shields the two parties encamped hard by each other the nez perces were on a hunting expedition but had been almost famished on their march they had no provisions left but a few dried salmon yet finding the white men equally in want they generously offered to share even this meager pittance and frequently repeated the offer with an earnestness that left no doubt of their sincerity their generosity won the heart of captain bonneville and produced the most cordial good will on the part of his men for two days that the parties remained in company the most amicable intercourse prevailed and they parted the best of friends captain bonneville detached a few men under mr cerre an able leader to accompany the nez perces on their hunting expedition and to trade with them for meat for the winters supply after this he proceeded down the river about five miles below the forks when he came to a halt on the 26th of september to establish his winter quarters     9       horses turned loosepreparations for winter quarters      hungry timesnezperces their honesty piety pacific      habits religious ceremoniescaptain bonnevilles      conversations with themtheir love of gambling  it was gratifying to captain bonneville after so long and toilsome a course of travel to relieve his poor jaded horses of the burden under which they were almost ready to give out and to behold them rolling upon the grass and taking a long repose after all their sufferings indeed so exhausted were they that those employed under the saddle were no longer capable of hunting for the daily subsistence of the camp  all hands now set to work to prepare a winter cantonment a temporary fortification was thrown up for the protection of the party a secure and comfortable pen into which the horses could be driven at night and huts were built for the reception of the merchandise  this done captain bonneville made a distribution of his forces twenty men were to remain with him in garrison to protect the property the rest were organized into three brigades and sent off in different directions to subsist themselves by hunting the buffalo until the snow should become too deep  indeed it would have been impossible to provide for the whole party in this neighborhood it was at the extreme western limit of the buffalo range and these animals had recently been completely hunted out of the neighborhood by the nez perces so that although the hunters of the garrison were continually on the alert ranging the country round they brought in scarce game sufficient to keep famine from the door now and then there was a scanty meal of fish or wildfowl occasionally an antelope but frequently the cravings of hunger had to be appeased with roots or the flesh of wolves and muskrats rarely could the inmates of the cantonment boast of having made a full meal and never of having wherewithal for the morrow in this way they starved along until the 8th of october when they were joined by a party of five families of nez perces who in some measure reconciled them to the hardships of their situation by exhibiting a lot still more destitute a more forlorn set they had never encountered they had not a morsel of meat or fish nor anything to subsist on excepting roots wild rosebuds the barks of certain plants and other vegetable production neither had they any weapon for hunting or defence excepting an old spear yet the poor fellows made no murmur nor complaint but seemed accustomed to their hard fare if they could not teach the white men their practical stoicism they at least made them acquainted with the edible properties of roots and wild rosebuds and furnished them a supply from their own store the necessities of the camp at length became so urgent that captain bonneville determined to dispatch a party to the horse prairie a plain to the north of his cantonment to procure a supply of provisions when the men were about to depart he proposed to the nez perces that they or some of them should join the huntingparty to his surprise they promptly declined he inquired the reason for their refusal seeing that they were in nearly as starving a situation as his own people they replied that it was a sacred day with them and the great spirit would be angry should they devote it to hunting they offered however to accompany the party if it would delay its departure until the following day but this the pinching demands of hunger would not permit and the detachment proceeded  a few days afterward four of them signified to captain bonneville that they were about to hunt what exclaimed he without guns or arrows and with only one old spear what do you expect to kill they smiled among themselves but made no answer preparatory to the chase they performed some religious rites and offered up to the great spirit a few short prayers for safety and success then having received the blessings of their wives they leaped upon their horses and departed leaving the whole party of christian spectators amazed and rebuked by this lesson of faith and dependence on a supreme and benevolent being accustomed adds captain bonneville as i had heretofore been to find the wretched indian revelling in blood and stained by every vice which can degrade human nature i could scarcely realize the scene which i had witnessed wonder at such unaffected tenderness and piety where it was least to have been sought contended in all our bosoms with shame and confusion at receiving such pure and wholesome instructions from creatures so far below us in the arts and comforts of life the simple prayers of the poor indians were not unheard in the course of four or five days they returned laden with meat captain bonneville was curious to know how they had attained such success with such scanty means they gave him to understand that they had chased the buffalo at full speed until they tired them down when they easily dispatched them with the spear and made use of the same weapon to flay the carcasses to carry through their lessons to their christian friends the poor savages were as charitable as they had been pious and generously shared with them the spoils of their hunting giving them food enough to last for several days  a further and more intimate intercourse with this tribe gave captain bonneville still greater cause to admire their strong devotional feeling simply to call these people religious says he would convey but a faint idea of the deep hue of piety and devotion which pervades their whole conduct their honesty is immaculate and their purity of purpose and their observance of the rites of their religion are most uniform and remarkable they are certainly more like a nation of saints than a horde of savages  in fact the antibelligerent policy of this tribe may have sprung from the doctrines of christian charity for it would appear that they had imbibed some notions of the christian faith from catholic missionaries and traders who had been among them they even had a rude calendar of the fasts and festivals of the romish church and some traces of its ceremonials these have become blended with their own wild rites and present a strange medley civilized and barbarous on the sabbath men women and children array themselves in their best style and assemble round a pole erected at the head of the camp here they go through a wild fantastic ceremonial strongly resembling the religious dance of the shaking quakers but from its enthusiasm much more striking and impressive during the intervals of the ceremony the principal chiefs who officiate as priests instruct them in their duties and exhort them to virtue and good deeds  there is something antique and patriarchal observes captain bonneville in this union of the offices of leader and priest as there is in many of their customs and manners which are all strongly imbued with religion  the worthy captain indeed appears to have been strongly interested by this gleam of unlooked for light amidst the darkness of the wilderness he exerted himself during his sojourn among this simple and welldisposed people to inculcate as far as he was able the gentle and humanizing precepts of the christian faith and to make them acquainted with the leading points of its history and it speaks highly for the purity and benignity of his heart that he derived unmixed happiness from the task  many a time says he was my little lodge thronged or rather piled with hearers for they lay on the ground one leaning over the other until there was no further room all listening with greedy ears to the wonders which the great spirit had revealed to the white man no other subject gave them half the satisfaction or commanded half the attention and but few scenes in my life remain so freshly on my memory or are so pleasurably recalled to my contemplation as these hours of intercourse with a distant and benighted race in the midst of the desert  the only excesses indulged in by this temperate and exemplary people appear to be gambling and horseracing in these they engage with an eagerness that amounts to infatuation knots of gamblers will assemble before one of their lodge fires early in the evening and remain absorbed in the chances and changes of the game until long after dawn of the following day as the night advances they wax warmer and warmer bets increase in amount one loss only serves to lead to a greater

indians of the nez perce tribe arrived at captain bonnevilles encampment they were on their way homeward but had been obliged to swerve from their ordinary route through the mountains by deep snows their new route took them though the horse prairie in traversing it they had been attracted by the distant smoke of a camp fire and on stealing near to reconnoitre had discovered a war party of blackfeet they had several horses with them and as they generally go on foot on warlike excursions it was concluded that these horses had been captured in the course of their maraudings  this intelligence awakened solicitude on the mind of captain bonneville for the party of hunters whom he had sent to that neighborhood and the nez perces when informed of the circumstances shook their heads and declared their belief that the horses they had seen had been stolen from that very party anxious for information on the subject captain bonneville dispatched two hunters to beat up the country in that direction they searched in vain not a trace of the men could be found but they got into a region destitute of game where they were wellnigh famished at one time they were three entire days without a mouthful of food at length they beheld a buffalo grazing at the foot of the mountain after manoeuvring so as to get within shot they fired but merely wounded him he took to flight and they followed him over hill and dale with the eagerness and perseverance of starving men a more lucky shot brought him to the ground stanfield sprang upon him plunged his knife into his throat and allayed his raging hunger by drinking his blood a fire was instantly kindled beside the carcass when the two hunters cooked and ate again and again until perfectly gorged they sank to sleep before their hunting fire on the following morning they rose early made another hearty meal then loading themselves with buffalo meat set out on their return to the camp to report the fruitlessness of their mission  at length after six weeks absence the hunters made their appearance and were received with joy proportioned to the anxiety that had been felt on their account they had hunted with success on the prairie but while busy drying buffalo meat were joined by a few panicstricken flatheads who informed them that a powerful band of blackfeet was at hand the hunters immediately abandoned the dangerous hunting ground and accompanied the flatheads to their village here they found mr cerre and the detachment of hunters sent with him to accompany the hunting party of the nez perces  after remaining some time at the village until they supposed the blackfeet to have left the neighborhood they set off with some of mr cerres men for the cantonment at salmon river where they arrived without accident they informed captain bonneville however that not far from his quarters they had found a wallet of fresh meat and a cord which they supposed had been left by some prowling blackfeet a few days afterward mr cerre with the remainder of his men likewise arrived at the cantonment  mr walker one of his subleaders who had gone with a band of twenty hunters to range the country just beyond the horse prairie had likewise his share of adventures with the allpervading blackfeet at one of his encampments the guard stationed to keep watch round the camp grew weary of their duty and feeling a little too secure and too much at home on these prairies retired to a small grove of willows to amuse themselves with a social game of cards called old sledge which is as popular among these trampers of the prairies as whist or ecarte among the polite circles of the cities from the midst of their sport they were suddenly roused by a discharge of firearms and a shrill warwhoop starting on their feet and snatching up their rifles they beheld in dismay their horses and mules already in possession of the enemy who had stolen upon the camp unperceived while they were spellbound by the magic of old sledge the indians sprang upon the animals barebacked and endeavored to urge them off under a galling fire that did some execution the mules however confounded by the hurlyburly and disliking their new riders kicked up their heels and dismounted half of them in spite of their horsemanship this threw the rest into confusion they endeavored to protect their unhorsed comrades from the furious assaults of the whites but after a scene of confusion worse confounded horses and mules were abandoned and the indians betook themselves to the bushes here they quickly scratched holes in the earth about two feet deep in which they prostrated themselves and while thus screened from the shots of the white men were enabled to make such use of their bows and arrows and fusees as to repulse their assailants and to effect their retreat this adventure threw a temporary stigma upon the game of old sledge  in the course of the autumn four iroquois hunters driven by the snow from their hunting grounds made their appearance at the cantonment they were kindly welcomed and during their sojourn made themselves useful in a variety of ways being excellent trappers and firstrate woodsmen they were of the remnants of a party of iroquois hunters that came from canada into these mountain regions many years previously in the employ of the hudsons bay company they were led by a brave chieftain named pierre who fell by the hands of the blackfeet and gave his name to the fated valley of pierres hole this branch of the iroquois tribe has ever since remained among these mountains at mortal enmity with the blackfeet and have lost many of their prime hunters in their feuds with that ferocious race some of them fell in with general ashley in the course of one of his gallant excursions into the wilderness and have continued ever since in the employ of the company  among the motley visitors to the winter quarters of captain bonneville was a party of pends oreilles or hangingears and their chief these indians have a strong resemblance in character and customs to the nez perces they amount to about three hundred lodges are well armed and possess great numbers of horses during the spring summer and autumn they hunt the buffalo about the headwaters of the missouri henrys fork of the snake river and the northern branches of salmon river their winter quarters are upon the racine amere where they subsist upon roots and dried buffalo meat upon this river the hudsons bay company have established a trading post where the pends oreilles and the flatheads bring their peltries to exchange for arms clothing and trinkets  this tribe like the nez perces evince strong and peculiar feelings of natural piety their religion is not a mere superstitious fear like that of most savages they evince abstract notions of morality a deep reverence for an overruling spirit and a respect for the rights of their fellow men in one respect their religion partakes of the pacific doctrines of the quakers they hold that the great spirit is displeased with all nations who wantonly engage in war they abstain therefore from all aggressive hostilities but though thus unoffending in their policy they are called upon continually to wage defensive warfare especially with the blackfeet with whom in the course of their hunting expeditions they come in frequent collision and have desperate battles their conduct as warriors is without fear or reproach and they can never be driven to abandon their hunting grounds  like most savages they are firm believers in dreams and in the power and efficacy of charms and amulets or medicines as they term them some of their braves also who have had numerous hairbreadth scapes like the old nez perce chief in the battle of pierres hole are believed to wear a charmed life and to be bulletproof of these gifted beings marvelous anecdotes are related which are most potently believed by their fellow savages and sometimes almost credited by the white hunters

salmon river we will inquire after the fortunes of those doughty rivals of the rocky mountains and american fur companies who started off for the trapping grounds to the northnorthwest  fitzpatrick and bridger of the former company as we have already shown having received their supplies had taken the lead and hoped to have the first sweep of the hunting grounds vanderburgh and dripps however the two resident partners of the opposite company by extraordinary exertions were enabled soon to put themselves upon their traces and pressed forward with such speed as to overtake them just as they had reached the heart of the beaver country in fact being ignorant of the best trapping grounds it was their object to follow on and profit by the superior knowledge of the other party  nothing could equal the chagrin of fitzpatrick and bridger at being dogged by their inexperienced rivals especially after their offer to divide the country with them they tried in every way to blind and baffle them to steal a march upon them or lead them on a wrong scent but all in vain vanderburgh made up by activity and intelligence for his ignorance of the country was always wary always on the alert discovered every movement of his rivals however secret and was not to be eluded or misled  fitzpatrick and his colleague now lost all patience since the others persisted in following them they determined to give them an unprofitable chase and to sacrifice the hunting season rather than share the products with their rivals they accordingly took up their line of march down the course of the missouri keeping the main blackfoot trail and tramping doggedly forward without stopping to set a single trap the others beat the hoof after them for some time but by degrees began to perceive that they were on a wildgoose chase and getting into a country perfectly barren to the trapper they now came to a halt and bethought themselves how to make up for lost time and improve the remainder of the season it was thought best to divide their forces and try different trapping grounds while dripps went in one direction vanderburgh with about fifty men proceeded in another the latter in his headlong march had got into the very heart of the blackfoot country yet seems to have been unconscious of his danger as his scouts were out one day they came upon the traces of a recent band of savages there were the deserted fires still smoking surrounded by the carcasses of buffaloes just killed it was evident a party of blackfeet had been frightened from their hunting camp and had retreated probably to seek reinforcements the scouts hastened back to the camp and told vanderburgh what they had seen he made light of the alarm and taking nine men with him galloped off to reconnoitre for himself he found the deserted hunting camp just as they had represented it there lay the carcasses of buffaloes partly dismembered there were the smouldering fires still sending up their wreaths of smoke everything bore traces of recent and hasty retreat and gave reason to believe that the savages were still lurking in the neighborhood with heedless daring vanderburgh put himself upon their trail to trace them to their place of concealment it led him over prairies and through skirts of woodland until it entered a dark and dangerous ravine vanderburgh pushed in without hesitation followed by his little band they soon found themselves in a gloomy dell between steep banks overhung with trees where the profound silence was only broken by the tramp of their own horses  suddenly the horrid warwhoop burst on their ears mingled with the sharp report of rifles and a legion of savages sprang from their concealments yelling and shaking their buffalo robes to frighten the horses vanderburghs horse fell mortally wounded by the first discharge in his fall he pinned his rider to the ground who called in vain upon his men to assist in extricating him one was shot down scalped a few paces distant most of the others were severely wounded and sought their safety in flight the savages approached to dispatch the unfortunate leader as he lay struggling beneath his horse he had still his rifle in his hand and his pistols in his belt the first savage that advanced received the contents of the rifle in his breast and fell dead upon the spot but before vanderburgh could draw a pistol a blow from a tomahawk laid him prostrate and he was dispatched by repeated wounds  such was the fate of major henry vanderburgh one of the best and worthiest leaders of the american fur company who by his manly bearing and dauntless courage is said to have made himself universally popular among the boldhearted rovers of the wilderness  those of the little band who escaped fled in consternation to the camp and spread direful reports of the force and ferocity of the enemy the party being without a head were in complete confusion and dismay and made a precipitate retreat without attempting to recover the remains of their butchered leader they made no halt until they reached the encampment of the pends oreilles or hangingears where they offered a reward for the recovery of the body but without success it never could be found  in the meantime fitzpatrick and bridger of the rocky mountain company fared but little better than their rivals in their eagerness to mislead them they betrayed themselves into danger and got into a region infested with the blackfeet they soon found that foes were on the watch for them but they were experienced in indian warfare and not to be surprised at night nor drawn into an ambush in the daytime as the evening advanced the horses were all brought in and picketed and a guard was stationed round the camp at the earliest streak of day one of the leaders would mount his horse and gallop off full speed for about half a mile then look round for indian trails to ascertain whether there had been any lurkers round the camp returning slowly he would reconnoitre every ravine and thicket where there might be an ambush this done he would gallop off in an opposite direction and repeat the same scrutiny finding all things safe the horses would be turned loose to graze but always under the eye of a guard  a caution equally vigilant was observed in the march on approaching any defile or place where an enemy might lie in wait and scouts were always kept in the advance or along the ridges and rising grounds on the flanks  at length one day a large band of blackfeet appeared in the open field but in the vicinity of rocks and cliffs they kept at a wary distance but made friendly signs the trappers replied in the same way but likewise kept aloof a small party of indians now advanced bearing the pipe of peace they were met by an equal number of white men and they formed a group midway between the two bands where the pipe was circulated from hand to hand and smoked with all due ceremony an instance of natural affection took place at this pacific meeting among the free trappers in the rocky mountain band was a spirited young mexican named loretto who in the course of his wanderings had ransomed a beautiful blackfoot girl from a band of crows by whom she had been captured he made her his wife after the indian style and she had followed his fortunes ever since with the most devoted affection  among the blackfeet warriors who advanced with the calumet of peace she recognized a brother leaving her infant with loretto she rushed forward and threw herself upon her brothers neck who clasped his longlost sister to his heart with a warmth of affection but little compatible with the reputed stoicism of the savage  while this scene was taking place bridger left the main body of trappers and rode slowly toward the group of smokers with his rifle resting across the pommel of his saddle the chief of the blackfeet stepped forward to meet him from some unfortunate feeling of distrust bridger cocked his rifle just as the chief was extending his hand in friendship the quick ear of the savage caught the click of the lock in a twinkling he grasped the barrel forced the muzzle downward and the contents were discharged into the earth at his feet his next movement was to wrest the weapon from the hand of bridger and fell him with it to the earth he might have found this no easy task had not the unfortunate leader received two arrows in his back during the struggle  the chief now sprang into the vacant saddle and galloped off to his band a wild hurryskurry scene ensued each party took to the banks the rocks and trees to gain favorable positions and an irregular firing was kept up on either side without much effect the indian girl had been hurried off by her people at the outbreak of the affray she would have returned through the dangers of the fight to her husband and her child but was prevented by her brother the young mexican saw her struggles and her agony and heard her piercing cries with a generous impulse he caught up the child in his arms rushed forward regardless of indian shaft or rifle and placed it in safety upon her bosom even the savage heart of the blackfoot chief was reached by this noble deed he pronounced loretto a madman for his temerity but bade him depart in peace the young mexican hesitated he urged to have his wife restored to him but her brother interfered and the countenance of the chief grew dark the girl he said belonged to his tribeshe must remain with her people loretto would still have lingered but his wife implored him to depart lest his life should be endangered it was with the greatest reluctance that he returned to his companions  the approach of night put an end to the skirmishing fire of the adverse parties and the savages drew off without renewing their hostilities we cannot but remark that both in this affair and that of pierres hole the affray commenced by a hostile act on the part of white men at the moment when the indian warrior was extending the hand of amity in neither instance as far as circumstances have been stated to us by different persons do we see any reason to suspect the savage chiefs of perfidy in their overtures of friendship they advanced in the confiding way usual among indians when they bear the pipe of peace and consider themselves sacred from attack if we violate the sanctity of this ceremonial by any hostile movement on our part it is we who incur the charge of faithlessness and we doubt not that in both these instances the white men have been considered by the blackfeet as the aggressors and have in consequence been held up as men not to be trusted  a word to conclude the romantic incident of loretto and his indian bride a few months subsequent to the event just related the young mexican settled his accounts with the rocky mountain company and obtained his discharge he then left his comrades and set off to rejoin his wife and child among her people and we understand that at the time we are writing these pages he resides at a tradinghouse established of late by the american fur company in the blackfoot country where he acts as an interpreter and has his indian girl with him     12

bonneville remained in his temporary post on salmon river he was now in the full enjoyment of his wishes leading a hunters life in the heart of the wilderness with all its wild populace around him beside his own people motley in character and costumecreole kentuckian indian halfbreed hired trapper and free trapperhe was surrounded by encampments of nez perces and flatheads with their droves of horses covering the hills and plains it was he declares a wild and bustling scene the hunting parties of white men and red men continually sallying forth and returning the groups at the various encampments some cooking some working some amusing themselves at different games the neighing of horses the braying of asses the resounding strokes of the axe the sharp report of the rifle the whoop the halloo and the frequent burst of laughter all in the midst of a region suddenly roused from perfect silence and loneliness by this transient hunters sojourn realized he says the idea of a populous solitude  the kind and genial character of the captain had evidently its influence on the opposite races thus fortuitously congregated together the most perfect harmony prevailed between them the indians he says were friendly in their dispositions and honest to the most scrupulous degree in their intercourse with the white men it is true they were somewhat importunate in their curiosity and apt to be continually in the way examining everything with keen and prying eye and watching every movement of the white men all this however was borne with great goodhumor by the captain and through his example by his men indeed throughout all his transactions he shows himself the friend of the poor indians and his conduct toward them is above all praise  the nez perces the flatheads and the hangingears pride themselves upon the number of their horses of which they possess more in proportion than any other of the mountain tribes within the buffalo range many of the indian warriors and hunters encamped around captain bonneville possess from thirty to forty horses each their horses are stout wellbuilt ponies of great wind and capable of enduring the severest hardship and fatigue the swiftest of them however are those obtained from the whites while sufficiently young to become acclimated and inured to the rough service of the mountains  by degrees the populousness of this encampment began to produce its inconveniences the immense droves of horses owned by the indians consumed the herbage of the surrounding hills while to drive them to any distant pasturage in a neighborhood abounding with lurking and deadly enemies would be to endanger the loss both of man and beast game too began to grow scarce it was soon hunted and frightened out of the vicinity and though the indians made a wide circuit through the mountains in the hope of driving the buffalo toward the cantonment their expedition was unsuccessful it was plain that so large a party could not subsist themselves there nor in any one place throughout the winter captain bonneville therefore altered his whole arrangements he detached fifty men toward the south to winter upon snake river and to trap about its waters in the spring with orders to rejoin him in the month of july at horse creek in green river valley which he had fixed upon as the general rendezvous of his company for the ensuing year  of all his late party he now retained with him merely a small number of free trappers with whom he intended to sojourn among the nez perces and flatheads and adopt the indian mode of moving with the game and grass those bands in effect shortly afterward broke up their encampments and set off for a less beaten neighborhood captain bonneville remained behind for a few days that he might secretly prepare caches in which to deposit everything not required for current use thus lightened of all superfluous encumbrance he set off on the 20th of november to rejoin his indian allies he found them encamped in a secluded part of the country at the head of a small stream considering themselves out of all danger in this sequestered spot from their old enemies the blackfeet their encampment manifested the most negligent security their lodges were scattered in every direction and their horses covered every hill for a great distance round grazing upon the upland bunch grass which grew in great abundance and though dry retained its nutritious properties instead of losing them like other grasses in the autumn  when the nez perces flatheads and pends oreilles are encamped in a dangerous neighborhood says captain bonneville the greatest care is taken of their horses those prime articles of indian wealth and objects of indian depredation each warrior has his horse tied by one foot at night to a stake planted before his lodge here they remain until broad daylight by that time the young men of the camp are already ranging over the surrounding hills each family then drives its horses to some eligible spot where they are left to graze unattended a young indian repairs occasionally to the pasture to give them water and to see that all is well so accustomed are the horses to this management that they keep together in the pasture where they have been left as the sun sinks behind the hills they may be seen moving from all points toward the camp where they surrender themselves to be tied up for the night even in situations of danger the indians rarely set guards over their camp at night intrusting that office entirely to their vigilant and welltrained dogs  in an encampment however of such fancied security as that in which captain bonneville found his indian friends much of these precautions with respect to their horses are omitted they merely drive them at nightfall to some sequestered little dell and leave them there at perfect liberty until the morning  one object of captain bonneville in wintering among these indians was to procure a supply of horses against the spring they were however extremely unwilling to part with any and it was with great difficulty that he purchased at the rate of twenty dollars each a few for the use of some of his free trappers who were on foot and dependent on him for their equipment  in this encampment captain bonneville remained from the 21st of november to the 9th of december during this period the thermometer ranged from thirteen to fortytwo degrees there were occasional falls of snow but it generally melted away almost immediately and the tender blades of new grass began to shoot up among the old on the 7th of december however the thermometer fell to seven degrees  the reader will recollect that on distributing his forces when in green river valley captain bonneville had detached a party headed by a leader of the name of matthieu with all the weak and disabled horses to sojourn about bear river meet the shoshonie bands and afterward to rejoin him at his winter camp on salmon river  more than sufficient time had elapsed yet matthieu failed to make his appearance and uneasiness began to be felt on his account captain bonneville sent out four men to range the country through which he would have to pass and endeavor to get some information concerning him for his route lay across the great snake river plain which spreads itself out like an arabian desert and on which a cavalcade could be descried at a great distance the scouts soon returned having proceeded no further than the edge of the plain pretending that their horses were lame but it was evident they had feared to venture with so small a force into these exposed and dangerous regions  a disease which captain bonneville supposed to be pneumonia now appeared among the indians carrying off numbers of them after an illness of three or four days the worthy captain acted as physician prescribing profuse sweatings and copious bleedings and uniformly with success if the patient were subsequently treated with proper care in extraordinary cases the poor savages called in the aid of their own doctors or conjurors who officiated with great noise and mummery but with little benefit those who died during this epidemic were buried in graves after the manner of the whites but without any regard to the direction of the head it is a fact worthy of notice that while this malady made such ravages among the natives not a single white man had the slightest symptom of it  a familiar intercourse of some standing with the piercednose and flathead indians had now convinced captain bonneville of their amicable and inoffensive character he began to take a strong interest in them and conceived the idea of becoming a pacificator and healing the deadly feud between them and the blackfeet in which they were so deplorably the sufferers he proposed the matter to some of the leaders and urged that they should meet the blackfeet chiefs in a grand pacific conference offering to send two of his men to the enemys camp with pipe tobacco and flag of truce to negotiate the proposed meeting  the nez perces and flathead sages upon this held a council of war of two days duration in which there was abundance of hard smoking and long talking and both eloquence and tobacco were nearly exhausted at length they came to a decision to reject the worthy captains proposition and upon pretty substantial grounds as the reader may judge  war said the chiefs is a bloody business and full of evil but it keeps the eyes of the chiefs always open and makes the limbs of the young men strong and supple in war every one is on the alert if we see a trail we know it must be an enemy if the blackfeet come to us we know it is for war and we are ready peace on the other hand sounds no alarm the eyes of the chiefs are closed in sleep and the young men are sleek and lazy the horses stray into the mountains the women and their little babes go about alone but the heart of a blackfoot is a lie and his tongue is a trap if he says peace it is to deceive he comes to us as a brother he smokes his pipe with us but when he sees us weak and off our guard he will slay and steal we will have no such peace let there be war  with this reasoning captain bonneville was fain to acquiesce but since the sagacious flatheads and their allies were content to remain in a state of warfare he wished them at least to exercise the boasted vigilance which war was to produce and to keep their eyes open he represented to them the impossibility that two such considerable clans could move about the country without leaving trails by which they might be traced besides among the blackfeet braves were several nez perces who had been taken prisoners in early youth adopted by their captors and trained up and imbued with warlike and predatory notions these had lost all sympathies with their native tribe and would be prone to lead the enemy to their secret haunts he exhorted them therefore to keep upon the alert and never to remit their vigilance while within the range of so crafty and cruel a foe all these counsels were lost upon his easy and simpleminded hearers a careless indifference reigned throughout their encampments and their horses were permitted to range the hills at night in perfect freedom captain bonneville had his own horses brought in at night and properly picketed and guarded the evil he apprehended soon took place in a single night a swoop was made through the neighboring pastures by the blackfeet and eightysix of the finest horses carried off a whip and a rope were left in a conspicuous situation by the robbers as a taunt to the simpletons they had unhorsed  long before sunrise the news of this calamity spread like wildfire through the different encampments captain bonneville whose own horses remained safe at their pickets watched in momentary expectation of an outbreak of warriors piercednose and flathead in furious pursuit of the marauders but no such thingthey contented themselves with searching diligently over hill and dale to glean up such horses as had escaped the hands of the marauders and then resigned themselves to their loss with the most exemplary quiescence  some it is true who were entirely unhorsed set out on a begging visit to their cousins as they called them the lower nez perces who inhabit the lower country about the columbia and possess horses in abundance to these they repair when in difficulty and seldom fail by dint of begging and bartering to get themselves once more mounted on horseback  game had now become scarce in the neighborhood of the camp and it was necessary according to indian custom to move off to a less beaten ground captain bonneville proposed the horse prairie but his indian friends objected that many of the nez perces had gone to visit their cousins and that the whites were few in number so that their united force was not sufficient to venture upon the buffalo grounds which were infested by bands of blackfeet  they now spoke of a place at no great distance which they represented as a perfect hunters elysium it was on the right branch or head stream of the river locked up among cliffs and precipices where there was no danger from roving bands and where the blackfeet dare not enter here they said the elk abounded and the mountain sheep were to be seen trooping upon the rocks and hills a little distance beyond it also herds of buffalo were to be met with out of range of danger thither they proposed to move their camp  the proposition pleased the captain who was desirous through the indians of becoming acquainted with all the secret places of the land accordingly on the 9th of december they struck their tents and moved forward by short stages as many of the indians were yet feeble from the late malady  following up the right fork of the river they came to where it entered a deep gorge of the mountains up which lay the secluded region so much valued by the indians captain bonneville halted and encamped for three days before entering the gorge in the meantime he detached five of his free trappers to scour the hills and kill as many elk as possible before the main body should enter as they would then be soon frightened away by the various indian hunting parties  while thus encamped they were still liable to the marauds of the blackfeet and captain bonneville admonished his indian friends to be upon their guard the nez perces however notwithstanding their recent loss were still careless of their horses merely driving them to some secluded spot and leaving them there for the night without setting any guard upon them the consequence was a second swoop in which fortyone were carried off this was borne with equal philosophy with the first and no effort was made either to recover the horses or to take vengeance on the thieves  the nez perces however grew more cautious with respect to their remaining horses driving them regularly to the camp every evening and fastening them to pickets captain bonneville however told them that this was not enough it was evident they were dogged by a daring and persevering enemy who was encouraged by past impunity they should therefore take more than usual precautions and post a guard at night over their cavalry they could not however be persuaded to depart from their usual custom the horse once picketed the care of the owner was over for the night and he slept profoundly none waked in the camp but the gamblers who absorbed in their play were more difficult to be roused to external circumstances than even the sleepers  the blackfeet are bold enemies and fond of hazardous exploits the band that were hovering about the neighborhood finding that they had such pacific people to deal with redoubled their daring the horses being now picketed before the lodges a number of blackfeet scouts penetrated in the early part of the night into the very centre of the camp here they went about among the lodges as calmly and deliberately as if at home quietly cutting loose the horses that stood picketed by the lodges of their sleeping owners one of these prowlers more adventurous than the rest approached a fire round which a group of nez perces were gambling with the most intense eagerness here he stood for some time muffled up in his robe peering over the shoulders of the players watching the changes of their countenances and the fluctuations of the game so completely engrossed were they that the presence of this muffled eavesdropper was unnoticed and having executed his bravado he retired undiscovered  having cut loose as many horses as they could conveniently carry off the blackfeet scouts rejoined their comrades and all remained patiently round the camp by degrees the horses finding themselves at liberty took their route toward their customary grazing ground as they emerged from the camp they were silently taken possession of until having secured about thirty the blackfeet sprang on their backs and scampered off the clatter of hoofs startled the gamblers from their game they gave the alarm which soon roused the sleepers from every lodge still all was quiescent no marshalling of forces no saddling of steeds and dashing off in pursuit no talk of retribution for their repeated outrages the patience of captain bonneville was at length exhausted he had played the part of a pacificator without success he now altered his tone and resolved if possible to rouse their war spirit  accordingly convoking their chiefs he inveighed against their craven policy and urged the necessity of vigorous and retributive measures that would check the confidence and presumption of their enemies if not inspire them with awe for this purpose he advised that a war party should be immediately sent off on the trail of the marauders to follow them if necessary into the very heart of the blackfoot country and not to leave them until they had taken signal vengeance beside this he recommended the organization of minor war parties to make reprisals to the extent of the losses sustained unless you rouse yourselves from your apathy said he and strike some bold and decisive blow you will cease to be considered men or objects of manly warfare the very squaws and children of the blackfeet will be set against you while their warriors reserve themselves for nobler antagonists  this harangue had evidently a momentary effect upon the pride of the hearers after a short pause however one of the orators arose it was bad he said to go to war for mere revenge the great spirit had given them a heart for peace not for war they had lost horses it was true but they could easily get others from their cousins the lower nez perces without incurring any risk whereas in war they should lose men who were not so readily replaced as to their late losses an increased watchfulness would prevent any more misfortunes of the kind he disapproved therefore of all hostile measures and all the other chiefs concurred in his opinion  captain bonneville again took up the point it is true said he the great spirit has given you a heart to love your friends but he has also given you an arm to strike your enemies unless you do something speedily to put an end to this continual plundering i must say farewell as yet i have sustained no loss thanks to the precautions which you have slighted but my property is too unsafe here my turn will come next i and my people will share the contempt you are bringing upon yourselves and will be thought like you poorspirited beings who may at any time be plundered with impunity  the conference broke up with some signs of excitement on the part of the indians early the next morning a party of thirty men set off in pursuit of the foe and captain bonneville hoped to hear a good account of the blackfeet marauders to his disappointment the war party came lagging back on the following day leading a few old sorry brokendown horses which the freebooters had not been able to urge to sufficient speed this effort exhausted the martial spirit and satisfied the wounded pride of the nez perces and they relapsed into their usual state of passive indifference     13       story of kosato the renegade blackfoot  if the meekness and longsuffering of the piercednoses grieved the spirit of captain bonneville there was another individual in the camp to whom they were still more annoying this was a blackfoot renegado named kosato a fiery hotblooded youth who with a beautiful girl of the same tribe had taken refuge among the nez perces though adopted into the tribe he still retained the warlike spirit of his race and loathed the peaceful inoffensive habits of those around him the hunting of the deer the elk and the buffalo which was the height of their ambition was too tame to satisfy his wild and restless nature his heart burned for the foray the ambush the skirmish the scamper and all the haps and hazards of roving and predatory warfare  the recent hoverings of the blackfeet about the camp their nightly prowls and daring and successful marauds had kept him in a fever and a flutter like a hawk in a cage who hears his late companions swooping and screaming in wild liberty above him the attempt of captain bonneville to rouse the war spirit of the nez perces and prompt them to retaliation was ardently seconded by kosato for several days he was incessantly devising schemes of vengeance and endeavoring to set on foot an expedition that should carry dismay and desolation into the blackfeet town all his art was exerted to touch upon those springs of human action with which he was most familiar he drew the listening savages round him by his nervous eloquence taunted them with recitals of past wrongs and insults drew glowing pictures of triumphs and trophies within their reach recounted tales of daring and romantic enterprise of secret marchings covert lurkings midnight surprisals sackings burnings plunderings scalpings together with the triumphant return and the feasting and rejoicing of the victors these wild tales were intermingled with the beating of the drum the yell the warwhoop and the wardance so inspiring to indian valor all however were lost upon the peaceful spirits of his hearers not a nez perce was to be roused to vengeance or stimulated to glorious war in the bitterness of his heart the blackfoot renegade repined at the mishap which had severed him from a race of congenial spirits and driven him to take refuge among beings so destitute of martial fire  the character and conduct of this man attracted the attention of captain bonneville and he was anxious to hear the reason why he had deserted his tribe and why he looked back upon them with such deadly hostility kosato told him his own story briefly it gives a picture of the deep strong passions that work in the bosoms of these miscalled stoics  you see my wife said he she is good she is beautifuli love her yet she has been the cause of all my troubles she was the wife of my chief i loved her more than he did and she knew it we talked together we laughed together we were always seeking each others society but we were as innocent as children the chief grew jealous and commanded her to speak with me no more his heart became hard toward her his jealousy grew more furious he beat her without cause and without mercy and threatened to kill her outright if she even looked at me do you want traces of his fury look at that scar his rage against me was no less persecuting war parties of the crows were hovering round us our young men had seen their trail all hearts were roused for action my horses were before my lodge suddenly the chief came took them to his own pickets and called them his own what could i do he was a chief i durst not speak but my heart was burning i joined no longer in the council the hunt or the warfeast what had i to do there an unhorsed degraded warrior i kept by myself and thought of nothing but these wrongs and outrages  i was sitting one evening upon a knoll that overlooked the meadow where the horses were pastured i saw the horses that were once mine grazing among those of the chief this maddened me and i sat brooding for a time over the injuries i had suffered and the cruelties which she i loved had endured for my sake until my heart swelled and grew sore and my teeth were clinched as i looked down upon the meadow i saw the chief walking among his horses i fastened my eyes upon him as a hawks my blood boiled i drew my breath hard he went among the willows in an instant i was on my feet my hand was on my knifei flew rather than ranbefore he was aware i sprang upon him and with two blows laid him dead at my feet i covered his body with earth and strewed bushes over the place then i hastened to her i loved told her what i had done and urged her to fly with me she only answered me with tears i reminded her of the wrongs i had suffered and of the blows and stripes she had endured from the deceased i had done nothing but an act of justice i again urged her to fly but she only wept the more and bade me go my heart was heavy but my eyes were dry i folded my arms tis well said i kosato will go alone to the desert none will be with him but the wild beasts of the desert the seekers of blood may follow on his trail they may come upon him when he sleeps and glut their revenge but you will be safe kosato will go alone  i turned away she sprang after me and strained me in her arms no she cried kosato shall not go alone wherever he goes i will gohe shall never part from me  we hastily took in our hands such things as we most needed and stealing quietly from the village mounted the first horses we encountered speeding day and night we soon reached this tribe they received us with welcome and we have dwelt with them in peace they are good and kind they are honest but their hearts are the hearts of women  such was the story of kosato as related by him to captain bonneville it is of a kind that often occurs in indian life where love elopements from tribe to tribe are as frequent as among the novelread heroes and heroines of sentimental civilization and often give rise to bloods and lasting feuds     14       the party enters the mountain gorgea wild fastness among      hillsmountain muttonpeace and plentythe amorous      trappera piebald weddinga free trappers wifeher gala      equipmentschristmas in the wilderness  on the 19th of december captain bonneville and his confederate indians raised their camp and entered the narrow gorge made by the north fork of salmon river up this lay the secure and plenteous hunting region so temptingly described by the indians  since leaving green river the plains had invariably been of loose sand or coarse gravel and the rocky formation of the mountains of primitive limestone the rivers in general were skirted with willows and bitter cottonwood trees and the prairies covered with wormwood in the hollow breast of the mountains which they were now penetrating the surrounding heights were clothed with pine while the declivities of the lower hills afforded abundance of bunch grass for the horses  as the indians had represented they were now in a natural fastness of the mountains the ingress and egress of which was by a deep gorge so narrow rugged and difficult as to prevent secret approach or rapid retreat and to admit of easy defence the blackfeet therefore refrained from venturing in after the nez perces awaiting a better chance when they should once more emerge into the open country  captain bonneville soon found that the indians had not exaggerated the advantages of this region besides the numerous gangs of elk large flocks of the ahsahta or bighorn the mountain sheep were to be seen bounding among the precipices these simple animals were easily circumvented and destroyed a few hunters may surround a flock and kill as many as they please numbers were daily brought into camp and the flesh of those which were young and fat was extolled as superior to the finest mutton  here then there was a cessation from toil from hunger and alarm past ills and dangers were forgotten the hunt the game the song the story the rough though goodhumored joke made time pass joyously away and plenty and security reigned throughout the camp  idleness and ease it is said lead to love and love to matrimony in civilized life and the same process takes place in the wilderness filled with good cheer and mountain mutton one of the free trappers began to repine at the solitude of his lodge and to experience the force of that great law of nature it is not meet for man to live alone  after a night of grave cogitation he repaired to kowsoter the piercednose chief and unfolded to him the secret workings of his bosom  i want said he a wife give me one from among your tribe not a young giddypated girl that will think of nothing but flaunting and finery but a sober discreet hardworking squaw one that will share my lot without flinching however hard it may be that can take care of my lodge and be a companion and a helpmate to me in the wilderness kowsoter promised to look round among the females of his tribe and procure such a one as he desired two days were requisite for the search at the expiration of these kowsoter called at his lodge and informed him that he would bring his bride to him in the course of the afternoon he kept his word at the appointed time he approached leading the bride a comely coppercolored dame attired in her indian finery her father mother brothers by the half dozen and cousins by the score all followed on to grace the ceremony and greet the new and important relative  the trapper received his new and numerous family connection with proper solemnity he placed his bride beside him and filling the pipe the great symbol of peace with his best tobacco took two or three whiffs then handed it to the chief who transferred it to the father of the bride from whom it was passed on from hand to hand and mouth to mouth of the whole circle of kinsmen round the fire all maintaining the most profound and becoming silence  after several pipes had been filled and emptied in this solemn ceremonial the chief addressed the bride detailing at considerable length the duties of a wife which among indians are little less onerous than those of the packhorse this done he turned to her friends and congratulated them upon the great alliance she had made they showed a due sense of their good fortune especially when the nuptial presents came to be distributed among the chiefs and relatives amounting to about one hundred and eighty dollars the company soon retired and now the worthy trapper found indeed that he had no green girl to deal with for the knowing dame at once assumed the style and dignity of a trappers wife taking possession of the lodge as her undisputed empire arranging everything according to her own taste and habitudes and appearing as much at home and on as easy terms with the trapper as if they had been man and wife for years  we have already given a picture of a free trapper and his horse as furnished by captain bonneville we shall here subjoin as a companion picture his description of a free trappers wife that the reader may have a correct idea of the kind of blessing the worthy hunter in question had invoked to solace him in the wilderness  the free trapper while a bachelor has no greater pet than his horse but the moment he takes a wife a sort of brevet rank in matrimony occasionally bestowed upon some indian fair one like the heroes of ancient chivalry in the open field he discovers that he has a still more fanciful and capricious animal on which to lavish his expenses  no sooner does an indian belle experience this promotion than all her notions at once rise and expand to the dignity of her situation and the purse of her lover and his credit into the bargain are taxed to the utmost to fit her out in becoming style the wife of a free trapper to be equipped and arrayed like any ordinary and undistinguished squaw perish the grovelling thought in the first place she must have a horse for her own riding but no jaded sorry earthspirited hack such as is sometimes assigned by an indian husband for the transportation of his squaw and her pappooses the wife of a free trader must have the most beautiful animal she can lay her eyes on and then as to his decoration headstall breastbands saddle and crupper are lavishly embroidered with beads and hung with thimbles hawks bells and bunches of ribbons from each side of the saddle hangs an esquimoot a sort of pocket in which she bestows the residue of her trinkets and nicknacks which cannot be crowded on the decoration of her horse or herself over this she folds with great care a drapery of scarlet and brightcolored calicoes and now considers the caparison of her steed complete  as to her own person she is even still more extravagant her hair esteemed beautiful in proportion to its length is carefully plaited and made to fall with seeming negligence over either breast her riding hat is stuck full of particolored feathers her robe fashioned somewhat after that of the whites is of red green and sometimes gray cloth but always of the finest texture that can be procured her leggings and moccasins are of the most beautiful and expensive workmanship and fitted neatly to the foot and ankle which with the indian woman are generally well formed and delicate then as to jewelry in the way of fingerrings earrings necklaces and other female glories nothing within reach of the trappers means is omitted that can tend to impress the beholder with an idea of the ladys high estate to finish the whole she selects from among her blankets of various dyes one of some glowing color and throwing it over her shoulders with a native grace vaults into the saddle of her gay prancing steed and is ready to follow her mountaineer to the last gasp with love and loyalty  such is the general picture of the free trappers wife given by captain bonneville how far it applied in its details to the one in question does not altogether appear though it would seem from the outset of her connubial career that she was ready to avail herself of all the pomp and circumstance of her new condition it is worthy of mention that wherever there are several wives of free trappers in a camp the keenest rivalry exists between them to the sore detriment of their husbands purses their whole time is expended and their ingenuity tasked by endeavors to eclipse each other in dress and decoration the jealousies and heartburnings thus occasioned among these sostyled children of nature are equally intense with those of the rival leaders of style and fashion in the luxurious abodes of civilized life  the genial festival of christmas which throughout all christendom lights up the fireside of home with mirth and jollity followed hard upon the wedding just described though far from kindred and friends captain bonneville and his handful of free trappers were not disposed to suffer the festival to pass unenjoyed they were in a region of good cheer and were disposed to be joyous so it was determined to light up the yule clog and celebrate a merry christmas in the heart of the wilderness  on christmas eve accordingly they began their rude fetes and rejoicings in the course of the night the free trappers surrounded the lodge of the piercednose chief and in lieu of christmas carols saluted him with a feude joie  kowsoter received it in a truly christian spirit and after a speech in which he expressed his high gratification at the honor done him invited the whole company to a feast on the following day his invitation was gladly accepted a christmas dinner in the wigwam of an indian chief there was novelty in the idea not one failed to be present the banquet was served up in primitive style skins of various kinds nicely dressed for the occasion were spread upon the ground upon these were heaped up abundance of venison elk meat and mountain mutton with various bitter roots which the indians use as condiments  after a short prayer the company all seated themselves crosslegged in turkish fashion to the banquet which passed off with great hilarity after which various games of strength and agility by both white men and indians closed the christmas

this time caused great uneasiness in the mind of captain bonneville and finding there was no dependence to be placed upon the perseverance and courage of scouting parties in so perilous a quest he determined to set out himself on the search and to keep on until he should ascertain something of the object of his solicitude  accordingly on the 20th december he left the camp accompanied by thirteen stark trappers and hunters all well mounted and armed for dangerous enterprise on the following morning they passed out at the head of the mountain gorge and sallied forth into the open plain as they confidently expected a brush with the blackfeet or some other predatory horde they moved with great circumspection and kept vigilant watch in their encampments  in the course of another day they left the main branch of salmon river and proceeded south toward a pass called john days defile it was severe and arduous travelling the plains were swept by keen and bitter blasts of wintry wind the ground was generally covered with snow game was scarce so that hunger generally prevailed in the camp while the want of pasturage soon began to manifest itself in the declining vigor of the horses  the party had scarcely encamped on the afternoon of the 28th when two of the hunters who had sallied forth in quest of game came galloping back in great alarm while hunting they had perceived a party of savages evidently manoeuvring to cut them off from the camp and nothing had saved them from being entrapped but the speed of their horses  these tidings struck dismay into the camp captain bonneville endeavored to reassure his men by representing the position of their encampment and its capability of defence he then ordered the horses to be driven in and picketed and threw up a rough breastwork of fallen trunks of trees and the vegetable rubbish of the wilderness within this barrier was maintained a vigilant watch throughout the night which passed away without alarm at early dawn they scrutinized the surrounding plain to discover whether any enemies had been lurking about during the night not a footprint however was to be discovered in the coarse gravel with which the plain was covered  hunger now began to cause more uneasiness than the apprehensions of surrounding enemies after marching a few miles they encamped at the foot of a mountain in hopes of finding buffalo it was not until the next day that they discovered a pair of fine bulls on the edge of the plain among rocks and ravines having now been two days and a half without a mouthful of food they took especial care that these animals should not escape them while some of the surest marksmen advanced cautiously with their rifles into the rough ground four of the best mounted horsemen took their stations in the plain to run the bulls down should they only be maimed  the buffalo were wounded and set off in headlong flight the halffamished horses were too weak to overtake them on the frozen ground but succeeded in driving them on the ice where they slipped and fell and were easily dispatched the hunters loaded themselves with beef for present and future supply and then returned and encamped at the last nightss fire here they passed the remainder of the day cooking and eating with a voracity proportioned to previous starvation forgetting in the hearty revel of the moment the certain dangers with which they were environed  the cravings of hunger being satisfied they now began to debate about their further progress the men were much disheartened by the hardships they had already endured indeed two who had been in the rear guard taking advantage of their position had deserted and returned to the lodges of the nez perces the prospect ahead was enough to stagger the stoutest heart they were in the dead of winter as far as the eye could reach the wild landscape was wrapped in snow which was evidently deepening as they advanced over this they would have to toil with the icy wind blowing in their faces their horses might give out through want of pasturage and they themselves must expect intervals of horrible famine like that they had already experienced  with captain bonneville however perseverance was a matter of pride and having undertaken this enterprise nothing could turn him back until it was accomplished though he declares that had he anticipated the difficulties and sufferings which attended it he should have flinched from the undertaking  onward therefore the little band urged their way keeping along the course of a stream called john days creek the cold was so intense that they had frequently to dismount and travel on foot lest they should freeze in their saddles the days which at this season are short enough even in the open prairies were narrowed to a few hours by the high mountains which allowed the travellers but a brief enjoyment of the cheering rays of the sun the snow was generally at least twenty inches in depth and in many places much more those who dismounted had to beat their way with toilsome steps eight miles were considered a good days journey the horses were almost famished for the herbage was covered by the deep snow so that they had nothing to subsist upon but scanty wisps of the dry bunch grass which peered above the surface and the small branches and twigs of frozen willows and wormwood  in this way they urged their slow and painful course to the south down john days creek until it lost itself in a swamp here they encamped upon the ice among stiffened willows where they were obliged to beat down and clear away the snow to procure pasturage for their horses  hence they toiled on to godin river so called after an iroquois hunter in the service of sublette who was murdered there by the blackfeet many of the features of this remote wilderness are thus named after scenes of violence and bloodshed that occurred to the early pioneers it was an act of filial vengeance on the part of godins son antoine that as the reader may recollect brought on the recent battle at pierres hole  from godins river captain bonneville and his followers came out upon the plain of the three butes so called from three singular and isolated hills that rise from the midst it is a part of the great desert of snake river one of the most remarkable tracts beyond the mountains could they have experienced a respite from their sufferings and anxieties the immense landscape spread out before them was calculated to inspire admiration winter has its beauties and glories as well as summer and captain bonneville had the soul to appreciate them  far away says he over the vast plains and up the steep sides of the lofty mountains the snow lay spread in dazzling whiteness and whenever the sun emerged in the morning above the giant peaks or burst forth from among clouds in his midday course mountain and dell glazed rock and frosted tree glowed and sparkled with surpassing lustre the tall pines seemed sprinkled with a silver dust and the willows studded with minute icicles reflecting the prismatic rays brought to mind the fairy trees conjured up by the caliphs storyteller to adorn his vale of diamonds  the poor wanderers however nearly starved with hunger and cold were in no mood to enjoy the glories of these brilliant scenes though they stamped pictures on their memory which have been recalled with delight in more genial situations  encamping at the west bute they found a place swept by the winds so that it was bare of snow and there was abundance of bunch grass here the horses were turned loose to graze throughout the night though for once they had ample pasturage yet the keen winds were so intense that in the morning a mule was found frozen to death the trappers gathered round and mourned over him as over a cherished friend they feared their halffamished horses would soon share his fate for there seemed scarce blood enough left in their veins to withstand the freezing cold to beat the way further through the snow with these enfeebled animals seemed next to impossible and despondency began to creep over their hearts when fortunately they discovered a trail made by some hunting party into this they immediately entered and proceeded with less difficulty shortly afterward a fine buffalo bull came bounding across the snow and was instantly brought down by the hunters a fire was soon blazing and crackling and an ample repast soon cooked and sooner dispatched after which they made some further progress and then encamped one of the men reached the camp nearly frozen to death but good cheer and a blazing fire gradually restored life and put his blood in circulation  having now a beaten path they proceeded the next morning with more facility indeed the snow decreased in depth as they receded from the mountains and the temperature became more mild in the course of the day they discovered a solitary horseman hovering at a distance before them on the plain they spurred on to overtake him but he was better mounted on a fresher steed and kept at a wary distance reconnoitring them with evident distrust for the wild dress of the free trappers their leggings blankets and cloth caps garnished with fur and topped off with feathers even their very elflocks and weatherbronzed complexions gave them the look of indians rather than white men and made him mistake them for a war party of some hostile tribe  after much manoeuvring the wild horseman was at length brought to a parley but even then he conducted himself with the caution of a knowing prowler of the prairies dismounting from his horse and using him as a breastwork he levelled his gun across his back and thus prepared for defence like a wary cruiser upon the high seas he permitted himself to be approached within speaking distance  he proved to be an indian of the banneck tribe belonging to a band at no great distance it was some time before he could be persuaded that he was conversing with a party of white men and induced to lay aside his reserve and join them he then gave them the interesting intelligence that there were two companies of white men encamped in the neighborhood this was cheering news to captain bonneville who hoped to find in one of them the longsought party of matthieu pushing forward therefore with renovated spirits he reached snake river by nightfall and there fixed his encampment  early the next morning 13th january 1833 diligent search was made about the neighborhood for traces of the reported parties of white men an encampment was soon discovered about four miles farther up the river in which captain bonneville to his great joy found two of matthieus men from whom he learned that the rest of his party would be there in the course of a few days it was a matter of great pride and selfgratulation to captain bonneville that he had thus accomplished his dreary and doubtful enterprise and he determined to pass some time in this encampment both to await the return of matthieu and to give needful repose to men and horses  it was in fact one of the most eligible and delightful wintering grounds in that whole range of country the snake river here wound its devious way between low banks through the great plain of the three butes and was bordered by wide and fertile meadows it was studded with islands which like the alluvial bottoms were covered with groves of cottonwood thickets of willow tracts of good lowland grass and abundance of green rushes the adjacent plains were so vast in extent that no single band of indians could drive the buffalo out of them nor was the snow of sufficient depth to give any serious inconvenience indeed during the sojourn of captain bonneville in this neighborhood which was in the heart of winter he found the weather with the exception of a few cold and stormy days generally mild and pleasant freezing a little at night but invariably thawing with the mornings sunresembling the spring weather in the middle parts of the united states  the lofty range of the three tetons those great landmarks of the rocky mountains rising in the east and circling away to the north and west of the great plain of snake river and the mountains of salt river and portneuf toward the south catch the earliest falls of snow their white robes lengthen as the winter advances and spread themselves far into the plain driving the buffalo in herds to the banks of the river in quest of food where they are easily slain in great numbers  such were the palpable advantages of this winter encampment added to which it was secure from the prowlings and plunderings of any petty band of roving blackfeet the difficulties of retreat rendering it unwise for those crafty depredators to venture an attack unless with an overpowering force  about ten miles below the encampment lay the banneck indians numbering about one hundred and twenty lodges they are brave and cunning warriors and deadly foes of the blackfeet whom they easily overcome in battles where their forces are equal they are not vengeful and enterprising in warfare however seldom sending war parties to attack the blackfeet towns but contenting themselves with defending their own territories and house about one third of their warriors are armed with fusees the rest with bows and arrows  as soon as the spring opens they move down the right bank of snake river and encamp at the heads of the boisee and payette here their horses wax fat on good pasturage while the tribe revels in plenty upon the flesh of deer elk bear and beaver they then descend a little further and are met by the lower nez perces with whom they trade for horses giving in exchange beaver buffalo and buffalo robes hence they strike upon the tributary streams on the left bank of snake river and encamp at the rise of the portneuf and blackfoot streams in the buffalo range their horses although of the nez perce breed are inferior to the parent stock from being ridden at too early an age being often bought when but two years old and immediately put to hard work they have fewer horses also than most of these migratory tribes  at the time that captain bonneville came into the neighborhood of these indians they were all in mourning for their chief surnamed the horse this chief was said to possess a charmed life or rather to be invulnerable to lead no bullet having ever hit him though he had been in repeated battles and often shot at by the surest marksmen he had shown great magnanimity in his intercourse with the white men one of the great men of his family had been slain in an attack upon a band of trappers passing through the territories of his tribe vengeance had been sworn by the bannecks but the horse interfered declaring himself the friend of white men and having great influence and authority among his people he compelled them to forego all vindictive plans and to conduct themselves amicably whenever they came in contact with the traders  this chief had bravely fallen in resisting an attack made by the blackfeet upon his tribe while encamped at the head of godin river his fall in nowise lessened the faith of his people in his charmed life for they declared that it was not a bullet which laid him low but a bit of horn which had been shot into him by some blackfoot marksman aware no doubt of the inefficacy of lead since his death there was no one with sufficient influence over the tribe to restrain the wild and predatory propensities of the young men the consequence was they had become troublesome and dangerous neighbors openly friendly for the sake of traffic but disposed to commit secret depredations and to molest any small party that might fall within their reach     16       misadventures of matthieu and his partyreturn to the      caches at salmon riverbattle between nez perces and black      feetheroism of a nez perce womanenrolled among the      braves  on the 3d of february matthieu with the residue of his band arrived in camp he had a disastrous story to relate after parting with captain bonneville in green river valley he had proceeded to the westward keeping to the north of the eutaw mountains a spur of the great rocky chain here he experienced the most rugged travelling for his horses and soon discovered that there was but little chance of meeting the shoshonie bands he now proceeded along bear river a stream much frequented by trappers intending to shape his course to salmon river to rejoin captain bonneville  he was misled however either through the ignorance or treachery of an indian guide and conducted into a wild valley where he lay encamped during the autumn and the early part of the winter nearly buried in snow and almost starved early in the season he detached five men with nine horses to proceed to the neighborhood of the sheep rock on bear river where game was plenty and there to procure a supply for the camp  they had not proceeded far on their expedition when their trail was discovered by a party of nine or ten indians who immediately commenced a lurking pursuit dogging them secretly for five or six days so long as their encampments were well chosen and a proper watch maintained the wary savages kept aloof at length observing that they were badly encamped in a situation where they might be approached with secrecy the enemy crept stealthily along under cover of the river bank preparing to burst suddenly upon their prey  they had not advanced within striking distance however before they were discovered by one of the trappers he immediately but silently gave the alarm to his companions they all sprang upon their horses and prepared to retreat to a safe position one of the party however named jennings doubted the correctness of the alarm and before he mounted his horse wanted to ascertain the fact his companions urged him to mount but in vain he was incredulous and obstinate a volley of firearms by the savages dispelled his doubts but so overpowered his nerves that he was unable to get into his saddle his comrades seeing his peril and confusion generously leaped from their horses to protect him a shot from a rifle brought him to the earth in his agony he called upon the others not to desert him two of them le roy and ross after fighting desperately were captured by the savages the remaining two vaulted into their saddles and saved themselves by headlong flight being pursued for nearly thirty miles they got safe back to matthieus camp where their story inspired such dread of lurking indians that the hunters could not be prevailed upon to undertake another foray in quest of provisions they remained therefore almost starving in their camp now and then killing an old or disabled horse for food while the elk and the mountain sheep roamed unmolested among the surrounding mountains  the disastrous surprisal of this hunting party is cited by captain bonneville to show the importance of vigilant watching and judicious encampments in the indian country most of this kind of disasters to traders and trappers arise from some careless inattention to the state of their arms and ammunition the placing of their horses at night the position of their camping ground and the posting of their night watches the indian is a vigilant and crafty foe by no means given to hairbrained assaults he seldom attacks when he finds his foe well prepared and on the alert caution is at least as efficacious a protection against him as courage  the indians who made this attack were at first supposed to be blackfeet until captain bonneville found subsequently in the camp of the bannecks a horse saddle and bridle which he recognized as having belonged to one of the hunters the bannecks however stoutly denied having taken these spoils in fight and persisted in affirming that the outrage had been perpetrated by a blackfoot band  captain bonneville remained on snake river nearly three weeks after the arrival of matthieu and his party at length his horses having recovered strength sufficient for a journey he prepared to return to the nez perces or rather to visit his caches on salmon river that he might take thence goods and equipments for the opening season accordingly leaving sixteen men at snake river he set out on the 19th of february with sixteen others on his journey to the caches  fording the river he proceeded to the borders of the deep snow when he encamped under the lee of immense piles of burned rock on the 21st he was again floundering through the snow on the great snake river plain where it lay to the depth of thirty inches it was sufficiently incrusted to bear a pedestrian but the poor horses broke through the crust and plunged and strained at every step so lacerated were they by the ice that it was necessary to change the front every hundred yards and put a different one in advance to break the way the open prairies were swept by a piercing and biting wind from the northwest at night they had to task their ingenuity to provide shelter and keep from freezing in the first place they dug deep holes in the snow piling it up in ramparts to windward as a protection against the blast beneath these they spread buffalo skins upon which they stretched themselves in full dress with caps cloaks and moccasins and covered themselves with numerous blankets notwithstanding all which they were often severely pinched with the cold  on the 28th of february they arrived on the banks of godin river this stream emerges from the mountains opposite an eastern branch of the malade river running southeast forms a deep and swift current about twenty yards wide passing rapidly through a defile to which it gives its name and then enters the great plain where after meandering about forty miles it is finally lost in the region of the burned rocks  on the banks of this river captain bonneville was so fortunate as to come upon a buffalo trail following it up he entered the defile where he remained encamped for two days to allow the hunters time to kill and dry a supply of buffalo beef in this sheltered defile the weather was moderate and grass was already sprouting more than an inch in height there was abundance too of the salt weed which grows most plentiful in clayey and gravelly barrens it resembles pennyroyal and derives its name from a partial saltness it is a nourishing food for the horses in the winter but they reject it the moment the young grass affords sufficient pasturage  on the 6th of march having cured sufficient meat the party resumed their march and moved on with comparative ease excepting where they had to make their way through snowdrifts which had been piled up by the wind  on the 11th a small cloud of smoke was observed rising in a deep part of the defile an encampment was instantly formed and scouts were sent out to reconnoitre they returned with intelligence that it was a hunting party of flatheads returning from the buffalo range laden with meat captain bonneville joined them the next day and persuaded them to proceed with his party a few miles below to the caches whither he proposed also to invite the nez perces whom he hoped to find somewhere in this neighborhood in fact on the 13th he was rejoined by that friendly tribe who since he separated from them on salmon river had likewise been out to hunt the buffalo but had continued to be haunted and harassed by their old enemies the blackfeet who as usual had contrived to carry off many of their horses  in the course of this hunting expedition a small band of ten lodges separated from the main body in search of better pasturage for their horses about the 1st of march the scattered parties of blackfoot banditti united to the number of three hundred fighting men and determined upon some signal blow proceeding to the former camping ground of the nez perces they found the lodges deserted upon which they hid themselves among the willows and thickets watching for some straggler who might guide them to the present whereabout of their intended victims as fortune would have it kosato the blackfoot renegade was the first to pass along accompanied by his bloodbought bride he was on his way from the main body of hunters to the little band of ten lodges the blackfeet knew and marked him as he passed he was within bowshot of their ambuscade yet much as they thirsted for his blood they forbore to launch a shaft sparing him for the moment that he might lead them to their prey secretly following his trail they discovered the lodges of the unfortunate nez perces and assailed them with shouts and yellings the nez perces numbered only twenty men and but nine were armed with fusees they showed themselves however as brave and skilful in war as they had been mild and longsuffering in peace their first care was to dig holes inside of their lodges thus ensconced they fought desperately laying several of the enemy dead upon the ground while they though some of them were wounded lost not a single warrior  during the heat of the battle a woman of the nez perces seeing her warrior badly wounded and unable to fight seized his bow and arrows and bravely and successfully defended his person contributing to the safety of the whole party  in another part of the field of action a nez perce had crouched behind the trunk of a fallen tree and kept up a galling fire from his covert a blackfoot seeing this procured a round log and placing it before him as he lay prostrate rolled it forward toward the trunk of the tree behind which his enemy lay crouched it was a moment of breathless interest whoever first showed himself would be in danger of a shot the nez perce put an end to the suspense the moment the logs touched he sprang upon his feet and discharged the contents of his fusee into the back of his antagonist by this time the blackfeet had got possession of the horses several of their warriors lay dead on the field and the nez perces ensconced in their lodges seemed resolved to defend themselves to the last gasp it so happened that the chief of the blackfeet party was a renegade from the nez perces unlike kosato however he had no vindictive rage against his native tribe but was rather disposed now he had got the booty to spare all unnecessary effusion of blood he held a long parley therefore with the besieged and finally drew off his warriors taking with him seventy horses it appeared afterward that the bullets of the blackfeet had been entirely expended in the course of the battle so that they were obliged to make use of stones as substitute  at the outset of the fight kosato the renegade fought with fury rather than valor animating the others by word as well as deed a wound in the head from a rifle ball laid him senseless on the earth there his body remained when the battle was over and the victors were leading off the horses his wife hung over him with frantic lamentations the conquerors paused and urged her to leave the lifeless renegade and return with them to her kindred she refused to listen to their solicitations and they passed on as she sat watching the features of kosato and giving way to passionate grief she thought she perceived him to breathe she was not mistaken the ball which had been nearly spent before it struck him had stunned instead of killing him by the ministry of his faithful wife he gradually recovered reviving to a redoubled love for her and hatred of his tribe  as to the female who had so bravely defended her husband she was elevated by the tribe to a rank far above her sex and beside other honorable distinctions was thenceforward permitted to take a part in the war dances of the braves     17       opening of the cachesdetachments of cerre and hodgkiss      salmon river mountainssuperstition of an indian trapper

captain bonneville found his caches perfectly secure and having secretly opened them he selected such articles as were necessary to equip the free trappers and to supply the inconsiderable trade with the indians after which he closed them again the free trappers being newly rigged out and supplied were in high spirits and swaggered gayly about the camp to compensate all hands for past sufferings and to give a cheerful spur to further operations captain bonneville now gave the men what in frontier phrase is termed a regular blowout it was a day of uncouth gambols and frolics and rude feasting the indians joined in the sports and games and all was mirth and goodfellowship  it was now the middle of march and captain bonneville made preparations to open the spring campaign he had pitched upon malade river for his main trapping ground for the season this is a stream which rises among the great bed of mountains north of the lava plain and after a winding course falls into snake river previous to his departure the captain dispatched mr cerre with a few men to visit the indian villages and purchase horses he furnished his clerk mr hodgkiss also with a small stock of goods to keep up a trade with the indians during the spring for such peltries as they might collect appointing the caches on salmon river as the point of rendezvous where they were to rejoin him on the 15th of june following  this done he set out for malade river with a band of twentyeight men composed of hired and free trappers and indian hunters together with eight squaws their route lay up along the right fork of salmon river as it passes through the deep defile of the mountains they travelled very slowly not above five miles a day for many of the horses were so weak that they faltered and staggered as they walked pasturage however was now growing plentiful there was abundance of fresh grass which in some places had attained such height as to wave in the wind the native flocks of the wilderness the mountain sheep as they are called by the trappers were continually to be seen upon the hills between which they passed and a good supply of mutton was provided by the hunters as they were advancing toward a region of scarcity  in the course of his journey captain bonneville had occasion to remark an instance of the many notions and almost superstitions which prevail among the indians and among some of the white men with respect to the sagacity of the beaver the indian hunters of his party were in the habit of exploring all the streams along which they passed in search of beaver lodges and occasionally set their traps with some success one of them however though an experienced and skilful trapper was invariably unsuccessful astonished and mortified at such unusual bad luck he at length conceived the idea that there was some odor about his person of which the beaver got scent and retreated at his approach he immediately set about a thorough purification making a rude sweatinghouse on the banks of the river he would shut himself up until in a reeking perspiration and then suddenly emerging would plunge into the river a number of these sweatings and plungings having as he supposed rendered his person perfectly inodorous he resumed his trapping with renovated hope  about the beginning of april they encamped upon godins river where they found the swamp full of muskrat houses here therefore captain bonneville determined to remain a few days and make his first regular attempt at trapping that his maiden campaign might open with spirit he promised the indians and free trappers an extra price for every muskrat they should take all now set to work for the next days sport the utmost animation and gayety prevailed throughout the camp everything looked auspicious for their spring campaign the abundance of muskrats in the swamp was but an earnest of the nobler game they were to find when they should reach the malade river and have a capital beaver country all to themselves where they might trap at their leisure without molestation  in the midst of their gayety a hunter came galloping into the camp shouting or rather yelling a trail a traillodge poles lodge poles  these were words full of meaning to a trappers ear they intimated that there was some band in the neighborhood and probably a hunting party as they had lodge poles for an encampment the hunter came up and told his story he had discovered a fresh trail in which the traces made by the dragging of lodge poles were distinctly visible the buffalo too had just been driven out of the neighborhood which showed that the hunters had already been on the range  the gayety of the camp was at an end all preparations for muskrat trapping were suspended and all hands sallied forth to examine the trail their worst fears were soon confirmed infallible signs showed the unknown party in the advance to be white men doubtless some rival band of trappers here was competition when least expected and that too by a party already in the advance who were driving the game before them captain bonneville had now a taste of the sudden transitions to which a trappers life is subject the buoyant confidence in an uninterrupted hunt was at an end every countenance lowered with gloom and disappointment  captain bonneville immediately dispatched two spies to overtake the rival party and endeavor to learn their plans in the meantime he turned his back upon the swamp and its muskrat houses and followed on at long camps which in trappers language is equivalent to long stages on the 6th of april he met his spies returning they had kept on the trail like hounds until they overtook the party at the south end of godins defile here they found them comfortably encamped twentytwo prime trappers all well appointed with excellent horses in capital condition led by milton sublette and an able coadjutor named jarvie and in full march for the malade hunting ground this was stunning news the malade river was the only trapping ground within reach but to have to compete there with veteran trappers perfectly at home among the mountains and admirably mounted while they were so poorly provided with horses and trappers and had but one man in their party acquainted with the countryit was out of the question  the only hope that now remained was that the snow which still lay deep among the mountains of godins river and blocked up the usual pass to the malade country might detain the other party until captain bonnevilles horses should get once more into good condition in their present ample pasturage  the rival parties now encamped together not out of companionship but to keep an eye upon each other day after day passed by without any possibility of getting to the malade country sublette and jarvie endeavored to force their way across the mountain but the snows lay so deep as to oblige them to turn back in the meantime the captains horses were daily gaining strength and their hoofs improving which had been worn and battered by mountain service the captain also was increasing his stock of provisions so that the delay was all in his favor  to any one who merely contemplates a map of the country this difficulty of getting from godin to malade river will appear inexplicable as the intervening mountains terminate in the great snake river plain so that apparently it would be perfectly easy to proceed round their bases  here however occur some of the striking phenomena of this wild and sublime region the great lower plain which extends to the feet of these mountains is broken up near their bases into crests and ridges resembling the surges of the ocean breaking on a rocky shore  in a line with the mountains the plain is gashed with numerous and dangerous chasms from four to ten feet wide and of great depth captain bonneville attempted to sound some of these openings but without any satisfactory result a stone dropped into one of them reverberated against the sides for apparently a very great depth and by its sound indicated the same kind of substance with the surface as long as the strokes could be heard the horse instinctively sagacious in avoiding danger shrinks back in alarm from the least of these chasms pricking up his ears snorting and pawing until permitted to turn away  we have been told by a person well acquainted with the country that it is sometimes necessary to travel fifty and sixty miles to get round one of these tremendous ravines considerable streams like that of godins river that run with a bold free current lose themselves in this plain some of them end in swamps others suddenly disappear finding no doubt subterranean outlets  opposite to these chasms snake river makes two desperate leaps over precipices at a short distance from each other one twenty the other forty feet in height  the volcanic plain in question forms an area of about sixty miles in diameter where nothing meets the eye but a desolate and awful waste where no grass grows nor water runs and where nothing is to be seen but lava ranges of mountains skirt this plain and in captain bonnevilles opinion were formerly connected until rent asunder by some convulsion of nature far to the east the three tetons lift their heads sublimely and dominate this wide sea of lavaone of the most striking features of a wilderness where everything seems on a scale of stern and simple grandeur  we look forward with impatience for some able geologist to explore this sublime but almost unknown region  it was not until the 25th of april that the two parties of trappers broke up their encampments and undertook to cross over the southwest end of the mountain by a pass explored by their scouts from various points of the mountain they commanded boundless prospects of the lava plain stretching away in cold and gloomy barrenness as far as the eye could reach on the evening of the 26th they reached the plain west of the mountain watered by the malade the boisee and other streams which comprised the contemplated trappingground  the country about the boisee or woody river is extolled by captain bonneville as the most enchanting he had seen in the far west presenting the mingled grandeur and beauty of mountain and plain of bright running streams and vast grassy meadows waving to the breeze  we shall not follow the captain throughout his trapping campaign which lasted until the beginning of june nor detail all the manoeuvres of the rival trapping parties and their various schemes to outwit and outtrap each other suffice it to say that after having visited and camped about various streams with varying success captain bonneville set forward early in june for the appointed rendezvous at the caches on the way he treated his party to a grand buffalo hunt the scouts had re ported numerous herds in a plain beyond an intervening height there was an immediate halt the fleetest horses were forthwith mounted and the party advanced to the summit of the hill hence they beheld the great plain below absolutely swarming with buffalo captain bonneville now appointed the place where he would encamp and toward which the hunters were to drive the game he cautioned the latter to advance slowly reserving the strength and speed of the horses until within a moderate distance of the herds twentytwo horsemen descended cautiously into the plain conformably to these directions it was a beautiful sight says the captain to see the runners as they are called advancing in column at a slow trot until within two hundred and fifty yards of the outskirts of the herd then dashing on at full speed until lost in the immense multitude of buffaloes scouring the plain in every direction all was now tumult and wild confusion in the meantime captain bonneville and the residue of the party moved on to the appointed camping ground thither the most expert runners succeeded in driving numbers of buffalo which were killed hard by the camp and the flesh transported thither without difficulty in a little while the whole camp looked like one great slaughterhouse the carcasses were skilfully cut up great fires were made scaffolds erected for drying and jerking beef and an ample provision was made for future subsistence on the 15th of june the precise day appointed for the rendezvous captain bonneville and his party arrived safely at the caches  here he was joined by the other detachments of his main party all in good health and spirits the caches were again opened supplies of various kinds taken out and a liberal allowance of aqua vitae distributed throughout the camp to celebrate with proper conviviality this merry meeting     18       meeting with hodgkissmisfortunes of the nez perces      schemes of kosato the renegadohis

 indian tradehudsons bay companys monopolyarrangements      for autumnbreaking up of an encampment  having now a pretty strong party well armed and equipped captain bonneville no longer felt the necessity of fortifying himself in the secret places and fastnesses of the mountains but sallied forth boldly into the snake river plain in search of his clerk hodgkiss who had remained with the nez perces he found him on the 24th of june and learned from him another chapter of misfortunes which had recently befallen that illfated race  after the departure of captain bonneville in march kosato the renegade blackfoot had recovered from the wound received in battle and with his strength revived all his deadly hostility to his native tribe he now resumed his efforts to stir up the nez perces to reprisals upon their old enemies reminding them incessantly of all the outrages and robberies they had recently experienced and assuring them that such would continue to be their lot until they proved themselves men by some signal retaliation  the impassioned eloquence of the desperado at length produced an effect and a band of braves enlisted under his guidance to penetrate into the blackfoot country harass their villages carry off their horses and commit all kinds of depredations  kosato pushed forward on his foray as far as the horse prairie where he came upon a strong party of blackfeet without waiting to estimate their force he attacked them with characteristic fury and was bravely seconded by his followers the contest for a time was hot and bloody at length as is customary with these two tribes they paused and held a long parley or rather a war of words  what need said the blackfoot chief tauntingly have the nez perces to leave their homes and sally forth on war parties when they have danger enough at their own doors if you want fighting return to your villages you will have plenty of it there the blackfeet warriors have hitherto made war upon you as children they are now coming as men a great force is at hand they are on their way to your towns and are determined to rub out the very name of the nez perces from the mountains return i say to your towns and fight there if you wish to live any longer as a people  kosato took him at his word for he knew the character of his native tribe hastening back with his band to the nez perces village he told all that he had seen and heard and urged the most prompt and strenuous measures for defence the nez perces however heard him with their accustomed phlegm the threat of the blackfeet had been often made and as often had proved a mere bravado such they pronounced it to be at present and of course took no precautions  they were soon convinced that it was no empty menace in a few days a band of three hundred blackfeet warriors appeared upon the hills all now was consternation in the village the force of the nez perces was too small to cope with the enemy in open fight many of the young men having gone to their relatives on the columbia to procure horses the sages met in hurried council what was to be done to ward off a blow which threatened annihilation in this moment of imminent peril a piercednose chief named blue john by the whites offered to approach secretly with a small but chosen band through a defile which led to the encampment of the enemy and by a sudden onset to drive off the horses should this blow be successful the spirit and strength of the invaders would be broken and the nez perces having horses would be more than a match for them should it fail the village would not be worse off than at present when destruction appeared inevitable  twentynine of the choicest warriors instantly volunteered to follow blue john in this hazardous enterprise they prepared for it with the solemnity and devotion peculiar to the tribe blue john consulted his medicine or talismanic charm such as every chief keeps in his lodge as a supernatural protection the oracle assured him that his enterprise would be completely successful provided no rain should fall before he had passed through the defile but should it rain his band would be utterly cut off  the day was clear and bright and blue john anticipated that the skies would be propitious he departed in high spirits with his forlorn hope and never did band of braves make a more gallant displayhorsemen and horses being decorated and equipped in the fiercest and most glaring styleglittering with arms and ornaments and fluttering with feathers  the weather continued serene until they reached the defile but just as they were entering it a black cloud rose over the mountain crest and there was a sudden shower the warriors turned to their leader as if to read his opinion of this unlucky omen but the countenance of blue john remained unchanged and they continued to press forward it was their hope to make their way undiscovered to the very vicinity of the blackfoot camp but they had not proceeded far in the defile when they met a scouting party of the enemy they attacked and drove them among the hills and were pursuing them with great eagerness when they heard shouts and yells behind them and beheld the main body of the blackfeet advancing  the second chief wavered a little at the sight and proposed an instant retreat we came to fight replied blue john sternly then giving his warwhoop he sprang forward to the conflict his braves followed him they made a headlong charge upon the enemy not with the hope of victory but the determination to sell their lives dearly a frightful carnage rather than a regular battle succeeded the forlorn band laid heaps of their enemies dead at their feet but were overwhelmed with numbers and pressed into a gorge of the mountain where they continued to fight until they were cut to pieces one only of the thirty survived he sprang on the horse of a blackfoot warrior whom he had slain and escaping at full speed brought home the baleful tidings to his village  who can paint the horror and desolation of the inhabitants the flower of their warriors laid low and a ferocious enemy at their doors the air was rent by the shrieks and lamentations of the women who casting off their ornaments and tearing their hair wandered about frantically bewailing the dead and predicting destruction to the living the remaining warriors armed themselves for obstinate defence but showed by their gloomy looks and sullen silence that they considered defence hopeless to their surprise the blackfeet refrained from pursuing their advantage perhaps satisfied with the blood already shed or disheartened by the loss they had themselves sustained at any rate they disappeared from the hills and it was soon ascertained that they had returned to the horse prairie  the unfortunate nez perces now began once more to breathe a few of their warriors taking packhorses repaired to the defile to bring away the bodies of their slaughtered brethren they found them mere headless trunks and the wounds with which they were covered showed how bravely they had fought their hearts too had been torn out and carried off a proof of their signal valor for in devouring the heart of a foe renowned for bravery or who has distinguished himself in battle the indian victor thinks he appropriates to himself the courage of the deceased  gathering the mangled bodies of the slain and strapping them across their packhorses the warriors returned in dismal procession to the village the tribe came forth to meet them the women with piercing cries and wailings the men with downcast countenances in which gloom and sorrow seemed fixed as if in marble the mutilated and almost undistinguishable bodies were placed in rows upon the ground in the midst of the assemblage and the scene of heartrending anguish and lamentation that ensued would have confounded those who insist on indian stoicism  such was the disastrous event that had overwhelmed the nez perces tribe during the absence of captain bonneville and he was informed that kosato the renegade who being stationed in the village had been prevented from going on the forlorn hope was again striving to rouse the vindictive feelings of his adopted brethren and to prompt them to revenge the slaughter of their devoted braves  during his sojourn on the snake river plain captain bonneville made one of his first essays at the strategy of the fur trade there was at this time an assemblage of nez perces flatheads and cottonois indians encamped together upon the plain well provided with beaver which they had collected during the spring these they were waiting to traffic with a resident trader of the hudsons bay company who was stationed among them and with whom they were accustomed to deal as it happened the trader was almost entirely destitute of indian goods his spring supply not having yet reached him captain bonneville had secret intelligence that the supplies were on their way and would soon arrive he hoped however by a prompt move to anticipate their arrival and secure the market to himself throwing himself therefore among the indians he opened his packs of merchandise and displayed the most tempting wares bright cloths and scarlet blankets and glittering ornaments and everything gay and glorious in the eyes of warrior or squaw all however was in vain the hudsons bay trader was a perfect master of his business thoroughly acquainted with the indians he had to deal with and held such control over them that none dared to act openly in opposition to his wishes nay morehe came nigh turning the tables upon the captain and shaking the allegiance of some of his free trappers by distributing liquors among them the latter therefore was glad to give up a competition where the war was likely to be carried into his own camp  in fact the traders of the hudsons bay company have advantages over all competitors in the trade beyond the rocky mountains that huge monopoly centers within itself not merely its own hereditary and longestablished power and influence but also those of its ancient rival but now integral part the famous northwest company it has thus its races of traders trappers hunters and voyageurs born and brought up in its service and inheriting from preceding generations a knowledge and aptitude in everything connected with indian life and indian traffic in the process of years this company has been enabled to spread its ramifications in every direction its system of intercourse is founded upon a long and intimate knowledge of the character and necessities of the various tribes and of all the fastnesses defiles and favorable hunting grounds of the country their capital also and the manner in which their supplies are distributed at various posts or forwarded by regular caravans keep their traders well supplied and enable them to furnish their goods to the indians at a cheap rate their men too being chiefly drawn from the canadas where they enjoy great influence and control are engaged at the most trifling wages and supported at little cost the provisions which they take with them being little more than indian corn and grease they are brought also into the most perfect discipline and subordination especially when their leaders have once got them to their scene of action in the heart of the wilderness  these circumstances combine to give the leaders of the hudsons bay company a decided advantage over all the american companies that come within their range so that any close competition with them is almost hopeless  shortly after captain bonnevilles ineffectual attempt to participate in the trade of the associated camp the supplies of the hudsons bay company arrived and the resident trader was enabled to monopolize the market  it was now the beginning of july in the latter part of which month captain bonneville had appointed a rendezvous at horse creek in green river valley with some of the parties which he had detached in the preceding year he now turned his thoughts in that direction and prepared for the journey  the cottonois were anxious for him to proceed at once to their country which they assured him abounded in beaver the lands of this tribe lie immediately north of those of the flatheads and are open to the inroads of the blackfeet it is true the latter professed to be their allies but they had been guilty of so many acts of perfidy that the cottonois had latterly renounced their hollow friendship and attached themselves to the flatheads and nez perces these they had accompanied in their migrations rather than remain alone at home exposed to the outrages of the blackfeet they were now apprehensive that these marauders would range their country during their absence and destroy the beaver this was their reason for urging captain bonneville to make it his autumnal hunting ground the latter however was not to be tempted his engagements required his presence at the rendezvous in green river valley and he had already formed his ulterior plans  an unexpected difficulty now arose the free trappers suddenly made a stand and declined to accompany him it was a long and weary journey the route lay through pierres hole and other mountain passes infested by the blackfeet and recently the scenes of sanguinary conflicts they were not disposed to undertake such unnecessary toils and dangers when they had good and secure trapping grounds nearer at hand on the headwaters of salmon river  as these were free and independent fellows whose will and whim were apt to be lawwho had the whole wilderness before them where to choose and the trader of a rival company at hand ready to pay for their servicesit was necessary to bend to their wishes captain bonneville fitted them out therefore for the hunting ground in question appointing mr hodgkiss to act as their partisan or leader and fixing a rendezvous where he should meet them in the course of the ensuing winter the brigade consisted of twentyone free trappers and four or five hired men as campkeepers this was not the exact arrangement of a trapping party which when accurately organized is composed of two thirds trappers whose duty leads them continually abroad in pursuit of game and one third campkeepers who cook pack and unpack set up the tents take care of the horses and do all other duties usually assigned by the indians to their women this part of the service is apt to be fulfilled by french creoles from canada and the valley of the mississippi  in the meantime the associated indians having completed their trade and received their supplies were all ready to disperse in various directions as there was a formidable band of blackfeet just over a mountain to the northeast by which hodgkiss and his free trappers would have to pass and as it was known that those sharpsighted marauders had their scouts out watching every movement of the encampments so as to cut off stragglers or weak detachments captain bonneville prevailed upon the nez perces to accompany hodgkiss and his party until they should be beyond the range of the enemy  the cottonois and the pends oreilles determined to move together at the same time and to pass close under the mountain infested by the blackfeet while captain bonneville with his party was to strike in an opposite direction to the southeast bending his course for pierres hole on his way to green river  accordingly on the 6th of july all the camps were raised at the same moment each party taking its separate route the scene was wild and picturesque the long line of traders trappers and indians with their rugged and fantastic dresses and accoutrements their varied weapons their innumerable horses some under the saddle some burdened with packages others following in droves all stretching in lengthening cavalcades across the vast landscape making for different points of the plains and mountains     19       precautions in dangerous defilestrappers mode of defence      on a prairiea mysterious visitorarrival in green river      valleyadventures of the detachmentsthe forlorn partisan      his tale of disasters  as the route of captain bonneville lay through what was considered the most perilous part of this region of dangers he took all his measures with military skill and observed the strictest circumspection when on the march a small scouting party was thrown in the advance to reconnoitre the country through which they were to pass the encampments were selected with great care and a watch was kept up night and day the horses were brought in and picketed at night and at daybreak a party was sent out to scour the neighborhood for half a mile round beating up every grove and thicket that could give shelter to a lurking foe when all was reported safe the horses were cast loose and turned out to graze were such precautions generally observed by traders and hunters we should not so often hear of parties being surprised by the indians  having stated the military arrangements of the captain we may here mention a mode of defence on the open prairie which we have heard from a veteran in the indian trade when a party of trappers is on a journey with a convoy of goods or peltries every man has three packhorses under his care each horse laden with three packs every man is provided with a picket with an iron head a mallet and hobbles or leathern fetters for the horses the trappers proceed across the prairie in a long line or sometimes three parallel lines sufficiently distant from each other to prevent the packs from interfering at an alarm when there is no covert at hand the line wheels so as to bring the front to the rear and form a circle all then dismount drive their pickets into the ground in the centre fasten the horses to them and hobble their forelegs so that in case of alarm they cannot break away then they unload them and dispose of their packs as breastworks on the periphery of the circle each man having nine packs behind which to shelter himself in this promptlyformed fortress they await the assault of the enemy and are enabled to set large bands of indians at defiance  the first night of his march captain bonneville encamped upon henrys fork an upper branch of snake river called after the first american trader that erected a fort beyond the mountains about an hour after all hands had come to a halt the clatter of hoofs was heard and a solitary female of the nez perce tribe came galloping up she was mounted on a mustang or half wild horse which she managed by a long rope hitched round the under jaw by way of bridle dismounting she walked silently into the midst of the camp and there seated herself on the ground still holding her horse by the long halter  the sudden and lonely apparition of this woman and her calm yet resolute demeanor awakened universal curiosity the hunters and trappers gathered round and gazed on her as something mysterious she remained silent but maintained her air of calmness and selfpossession captain bonneville approached and interrogated her as to the object of her mysterious visit her answer was brief but earnesti love the whitesi will go with them she was forthwith invited to a lodge of which she readily took possession and from that time forward was considered one of the camp  in consequence very probably of the military precautions of captain bonneville he conducted his party in safety through this hazardous region no accident of a disastrous kind occurred excepting the loss of a horse which in passing along the giddy edge of a precipice called the cornice a dangerous pass between jacksons and pierres hole fell over the brink and was dashed to pieces  on the 13th of july 1833 captain bonneville arrived at green river as he entered the valley he beheld it strewed in every direction with the carcasses of buffaloes it was evident that indians had recently been there and in great numbers alarmed at this sight he came to a halt and as soon as it was dark sent out spies to his place of rendezvous on horse creek where he had expected to meet with his detached parties of trappers on the following day early in the morning the spies made their appearance in the camp and with them came three trappers of one of his bands from the rendezvous who told him his people were all there expecting him as to the slaughter among the buffaloes it had been made by a friendly band of shoshonies who had fallen in with one of his trapping parties and accompanied them to the rendezvous having imparted this intelligence the three worthies from the rendezvous broached a small keg of alcohol which they had brought with them to enliven this merry meeting the liquor went briskly round all absent friends were toasted and the party moved forward to the rendezvous in high spirits  the meeting of associated bands who have been separated from each other on these hazardous enterprises is always interesting each having its tales of perils and adventures to relate such was the case with the various detachments of captain bonnevilles company thus brought together on horse creek here was the detachment of fifty men which he had sent from salmon river in the preceding month of november to winter on snake river they had met with many crosses and losses in the course of their spring hunt not so much from indians as from white men they had come in competition with rival trapping parties particularly one belonging to the rocky mountain fur company and they had long stories to relate of their manoeuvres to forestall or distress each other in fact in these virulent and sordid competitions the trappers of each party were more intent upon injuring their rivals than benefitting themselves breaking each others traps trampling and tearing to pieces the beaver lodges and doing every thing in their power to mar the success of the hunt we forbear to detail these pitiful contentions  the most lamentable tale of disasters however that captain bonneville had to hear was from a partisan whom he had detached in the preceding year with twenty men to hunt through the outskirts of the crow country and on the tributary streams of the yellowstone whence he was to proceed and join him in his winter quarters on salmon river this partisan appeared at the rendezvous without his party and a sorrowful tale of disasters had he to relate in hunting the crow country he fell in with a village of that tribe notorious rogues jockeys and horse stealers and errant scamperers of the mountains these decoyed most of his men to desert and carry off horses traps and accoutrements when he attempted to retake the deserters the crow warriors ruffled up to him and declared the deserters were their good friends had determined to remain among them and should not be molested the poor partisan therefore was fain to leave his vagabonds among these birds of their own feather and being too weak in numbers to attempt the dangerous pass across the mountains to meet captain bonneville on salmon river he made with the few that remained faithful to him for the neighborhood of tullocks fort on the yellowstone under the protection of which he went into winter quarters  he soon found out that the neighborhood of the fort was nearly as bad as the neighborhood of the crows his men were continually stealing away thither with whatever beaver skins they could secrete or lay their hands on these they would exchange with the hangerson of the fort for whiskey and then revel in drunkeness and debauchery  the unlucky partisan made another move associating with his party a few free trappers whom he met with in this neighborhood he started off early in the spring to trap on the head waters of powder river in the course of the journey his horses were so much jaded in traversing a steep mountain that he was induced to turn them loose to graze during the night the place was lonely the path was rugged there was not the sign of an indian in the neighborhood not a blade of grass that had been turned by a footstep but who can calculate on security in the midst of the indian country where the foe lurks in silence and secrecy and seems to come and go on the wings of the wind the horses had scarce been turned loose when a couple of arickara or rickaree warriors entered the camp they affected a frank and friendly demeanor but their appearance and movements awakened the suspicions of some of the veteran trappers well versed in indian wiles convinced that they were spies sent on some sinister errand they took them in custody and set to work to drive in the horses it was too latethe horses were already gone in fact a war party of arickaras had been hovering on their trail for several days watching with the patience and perseverance of indians for some moment of negligence and fancied security to make a successful swoop the two spies had evidently been sent into the camp to create a diversion while their confederates carried off the spoil  the unlucky partisan thus robbed of his horses turned furiously on his prisoners ordered them to be bound hand and foot and swore to put them to death unless his property were restored the robbers who soon found that their spies were in captivity now made their appearance on horseback and held a parley the sight of them mounted on the very horses they had stolen set the blood of the mountaineers in a ferment but it was useless to attack them as they would have but to turn their steeds and scamper out of the reach of pedestrians a negotiation was now attempted the arickaras offered what they considered fair terms to barter one horse or even two horses for a prisoner the mountaineers spurned at their offer and declared that unless all the horses were relinquished the prisoners should be burnt to death to give force to their threat a pyre of logs and fagots was heaped up and kindled into a blaze  the parley continued the arickaras released one horse and then another in earnest of their proposition finding however that nothing short of the relinquishment of all their spoils would purchase the lives of the captives they abandoned them to their fate moving off with many parting words and lamentable howlings the prisoners seeing them depart and knowing the horrible fate that awaited them made a desperate effort to escape they partially succeeded but were severely wounded and retaken then dragged to the blazing pyre and burnt to death in the sight of their retreating comrades  such are the savage cruelties that white men learn to practise who mingle in savage life and such are the acts that lead to terrible recrimination on the part of the indians should we hear of any atrocities committed by the arickaras upon captive white men let this signal and recent provocation be borne in mind individual cases of the kind dwell in the recollections of whole tribes and it is a point of honor and conscience to revenge them  the loss of his horses completed the ruin of the unlucky partisan it was out of his power to prosecute his hunting or to maintain his party the only thought now was how to get back to civilized life at the first watercourse his men built canoes and committed themselves to the stream some engaged themselves at various trading establishments at which they touched others got back to the settlements as to the partisan he found an opportunity to make his way to the rendezvous at green river valley which he reached in time to render to captain bonneville this forlorn account of his misadventures     20       gathering in green river valleyvisitings and feastings of      leadersrough wassailing among the trapperswild blades of      the mountainsindian bellespotency of bright beads and      red blanketsarrival of suppliesrevelry and extravagance      mad wolvesthe lost indian  the green river valley was at this time the scene of one of those general gatherings of traders trappers and indians that we have already mentioned the three rival companies which for a year past had been endeavoring to outtrade outtrap and outwit each other were here encamped in close proximity awaiting their annual supplies about four miles from the rendezvous of captain bonneville was that of the american fur company hard by which was that also of the rocky mountain fur company  after the eager rivalry and almost hostility displayed by these companies in their late campaigns it might be expected that when thus brought in juxtaposition they would hold themselves warily and sternly aloof from each other and should they happen to come in contact brawl and bloodshed would ensue  no such thing never did rival lawyers after a wrangle at the bar meet with more social good humor at a circuit dinner the hunting season over all past tricks and maneuvres are forgotten all feuds and bickerings buried in oblivion from the middle of june to the middle of september all trapping is suspended for the beavers are then shedding their furs and their skins are of little value this then is the trappers holiday when he is all for fun and frolic and ready for a saturnalia among the mountains  at the present season too all parties were in good humor the year had been productive competition by threatening to lessen their profits had quickened their wits roused their energies and made them turn every favorable chance to the best advantage so that on assembling at their respective places of rendezvous each company found itself in possession of a rich stock of peltries  the leaders of the different companies therefore mingled on terms of perfect good fellowship interchanging visits and regaling each other in the best style their respective camps afforded but the rich treat for the worthy captain was to see the chivalry of the various encampments engaged in contests of skill at running jumping wrestling shooting with the rifle and running horses and then their rough hunters feastings and carousels they drank together they sang they laughed they whooped they tried to outbrag and outlie each other in stories of their adventures and achievements here the free trappers were in all their glory they considered themselves the cocks of the walk and always carried the highest crests now and then familiarity was pushed too far and would effervesce into a brawl and a rough and tumble fight but it all ended in cordial reconciliation and maudlin endearment  the presence of the shoshonie tribe contributed occasionally to cause temporary jealousies and feuds the shoshonie beauties became objects of rivalry among some of the amorous mountaineers happy was the trapper who could muster up a red blanket a string of gay beads or a paper of precious vermilion with which to win the smiles of a shoshonie fair one  the caravans of supplies arrived at the valley just at this period of gallantry and good fellowship now commenced a scene of eager competition and wild prodigality at the different encampments bales were hastily ripped open and their motley contents poured forth a mania for purchasing spread itself throughout the several bandsmunitions for war for hunting for gallantry were seized upon with equal avidityrifles hunting knives traps scarlet cloth red blankets garish beads and glittering trinkets were bought at any price and scores run up without any thought how they were ever to be rubbed off the free trappers especially were extravagant in their purchases for a free mountaineer to pause at a paltry consideration of dollars and cents in the attainment of any object that might strike his fancy would stamp him with the mark of the beast in the estimation of his comrades for a trader to refuse one of these free and flourishing blades a credit whatever unpaid scores might stare him in the face would be a flagrant affront scarcely to be forgiven  now succeeded another outbreak of revelry and extravagance the trappers were newly fitted out and arrayed and dashed about with their horses caparisoned in indian style the shoshonie beauties also flaunted about in all the colors of the rainbow every freak of prodigality was indulged to its fullest extent and in a little while most of the trappers having squandered away all their wages and perhaps run kneedeep in debt were ready for another hard campaign in the wilderness  during this season of folly and frolic there was an alarm of mad wolves in the two lower camps one or more of these animals entered the camps for three nights successively and bit several of the people  captain bonneville relates the case of an indian who was a universal favorite in the lower camp he had been bitten by one of these animals being out with a party shortly afterwards he grew silent and gloomy and lagged behind the rest as if he wished to leave them they halted and urged him to move faster but he entreated them not to approach him and leaping from his horse began to roll frantically on the earth gnashing his teeth and foaming at the mouth still he retained his senses and warned his companions not to come near him as he should not be able to restrain himself from biting them they hurried off to obtain relief but on their return he was nowhere to be found his horse and his accoutrements remained upon the spot three or four days afterwards a solitary indian believed to be the same was observed crossing a valley and pursued but he darted away into the fastnesses of the mountains and was seen no more  another instance we have from a different person who was present in the encampment one of the men of the rocky mountain fur company had been bitten he set out shortly afterwards in company with two white men on his return to the settlements in the course of a few days he showed symptoms of hydrophobia and became raving toward night at length breaking away from his companions he rushed into a thicket of willows where they left him to his fate     21       schemes of captain bonnevillethe great salt lake      expedition to explore itpreparations for a journey to the      bighorn  captain bonneville now found himself at the head of a hardy wellseasoned and wellappointed company of trappers all benefited by at least one years experience among the mountains and capable of protecting themselves from indian wiles and stratagems and of providing for their subsistence wherever game was to be found he had also an excellent troop of horses in prime condition and fit for hard service he determined therefore to strike out into some of the bolder parts of his scheme one of these was to carry his expeditions into some of the unknown tracts of the far west beyond what is generally termed the buffalo range this would have something of the merit and charm of discovery so dear to every brave and adventurous spirit another favorite project was to establish a trading post on the lower part of the columbia river near the multnomah valley and to endeavor to retrieve for his country some of the lost trade of astoria  the first of the above mentioned views was at present uppermost in his mindthe exploring of unknown regions among the grand features of the wilderness about which he was roaming one had made a vivid impression on his mind and been clothed by his imagination with vague and ideal charms this is a great lake of salt water laving the feet of the mountains but extending far to the westsouthwest into one of those vast and elevated plateaus of land which range high above the level of the pacific  captain bonneville gives a striking account of the lake when seen from the land as you ascend the mountains about its shores says he you behold this immense body of water spreading itself before you and stretching further and further in one wide and farreaching expanse until the eye wearied with continued and strained attention rests in the blue dimness of distance upon lofty ranges of mountains confidently asserted to rise from the bosom of the waters nearer to you the smooth and unruffled surface is studded with little islands where the mountain sheep roam in considerable numbers what extent of lowland may be encompassed by the high peaks beyond must remain for the present matter of mere conjecture though from the form of the summits and the breaks which may be discovered among them there can be little doubt that they are the sources of streams calculated to water large tracts which are probably concealed from view by the rotundity of the lakes surface at some future day in all probability the rich harvest of beaver fur which may be reasonably anticipated in such a spot will tempt adventurers to reduce all this doubtful region to the palpable certainty of a beaten track at present however destitute of the means of making boats the trapper stands upon the shore and gazes upon a promised land which his feet are never to tread  such is the somewhat fanciful view which captain bonneville gives to this great body of water he has evidently taken part of his ideas concerning it from the representations of others who have somewhat exaggerated its features it is reported to be about one hundred and fifty miles long and fifty miles broad the ranges of mountain peaks which captain bonneville speaks of as rising from its bosom are probably the summits of mountains beyond it which may be visible at a vast distance when viewed from an eminence in the transparent atmosphere of these lofty regions several large islands certainly exist in the lake one of which is said to be mountainous but not by any means to the extent required to furnish the series of peaks above mentioned  captain sublette in one of his early expeditions across the mountains is said to have sent four men in a skin canoe to explore the lake who professed to have navigated all round it but to have suffered excessively from thirst the water of the lake being extremely salt and there being no fresh streams running into it  captain bonneville doubts this report or that the men accomplished the circumnavigation because he says the lake receives several large streams from the mountains which bound it to the east in the spring when the streams are swollen by rain and by the melting of the snows the lake rises several feet above its ordinary level during the summer it gradually subsides again leaving a sparkling zone of the finest salt upon its shores  the elevation of the vast plateau on which this lake is situated is estimated by captain bonneville at one and threefourths of a mile above the level of the ocean the admirable purity and transparency of the atmosphere in this region allowing objects to be seen and the report of firearms to be heard at an astonishing distance and its extreme dryness causing the wheels of wagons to fall in pieces as instanced in former passages of this work are proofs of the great altitude of the rocky mountain plains that a body of salt water should exist at such a height is cited as a singular phenomenon by captain bonneville though the salt lake of mexico is not much inferior in elevation  to have this lake properly explored and all its secrets revealed was the grand scheme of the captain for the present year and while it was one in which his imagination evidently took a leading part he believed it would be attended with great profit from the numerous beaver streams with which the lake must be fringed  this momentous undertaking he confided to his lieutenant mr walker in whose experience and ability he had great confidence he instructed him to keep along the shores of the lake and trap in all the streams on his route also to keep a journal and minutely to record the events of his journey and everything curious or interesting making maps or charts of his route and of the surrounding country  no pains nor expense were spared in fitting out the party of forty men which he was to command they had complete supplies for a year and were to meet captain bonneville in the ensuing summer in the valley of bear river the largest tributary of the salt lake which was to be his point of general rendezvous  the next care of captain bonneville was to arrange for the safe transportation of the peltries which he had collected to the atlantic states mr robert campbell the partner of sublette was at this time in the rendezvous of the rocky mountain fur company having brought up their supplies he was about to set off on his return with the peltries collected during the year and intended to proceed through the crow country to the head of navigation on the bighorn river and to descend in boats down that river the missouri and the yellowstone to st louis  captain bonneville determined to forward his peltries by the same route under the especial care of mr cerre by way of escort he would accompany cerre to the point of embarkation and then make an autumnal hunt in the crow country     22       the crow countrya crow paradise habits of the crows      anecdotes of rose the renegade white manhis fights with      the blackfeethis elevationhis deatharapooish the crow      chiefhis eagle adventure of robert campbellhonor among      crows  before we accompany captain bonneville into the crow country we will impart a few facts about this wild region and the wild people who inhabit it we are not aware of the precise boundaries if there are any of the country claimed by the crows it appears to extend from the black hills to the rocky mountains including a part of their lofty ranges and embracing many of the plains and valleys watered by the wind river the yellowstone the powder river the little missouri and the nebraska the country varies in soil and climate there are vast plains of sand and clay studded with large red sandhills other parts are mountainous and picturesque it possesses warm springs and coal mines and abounds with game  but let us give the account of the country as rendered by arapooish a crow chief to mr robert campbell of the rocky mountain fur company  the crow country said he is a good country the great spirit has put it exactly in the right place while youare in it you fare well whenever you go out of it whichever way you travel you fare worse  if you go to the south you have to wander over great barren plains the water is warm and bad and you meet the fever and ague  to the north it is cold the winters are long and bitter with no grass you cannot keep horses there but must travel with dogs what is a country without horses  on the columbia they are poor and dirty paddle about in canoes and eat fish their teeth are worn out they are always taking fishbones out of their mouths fish is poor food  to the east they dwell in villages they live well but they drink the muddy water of the missourithat is bad a crows dog would not drink such water  about the forks of the missouri is a fine country good water good grass plenty of buffalo in summer it is almost as good as the crow country but in winter it is cold the grass is gone and there is no salt weed for the horses  the crow country is exactly in the right place it has snowy mountains and sunny plains all kinds of climates and good things for every season when the summer heats scorch the prairies you can draw up under the mountains where the air is sweet and cool the grass fresh and the bright streams come tumbling out of the snowbanks there you can hunt the elk the deer and the antelope when their skins are fit for dressing there you will find plenty of white bears and mountain sheep  in the autumn when your horses are fat and strong from the mountain pastures you can go down into the plains and hunt the buffalo or trap beaver on the streams and when winter comes on you can take shelter in the woody bottoms along the rivers there you will find buffalo meat for yourselves and cottonwood bark for your horses or you may winter in the wind river valley where there is salt weed in abundance  the crow country is exactly in the right place everything good is to be found there there is no country like the crow country  such is the eulogium on his country by arapooish  we have had repeated occasions to speak of the restless and predatory habits of the crows they can muster fifteen hundred fighting men but their incessant wars with the blackfeet and their vagabond predatory habits are gradually wearing them out  in a recent work we related the circumstance of a white man named rose an outlaw and a designing vagabond who acted as guide and interpreter to mr hunt and his party on their journey across the mountains to astoria who came near betraying them into the hands of the crows and who remained among the tribe marrying one of their women and adopting their congenial habits a few anecdotes of the subsequent fortunes of that renegade may not be uninteresting especially as they are connected with the fortunes of the tribe  rose was powerful in frame and fearless in spirit and soon by his daring deeds took his rank among the first braves of the tribe he aspired to command and knew it was only to be attained by desperate exploits he distinguished himself in repeated actions with blackfeet on one occasion a band of those savages had fortified themselves within a breastwork and could not be harmed rose proposed to storm the work who will take the lead was the demand i cried he and putting himself at their head rushed forward the first blackfoot that opposed him he shot down with his rifle and snatching up the warclub of his victim killed four others within the fort the victory was complete and rose returned to the crow village covered with glory and bearing five blackfoot scalps to be erected as a trophy before his lodge from this time he was known among the crows by the name of chekukaats or the man who killed five he became chief of the village or rather band and for a time was the popular idol his popularity soon awakened envy among the native braves he was a stranger an intruder a white man a party seceded from his command feuds and civil wars succeeded that lasted for two or three years until rose having contrived to set his adopted brethren by the ears left them and went down the missouri in 1823 here he fell in with one of the earliest trapping expeditions sent by general ashley across the mountains it was conducted by smith fitzpatrick and sublette rose enlisted with them as guide and interpreter when he got them among the crows he was exceedingly generous with their goods making presents to the braves of his adopted tribe as became a highminded chief  this doubtless helped to revive his popularity in that expedition smith and fitzpatrick were robbed of their horses in green river valley the place where the robbery took place still bears the name of horse creek we are not informed whether the horses were stolen through the instigation and management of rose it is not improbable for such was the perfidy he had intended to practice on a former occasion toward mr hunt and his party  the last anecdote we have of rose is from an indian trader when general atkinson made his military expedition up the missouri in 1825 to protect the fur trade he held a conference with the crow nation at which rose figured as indian dignitary and crow interpreter the military were stationed at some little distance from the scene of the big talk while the general and the chiefs were smoking pipes and making speeches the officers supposing all was friendly left the troops and drew near the scene of ceremonial some of the more knowing crows perceiving this stole quietly to the camp and unobserved contrived to stop the touchholes of the fieldpieces with dirt shortly after a misunderstanding occurred in the conference some of the indians knowing the cannon to be useless became insolent a tumult arose in the confusion colonel ofallan snapped a pistol in the face of a brave and knocked him down with the butt end the crows were all in a fury a chancemedley fight was on the point of taking place when rose his natural sympathies as a white man suddenly recurring broke the stock of his fusee over the head of a crow warrior and laid so vigorously about him with the barrel that he soon put the whole throng to flight luckily as no lives had been lost this sturdy rib roasting calmed the fury of the crows and the tumult ended without serious consequences  what was the ultimate fate of this vagabond hero is not distinctly known some report him to have fallen a victim to disease brought on by his licentious life others assert that he was murdered in a feud among the crows after all his residence among these savages and the influence he acquired over them had for a time some beneficial effects he is said not merely to have rendered them more formidable to the blackfeet but to have opened their eyes to the policy of cultivating the friendship of the white men  after roses death his policy continued to be cultivated with indifferent success by arapooish the chief already mentioned who had been his great friend and whose character he had contributed to develope this sagacious chief endeavored on every occasion to restrain the predatory propensities of his tribe when directed against the white men if we keep friends with them said he we have nothing to fear from the blackfeet and can rule the mountains arapooish pretended to be a great medicine man a character among the indians which is a compound of priest doctor prophet and conjurer he carried about with him a tame eagle as his medicine or familiar with the white men he acknowledged that this was all charlatanism but said it was necessary to give him weight and influence among his people  mr robert campbell from whom we have most of these facts in the course of one of his trapping expeditions was quartered in the village of arapooish and a guest in the lodge of the chieftain he had collected a large quantity of furs and fearful of being plundered deposited but a part in the lodge of the chief the rest he buried in a cache one night arapooish came into the lodge with a cloudy brow and seated himself for a time without saying a word at length turning to campbell you have more furs with you said he than you have brought into my lodge  i have replied campbell  where are they  campbell knew the uselessness of any prevarication with an indian and the importance of complete frankness he described the exact place where he had concealed his peltries  tis well replied arapooish you speak straight it is just as you say but your cache has been robbed go and see how many skins have been taken from it  campbell examined the cache and estimated his loss to be about one hundred and fifty beaver skins  arapooish now summoned a meeting of the village he bitterly reproached his people for robbing a stranger who had confided to their honor and commanded that whoever had taken the skins should bring them back declaring that as campbell was his guest and inmate of his lodge he would not eat nor drink until every skin was restored to him  the meeting broke up and every one dispersed arapooish now charged campbell to give neither reward nor thanks to any one who should bring in the beaver skins but to keep count as they were delivered  in a little while the skins began to make their appearance a few at a time they were laid down in the lodge and those who brought them departed without saying a word the day passed away arapooish sat in one corner of his lodge wrapped up in his robe scarcely moving a muscle of his countenance when night arrived he demanded if all the skins had been brought in above a hundred had been given up and campbell expressed himself contented not so the crow chieftain he fasted all that night nor tasted a drop of water in the morning some more skins were brought in and continued to come one and two at a time throughout the day until but a few were wanting to make the number complete campbell was now anxious to put an end to this fasting of the old chief and again declared that he was perfectly satisfied arapooish demanded what number of skins were yet wanting on being told he whispered to some of his people who disappeared after a time the number were brought in though it was evident they were not any of the skins that had been stolen but others gleaned in the village  is all right now demanded arapooish  all is right replied campbell  good now bring me meat and drink  when they were alone together arapooish had a conversation with his guest  when you come another time among the crows said he dont hide your goods trust to them and they will not wrong you put your goods in the lodge of a chief and they are sacred hide them in a cache and any one who finds will steal them my people have now given up your goods for my sake but there are some foolish young men in the village who may be disposed to be troublesome dont linger therefore but pack your horses and be off  campbell took his advice and made his way safely out of the crow country he has ever since maintained that the crows are not so black as they are painted trust to their honor says he and you are safe trust to their honesty and they will steal the hair off your head  having given these few preliminary particulars we will resume the course of our narrative     23       departure

out on his route for the bighorn at the head of a party of fiftysix men including those who were to embark with cerre crossing the green river valley he proceeded along the south point of the wind river range of mountains and soon fell upon the track of mr robert campbells party which had preceded him by a day this he pursued until he perceived that it led down the banks of the sweet water to the southeast as this was different from his proposed direction he left it and turning to the northeast soon came upon the waters of the popo agie this stream takes its rise in the wind river mountains its name like most indian names is characteristic popo in the crow language signifies head and agie river it is the head of a long river extending from the south end of the wind river mountains in a northeast direction until it falls into the yellowstone its course is generally through plains but is twice crossed by chains of mountains the first called the littlehorn the second the bighorn after it has forced its way through the first chain it is called the horn river after the second chain it is called the bighorn river its passage through this last chain is rough and violent making repeated falls and rushing down long and furious rapids which threaten destruction to the navigator though a hardy trapper is said to have shot down them in a canoe at the foot of these rapids is the head of navigation where it was the intention of the parties to construct boats and embark  proceeding down along the popo agie captain bonneville came again in full view of the bluffs as they are called extending from the base of the wind river mountains far away to the east and presenting to the eye a confusion of hills and cliffs of red sandstone some peaked and angular some round some broken into crags and precipices and piled up in fantastic masses but all naked and sterile there appeared to be no soil favorable to vegetation nothing but coarse gravel yet over all this isolated barren landscape were diffused such atmospherical tints and hues as to blend the whole into harmony and beauty  in this neighborhood the captain made search for the great tar spring one of the wonders of the mountains the medicinal properties of which he had heard extravagantly lauded by the trappers after a toilsome search he found it at the foot of a sandbluff a little east of the wind river mountains where it exuded in a small stream of the color and consistency of tar the men immediately hastened to collect a quantity of it to use as an ointment for the galled backs of their horses and as a balsam for their own pains and aches from the description given of it it is evidently the bituminous oil called petrolium or naphtha which forms a principal ingredient in the potent medicine called british oil it is found in various parts of europe and asia in several of the west india islands and in some places of the united states in the state of new york it is called seneca oil from being found near the seneca lake  the crow country has other natural curiosities which are held in superstitious awe by the indians and considered great marvels by the trappers such is the burning mountain on powder river abounding with anthracite coal here the earth is hot and cracked in many places emitting smoke and sulphurous vapors as if covering concealed fires a volcanic tract of similar character is found on stinking river one of the tributaries of the bighorn which takes its unhappy name from the odor derived from sulphurous springs and streams this last mentioned place was first discovered by colter a hunter belonging to lewis and clarkes exploring party who came upon it in the course of his lonely wanderings and gave such an account of its gloomy terrors its hidden fires smoking pits noxious streams and the allpervading smell of brimstone that it received and has ever since retained among trappers the name of colters hell  resuming his descent along the left bank of the popo agie captain bonneville soon reached the plains where he found several large streams entering from the west among these was wind river which gives its name to the mountains among which it takes its rise this is one of the most important streams of the crow country the river being much swollen captain bonneville halted at its mouth and sent out scouts to look for a fording place while thus encamped he beheld in the course of the afternoon a long line of horsemen descending the slope of the hills on the opposite side of the popo agie his first idea was that they were indians he soon discovered however that they were white men and by the long line of packhorses ascertained them to be the convoy of campbell which having descended the sweet water was now on its way to the horn river  the two parties came together two or three days afterwards on the 4th of august after having passed through the gap of the littlehorn mountain in company with campbells convoy was a trapping party of the rocky mountain company headed by fitzpatrick who after campbells embarkation on the bighorn was to take charge of all the horses and proceed on a trapping campaign there were moreover two chance companions in the rival camp one was captain stewart of the british army a gentleman of noble connections who was amusing himself by a wandering tour in the far west in the course of which he had lived in hunters style accompanying various bands of traders trappers and indians and manifesting that relish for the wilderness that belongs to men of game spirit  the other casual inmate of mr campbells camp was mr nathaniel wyeth the selfsame leader of the band of new england salmon fishers with whom we parted company in the valley of pierres hole after the battle with the blackfeet a few days after that affair he again set out from the rendezvous in company with milton sublette and his brigade of trappers on his march he visited the battle ground and penetrated to the deserted fort of the blackfeet in the midst of the wood it was a dismal scene the fort was strewed with the mouldering bodies of the slain while vultures soared aloft or sat brooding on the trees around and indian dogs howled about the place as if bewailing the death of their masters wyeth travelled for a considerable distance to the southwest in company with milton sublette when they separated and the former with eleven men the remnant of his band pushed on for snake river kept down the course of that eventful stream traversed the blue mountains trapping beaver occasionally by the way and finally after hardships of all kinds arrived on the 29th of october at vancouver on the columbia the main factory of the hudsons bay company  he experienced hospitable treatment at the hands of the agents of that company but his men heartily tired of wandering in the wilderness or tempted by other prospects refused for the most part to continue any longer in his service some set off for the sandwich islands some entered into other employ wyeth found too that a great part of the goods he had brought with him were unfitted for the indian trade in a word his expedition undertaken entirely on his own resources proved a failure he lost everything invested in it but his hopes these were as strong as ever he took note of every thing therefore that could be of service to him in the further prosecution of his project collected all the information within his reach and then set off accompanied by merely two men on his return journey across the continent he had got thus far by hook and by crook a mode in which a new england man can make his way all over the world and through all kinds of difficulties and was now bound for boston in full confidence of being able to form a company for the salmon fishery and fur trade of the columbia  the party of mr campbell had met with a disaster in the course of their route from the sweet water three or four of the men who were reconnoitering the country in advance of the main body were visited one night in their camp by fifteen or twenty shoshonies considering this tribe as perfectly friendly they received them in the most cordial and confiding manner in the course of the night the man on guard near the horses fell sound asleep upon which a shoshonie shot him in the head and nearly killed him the savages then made off with the horses leaving the rest of the party to find their way to the main body on foot  the rival companies of captain bonneville and mr campbell thus fortuitously brought together now prosecuted their journey in great good fellowship forming a joint camp of about a hundred men the captain however began to entertain doubts that fitzpatrick and his trappers who kept profound silence as to their future movements intended to hunt the same grounds which he had selected for his autumnal campaign which lay to the west of the horn river on its tributary streams in the course of his march therefore he secretly detached a small party of trappers to make their way to those hunting grounds while he continued on with the main body appointing a rendezvous at the next full moon about the 28th of august at a place called the medicine lodge  on reaching the second chain called the bighorn mountains where the river forced its impetuous way through a precipitous defile with cascades and rapids the travellers were obliged to leave its banks and traverse the mountains by a rugged and frightful route emphatically called the bad pass descending the opposite side they again made for the river banks and about the middle of august reached the point below the rapids where the river becomes navigable for boats here captain bonneville detached a second party of trappers consisting of ten men to seek and join those whom he had detached while on the route appointing for them the same rendezvous at the medicine lodge on the 28th of august  all hands now set to work to construct bull boats as they are technically called a light fragile kind of bark characteristic of the expedients and inventions of the wilderness being formed of buffalo skins stretched on frames they are sometimes also called skin boats wyeth was the first ready and with his usual promptness and hardihood launched his frail bark singly on this wild and hazardous voyage down an almost interminable succession of rivers winding through countries teeming with savage hordes milton sublette his former fellow traveller and his companion in the battle scenes of pierres hole took passage in his boat his crew consisted of two white men and two indians we shall hear further of wyeth and his wild voyage in the course of our wanderings about the far west  the remaining parties soon completed their several armaments that of captain bonneville was composed of three bull boats in which he embarked all his peltries giving them in charge of mr cerre with a party of thirtysix men mr campbell took command of his own boats and the little squadrons were soon gliding down the bright current of the bighorn  the secret precautions which captain bonneville had taken to throw his men first into the trapping ground west of the bighorn were probably superfluous it did not appear that fitzpatrick had intended to hunt in that direction the moment mr campbell and his men embarked with the peltries fitzpatrick took charge of all the horses amounting to above a hundred and struck off to the east to trap upon littlehorn powder and tongue rivers he was accompanied by captain stewart who was desirous of having a range about the crow country of the adventures they met with in that region of vagabonds and horse stealers we shall have something to relate hereafter  captain bonneville being now left to prosecute his trapping campaign without rivalry set out on the 17th of august for the rendezvous at medicine lodge he had but four men remaining with him and fortysix horses to take care of with these he had to make his way over mountain and plain through a marauding horsestealing region full of peril for a numerous cavalcade so slightly manned he addressed himself to his difficult journey however with his usual alacrity of spirit  in the afternoon of his first days journey on drawing near to the bighorn mountain on the summit of which he intended to encamp for the night he observed to his disquiet a cloud of smoke rising from its base he came to a halt and watched it anxiously it was very irregular sometimes it would almost die away and then would mount up in heavy volumes there was apparently a large party encamped there probably some ruffian horde of blackfeet at any rate it would not do for so small a number of men with so numerous a cavalcade to venture within sight of any wandering tribe captain bonneville and his companions therefore avoided this dangerous neighborhood and proceeding with extreme caution reached the summit of the mountain apparently without being discovered here they found a deserted blackfoot fort in which they ensconced themselves disposed of every thing as securely as possible and passed the night without molestation early the next morning they descended the south side of the mountain into the great plain extending between it and the littlehorn range here they soon came upon numerous footprints and the carcasses of buffaloes by which they knew there must be indians not far off captain bonneville now began to feel solicitude about the two small parties of trappers which he had detached lest the indians should have come upon them before they had united their forces but he felt still more solicitude about his own party for it was hardly to be expected he could traverse these naked plains undiscovered when indians were abroad and should he be discovered his chance would be a desperate one everything now depended upon the greatest circumspection it was dangerous to discharge a gun or light a fire or make the least noise where such quickeared and quicksighted enemies were at hand in the course of the day they saw indubitable signs that the buffalo had been roaming there in great numbers and had recently been frightened away that night they encamped with the greatest care and threw up a strong breastwork for their protection  for the two succeeding days they pressed forward rapidly but cautiously across the great plain fording the tributary streams of the horn river encamping one night among thickets the next on an island meeting repeatedly with traces of indians and now and then in passing through a defile experiencing alarms that induced them to cock their rifles  on the last day of their march hunger got the better of their caution and they shot a fine buffalo bull at the risk of being betrayed by the report they did not halt to make a meal but carried the meat on with them to the place of rendezvous the medicine lodge where they arrived safely in the evening and celebrated their arrival by a hearty supper  the next morning they erected a strong pen for the horses and a fortress of logs for themselves and continued to observe the greatest caution their cooking was all done at midday when the fire makes no glare and a moderate smoke cannot be perceived at any great distance in the morning and the evening when the wind is lulled the smoke rises perpendicularly in a blue column or floats in light clouds above the treetops and can be discovered from afar  in this way the little party remained for several days cautiously encamped until on the 29th of august the two detachments they had been expecting arrived together at the rendezvous they as usual had their several tales of adventures to relate to the captain which we will furnish to the reader in the next chapter     24       adventures of the party of tenthebalaamite mulea dead      pointthe mysterious elksa night attacka retreat      travelling under an alarma joyful meetingadventures of      the other partya decoy elkretreat to an islanda savage      dance of triumpharrival at wind river  the adventures of the detachment of ten are the first in order these trappers when they separated from captain bonneville at the place where the furs were embarked proceeded to the foot of the bighorn mountain and having encamped one of them mounted his mule and went out to set his trap in a neighboring stream he had not proceeded far when his steed came to a full stop the trapper kicked and cudgelled but to every blow and kick the mule snorted and kicked up but still refused to budge an inch the rider now cast his eyes warily around in search of some cause for this demur when to his dismay he discovered an indian fort within gunshot distance lowering through the twilight in a twinkling he wheeled about his mule now seemed as eager to get on as himself and in a few moments brought him clattering with his traps among his comrades he was jeered at for his alacrity in retreating his report was treated as a false alarm his brother trappers contented themselves with reconnoitring the fort at a distance and pronounced that it was deserted  as night set in the usual precaution enjoined by captain bonneville on his men was observed the horses were brought in and tied and a guard stationed over them this done the men wrapped themselves in their blankets stretched themselves before the fire and being fatigued with a long days march and gorged with a hearty supper were soon in a profound sleep  the camp fires gradually died away all was dark and silent the sentinel stationed to watch the horses had marched as far and supped as heartily as any of his companions and while they snored he began to nod at his post after a time a low trampling noise reached his ear he half opened his closing eyes and beheld two or three elks moving about the lodges picking and smelling and grazing here and there the sight of elk within the purlieus of the camp caused some little surprise but having had his supper he cared not for elk meat and suffering them to graze about unmolested soon relapsed into a doze  suddenly before daybreak a discharge of firearms and a struggle and tramp of horses made every one start to his feet the first move was to secure the horses some were gone others were struggling and kicking and trembling for there was a horrible uproar of whoops and yells and firearms several trappers stole quietly from the camp and succeeded in driving in the horses which had broken away the rest were tethered still more strongly a breastwork was thrown up of saddles baggage and camp furniture and all hands waited anxiously for daylight the indians in the meantime collected on a neighboring height kept up the most horrible clamor in hopes of striking a panic into the camp or frightening off the horses when the day dawned the trappers attacked them briskly and drove them to some distance a desultory fire was kept up for an hour when the indians seeing nothing was to be gained gave up the contest and retired they proved to be a war party of blackfeet who while in search of the crow tribe had fallen upon the trail of captain bonneville on the popo agie and dogged him to the bighorn but had been completely baffled by his vigilance they had then waylaid the present detachment and were actually housed in perfect silence within their fort when the mule of the trapper made such a dead point  the savages went off uttering the wildest denunciations of hostility mingled with opprobrious terms in broken english and gesticulations of the most insulting kind  in this melee one white man was wounded and two horses were killed on preparing the mornings meal however a number of cups knives and other articles were missing which had doubtless been carried off by the fictitious elk during the slumber of the very sagacious sentinel as the indians had gone off in the direction which the trappers had intended to travel the latter changed their route and pushed forward rapidly through the bad pass nor halted until night when supposing themselves out of the reach of the enemy they contented themselves with tying up their horses and posting a guard they had scarce laid down to sleep when a dog strayed into the camp with a small pack of moccasons tied upon his back for dogs are made to carry burdens among the indians the sentinel more knowing than he of the preceding night awoke his companions and reported the circumstance it was evident that indians were at hand all were instantly at work a strong pen was soon constructed for the horses after completing which they resumed their slumbers with the composure of men long inured to dangers  in the next night the prowling of dogs about the camp and various suspicious noises showed that indians were still hovering about them hurrying on by long marches they at length fell upon a trail which with the experienced eye of veteran woodmen they soon discovered to be that of the party of trappers detached by captain bonneville when on his march and which they were sent to join they likewise ascertained from various signs that this party had suffered some maltreatment from the indians they now pursued the trail with intense anxiety it carried them to the banks of the stream called the gray bull and down along its course until they came to where it empties into the horn river here to their great joy they discovered the comrades of whom they were in search all strongly fortified and in a state of great watchfulness and anxiety  we now take up the adventures of this first detachment of trappers these men after parting with the main body under captain bonneville had proceeded slowly for several days up the course of the river trapping beaver as they went one morning as they were about to visit their traps one of the campkeepers pointed to a fine elk grazing at a distance and requested them to shoot it three of the trappers started off for the purpose in passing a thicket they were fired upon by some savages in ambush and at the same time the pretended elk throwing off his hide and his horn started forth an indian warrior  one of the three trappers had been brought down by the volley the others fled to the camp and all hands seizing up whatever they could carry off retreated to a small island in the river and took refuge among the willows here they were soon joined by their comrade who had fallen but who had merely been wounded in the neck  in the meantime the indians took possession of the deserted camp with all the traps accoutrements and horses while they were busy among the spoils a solitary trapper who had been absent at his work came sauntering to the camp with his traps on his back he had approached near by when an indian came forward and motioned him to keep away at the same moment he was perceived by his comrades on the island and warned of his danger with loud cries the poor fellow stood for a moment bewildered and aghast then dropping his traps wheeled and made off at full speed quickened by a sportive volley which the indians rattled after him  in high good humor with their easy triumph the savages now formed a circle round the fire and performed a war dance with the unlucky trappers for rueful spectators this done emboldened by what they considered cowardice on the part of the white men they neglected their usual mode of bushfighting and advanced openly within twenty paces of the willows a sharp volley from the trappers brought them to a sudden halt and laid three of them breathless the chief who had stationed himself on an eminence to direct all the movements of his people seeing three of his warriors laid low ordered the rest to retire they immediately did so and the whole band soon disappeared behind a point of woods carrying off with them the horses traps and the greater part of the baggage  it was just after this misfortune that the party of ten men discovered this forlorn band of trappers in a fortress which they had thrown up after their disaster they were so perfectly dismayed that they could not be induced even to go in quest of their traps which they had set in a neighboring stream the two parties now joined their forces and made their way without further misfortune to the rendezvous  captain bonneville perceived from the reports of these parties as well as from what he had observed himself in his recent march that he was in a neighborhood teeming with danger two wandering snake indians also who visited the camp assured him that there were two large bands of crows marching rapidly upon him he broke up his encampment therefore on the 1st of september made his way to the south across the littlehorn mountain until he reached wind river and then turning westward moved slowly up the banks of that stream giving time for his men to trap as he proceeded as it was not in the plan of the present hunting campaigns to go near the caches on green river and as the trappers were in want of traps to replace those they had lost captain bonneville undertook to visit the caches and procure a supply to accompany him in this hazardous expedition which would take him through the defiles of the wind river mountains and up the green river valley he took but three men the main party were to continue on trapping up toward the head of wind river near which he was to rejoin them just about the place where that stream issues from the mountains we

men of the mountains  having forded wind river a little above its mouth captain bonneville and his three companions proceeded across a gravelly plain until they fell upon the popo agie up the left bank of which they held their course nearly in a southerly direction here they came upon numerous droves of buffalo and halted for the purpose of procuring a supply of beef as the hunters were stealing cautiously to get within shot of the game two small white bears suddenly presented themselves in their path and rising upon their hind legs contemplated them for some time with a whimsically solemn gaze the hunters remained motionless whereupon the bears having apparently satisfied their curiosity lowered themselves upon all fours and began to withdraw the hunters now advanced upon which the bears turned rose again upon their haunches and repeated their seriocomic examination this was repeated several times until the hunters piqued at their unmannerly staring rebuked it with a discharge of their rifles the bears made an awkward bound or two as if wounded and then walked off with great gravity seeming to commune together and every now and then turning to take another look at the hunters it was well for the latter that the bears were but half grown and had not yet acquired the ferocity of their kind  the buffalo were somewhat startled at the report of the firearms but the hunters succeeded in killing a couple of fine cows and having secured the best of the meat continued forward until some time after dark when encamping in a large thicket of willows they made a great fire roasted buffalo beef enough for half a score disposed of the whole of it with keen relish and high glee and then turned in for the night and slept soundly like weary and well fed hunters  at daylight they were in the saddle again and skirted along the river passing through fresh grassy meadows and a succession of beautiful groves of willows and cottonwood toward evening captain bonneville observed a smoke at a distance rising from among hills directly in the route he was pursuing apprehensive of some hostile band he concealed the horses in a thicket and accompanied by one of his men crawled cautiously up a height from which he could overlook the scene of danger here with a spyglass he reconnoitred the surrounding country but not a lodge nor fire not a man horse nor dog was to be discovered in short the smoke which had caused such alarm proved to be the vapor from several warm or rather hot springs of considerable magnitude pouring forth streams in every direction over a bottom of white clay one of the springs was about twentyfive yards in diameter and so deep that the water was of a bright green color  they were now advancing diagonally upon the chain of wind river mountains which lay between them and green river valley to coast round their southern points would be a wide circuit whereas could they force their way through them they might proceed in a straight line the mountains were lofty with snowy peaks and cragged sides it was hoped however that some practicable defile might be found they attempted accordingly to penetrate the mountains by following up one of the branches of the popo agie but soon found themselves in the midst of stupendous crags and precipices that barred all progress retracing their steps and falling back upon the river they consulted where to make another attempt they were too close beneath the mountains to scan them generally but they now recollected having noticed from the plain a beautiful slope rising at an angle of about thirty degrees and apparently without any break until it reached the snowy region seeking this gentle acclivity they began to ascend it with alacrity trusting to find at the top one of those elevated plains which prevail among the rocky mountains the slope was covered with coarse gravel interspersed with plates of freestone they attained the summit with some toil but found instead of a level or rather undulating plain that they were on the brink of a deep and precipitous ravine from the bottom of which rose a second slope similar to the one they had just ascended down into this profound ravine they made their way by a rugged path or rather fissure of the rocks and then labored up the second slope they gained the summit only to find themselves on another ravine and now perceived that this vast mountain which had presented such a sloping and even side to the distant beholder on the plain was shagged by frightful precipices and seamed with longitudinal chasms deep and dangerous  in one of these wild dells they passed the night and slept soundly and sweetly after their fatigues two days more of arduous climbing and scrambling only served to admit them into the heart of this mountainous and awful solitude where difficulties increased as they proceeded sometimes they scrambled from rock to rock up the bed of some mountain stream dashing its bright way down to the plains sometimes they availed themselves of the paths made by the deer and the mountain sheep which however often took them to the brinks of fearful precipices or led to rugged defiles impassable for their horses at one place they were obliged to slide their horses down the face of a rock in which attempt some of the poor animals lost their footing rolled to the bottom and came near being dashed to pieces  in the afternoon of the second day the travellers attained one of the elevated valleys locked up in this singular bed of mountains here were two bright and beautiful little lakes set like mirrors in the midst of stern and rocky heights and surrounded by grassy meadows inexpressibly refreshing to the eye these probably were among the sources of those mighty streams which take their rise among these mountains and wander hundreds of miles through the plains  in the green pastures bordering upon these lakes the travellers halted to repose and to give their weary horses time to crop the sweet and tender herbage they had now ascended to a great height above the level of the plains yet they beheld huge crags of granite piled one upon another and beetling like battlements far above them while two of the men remained in the camp with the horses captain bonneville accompanied by the other men man set out to climb a neighboring height hoping to gain a commanding prospect and discern some practicable route through this stupendous labyrinth after much toil he reached the summit of a lofty cliff but it was only to behold gigantic peaks rising all around and towering far into the snowy regions of the atmosphere selecting one which appeared to be the highest he crossed a narrow intervening valley and began to scale it he soon found that he had undertaken a tremendous task but the pride of man is never more obstinate than when climbing mountains the ascent was so steep and rugged that he and his companion were frequently obliged to clamber on hands and knees with their guns slung upon their backs frequently exhausted with fatigue and dripping with perspiration they threw themselves upon the snow and took handfuls of it to allay their parching thirst at one place they even stripped off their coats and hung them upon the bushes and thus lightly clad proceeded to scramble over these eternal snows as they ascended still higher there were cool breezes that refreshed and braced them and springing with new ardor to their task they at length attained the summit  here a scene burst upon the view of captain bonneville that for a time astonished and overwhelmed him with its immensity he stood in fact upon that dividing ridge which indians regard as the crest of the world and on each side of which the landscape may be said to decline to the two cardinal oceans of the globe whichever way he turned his eye it was confounded by the vastness and variety of objects beneath him the rocky mountains seemed to open all their secret recesses deep solemn valleys treasured lakes dreary passes rugged defiles and foaming torrents while beyond their savage precincts the eye was lost in an almost immeasurable landscape stretching on every side into dim and hazy distance like the expanse of a summers sea whichever way he looked he beheld vast plains glimmering with reflected sunshine mighty streams wandering on their shining course toward either ocean and snowy mountains chain beyond chain and peak beyond peak till they melted like clouds into the horizon for a time the indian fable seemed realized he had attained that height from which the blackfoot warrior after death first catches a view of the land of souls and beholds the happy hunting grounds spread out below him brightening with the abodes of the free and generous spirits the captain stood for a long while gazing upon this scene lost in a crowd of vague and indefinite ideas and sensations a longdrawn inspiration at length relieved him from this enthralment of the mind and he began to analyze the parts of this vast panorama a simple enumeration of a few of its features may give some idea of its collective grandeur and magnificence  the peak on which the captain had taken his stand commanded the whole wind river chain which in fact may rather be considered one immense mountain broken into snowy peaks and lateral spurs and seamed with narrow valleys some of these valleys glittered with silver lakes and gushing streams the fountain heads as it were of the mighty tributaries to the atlantic and pacific oceans beyond the snowy peaks to the south and far far below the mountain range the gentle river called the sweet water was seen pursuing its tranquil way through the rugged regions of the black hills in the east the head waters of wind river wandered through a plain until mingling in one powerful current they forced their way through the range of horn mountains and were lost to view to the north were caught glimpses of the upper streams of the yellowstone that great tributary of the missouri in another direction were to be seen some of the sources of the oregon or columbia flowing to the northwest past those towering landmarks the three tetons and pouring down into the great lava plain while almost at the captains feet the green river or colorado of the west set forth on its wandering pilgrimage to the gulf of california at first a mere mountain torrent dashing northward over a crag and precipice in a succession of cascades and tumbling into the plain where expanding into an ample river it circled away to the south and after alternately shining out and disappearing in the mazes of the vast landscape was finally lost in a horizon of mountains the day was calm and cloudless and the atmosphere so pure that objects were discernible at an astonishing distance the whole of this immense area was inclosed by an outer range of shadowy peaks some of them faintly marked on the horizon which seemed to wall it in from the rest of the earth  it is to be regretted that captain bonneville had no instruments with him with which to ascertain the altitude of this peak he gives it as his opinion that it is the loftiest point of the north american continent but of this we have no satisfactory proof it is certain that the rocky mountains are of an altitude vastly superior to what was formerly supposed we rather incline to the opinion that the highest peak is further to the northward and is the same measured by mr thompson surveyor to the northwest company who by the joint means of the barometer and trigonometric measurement ascertained it to be twentyfive thousand feet above the level of the sea an elevation only inferior to that of the himalayas  for a long time captain bonneville remained gazing around him with wonder and enthusiasm at length the chill and wintry winds whirling about the snowclad height admonished him to descend he soon regained the spot where he and his companions companion had thrown off their coats which were now gladly resumed and retracing their course down the peak they safely rejoined their companions on the border of the lake  notwithstanding the savage and almost inaccessible nature of these mountains they have their inhabitants as one of the party was out hunting he came upon the solitary track of a man in a lonely valley following it up he reached the brow of a cliff whence he beheld three savages running across the valley below him he fired his gun to call their attention hoping to induce them to turn back they only fled the faster and disappeared among the rocks the hunter returned and reported what he had seen captain bonneville at once concluded that these belonged to a kind of hermit race scanty in number that inhabit the highest and most inaccessible fastnesses they speak the shoshonie language and probably are offsets from that tribe though they have peculiarities of their own which distinguish them from all other indians they are miserably poor own no horses and are destitute of every convenience to be derived from an intercourse with the whites their weapons are bows and stonepointed arrows with which they hunt the deer the elk and the mountain sheep they are to be found scattered about the countries of the shoshonie flathead crow and blackfeet tribes but their residences are always in lonely places and the clefts of the rocks  their footsteps are often seen by the trappers in the high and solitary valleys among the mountains and the smokes of their fires descried among the precipices but they themselves are rarely met with and still more rarely brought to a parley so great is their shyness and their dread of strangers  as their poverty offers no temptation to the marauder and as they are inoffensive in their habits they are never the objects of warfare should one of them however fall into the hands of a war party he is sure to be made a sacrifice for the sake of that savage trophy a scalp and that barbarous ceremony a scalp dance these forlorn beings forming a mere link between human nature and the brute have been looked down upon with pity and contempt by the creole trappers who have given them the appellation of les dignes de pitie or the objects of pity they appear more worthy to be called the wild men of the mountains     26       a retrogade move channel of a mountain torrentalpine

caches  the view from the snowy peak of the wind river mountains while it had excited captain bonnevilles enthusiasm had satisfied him that it would be useless to force a passage westward through multiplying barriers of cliffs and precipices turning his face eastward therefore he endeavored to regain the plains intending to make the circuit round the southern point of the mountain to descend and to extricate himself from the heart of this rockpiled wilderness was almost as difficult as to penetrate it taking his course down the ravine of a tumbling stream the commencement of some future river he descended from rock to rock and shelf to shelf between stupendous cliffs and beetling crags that sprang up to the sky often he had to cross and recross the rushing torrent as it wound foaming and roaring down its broken channel or was walled by perpendicular precipices and imminent was the hazard of breaking the legs of the horses in the clefts and fissures of slippery rocks the whole scenery of this deep ravine was of alpine wildness and sublimity sometimes the travellers passed beneath cascades which pitched from such lofty heights that the water fell into the stream like heavy rain in other places torrents came tumbling from crag to crag dashing into foam and spray and making tremendous din and uproar  on the second day of their descent the travellers having got beyond the steepest pitch of the mountains came to where the deep and rugged ravine began occasionally to expand into small levels or valleys and the stream to assume for short intervals a more peaceful character here not merely the river itself but every rivulet flowing into it was dammed up by communities of industrious beavers so as to inundate the neighborhood and make continual swamps  during a midday halt in one of these beaver valleys captain bonneville left his companions and strolled down the course of the stream to reconnoitre he had not proceeded far when he came to a beaver pond and caught a glimpse of one of its painstaking inhabitants busily at work upon the dam the curiosity of the captain was aroused to behold the mode of operating of this farfamed architect he moved forward therefore with the utmost caution parting the branches of the water willows without making any noise until having attained a position commanding a view of the whole pond he stretched himself flat on the ground and watched the solitary workman in a little while three others appeared at the head of the dam bringing sticks and bushes with these they proceeded directly to the barrier which captain bonneville perceived was in need of repair having deposited their loads upon the broken part they dived into the water and shortly reappeared at the surface each now brought a quantity of mud with which he would plaster the sticks and bushes just deposited this kind of masonry was continued for some time repeated supplies of wood and mud being brought and treated in the same manner this done the industrious beavers indulged in a little recreation chasing each other about the pond dodging and whisking about on the surface or diving to the bottom and in their frolic often slapping their tails on the water with a loud clacking sound while they were thus amusing themselves another of the fraternity made his appearance and looked gravely on their sports for some time without offering to join in them he then climbed the bank close to where the captain was concealed and rearing himself on his hind quarters in a sitting position put his forepaws against a young pine tree and began to cut the bark with his teeth at times he would tear off a small piece and holding it between his paws and retaining his sedentary position would feed himself with it after the fashion of a monkey the object of the beaver however was evidently to cut down the tree and he was proceeding with his work when he was alarmed by the approach of captain bonnevilles men who feeling anxious at the protracted absence of their leader were coming in search of him at the sound of their voices all the beavers busy as well as idle dived at once beneath the surface and were no more to be seen captain bonneville regretted this interruption he had heard much of the sagacity of the beaver in cutting down trees in which it is said they manage to make them fall into the water and in such a position and direction as may be most favorable for conveyance to the desired point in the present instance the tree was a tall straight pine and as it grew perpendicularly and there was not a breath of air stirring the beaver could have felled it in any direction he pleased if really capable of exercising a discretion in the matter he was evidently engaged in belting the tree and his first incision had been on the side nearest to the water  captain bonneville however discredits on the whole the alleged sagacity of the beaver in this particular and thinks the animal has no other aim than to get the tree down without any of the subtle calculation as to its mode or direction of falling this attribute he thinks has been ascribed to them from the circumstance that most trees growing near watercourses either lean bodily toward the stream or stretch their largest limbs in that direction to benefit by the space the light and the air to be found there the beaver of course attacks those trees which are nearest at hand and on the banks of the stream or pond he makes incisions round them or in technical phrase belts them with his teeth and when they fall they naturally take the direction in which their trunks or branches preponderate  i have often says captain bonneville seen trees measuring eighteen inches in diameter at the places where they had been cut through by the beaver but they lay in all directions and often very inconveniently for the after purposes of the animal in fact so little ingenuity do they at times display in this particular that at one of our camps on snake river a beaver was found with his head wedged into the cut which he had made the tree having fallen upon him and held him prisoner until he died  great choice according to the captain is certainly displayed by the beaver in selecting the wood which is to furnish bark for winter provision the whole beaver household old and young set out upon this business and will often make long journeys before they are suited sometimes they cut down trees of the largest size and then cull the branches the bark of which is most to their taste these they cut into lengths of about three feet convey them to the water and float them to their lodges where they are stored away for winter they are studious of cleanliness and comfort in their lodges and after their repasts will carry out the sticks from which they have eaten the bark and throw them into the current beyond the barrier they are jealous too of their territories and extremely pugnacious never permitting a strange beaver to enter their premises and often fighting with such virulence as almost to tear each other to pieces in the spring which is the breeding season the male leaves the female at home and sets off on a tour of pleasure rambling often to a great distance recreating himself in every clear and quiet expanse of water on his way and climbing the banks occasionally to feast upon the tender sprouts of the young willows as summer advances he gives up his bachelor rambles and bethinking himself of housekeeping duties returns home to his mate and his new progeny and marshals them all for the foraging expedition in quest of winter provisions  after having shown the public spirit of this praiseworthy little animal as a member of a community and his amiable and exemplary conduct as the father of a family we grieve to record the perils with which he is environed and the snares set for him and his painstaking household  practice says captain bonneville has given such a quickness of eye to the experienced trapper in all that relates to his pursuit that he can detect the slightest sign of beaver however wild and although the lodge may be concealed by close thickets and overhanging willows he can generally at a single glance make an accurate guess at the number of its inmates he now goes to work to set his trap planting it upon the shore in some chosen place two or three inches below the surface of the water and secures it by a chain to a pole set deep in the mud a small twig is then stripped of its bark and one end is dipped in the medicine as the trappers term the peculiar bait which they employ this end of the stick rises about four inches above the surface of the water the other end is planted between the jaws of the trap the beaver possessing an acute sense of smell is soon attracted by the odor of the bait as he raises his nose toward it his foot is caught in the trap in his fright he throws a somerset into the deep water the trap being fastened to the pole resists all his efforts to drag it to the shore the chain by which it is fastened defies his teeth he struggles for a time and at length sinks to the bottom and is drowned  upon rocky bottoms where it is not possible to plant the pole it is thrown into the stream the beaver when entrapped often gets fastened by the chain to sunken logs or floating timber if he gets to shore he is entangled in the thickets of brook willows in such cases however it costs the trapper diligent search and sometimes a bout at swimming before he finds his game  occasionally it happens that several members of a beaver family are trapped in succession the survivors then become extremely shy and can scarcely be brought to medicine to use the trappers phrase for taking the bait in such case the trapper gives up the use of the bait and conceals his traps in the usual paths and crossing places of the household the beaver now being completely up to trap approaches them cautiously and springs them ingeniously with a stick at other times he turns the traps bottom upwards by the same means and occasionally even drags them to the barrier and conceals them in the mud the trapper now gives up the contest of ingenuity and shouldering his traps marches off admitting that he is not yet up to beaver  on the day following captain bonnevilles supervision of the industrious and frolicsome community of beavers of which he has given so edifying an account he succeeded in extricating himself from the wind river mountains and regaining the plain to the eastward made a great bend to the south so as to go round the bases of the mountains and arrived without further incident of importance at the old place of rendezvous in green river valley on the 17th of september  he found the caches in which he had deposited his superfluous goods and equipments all safe and having opened and taken from them the necessary supplies he closed them again taking care to obliterate all traces that might betray them to the keen eyes of indian marauders     27

adventures among the crows      orthodox crows  on the 18th of september captain bonneville and his three companions set out bright and early to rejoin the main party from which they had parted on wind river their route lay up the green river valley with that stream on their right hand and beyond it the range of wind river mountains at the head of the valley they were to pass through a defile which would bring them out beyond the northern end of these mountains to the head of wind river where they expected to meet the main party according to arrangement  we have already adverted to the dangerous nature of this neighborhood infested by roving bands of crows and blackfeet to whom the numerous defiles and passes of the country afford capital places for ambush and surprise the travellers therefore kept a vigilant eye upon everything that might give intimation of lurking danger  about two hours after midday as they reached the summit of a hill they discovered buffalo on the plain below running in every direction one of the men too fancied he heard the report of a gun it was concluded therefore that there was some party of indians below hunting the buffalo  the horses were immediately concealed in a narrow ravine and the captain mounting an eminence but concealing himself from view reconnoitred the whole neighborhood with a telescope not an indian was to be seen so after halting about an hour he resumed his journey convinced however that he was in a dangerous neighborhood he advanced with the utmost caution winding his way through hollows and ravines and avoiding as much as possible any open tract or rising ground that might betray his little party to the watchful eye of an indian scout  arriving at length at the edge of the open meadowland bordering on the river he again observed the buffalo as far as he could see scampering in great alarm once more concealing the horses he and his companions remained for a long time watching the various groups of the animals as each caught the panic and started off but they sought in vain to discover the cause  they were now about to enter the mountain defile at the head of green river valley where they might be waylaid and attacked they therefore arranged the packs on their horses in the manner most secure and convenient for sudden flight should such be necessary this done they again set forward keeping the most anxious lookout in every direction  it was now drawing toward evening but they could not think of encamping for the night in a place so full of danger captain bonneville therefore determined to halt about sunset kindle a fire as if for encampment cook and eat supper but as soon as it was sufficiently dark to make a rapid move for the summit of the mountain and seek some secluded spot for their nights lodgings  accordingly as the sun went down the little party came to a halt made a large fire spitted their buffalo meat on wooden sticks and when sufficiently roasted planted the savory viands before them cutting off huge slices with their hunting knives and supping with a hunters appetite the light of their fire would not fail as they knew to attract the attention of any indian horde in the neighborhood but they trusted to be off and away before any prowlers could reach the place while they were supping thus hastily however one of their party suddenly started up and shouted indians all were instantly on their feet with their rifles in their hands but could see no enemy the man however declared that he had seen an indian advancing cautiously along the trail which they had made in coming to the encampment who the moment he was perceived had thrown himself on the ground and disappeared he urged captain bonneville instantly to decamp the captain however took the matter more coolly the single fact that the indian had endeavored to hide himself convinced him that he was not one of a party on the advance to make an attack he was probably some scout who had followed up their trail until he came in sight of their fire he would in such case return and report what he had seen to his companions these supposing the white men had encamped for the night would keep aloof until very late when all should be asleep they would then according to indian tactics make their stealthy approaches and place themselves in ambush around preparatory to their attack at the usual hour of daylight  such was captain bonnevilles conclusion in consequence of which he counselled his men to keep perfectly quiet and act as if free from all alarm until the proper time arrived for a move they accordingly continued their repast with pretended appetite and jollity and then trimmed and replenished their fire as if for a bivouac as soon however as the night had completely set in they left their fire blazing walked quietly among the willows and then leaping into their saddles made off as noiselessly as possible in proportion as they left the point of danger behind them they relaxed in their rigid and anxious taciturnity and began to joke at the expense of their enemy whom they pictured to themselves mousing in the neighborhood of their deserted fire waiting for the proper time of attack and preparing for a grand disappointment  about midnight feeling satisfied that they had gained a secure distance they posted one of their number to keep watch in case the enemy should follow on their trail and then turning abruptly into a dense and matted thicket of willows halted for the night at the foot of the mountain instead of making for the summit as they had originally intended  a trapper in the wilderness like a sailor on the ocean snatches morsels of enjoyment in the midst of trouble and sleeps soundly when surrounded by danger the little party now made their arrangements for sleep with perfect calmness they did not venture to make a fire and cook it is true though generally done by hunters whenever they come to a halt and have provisions they comforted themselves however by smoking a tranquil pipe and then calling in the watch and turning loose the horses stretched themselves on their pallets agreed that whoever should first awake should rouse the rest and in a little while were all as sound asleep as though in the midst of a fortress  a little before day they were all on the alert it was the hour for indian maraud a sentinel was immediately detached to post himself at a little distance on their trail and give the alarm should he see or hear an enemy  with the first blink of dawn the rest sought the horses brought them to the camp and tied them up until an hour after sunrise when the sentinel having reported that all was well they sprang once more into their saddles and pursued the most covert and secret paths up the mountain avoiding the direct route  at noon they halted and made a hasty repast and then bent their course so as to regain the route from which they had diverged they were now made sensible of the danger from which they had just escaped there were tracks of indians who had evidently been in pursuit of them but had recently returned baffled in their search  trusting that they had now got a fair start and could not be overtaken before night even in case the indians should renew the chase they pushed briskly forward and did not encamp until late when they cautiously concealed themselves in a secure nook of the mountains  without any further alarm they made their way to the head waters of wind river and reached the neighborhood in which they had appointed the rendezvous with their companions it was within the precincts of the crow country the wind river valley being one of the favorite haunts of that restless tribe after much searching captain bonneville came upon a trail which had evidently been made by his main party it was so old however that he feared his people might have left the neighborhood driven off perhaps by some of those war parties which were on the prowl he continued his search with great anxiety and no little fatigue for his horses were jaded and almost crippled by their forced marches and scramblings through rocky defiles  on the following day about noon captain bonneville came upon a deserted camp of his people from which they had evidently turned back but he could find no signs to indicate why they had done so whether they had met with misfortune or molestation or in what direction they had gone he was now more than ever perplexed  on the following day he resumed his march with increasing anxiety the feet of his horses had by this time become so worn and wounded by the rocks that he had to make moccasons for them of buffalo hide about noon he came to another deserted camp of his men but soon after lost their trail after great search he once more found it turning in a southerly direction along the eastern bases of the wind river mountains which towered to the right he now pushed forward with all possible speed in hopes of overtaking the party at night he slept at another of their camps from which they had but recently departed when the day dawned sufficiently to distinguish objects he perceived the danger that must be dogging the heels of his main party all about the camp were traces of indians who must have been prowling about it at the time his people had passed the night there and who must still be hovering about them convinced now that the main party could not be at any great distance he mounted a scout on the best horse and sent him forward to overtake them to warn them of their danger and to order them to halt until he should rejoin them  in the afternoon to his great joy he met the scout returning with six comrades from the main party leading fresh horses for his accommodation and on the following day september 25th all hands were once more reunited after a separation of nearly three weeks their meeting was hearty and joyous for they had both experienced dangers and perplexities  the main party in pursuing their course up the wind river valley had been dogged the whole way by a war party of crows in one place they had been fired upon but without injury in another place one of their horses had been cut loose and carried off at length they were so closely beset that they were obliged to make a retrogade move lest they should be surprised and overcome this was the movement which had caused such perplexity to captain bonneville  the whole party now remained encamped for two or three days to give repose to both men and horses some of the trappers however pursued their vocations about the neighboring streams while one of them was setting his traps he heard the tramp of horses and looking up beheld a party of crow braves moving along at no great distance with a considerable cavalcade the trapper hastened to conceal himself but was discerned by the quick eye of the savages with whoops and yells they dragged him from his hidingplace flourished over his head their tomahawks and scalpingknives and for a time the poor trapper gave himself up for lost fortunately the crows were in a jocose rather than a sanguinary mood they amused themselves heartily for a while at the expense of his terrors and after having played off divers crow pranks and pleasantries suffered him to depart unharmed it is true they stripped him completely one taking his horse another his gun a third his traps a fourth his blanket and so on through all his accoutrements and even his clothing until he was stark naked but then they generously made him a present of an old tattered buffalo robe and dismissed him with many complimentary speeches and much laughter when the trapper returned to the camp in such sorry plight he was greeted with peals of laughter from his comrades and seemed more mortified by the style in which he had been dismissed than rejoiced at escaping with his life a circumstance which he related to captain bonneville gave some insight into the cause of this extreme jocularity on the part of the crows they had evidently had a run of luck and like winning gamblers were in high good humor among twentysix fine horses and some mules which composed their cavalcade the trapper recognized a number which had belonged to fitzpatricks brigade when they parted company on the bighorn it was supposed therefore that these vagabonds had been on his trail and robbed him of part of his cavalry  on the day following this affair three crows came into captain bonnevilles camp with the most easy innocent if not impudent air imaginable walking about with the imperturbable coolness and unconcern in which the indian rivals the fine gentleman as they had not been of the set which stripped the trapper though evidently of the same band they were not molested indeed captain bonneville treated them with his usual kindness and hospitality permitting them to remain all day in the camp and even to pass the night there at the same time however he caused a strict watch to be maintained on all their movements and at night stationed an armed sentinel near them the crows remonstrated against the latter being armed this only made the captain suspect them to be spies who meditated treachery he redoubled therefore his precautions at the same time he assured his guests that while they were perfectly welcome to the shelter and comfort of his camp yet should any of their tribe venture to approach during the night they would certainly be shot which would be a very unfortunate circumstance and much to be deplored to the latter remark they fully assented and shortly afterward commenced a wild song or chant which they kept up for a long time and in which they very probably gave their friends who might be prowling round the camp notice that the white men were on the alert the night passed away without disturbance in the morning the three crow guests were very pressing that captain bonneville and his party should accompany them to their camp which they said was close by instead of accepting their invitation captain bonneville took his departure with all possible dispatch eager to be out of the vicinity of such a piratical horde nor did he relax the diligence of his march until on the second day he reached the banks of the sweet water beyond the limits of the crow country and a heavy fall of snow had obliterated all traces of his course  he now continued on for some few days at a slower pace round the point of the mountain toward green river and arrived once more at the caches on the 14th of october  here they found traces of the band of indians who had hunted them in the defile toward the head waters of wind river having lost all trace of them on their way over the mountains they had turned and followed back their trail down the green river valley to the caches one of these they had discovered and broken open but it fortunately contained nothing but fragments of old iron which they had scattered about in all directions and then departed in examining their deserted camp captain bonneville discovered that it numbered thirtynine fires and had more reason than ever to congratulate himself on having escaped the clutches of such a formidable band of freebooters  he now turned his course southward under cover of the mountains and on the 25th of october reached liberges ford a tributary of the colorado where he came suddenly upon the trail of this same war party which had crossed the stream so recently that the banks were yet wet with the water that had been splashed upon them to judge from their tracks they could not be less than three hundred warriors and apparently of the crow nation  captain bonneville was extremely uneasy lest this overpowering force should come upon him in some place where he would not have the means of fortifying himself promptly he now moved toward hanes fork another tributary of the colorado where he encamped and remained during the 26th of october seeing a large cloud of smoke to the south he supposed it to arise from some encampment of shoshonies and sent scouts to procure information and to purchase a lodge it was in fact a band of shoshonies but with them were encamped fitzpatrick and his party of trappers that active leader had an eventful story to relate of his fortunes in the country of the crows after parting with captain bonneville on the banks of the bighorn he made for the west to trap upon powder and tongue rivers he had between twenty and thirty men with him and about one hundred horses so large a cavalcade could not pass through the crow country without attracting the attention of its freebooting hordes a large band of crows was soon on their traces and came up with them on the 5th of september just as they had reached tongue river the crow chief came forward with great appearance of friendship and proposed to fitzpatrick that they should encamp together the latter however not having any faith in crows declined the invitation and pitched his camp three miles off he then rode over with two or three men to visit the crow chief by whom he was received with great apparent cordiality in the meantime however a party of young braves who considered them absolved by his distrust from all scruples of honor made a circuit privately and dashed into his encampment captain stewart who had remained there in the absence of fitzpatrick behaved with great spirit but the crows were too numerous and active they had got possession of the camp and soon made booty of every thingcarrying off all the horses on their way back they met fitzpatrick returning to his camp and finished their exploit by rifling and nearly stripping him  a negotiation now took place between the plundered white men and the triumphant crows what eloquence and management fitzpatrick made use of we do not know but he succeeded in prevailing upon the crow chieftain to return him his horses and many of his traps together with his rifles and a few rounds of ammunition for each man he then set out with all speed to abandon the crow country before he should meet with any fresh disasters  after his departure the consciences of some of the most orthodox crows pricked them sorely for having suffered such a cavalcade to escape out of their hands anxious to wipe off so foul a stigma on the reputation of the crow nation they followed on his trial nor quit hovering about him on his march until they had stolen a number of his best horses and mules it was doubtless this same band which came upon the lonely trapper on the popo agie and generously gave him an old buffalo robe in exchange for his rifle his traps and all his accoutrements with these anecdotes we shall for present take our leave of the crow country and its vagabond

horseshoe one of the principal head waters of this river although supposed to abound with beaver has never been visited by the trapper rising among rugged mountains and being barricadoed sic by fallen pine trees and tremendous precipices  proceeding down this river the party encamped on the 6th of november at the outlet of a lake about thirty miles long and from two to three miles in width completely imbedded in low ranges of mountains and connected with bear river by an impassable swamp it is called the little lake to distinguish it from the great one of salt water  on the 10th of november captain bonneville visited a place in the neighborhood which is quite a region of natural curiosities an area of about half a mile square presents a level surface of white clay or fullers earth perfectly spotless resembling a great slab of parian marble or a sheet of dazzling snow the effect is strikingly beautiful at all times in summer when it is surrounded with verdure or in autumn when it contrasts its bright immaculate surface with the withered herbage seen from a distant eminence it then shines like a mirror set in the brown landscape around this plain are clustered numerous springs of various sizes and temperatures one of them of scalding heat boils furiously and incessantly rising to the height of two or three feet in another place there is an aperture in the earth from which rushes a column of steam that forms a perpetual cloud the ground for some distance around sounds hollow and startles the solitary trapper as he hears the tramp of his horse giving the sound of a muffled drum he pictures to himself a mysterious gulf below a place of hidden fires and gazes round him with awe and uneasiness  the most noted curiosity however of this singular region is the beer spring of which trappers give wonderful accounts they are said to turn aside from their route through the country to drink of its waters with as much eagerness as the arab seeks some famous well of the desert captain bonneville describes it as having the taste of beer his men drank it with avidity and in copious draughts it did not appear to him to possess any medicinal properties or to produce any peculiar effects the indians however refuse to taste it and endeavor to persuade the white men from doing so  we have heard this also called the soda spring and described as containing iron and sulphur it probably possesses some of the properties of the ballston water  the time had now arrived for captain bonneville to go in quest of the party of free trappers detached in the beginning of july under the command of mr hodgkiss to trap upon the head waters of salmon river his intention was to unite them with the party with which he was at present travelling that all might go into quarters together for the winter accordingly on the 11th of november he took a temporary leave of his band appointing a rendezvous on snake river and accompanied by three men set out upon his journey his route lay across the plain of the portneuf a tributary stream of snake river called after an unfortunate canadian trapper murdered by the indians the whole country through which he passed bore evidence of volcanic convulsions and conflagrations in the olden time great masses of lava lay scattered about in every direction the crags and cliffs had apparently been under the action of fire the rocks in some places seemed to have been in a state of fusion the plain was rent and split with deep chasms and gullies some of which were partly filled with lava  they had not proceeded far however before they saw a party of horsemen galloping full tilt toward them they instantly turned and made full speed for the covert of a woody stream to fortify themselves among the trees the indians came to a halt and one of them came forward alone he reached captain bonneville and his men just as they were dismounting and about to post themselves a few words dispelled all uneasiness it was a party of twentyfive bannack indians friendly to the whites and they proposed through their envoy that both parties should encamp together and hunt the buffalo of which they had discovered several large herds hard by captain bonneville cheerfully assented to their proposition being curious to see their manner of hunting  both parties accordingly encamped together on a convenient spot and prepared for the hunt the indians first posted a boy on a small hill near the camp to keep a lookout for enemies the runners then as they are called mounted on fleet horses and armed with bows and arrows moved slowly and cautiously toward the buffalo keeping as much as possible out of sight in hollows and ravines when within a proper distance a signal was given and they all opened at once like a pack of hounds with a full chorus of yells dashing into the midst of the herds and launching their arrows to the right and left the plain seemed absolutely to shake under the tramp of the buffalo as they scoured off the cows in headlong panic the bulls furious with rage uttering deep roars and occasionally turning with a desperate rush upon their pursuers nothing could surpass the spirit grace and dexterity with which the indians managed their horses wheeling and coursing among the affrighted herd and launching their arrows with unerring aim in the midst of the apparent confusion they selected their victims with perfect judgment generally aiming at the fattest of the cows the flesh of the bull being nearly worthless at this season of the year in a few minutes each of the hunters had crippled three or four cows a single shot was sufficient for the purpose and the animal once maimed was left to be completely dispatched at the end of the chase frequently a cow was killed on the spot by a single arrow in one instance captain bonneville saw an indian shoot his arrow completely through the body of a cow so that it struck in the ground beyond the bulls however are not so easily killed as the cows and always cost the hunter several arrows sometimes making battle upon the horses and chasing them furiously though severely wounded with the darts still sticking in their flesh  the grand scamper of the hunt being over the indians proceeded to dispatch the animals that had been disabled then cutting up the carcasses they returned with loads of meat to the camp where the choicest pieces were soon roasting before large fires and a hunters feast succeeded at which captain bonneville and his men were qualified by previous fasting to perform their parts with great vigor  some men are said to wax valorous upon a full stomach and such seemed to be the case with the bannack braves who in proportion as they crammed themselves with buffalo meat grew stout of heart until the supper at an end they began to chant war songs setting forth their mighty deeds and the victories they had gained over the blackfeet warming with the theme and inflating themselves with their own eulogies these magnanimous heroes of the trencher would start up advance a short distance beyond the light of the fire and apostrophize most vehemently their blackfeet enemies as though they had been within hearing ruffling and swelling and snorting and slapping their breasts and brandishing their arms they would vociferate all their exploits reminding the blackfeet how they had drenched their towns in tears and blood enumerate the blows they had inflicted the warriors they had slain the scalps they had brought off in triumph then having said everything that could stir a mans spleen or pique his valor they would dare their imaginary hearers now that the bannacks were few in number to come and take their revengereceiving no reply to this valorous bravado they would conclude by all kinds of sneers and insults deriding the blackfeet for dastards and poltroons that dared not accept their challenge such is the kind of swaggering and rhodomontade in which the red men are prone to indulge in their vainglorious moments for with all their vaunted taciturnity they are vehemently prone at times to become eloquent about their exploits and to sound their own trumpet  having vented their valor in this fierce effervescence the bannack braves gradually calmed down lowered their crests smoothed their ruffled feathers and betook themselves to sleep without placing a single guard over their camp so that had the blackfeet taken them at their word but few of these braggart heroes might have survived for any further boasting  on the following morning captain bonneville purchased a supply of buffalo meat from his braggadocio friends who with all their vaporing were in fact a very forlorn horde destitute of firearms and of almost everything that constitutes riches in savage life the bargain concluded the bannacks set off for their village which was situated they said at the mouth of the portneuf and captain bonneville and his companions shaped their course toward snake river  arrived on the banks of that river he found it rapid and boisterous but not too deep to be forded in traversing it however one of the horses was swept suddenly from his footing and his rider was flung from the saddle into the midst of the stream both horse and horseman were extricated without any damage excepting that the latter was completely drenched so that it was necessary to kindle a fire to dry him while they were thus occupied one of the party looking up perceived an indian scout cautiously reconnoitring them from the summit of a neighboring hill the moment he found himself discovered he disappeared behind the hill from his furtive movements captain bonneville suspected him to be a scout from the blackfeet camp and that he had gone to report what he had seen to his companions it would not do to loiter in such a neighborhood so the kindling of the fire was abandoned the drenched horseman mounted in dripping condition and the little band pushed forward directly into the plain going at a smart pace until they had gained a considerable distance from the place of supposed danger here encamping for the night in the midst of abundance of sage or wormwood which afforded fodder for their horses they kindled a huge fire for the benefit of their damp comrade and then proceeded to prepare a sumptuous supper of buffalo humps and ribs and other choice bits which they had brought with them after a hearty repast relished with an appetite unknown to city epicures they stretched themselves upon their couches of skins and under the starry canopy of heaven enjoyed the sound and sweet sleep of hardy and wellfed mountaineers  they continued on their journey for several days without any incident worthy of notice and on the 19th of november came upon traces of the party of which they were in search such as burned patches of prairie and deserted camping grounds all these were carefully examined to discover by their freshness or antiquity the probable time that the trappers had left them at length after much wandering and investigating they came upon the regular trail of the hunting party which led into the mountains and following it up briskly came about two oclock in the afternoon of the 20th upon the encampment of hodgkiss and his band of free trappers in the bosom of a mountain valley  it will be recollected that these free trappers who were masters of themselves and their movements had refused to accompany captain bonneville back to green river in the preceding month of july preferring to trap about the upper waters of the salmon river where they expected to find plenty of beaver and a less dangerous neighborhood their hunt had not been very successful they had penetrated the great range of mountains among which some of the upper branches of salmon river take their rise but had become so entangled among immense and almost impassable barricades of fallen pines and so impeded by tremendous precipices that a great part of their season had been wasted among these mountains at one time they had made their way through them and reached the boisee river but meeting with a band of bannack indians from whom they apprehended hostilities they had again taken shelter among the mountains where they were found by captain bonneville in the neighborhood of their encampment the captain had the good fortune to meet with a family of those wanderers of the mountains emphatically called les dignes de pitie or poordevil indians these however appear to have forfeited the title for they had with them a fine lot of skins of beaver elk deer and mountain sheep these captain bonneville purchased from them at a fair valuation and sent them off astonished at their own wealth and no doubt objects of envy to all their pitiful tribe  being now reinforced by hodgkiss and his band of free trappers captain bonneville put himself at the head of the united parties and set out to rejoin those he had recently left at the beer spring that they might all go into winter quarters on snake river on his route he encountered many heavy falls of snow which melted almost immediately so as not to impede his march and on the 4th of december he found his other party encamped at the very place where he had partaken in the buffalo hunt with the bannacks  that braggart horde was encamped but about three miles off and were just then in high glee and festivity and more swaggering than ever celebrating a prodigious victory it appeared that a party of their braves being out on a hunting excursion discovered a band of blackfeet moving as they thought to surprise their hunting camp the bannacks immediately posted themselves on each side of a dark ravine through which the enemy must pass and just as they were entangled in the midst of it attacked them with great fury the blackfeet struck with sudden panic threw off their buffalo robes and fled leaving one of their warriors dead on the spot the victors eagerly gathered up the spoils but their greatest prize was the scalp of the blackfoot brave this they bore off in triumph to their village where it had ever since been an object of the greatest exultation and rejoicing it had been elevated upon a pole in the centre of the village where the warriors had celebrated the scalp dance round it with war feasts war songs and warlike harangues it had then been given up to the women and boys who had paraded it up and down the village with shouts and chants and antic dances occasionally saluting it with all kinds of taunts invectives and revilings  the blackfeet in this affair do not appear to have acted up to the character which has rendered them objects of such terror indeed their conduct in war to the inexperienced observer is full of inconsistencies at one time they are headlong in courage and heedless of danger at another time cautious almost to cowardice to understand these apparent incongruities one must know their principles of warfare a war party however triumphant if they lose a warrior in the fight bring back a cause of mourning to their people which casts a shade over the glory of their achievement hence the indian is often less fierce and reckless in general battle than he is in a private brawl and the chiefs are checked in their boldest undertakings by the fear of sacrificing their warriors  this peculiarity is not confined to the blackfeet among the osages says captain bonneville when a warrior falls in battle his comrades though they may have fought with consummate valor and won a glorious victory will leave their arms upon the field of battle and returning home with dejected countenances will halt without the encampment and wait until the relatives of the slain come forth and invite them to mingle again with their people     29       winter camp at the

near the portneuf captain bonneville had drawn off to some little distance from his bannack friends to avoid all annoyance from their intimacy or intrusions in so doing however he had been obliged to take up his quarters on the extreme edge of the flat land where he was encompassed with ice and snow and had nothing better for his horses to subsist on than wormwood the bannacks on the contrary were encamped among fine springs of water where there was grass in abundance some of these springs gush out of the earth in sufficient quantity to turn a mill and furnish beautiful streams clear as crystal and full of trout of a large size which may be seen darting about the transparent water  winter now set in regularly the snow had fallen frequently and in large quantities and covered the ground to a depth of a foot and the continued coldness of the weather prevented any thaw  by degrees a distrust which at first subsisted between the indians and the trappers subsided and gave way to mutual confidence and good will a few presents convinced the chiefs that the white men were their friends nor were the white men wanting in proofs of the honesty and good faith of their savage neighbors occasionally the deep snow and the want of fodder obliged them to turn their weakest horses out to roam in quest of sustenance if they at any time strayed to the camp of the bannacks they were immediately brought back it must be confessed however that if the stray horse happened by any chance to be in vigorous plight and good condition though he was equally sure to be returned by the honest bannacks yet it was always after the lapse of several days and in a very gaunt and jaded state and always with the remark that they had found him a long way off the uncharitable were apt to surmise that he had in the interim been well used up in a buffalo hunt but those accustomed to indian morality in the matter of horseflesh considered it a singular evidence of honesty that he should be brought back at all  being convinced therefore from these and other circumstances that his people were encamped in the neighborhood of a tribe as honest as they were valiant and satisfied that they would pass their winter unmolested captain bonneville prepared for a reconnoitring expedition of great extent and peril this was to penetrate to the hudsons bay establishments on the banks of the columbia and to make himself acquainted with the country and the indian tribes it being one part of his scheme to establish a trading post somewhere on the lower part of the river so as to participate in the trade lost to the united states by the capture of astoria this expedition would of course take him through the snake river country and across the blue mountains the scenes of so much hardship and disaster to hunt and crooks and their astorian bands who first explored it and he would have to pass through it in the same frightful season the depth of winter  the idea of risk and hardship however only served to stimulate the adventurous spirit of the captain he chose three companions for his journey put up a small stock of necessaries in the most portable form and selected five horses and mules for themselves and their baggage he proposed to rejoin his band in the early part of march at the winter encampment near the portneuf all these arrangements being completed he mounted his horse on christmas morning and set off with his three comrades they halted a little beyond the bannack camp and made their christmas dinner which if not a very merry was a very hearty one after which they resumed their journey  they were obliged to travel slowly to spare their horses for the snow had increased in depth to eighteen inches and though somewhat packed and frozen was not sufficiently so to yield firm footing their route lay to the west down along the left side of snake river and they were several days in reaching the first or american falls the banks of the river for a considerable distance both above and below the falls have a volcanic character masses of basaltic rock are piled one upon another the water makes its way through their broken chasms boiling through narrow channels or pitching in beautiful cascades over ridges of basaltic columns  beyond these falls they came to a picturesque but inconsiderable stream called the cassie it runs through a level valley about four miles wide where the soil is good but the prevalent coldness and dryness of the climate is unfavorable to vegetation near to this stream there is a small mountain of mica slate including garnets granite in small blocks is likewise seen in this neighborhood and white sandstone from this river the travellers had a prospect of the snowy heights of the salmon river mountains to the north the nearest at least fifty miles distant  in pursuing his course westward captain bonneville generally kept several miles from snake river crossing the heads of its tributary streams though he often found the open country so encumbered by volcanic rocks as to render travelling extremely difficult whenever he approached snake river he found it running through a broad chasm with steep perpendicular sides of basaltic rock after several days travel across a level plain he came to a part of the river which filled him with astonishment and admiration as far as the eye could reach the river was walled in by perpendicular cliffs two hundred and fifty feet high beetling like dark and gloomy battlements while blocks and fragments lay in masses at their feet in the midst of the boiling and whirling current just above the whole stream pitched in one cascade above forty feet in height with a thundering sound casting up a volume of spray that hung in the air like a silver mist these are called by some the fishing falls as the salmon are taken here in immense quantities they cannot get by these falls  after encamping at this place all night captain bonneville at sunrise descended with his party through a narrow ravine or rather crevice in the vast wall of basaltic rock which bordered the river this being the only mode for many miles of getting to the margin of the stream  the snow lay in a thin crust along the banks of the river so that their travelling was much more easy than it had been hitherto there were foot tracks also made by the natives which greatly facilitated their progress occasionally they met the inhabitants of this wild region a timid race and but scantily provided with the necessaries of life their dress consisted of a mantle about four feet square formed of strips of rabbit skins sewed together this they hung over their shoulders in the ordinary indian mode of wearing the blanket their weapons were bows and arrows the latter tipped with obsidian which abounds in the neighborhood their huts were shaped like haystacks and constructed of branches of willow covered with long grass so as to be warm and comfortable occasionally they were surrounded by small inclosures of wormwood about three feet high which gave them a cottagelike appearance three or four of these tenements were occasionally grouped together in some wild and striking situation and had a picturesque effect sometimes they were in sufficient number to form a small hamlet from these people captain bonnevilles party frequently purchased salmon dried in an admirable manner as were likewise the roes this seemed to be their prime article of food but they were extremely anxious to get buffalo meat in exchange  the high walls and rocks within which the travellers had been so long inclosed now occasionally presented openings through which they were enabled to ascend to the plain and to cut off considerable bends of the river  throughout the whole extent of this vast and singular chasm the scenery of the river is said to be of the most wild and romantic character the rocks present every variety of masses and grouping numerous small streams come rushing and boiling through narrow clefts and ravines one of a considerable size issued from the face of a precipice within twentyfive feet of its summit and after running in nearly a horizontal line for about one hundred feet fell by numerous small cascades to the rocky bank of the river  in its career through this vast and singular defile snake river is upward of three hundred yards wide and as clear as spring water sometimes it steals along with a tranquil and noiseless course at other times for miles and miles it dashes on in a thousand rapids wild and beautiful to the eye and lulling the ear with the soft tumult of plashing waters  many of the tributary streams of snake river rival it in the wildness and picturesqueness of their scenery that called the bruneau is particularly cited it runs through a tremendous chasm rather than a valley extending upwards of a hundred and fifty miles you come upon it on a sudden in traversing a level plain it seems as if you could throw a stone across from cliff to cliff yet the valley is near two thousand feet deep so that the river looks like an inconsiderable stream basaltic rocks rise perpendicularly so that it is impossible to get from the plain to the water or from the river margin to the plain the current is bright and limpid hot springs are found on the borders of this river one bursts out of the cliffs forty feet above the river in a stream sufficient to turn a mill and sends up a cloud of vapor  we find a characteristic picture of this volcanic region of mountains and streams furnished by the journal of mr wyeth which lies before us who ascended a peak in the neighborhood we are describing from this summit the country he says appears an indescribable chaos the tops of the hills exhibit the same strata as far as the eye can reach and appear to have once formed the level of the country and the valleys to be formed by the sinking of the earth rather than the rising of the hills through the deep cracks and chasms thus formed the rivers and brooks make their way which renders it difficult to follow them all these basaltic channels are called cut rocks by the trappers many of the mountain streams disappear in the plains either absorbed by their thirsty soil and by the porous surface of the lava or swallowed up in gulfs and chasms  on the 12th of january 1834 captain bonneville reached powder river much the largest stream that he had seen since leaving the portneuf he struck it about three miles above its entrance into snake river here he found himself above the lower narrows and defiles of the latter river and in an open and level country the natives now made their appearance in considerable numbers and evinced the most insatiable curiosity respecting the white men sitting in groups for hours together exposed to the bleakest winds merely for the pleasure of gazing upon the strangers and watching every movement these are of that branch of the great snake tribe called shoshokoes or root diggers from their subsisting in a great measure on the roots of the earth though they likewise take fish in great quantities and hunt in a small way they are in general very poor destitute of most of the comforts of life and extremely indolent but a mild inoffensive race they differ in many respects from the other branch of the snake tribe the shoshonies who possess horses are more roving and adventurous and hunt the buffalo  on the following day as captain bonneville approached the mouth of powder river he discovered at least a hundred families of these diggers as they are familiarly called assembled in one place the women and children kept at a distance perched among the rocks and cliffs their eager curiosity being somewhat dashed with fear from their elevated posts they scrutinized the strangers with the most intense earnestness regarding them with almost as much awe as if they had been beings of a supernatural order  the men however were by no means so shy and reserved but importuned captain bonneville and his companions excessively by their curiosity nothing escaped their notice and any thing they could lay their hands on underwent the most minute examination to get rid of such inquisitive neighbors the travellers kept on for a considerable distance before they encamped for the night  the country hereabout was generally level and sandy producing very little grass but a considerable quantity of sage or wormwood the plains were diversified by isolated hills all cut off as it were about the same height so as to have tabular summits in this they resembled the isolated hills of the great prairies east of the rocky mountains especially those found on the plains of the arkansas  the high precipices which had hitherto walled in the channel of snake river had now disappeared and the banks were of the ordinary height it should be observed that the great valleys or plains through which the snake river wound its course were generally of great breadth extending on each side from thirty to forty miles where the view was bounded by unbroken ridges of mountains  the travellers found but little snow in the neighborhood of powder river though the weather continued intensely cold they learned a lesson however from their forlorn friends the root diggers which they subsequently found of great service in their wintry wanderings they frequently observed them to be furnished with long ropes twisted from the bark of the wormwood this they used as a slow match carrying it always lighted whenever they wished to warm themselves they would gather together a little dry wormwood apply the match and in an instant produce a cheering blaze  captain bonneville gives a cheerless account of a village of these diggers which he saw in crossing the plain below powder river they live says he without any further protection from the inclemency of the season than a sort of breakweather about three feet high composed of sage or wormwood and erected around them in the shape of a half moon whenever he met with them however they had always a large suite of halfstarved dogs for these animals in savage as well as in civilized life seem to be the concomitants of beggary  these dogs it must be allowed were of more use than the beggary curs of cities the indian children used them in hunting the small game of the neighborhood such as rabbits and prairie dogs in which mongrel kind of chase they acquitted themselves with some credit  sometimes the diggers aspire to nobler game and succeed in entrapping the antelope the fleetest animal of the prairies the process by which this is effected is somewhat singular when the snow has disappeared says captain bonneville and the ground become soft the women go into the thickest fields of wormwood and pulling it up in great quantities construct with it a hedge about three feet high inclosing about a hundred acres a single opening is left for the admission of the game this done the women conceal themselves behind the wormwood and wait patiently for the coming of the antelopes which sometimes enter this spacious trap in considerable numbers as soon as they are in the women give the signal and the men hasten to play their part but one of them enters the pen at a time and after chasing the terrified animals round the inclosure is relieved by one of his companions in this way the hunters take their turns relieving each other and keeping up a continued pursuit by relays without fatigue to themselves the poor antelopes in the end are so wearied down that the whole party of men enter and dispatch them with clubs not one escaping that has entered the inclosure the most curious circumstance in this chase is that an animal so fleet and agile as the antelope and straining for its life should range round and round this fated inclosure without attempting to overleap the low barrier which surrounds it such however is said to be the fact and such their only mode of hunting the antelope  notwithstanding the absence of all comfort and convenience in their habitations and the general squalidness of their appearance the shoshokoes do not appear to be destitute of ingenuity they manufacture good ropes and even a tolerably fine thread from a sort of weed found in their neighborhood and construct bowls and jugs out of a kind of basketwork formed from small strips of wood plaited these by the aid of a little wax they render perfectly water tight beside the roots on which they mainly depend for subsistence they collect great quantities of seed of various kinds beaten with one hand out of the tops of the plants into wooden bowls held for that purpose the seed thus collected is winnowed and parched and ground between two stones into a kind of meal or flour which when mixed with water forms a very palatable paste or gruel  some of these people more provident and industrious than the rest lay up a stock of dried salmon and other fish for winter with these they were ready to traffic with the travellers for any objects of utility in indian life giving a large quantity in exchange for an awl a knife or a fishhook others were in the most abject state of want and starvation and would even gather up the fishbones which the travellers threw away after a repast warm them over again at the fire and pick them with the greatest avidity  the farther captain bonneville advanced into the country of these root diggers the more evidence he perceived of their rude and forlorn condition they were destitute says he of the necessary covering to protect them from the weather and seemed to be in the most unsophisticated ignorance of any other propriety or advantage in the use of clothing one old dame had absolutely nothing on her person but a thread round her neck from which was pendant a solitary bead  what stage of human destitution however is too destitute for vanity though these naked and forlornlooking beings had neither toilet to arrange nor beauty to contemplate their greatest passion was for a mirror it was a great medicine in their eyes the sight of one was sufficient at any time to throw them into a paroxysm of eagerness and delight and they were ready to give anything they had for the smallest fragment in which they might behold their squalid features with this simple instance of vanity in its primitive but vigorous state we shall close our remarks on the root diggers     30       temperature of the climateroot diggers on horsebackan      indian guidemountain prospectsthe grand rond      difficulties on snake

than in the same latitudes on the atlantic side the upper plains however which lie at a distance from the seacoast are subject in winter to considerable vicissitude being traversed by lofty sierras crowned with perpetual snow which often produce flaws and streaks of intense cold this was experienced by captain bonneville and his companions in their progress westward at the time when they left the bannacks snake river was frozen hard as they proceeded the ice became broken and floating it gradually disappeared and the weather became warm and pleasant as they approached a tributary stream called the little wyer and the soil which was generally of a watery clay with occasional intervals of sand was soft to the tread of the horses after a time however the mountains approached and flanked the river the snow lay deep in the valleys and the current was once more icebound  here they were visited by a party of root diggers who were apparently rising in the world for they had horse to ride and weapon to wear and were altogether better clad and equipped than any of the tribe that captain bonneville had met with they were just from the plain of boisee river where they had left a number of their tribe all as well provided as themselves having guns horses and comfortable clothing all these they obtained from the lower nez perces with whom they were in habits sic of frequent traffic they appeared to have imbibed from that tribe their noncombative principles being mild and inoffensive in their manners like them also they had something of religious feelings for captain bonneville observed that before eating they washed their hands and made a short prayer which he understood was their invariable custom from these indians he obtained a considerable supply of fish and an excellent and wellconditioned horse to replace one which had become too weak for the journey  the travellers now moved forward with renovated spirits the snow it is true lay deeper and deeper as they advanced but they trudged on merrily considering themselves well provided for the journey which could not be of much longer duration  they had intended to proceed up the banks of gun creek a stream which flows into snake river from the west but were assured by the natives that the route in that direction was impracticable the latter advised them to keep along snake river where they would not be impeded by the snow taking one of the diggers for a guide they set off along the river and to their joy soon found the country free from snow as had been predicted so that their horses once more had the benefit of tolerable pasturage their digger proved an excellent guide trudging cheerily in the advance he made an unsuccessful shot or two at a deer and a beaver but at night found a rabbit hole whence he extracted the occupant upon which with the addition of a fish given him by the travellers he made a hearty supper and retired to rest filled with good cheer and good humor  the next day the travellers came to where the hills closed upon the river leaving here and there intervals of undulating meadow land the river was sheeted with ice broken into hills at long intervals the digger kept on ahead of the party crossing and recrossing the river in pursuit of game until unluckily encountering a brother digger he stole off with him without the ceremony of leavetaking  being now left to themselves they proceeded until they came to some indian huts the inhabitants of which spoke a language totally different from any they had yet heard one however understood the nez perce language and through him they made inquiries as to their route these indians were extremely kind and honest and furnished them with a small quantity of meat but none of them could be induced to act as guides  immediately in the route of the travellers lay a high mountain which they ascended with some difficulty the prospect from the summit was grand but disheartening directly before them towered the loftiest peaks of immahah rising far higher than the elevated ground on which they stood on the other hand they were enabled to scan the course of the river dashing along through deep chasms between rocks and precipices until lost in a distant wilderness of mountains which closed the savage landscape  they remained for a long time contemplating with perplexed and anxious eye this wild congregation of mountain barriers and seeking to discover some practicable passage the approach of evening obliged them to give up the task and to seek some camping ground for the night moving briskly forward and plunging and tossing through a succession of deep snowdrifts they at length reached a valley known among trappers as the grand rond which they found entirely free from snow  this is a beautiful and very fertile valley about twenty miles long and five or six broad a bright cold stream called the fourche de glace or ice river runs through it its sheltered situation embosomed in mountains renders it good pasturaging ground in the winter time when the elk come down to it in great numbers driven out of the mountains by the snow the indians then resort to it to hunt they likewise come to it in the summer time to dig the camash root of which it produces immense quantities when this plant is in blossom the whole valley is tinted by its blue flowers and looks like the ocean when overcast by a cloud  after passing a night in this valley the travellers in the morning scaled the neighboring hills to look out for a more eligible route than that upon which they had unluckily fallen and after much reconnoitring determined to make their way once more to the river and to travel upon the ice when the banks should prove impassable  on the second day after this determination they were again upon snake river but contrary to their expectations it was nearly free from ice a narrow riband ran along the shore and sometimes there was a kind of bridge across the stream formed of old ice and snow for a short time they jogged along the bank with tolerable facility but at length came to where the river forced its way into the heart of the mountains winding between tremendous walls of basaltic rock that rose perpendicularly from the waters edge frowning in bleak and gloomy grandeur here difficulties of all kinds beset their path the snow was from two to three feet deep but soft and yielding so that the horses had no foothold but kept plunging forward straining themselves by perpetual efforts sometimes the crags and promontories forced them upon the narrow riband of ice that bordered the shore sometimes they had to scramble over vast masses of rock which had tumbled from the impending precipices sometimes they had to cross the stream upon the hazardous bridges of ice and snow sinking to the knee at every step sometimes they had to scale slippery acclivities and to pass along narrow cornices glazed with ice and sleet a shouldering wall of rock on one side a yawning precipice on the other where a single false step would have been fatal in a lower and less dangerous pass two of their horses actually fell into the river one was saved with much difficulty but the boldness of the shore prevented their rescuing the other and he was swept away by the rapid current  in this way they struggled forward manfully braving difficulties and dangers until they came to where the bed of the river was narrowed to a mere chasm with perpendicular walls of rock that defied all further progress turning their faces now to the mountain they endeavored to cross directly over it but after clambering nearly to the summit found their path closed by insurmountable barriers  nothing now remained but to retrace their steps to descend a cragged mountain however was more difficult and dangerous than to ascend it they had to lower themselves cautiously and slowly from steep to steep and while they managed with difficulty to maintain their own footing to aid their horses by holding on firmly to the rope halters as the poor animals stumbled among slippery rocks or slid down icy declivities thus after a day of intense cold and severe and incessant toil amidst the wildest of scenery they managed about nightfall to reach the camping ground from which they had started in the morning and for the first time in the course of their rugged and perilous expedition felt their hearts quailing under their multiplied hardships  a hearty supper a tranquillizing pipe and a sound nights sleep put them all in better mood and in the morning they held a consultation as to their future movements about four miles behind they had remarked a small ridge of mountains approaching closely to the river it was determined to scale this ridge and seek a passage into the valley which must lie beyond should they fail in this but one alternative remained to kill their horses dry the flesh for provisions make boats of the hides and in these commit themselves to the streama measure hazardous in the extreme  a short march brought them to the foot of the mountain but its steep and cragged sides almost discouraged hope the only chance of scaling it was by broken masses of rock piled one upon another which formed a succession of crags reaching nearly to the summit up these they wrought their way with indescribable difficulty and peril in a zigzag course climbing from rock to rock and helping their horses up after them which scrambled among the crags like mountain goats now and then dislodging some huge stone which the moment they had left it would roll down the mountain crashing and rebounding with terrific din it was some time after dark before they reached a kind of platform on the summit of the mountain where they could venture to encamp the winds which swept this naked height had whirled all the snow into the valley beneath so that the horses found tolerable winter pasturage on the dry grass which remained exposed the travellers though hungry in the extreme were fain to make a very frugal supper for they saw their journey was likely to be prolonged much beyond the anticipated term  in fact on the following day they discerned that although already at a great elevation they were only as yet upon the shoulder of the mountain it proved to be a great sierra or ridge of immense height running parallel to the course of the river swelling by degrees to lofty peaks but the outline gashed by deep and precipitous ravines this in fact was a part of the chain of blue mountains in which the first adventurers to astoria experienced such hardships  we will not pretend to accompany the travellers step by step in this tremendous mountain scramble into which they had unconsciously betrayed themselves day after day did their toil continue peak after peak had they to traverse struggling with difficulties and hardships known only to the mountain trapper as their course lay north they had to ascend the southern faces of the heights where the sun had melted the snow so as to render the ascent wet and slippery and to keep both men and horses continually on the strain while on the northern sides the snow lay in such heavy masses that it was necessary to beat a track down which the horses might be led every now and then also their way was impeded by tall and numerous pines some of which had fallen and lay in every direction  in the midst of these toils and hardships their provisions gave out for three days they were without food and so reduced that they could scarcely drag themselves along at length one of the mules being about to give out from fatigue and famine they hastened to dispatch him husbanding this miserable supply they dried the flesh and for three days subsisted upon the nutriment extracted from the bones as to the meat it was packed and preserved as long as they could do without it not knowing how long they might remain bewildered in these desolate regions  one of the men was now dispatched ahead to reconnoitre the country and to discover if possible some more practicable route in the meantime the rest of the party moved on slowly after a lapse of three days the scout rejoined them he informed them that snake river ran immediately below the sierra or mountainous ridge upon which they were travelling that it was free from precipices and was at no great distance from them in a direct line but that it would be impossible for them to reach it without making a weary circuit their only course would be to cross the mountain ridge to the left  up this mountain therefore the weary travellers directed their steps and the ascent in their present weak and exhausted state was one of the severest parts of this most painful journey for two days were they toiling slowly from cliff to cliff beating at every step a path through the snow for their faltering horses at length they reached the summit where the snow was blown off but in descending on the opposite side they were often plunging through deep drifts piled in the hollows and ravines  their provisions were now exhausted and they and their horses almost ready to give out with fatigue and hunger when one afternoon just as the sun was sinking behind a blue line of distant mountain they came to the brow of a height from which they beheld the smooth valley of the immahah stretched out in smiling verdure below them  the sight inspired almost a frenzy of delight roused to new ardor they forgot for a time their fatigues and hurried down the mountain dragging their jaded horses after them and sometimes compelling them to slide a distance of thirty or forty feet at a time at length they reached the banks of the immahah the young grass was just beginning to sprout and the whole valley wore an aspect of softness verdure and repose heightened by the contrast of the frightful region from which they had just descended to add to their joy they observed indian trails along the margin of the stream and other signs which gave them reason to believe that there was an encampment of the lower nez perces in the neighborhood as it was within the accustomed range of that pacific and hospitable tribe  the prospect of a supply of food stimulated them to new exertion and they continued on as fast as the enfeebled state of themselves and their steeds would permit at length one of the men more exhausted than the rest threw himself upon the grass and declared he could go no further it was in vain to attempt to rouse him his spirit had given out and his replies only showed the dogged apathy of despair his companions therefore encamped on the spot kindled a blazing fire and searched about for roots with which to strengthen and revive him they all then made a starveling repast but gathering round the fire talked over past dangers and troubles soothed themselves with the persuasion that all were now at an end and went to sleep with the comforting hope that the morrow would bring them into plentiful quarters

horsethe cost of an indian present  a tranquil nights rest had sufficiently restored the broken down traveller to enable him to resume his wayfaring and all hands set forward on the indian trail with all their eagerness to arrive within reach of succor such was their feeble and emaciated condition that they advanced but slowly nor is it a matter of surprise that they should almost have lost heart as well as strength it was now the 16th of february fiftythree days that they had been travelling in the midst of winter exposed to all kinds of privations and hardships and for the last twenty days they had been entangled in the wild and desolate labyrinths of the snowy mountains climbing and descending icy precipices and nearly starved with cold and hunger  all the morning they continued following the indian trail without seeing a human being and were beginning to be discouraged when about noon they discovered a horseman at a distance he was coming directly toward them but on discovering them suddenly reined up his steed came to a halt and after reconnoitring them for a time with great earnestness seemed about to make a cautious retreat they eagerly made signs of peace and endeavored with the utmost anxiety to induce him to approach he remained for some time in doubt but at length having satisfied himself that they were not enemies came galloping up to them he was a fine haughtylooking savage fancifully decorated and mounted on a highmettled steed with gaudy trappings and equipments it was evident that he was a warrior of some consequence among his tribe his whole deportment had something in it of barbaric dignity he felt perhaps his temporary superiority in personal array and in the spirit of his steed to the poor ragged travelworn trappers and their halfstarved horses approaching them with an air of protection he gave them his hand and in the nez perce language invited them to his camp which was only a few miles distant where he had plenty to eat and plenty of horses and would cheerfully share his good things with them  his hospitable invitation was joyfully accepted he lingered but a moment to give directions by which they might find his camp and then wheeling round and giving the reins to his mettlesome steed was soon out of sight the travellers followed with gladdened hearts but at a snails pace for their poor horses could scarcely drag one leg after the other captain bonneville however experienced a sudden and singular change of feeling hitherto the necessity of conducting his party and of providing against every emergency had kept his mind upon the stretch and his whole system braced and excited in no one instance had he flagged in spirit or felt disposed to succumb now however that all danger was over and the march of a few miles would bring them to repose and abundance his energies suddenly deserted him and every faculty mental and physical was totally relaxed he had not proceeded two miles from the point where he had had the interview with the nez perce chief when he threw himself upon the earth without the power or will to move a muscle or exert a thought and sank almost instantly into a profound and dreamless sleep his companions again came to a halt and encamped beside him and there they passed the night  the next morning captain bonneville awakened from his long and heavy sleep much refreshed and they all resumed their creeping progress they had not long been on the march when eight or ten of the nez perce tribe came galloping to meet them leading fresh horses to bear them to their camp thus gallantly mounted they felt new life infused into their languid frames and dashing forward were soon at the lodges of the nez perces here they found about twelve families living together under the patriarchal sway of an ancient and venerable chief he received them with the hospitality of the golden age and with something of the same kind of fare for while he opened his arms to make them welcome the only repast he set before them consisted of roots they could have wished for something more hearty and substantial but for want of better made a voracious meal on these humble viands the repast being over the best pipe was lighted and sent round and this was a most welcome luxury having lost their smoking apparatus twelve days before among the mountains  while they were thus enjoying themselves their poor horses were led to the best pastures in the neighborhood where they were turned loose to revel on the fresh sprouting grass so that they had better fare than their masters  captain bonneville soon felt himself quite at home among these quiet inoffensive people his long residence among their cousins the upper nez perces had made him conversant with their language modes of expression and all their habitudes he soon found too that he was well known among them by report at least from the constant interchange of visits and messages between the two branches of the tribe they at first addressed him by his name giving him his title of captain with a french accent but they soon gave him a title of their own which as usual with indian titles had a peculiar signification in the case of the captain it had somewhat of a whimsical origin  as he sat chatting and smoking in the midst of them he would occasionally take off his cap whenever he did so there was a sensation in the surrounding circle the indians would half rise from their recumbent posture and gaze upon his uncovered head with their usual exclamation of astonishment the worthy captain was completely bald a phenomenon very surprising in their eyes they were at a loss to know whether he had been scalped in battle or enjoyed a natural immunity from that belligerent infliction in a little while he became known among them by an indian name signifying the bald chief a sobriquet observes the captain for which i can find no parallel in history since the days of charles the bald  although the travellers had banqueted on roots and been regaled with tobacco smoke yet their stomachs craved more generous fare in approaching the lodges of the nez perces they had indulged in fond anticipations of venison and dried salmon and dreams of the kind still haunted their imaginations and could not be conjured down the keen appetites of mountain trappers quickened by a fortnights fasting at length got the better of all scruples of pride and they fairly begged some fish or flesh from the hospitable savages the latter however were slow to break in upon their winter store which was very limited but were ready to furnish roots in abundance which they pronounced excellent food at length captain bonneville thought of a means of attaining the muchcoveted gratification  he had about him he says a trusty plaid an old and valued travelling companion and comforter upon which the rains had descended and the snows and winds beaten without further effect than somewhat to tarnish its primitive lustre this coat of many colors had excited the admiration and inflamed the covetousness of both warriors and squaws to an extravagant degree an idea now occurred to captain bonneville to convert this rainbow garment into the savory viands so much desired there was a momentary struggle in his mind between old associations and projected indulgence and his decision in favor of the latter was made he says with a greater promptness perhaps than true taste and sentiment might have required in a few moments his plaid cloak was cut into numerous strips of these continues he with the newly developed talent of a manmilliner i speedily constructed turbans a la turque and fanciful headgears of divers conformations these judiciously distributed among such of the womenkind as seemed of most consequence and interest in the eyes of the patres conscripti brought us in a little while abundance of dried salmon and deers hearts on which we made a sumptuous supper another and a more satisfactory smoke succeeded this repast and sweet slumbers answering the peaceful invocation of our pipes wrapped us in that delicious rest which is only won by toil and travail as to captain bonneville he slept in the lodge of the venerable patriarch who had evidently conceived a most disinterested affection for him as was shown on the following morning the travellers invigorated by a good supper and fresh from the bath of repose were about to resume their journey when this affectionate old chief took the captain aside to let him know how much he loved him as a proof of his regard he had determined to give him a fine horse which would go further than words and put his good will beyond all question so saying he made a signal and forthwith a beautiful young horse of a brown color was led prancing and snorting to the place captain bonneville was suitably affected by this mark of friendship but his experience in what is proverbially called indian giving made him aware that a parting pledge was necessary on his own part to prove that his friendship was reciprocated he accordingly placed a handsome rifle in the hands of the venerable chief whose benevolent heart was evidently touched and gratified by this outward and visible sign of amity  having now as he thought balanced this little account of friendship the captain was about to shift his saddle to this noble gifthorse when the affectionate patriarch plucked him by the sleeve and introduced to him a whimpering whining leathernskinned old squaw that might have passed for an egyptian mummy without drying this said he is my wife she is a good wifei love her very muchshe loves the horseshe loves him a great dealshe will cry very much at losing himi do not know how i shall comfort herand that makes my heart very sore  what could the worthy captain do to console the tenderhearted old squaw and peradventure to save the venerable patriarch from a curtain lecture he bethought himself of a pair of earbobs it was true the patriarchs betterhalf was of an age and appearance that seemed to put personal vanity out of the question but when is personal vanity extinct the moment he produced the glittering earbobs the whimpering and whining of the sempiternal beldame was at an end she eagerly placed the precious baubles in her ears and though as ugly as the witch of endor went off with a sideling gait and coquettish air as though she had been a perfect semiramis  the captain had now saddled his newly acquired steed and his foot was in the stirrup when the affectionate patriarch again stepped forward and presented to him a young piercednose who had a peculiarly sulky look this said the venerable chief is my son he is very good a great horsemanhe always took care of this very fine horsehe brought him up from a colt and made him what he ishe is very fond of this fine horsehe loves him like a brotherhis heart will be very heavy when this fine horse leaves the camp  what could the captain do to reward the youthful hope of this venerable pair and comfort him for the loss of his fosterbrother the horse he bethought him of a hatchet which might be spared from his slender stores no sooner did he place the implement into the hands of the young hopeful than his countenance brightened up and he went off rejoicing in his hatchet to the full as much as did his respectable mother in her earbobs  the captain was now in the saddle and about to start when the affectionate old patriarch stepped forward for the third time and while he laid one hand gently on the mane of the horse held up the rifle in the other this rifle said he shall be my great medicine i will hug it to my hearti will always love it for the sake of my good friend the baldheaded chiefbut a rifle by itself is dumbi cannot make it speak if i had a little powder and ball i would take it out with me and would now and then shoot a deer and when i brought the meat home to my hungry family i would saythis was killed by the rifle of my friend the baldheaded chief to whom i gave that very fine horse  there was no resisting this appeal the captain forthwith furnished the coveted supply of powder and ball but at the same time put spurs to his very fine gifthorse and the first trial of his speed was to get out of all further manifestation of friendship on the part of the affectionate old patriarch and his insinuating family     32

feasttowncriers      honesty of the nezpercesthe captains attempt at      healing  following the course of the immahah captain bonneville and his three companions soon reached the vicinity of snake river their route now lay over a succession of steep and isolated hills with profound valleys on the second day after taking leave of the affectionate old patriarch as they were descending into one of those deep and abrupt intervals they descried a smoke and shortly afterward came in sight of a small encampment of nez perces  the indians when they ascertained that it was a party of white men approaching greeted them with a salute of firearms and invited them to encamp this band was likewise under the sway of a venerable chief named yomusroyecut a name which we shall be careful not to inflict oftener than is necessary upon the reader this ancient and hardnamed chieftain welcomed captain bonneville to his camp with the same hospitality and loving kindness that he had experienced from his predecessor he told the captain he had often heard of the americans and their generous deeds and that his buffalo brethren the upper nez perces had always spoken of them as the bighearted whites of the east the very good friends of the nez perces  captain bonneville felt somewhat uneasy under the responsibility of this magnanimous but costly appellation and began to fear he might be involved in a second interchange of pledges of friendship he hastened therefore to let the old chief know his povertystricken state and how little there was to be expected from him  he informed him that he and his comrades had long resided among the upper nez perces and loved them so much that they had thrown their arms around them and now held them close to their hearts that he had received such good accounts from the upper nez perces of their cousins the lower nez perces that he had become desirous of knowing them as friends and brothers that he and his companions had accordingly loaded a mule with presents and set off for the country of the lower nez perces but unfortunately had been entrapped for many days among the snowy mountains and that the mule with all the presents had fallen into snake river and been swept away by the rapid current that instead therefore of arriving among their friends the nez perces with light hearts and full hands they came naked hungry and broken down and instead of making them presents must depend upon them even for food but concluded he we are going to the white mens fort on the wallahwallah and will soon return and then we will meet our nez perce friends like the true big hearts of the east  whether the hint thrown out in the latter part of the speech had any effect or whether the old chief acted from the hospitable feelings which according to the captain are really inherent in the nez perce tribe he certainly showed no disposition to relax his friendship on learning the destitute circumstances of his guests on the contrary he urged the captain to remain with them until the following day when he would accompany him on his journey and make him acquainted with all his people in the meantime he would have a colt killed and cut up for travelling provisions this he carefully explained was intended not as an article of traffic but as a gift for he saw that his guests were hungry and in need of food  captain bonneville gladly assented to this hospitable arrangement the carcass of the colt was forthcoming in due season but the captain insisted that one half of it should be set apart for the use of the chieftains family  at an early hour of the following morning the little party resumed their journey accompanied by the old chief and an indian guide their route was over a rugged and broken country where the hills were slippery with ice and snow their horses too were so weak and jaded that they could scarcely climb the steep ascents or maintain their foothold on the frozen declivities throughout the whole of the journey the old chief and the guide were unremitting in their good offices and continually on the alert to select the best roads and assist them through all difficulties indeed the captain and his comrades had to be dependent on their indian friends for almost every thing for they had lost their tobacco and pipes those great comforts of the trapper and had but a few charges of powder left which it was necessary to husband for the purpose of lighting their fires  in the course of the day the old chief had several private consultations with the guide and showed evident signs of being occupied with some mysterious matter of mighty import what it was captain bonneville could not fathom nor did he make much effort to do so from some casual sentences that he overheard he perceived that it was something from which the old man promised himself much satisfaction and to which he attached a little vainglory but which he wished to keep a secret so he suffered him to spin out his petty plans unmolested  in the evening when they encamped the old chief and his privy counsellor the guide had another mysterious colloquy after which the guide mounted his horse and departed on some secret mission while the chief resumed his seat at the fire and sat humming to himself in a pleasing but mystic reverie  the next morning the travellers descended into the valley of the wayleeway a considerable tributary of snake river here they met the guide returning from his secret errand another private conference was held between him and the old managing chief who now seemed more inflated than ever with mystery and selfimportance numerous fresh trails and various other signs persuaded captain bonneville that there must be a considerable village of nez perces in the neighborhood but as his worthy companion the old chief said nothing on the subject and as it appeared to be in some way connected with his secret operations he asked no questions but patiently awaited the development of his mystery  as they journeyed on they came to where two or three indians were bathing in a small stream the good old chief immediately came to a halt and had a long conversation with them in the course of which he repeated to them the whole history which captain bonneville had related to him in fact he seems to have been a very sociable communicative old man by no means afflicted with that taciturnity generally charged upon the indians on the contrary he was fond of long talks and long smokings and evidently was proud of his new friend the baldheaded chief and took a pleasure in sounding his praises and setting forth the power and glory of the big hearts of the east  having disburdened himself of everything he had to relate to his bathing friends he left them to their aquatic disports and proceeded onward with the captain and his companions as they approached the wayleeway however the communicative old chief met with another and a very different occasion to exert his colloquial powers on the banks of the river stood an isolated mound covered with grass he pointed to it with some emotion the big heart and the strong arm said he lie buried beneath that sod  it was in fact the grave of one of his friends a chosen warrior of the tribe who had been slain on this spot when in pursuit of a war party of shoshokoes who had stolen the horses of the village the enemy bore off his scalp as a trophy but his friends found his body in this lonely place and committed it to the earth with ceremonials characteristic of their pious and reverential feelings they gathered round the grave and mourned the warriors were silent in their grief but the women and children bewailed their loss with loud lamentations for three days said the old man we performed the solemn dances for the dead and prayed the great spirit that our brother might be happy in the land of brave warriors and hunters then we killed at his grave fifteen of our best and strongest horses to serve him when he should arrive at the happy hunting grounds and having done all this we returned sorrowfully to our homes  while the chief was still talking an indian scout came galloping up and presenting him with a powderhorn wheeled round and was speedily out of sight the eyes of the old chief now brightened and all his selfimportance returned his petty mystery was about to explode turning to captain bonneville he pointed to a hill hard by and informed him that behind it was a village governed by a little chief whom he had notified of the approach of the baldheaded chief and a party of the big hearts of the east and that he was prepared to receive them in becoming style as among other ceremonials he intended to salute them with a discharge of firearms he had sent the horn of gunpowder that they might return the salute in a manner correspondent to his dignity  they now proceeded on until they doubled the point of the hill when the whole population of the village broke upon their view drawn out in the most imposing style and arrayed in all their finery the effect of the whole was wild and fantastic yet singularly striking in the front rank were the chiefs and principal warriors glaringly painted and decorated behind them were arranged the rest of the people men women and children  captain bonneville and his party advanced slowly exchanging salutes of firearms when arrived within a respectful distance they dismounted the chiefs then came forward successively according to their respective characters and consequence to offer the hand of good fellowship each filing off when he had shaken hands to make way for his successor those in the next rank followed in the same order and so on until all had given the pledge of friendship during all this time the chief according to custom took his stand beside the guests if any of his people advanced whom he judged unworthy of the friendship or confidence of the white men he motioned them off by a wave of the hand and they would submissively walk away when captain bonneville turned upon him an inquiring look he would observe he was a bad man or something quite as concise and there was an end of the matter  mats poles and other materials were now brought and a comfortable lodge was soon erected for the strangers where they were kept constantly supplied with wood and water and other necessaries and all their effects were placed in safe keeping their horses too were unsaddled and turned loose to graze and a guard set to keep watch upon them  all this being adjusted they were conducted to the main building or council house of the village where an ample repast or rather banquet was spread which seemed to realize all the gastronomical dreams that had tantalized them during their long starvation for here they beheld not merely fish and roots in abundance but the flesh of deer and elk and the choicest pieces of buffalo meat it is needless to say how vigorously they acquitted themselves on this occasion and how unnecessary it was for their hosts to practice the usual cramming principle of indian hospitality  when the repast was over a long talk ensued the chief showed the same curiosity evinced by his tribe generally to obtain information concerning the united states of which they knew little but what they derived through their cousins the upper nez perces as their traffic is almost exclusively with the british traders of the hudsons bay company captain bonneville did his best to set forth the merits of his nation and the importance of their friendship to the red men in which he was ably seconded by his worthy friend the old chief with the hard name who did all that he could to glorify the big hearts of the east  the chief and all present listened with profound attention and evidently with great interest nor were the important facts thus set forth confined to the audience in the lodge for sentence after sentence was loudly repeated by a crier for the benefit of the whole village  this custom of promulgating everything by criers is not confined to the nez perces but prevails among many other tribes it has its advantage where there are no gazettes to publish the news of the day or to report the proceedings of important meetings and in fact reports of this kind viva voce made in the hearing of all parties and liable to be contradicted or corrected on the spot are more likely to convey accurate information to the public mind than those circulated through the press the office of crier is generally filled by some old man who is good for little else a village has generally several of these walking newspapers as they are termed by the whites who go about proclaiming the news of the day giving notice of public councils expeditions dances feasts and other ceremonials and advertising anything lost while captain bonneville remained among the nez perces if a glove handkerchief or anything of similar value was lost or mislaid it was carried by the finder to the lodge of the chief and proclamation was made by one of their criers for the owner to come and claim his property  how difficult it is to get at the true character of these wandering tribes of the wilderness in a recent work we have had to speak of this tribe of indians from the experience of other traders who had casually been among them and who represented them as selfish inhospitable exorbitant in their dealings and much addicted to thieving captain bonneville on the contrary who resided much among them and had repeated opportunities of ascertaining their real character invariably speaks of them as kind and hospitable scrupulously honest and remarkable above all other indians that he had met with for a strong feeling of religion in fact so enthusiastic is he in their praise that he pronounces them all ignorant and barbarous as they are by their condition one of the purest hearted people on the face of the earth  some cures which captain bonneville had effected in simple cases among the upper nez perces had reached the ears of their cousins here and gained for him the reputation of a great medicine man he had not been long in the village therefore before his lodge began to be the resort of the sick and the infirm the captain felt the value of the reputation thus accidentally and cheaply acquired and endeavored to sustain it as he had arrived at that age when every man is experimentally something of a physician he was enabled to turn to advantage the little knowledge in the healing art which he had casually picked up and was sufficiently successful in two or three cases to convince the simple indians that report had not exaggerated his medical talents the only patient that effectually baffled his skill or rather discouraged any attempt at relief was an antiquated squaw with a churchyard cough and one leg in the grave it being shrunk and rendered useless by a rheumatic affection this was a case beyond his mark however he comforted the old woman with a promise that he would endeavor to procure something to relieve her at the fort on the wallahwallah and would bring it on his return with which assurance her husband was so well satisfied that he presented the captain with a colt to be killed as provisions for the journey a medical fee which was thankfully accepted  while among these indians captain bonneville unexpectedly found an owner for the horse which he had purchased from a root digger at the big wyer the indian satisfactorily proved that the horse had been stolen from him some time previous by some unknown thief however said the considerate savage you got him in fair tradeyou are more in want of horses than i am keep him he is yourshe is a good horse use him well  thus in the continued experience of acts of kindness and generosity which his destitute condition did not allow him to reciprocate captain bonneville passed some short time among these good people more and more impressed with the general excellence of their

perce guide whose knowledge of the country was important in choosing the routes and resting places he also continued to be accompanied by the worthy old chief with the hard name who seemed bent upon doing the honors of the country and introducing him to every branch of his tribe the wayleeway down the banks of which captain bonneville and his companions were now travelling is a considerable stream winding through a succession of bold and beautiful scenes sometimes the landscape towered into bold and mountainous heights that partook of sublimity at other times it stretched along the water side in fresh smiling meadows and graceful undulating valleys  frequently in their route they encountered small parties of the nez perces with whom they invariably stopped to shake hands and who generally evinced great curiosity concerning them and their adventures a curiosity which never failed to be thoroughly satisfied by the replies of the worthy yomusroyecut who kindly took upon himself to be spokesman of the party  the incessant smoking of pipes incident to the long talks of this excellent but somewhat garrulous old chief at length exhausted all his stock of tobacco so that he had no longer a whiff with which to regale his white companions in this emergency he cut up the stem of his pipe into fine shavings which he mixed with certain herbs and thus manufactured a temporary succedaneum to enable him to accompany his long colloquies and harangues with the customary fragrant cloud  if the scenery of the wayleeway had charmed the travellers with its mingled amenity and grandeur that which broke upon them on once more reaching snake river filled them with admiration and astonishment at times the river was overhung by dark and stupendous rocks rising like gigantic walls and battlements these would be rent by wide and yawning chasms that seemed to speak of past convulsions of nature sometimes the river was of a glassy smoothness and placidity at other times it roared along in impetuous rapids and foaming cascades here the rocks were piled in the most fantastic crags and precipices and in another place they were succeeded by delightful valleys carpeted with greenaward the whole of this wild and varied scenery was dominated by immense mountains rearing their distant peaks into the clouds the grandeur and originality of the views presented on every side says captain bonneville beggar both the pencil and the pen nothing we had ever gazed upon in any other region could for a moment compare in wild majesty and impressive sternness with the series of scenes which here at every turn astonished our senses and filled us with awe and delight  indeed from all that we can gather from the journal before us and the accounts of other travellers who passed through these regions in the memorable enterprise of astoria we are inclined to think that snake river must be one of the most remarkable for varied and striking scenery of all the rivers of this continent from its head waters in the rocky mountains to its junction with the columbia its windings are upward of six hundred miles through every variety of landscape rising in a volcanic region amid extinguished craters and mountains awful with the traces of ancient fires it makes its way through great plains of lava and sandy deserts penetrates vast sierras or mountainous chains broken into romantic and often frightful precipices and crowned with eternal snows and at other times careers through green and smiling meadows and wide landscapes of italian grace and beauty wildness and sublimity however appear to be its prevailing characteristics  captain bonneville and his companions had pursued their journey a considerable distance down the course of snake river when the old chief halted on the bank and dismounting recommended that they should turn their horses loose to graze while he summoned a cousin of his from a group of lodges on the opposite side of the stream his summons was quickly answered an indian of an active elastic form leaped into a light canoe of cottonwood and vigorously plying the paddle soon shot across the river bounding on shore he advanced with a buoyant air and frank demeanor and gave his right hand to each of the party in turn the old chief whose hard name we forbear to repeat now presented captain bonneville in form to his cousin whose name we regret to say was no less hard being nothing less than haysheincowcow the latter evinced the usual curiosity to know all about the strangers whence they came whither they were going the object of their journey and the adventures they had experienced all these of course were ample and eloquently set forth by the communicative old chief to all his grandiloquent account of the baldheaded chief and his countrymen the big hearts of the east his cousin listened with great attention and replied in the customary style of indian welcome he then desired the party to await his return and springing into his canoe darted across the river in a little while he returned bringing a most welcome supply of tobacco and a small stock of provisions for the road declaring his intention of accompanying the party having no horse he mounted behind one of the men observing that he should procure a steed for himself on the following day  they all now jogged on very sociably and cheerily together not many miles beyond they met others of the tribe among whom was one whom captain bonneville and his comrades had known during their residence among the upper nez perces and who welcomed them with open arms in this neighborhood was the home of their guide who took leave of them with a profusion of good wishes for their safety and happiness that night they put up in the hut of a nez perce where they were visited by several warriors from the other side of the river friends of the old chief and his cousin who came to have a talk and a smoke with the white men the heart of the good old chief was overflowing with good will at thus being surrounded by his new and old friends and he talked with more spirit and vivacity than ever the evening passed away in perfect harmony and goodhumor and it was not until a late hour that the visitors took their leave and recrossed the river  after this constant picture of worth and virtue on the part of the nez perce tribe we grieve to have to record a circumstance calculated to throw a temporary shade upon the name in the course of the social and harmonious evening just mentioned one of the captains men who happened to be something of a virtuoso in his way and fond of collecting curiosities produced a small skin a great rarity in the eyes of men conversant in peltries it attracted much attention among the visitors from beyond the river who passed it from one to the other examined it with looks of lively admiration and pronounced it a great medicine  in the morning when the captain and his party were about to set off the precious skin was missing search was made for it in the hut but it was nowhere to be found and it was strongly suspected that it had been purloined by some of the connoisseurs from the other side of the river  the old chief and his cousin were indignant at the supposed delinquency of their friends across the water and called out for them to come over and answer for their shameful conduct the others answered to the call with all the promptitude of perfect innocence and spurned at the idea of their being capable of such outrage upon any of the bighearted nation all were at a loss on whom to fix the crime of abstracting the invaluable skin when by chance the eyes of the worthies from beyond the water fell upon an unhappy cur belonging to the owner of the hut he was a gallowslooking dog but not more so than most indian dogs who take them in the mass are little better than a generation of vipers be that as it may he was instantly accused of having devoured the skin in question a dog accused is generally a dog condemned and a dog condemned is generally a dog executed so was it in the present instance the unfortunate cur was arraigned his thievish looks substantiated his guilt and he was condemned by his judges from across the river to be hanged in vain the indians of the hut with whom he was a great favorite interceded in his behalf in vain captain bonneville and his comrades petitioned that his life might be spared his judges were inexorable he was doubly guilty first in having robbed their good friends the big hearts of the east secondly in having brought a doubt on the honor of the nez perce tribe he was accordingly swung aloft and pelted with stones to make his death more certain the sentence of the judges being thoroughly executed a post mortem examination of the body of the dog was held to establish his delinquency beyond all doubt and to leave the nez perces without a shadow of suspicion great interest of course was manifested by all present during this operation the body of the dog was opened the intestines rigorously scrutinized but to the horror of all concerned not a particle of the skin was to be foundthe dog had been unjustly executed  a great clamor now ensued but the most clamorous was the party from across the river whose jealousy of their good name now prompted them to the most vociferous vindications of their innocence it was with the utmost difficulty that the captain and his comrades could calm their lively sensibilities by accounting for the disappearance of the skin in a dozen different ways until all idea of its having been stolen was entirely out of the question  the meeting now broke up the warriors returned across the river the captain and his comrades proceeded on their journey but the spirits of the communicative old chief yomusroyecut were for a time completely dampened and he evinced great mortification at what had just occurred he rode on in silence except that now and then he would give way to a burst of indignation and exclaim with a shake of the head and a toss of the hand toward the opposite shorebad men very bad men across the river to each of which brief exclamations his worthy cousin haysheincowcow would respond by a guttural sound of acquiescence equivalent to an amen  after some time the countenance of theold chief again cleared up and he fell into repeated conferences in an under tone with his cousin which ended in the departure of the latter who applying the lash to his horse dashed forward and was soon out of sight in fact they were drawing near to the village of another chief likewise distinguished by an appellation of some longitude opushyecut but commonly known as the great chief the cousin had been sent ahead to give notice of their approach a herald appeared as before bearing a powderhorn to enable them to respond to the intended salute a scene ensued on their approach to the village similar to that which had occurred at the village of the little chief the whole population appeared in the field drawn up in lines arrayed with the customary regard to rank and dignity then came on the firing of salutes and the shaking of hands in which last ceremonial every individual man woman and child participated for the indians have an idea that it is as indispensable an overture of friendship among the whites as smoking of the pipe is among the red men the travellers were next ushered to the banquet where all the choicest viands that the village could furnish were served up in rich profusion they were afterwards entertained by feats of agility and horseraces indeed their visit to the village seemed the signal for complete festivity in the meantime a skin lodge had been spread for their accommodation their horses and baggage were taken care of and wood and water supplied in abundance at night therefore they retired to their quarters to enjoy as they supposed the repose of which they stood in need no such thing however was in store for them a crowd of visitors awaited their appearance all eager for a smoke and a talk the pipe was immediately lighted and constantly replenished and kept alive until the night was far advanced as usual the utmost eagerness was evinced by the guests to learn everything within the scope of their comprehension respecting the americans for whom they professed the most fraternal regard the captain in his replies made use of familiar illustrations calculated to strike their minds and impress them with such an idea of the might of his nation as would induce them to treat with kindness and respect all stragglers that might fall in their path to their inquiries as to the numbers of the people of the united states he assured them that they were as countless as the blades of grass in the prairies and that great as snake river was if they were all encamped upon its banks they would drink it dry in a single day to these and similar statistics they listened with profound attention and apparently implicit belief it was indeed a striking scene the captain with his hunters dress and bald head in the midst holding forth and his wild auditors seated around like so many statues the fire lighting up their painted faces and muscular figures all fixed and motionless excepting when the pipe was passed a question propounded or a startling fact in statistics received with a movement of surprise and a halfsuppressed ejaculation of wonder and delight  the fame of the captain as a healer of diseases had accompanied him to this village and the great chief opushyecut now entreated him to exert his skill on his daughter who had been for three days racked with pains for which the piercednose doctors could devise no alleviation the captain found her extended on a pallet of mats in excruciating pain her father manifested the strongest paternal affection for her and assured the captain that if he would but cure her he would place the americans near his heart the worthy captain needed no such inducement his kind heart was already touched by the sufferings of the poor girl and his sympathies quickened by her appearance for she was but about sixteen years of age and uncommonly beautiful in form and feature the only difficulty with the captain was that he knew nothing of her malady and that his medical science was of a most haphazard kind after considering and cogitating for some time as a man is apt to do when in a maze of vague ideas he made a desperate dash at a remedy by his directions the girl was placed in a sort of rude vapor bath much used by the nez perces where she was kept until near fainting he then gave her a dose of gunpowder dissolved in cold water and ordered her to be wrapped in buffalo robes and put to sleep under a load of furs and blankets the remedy succeeded the next morning she was free from pain though extremely languid whereupon the captain prescribed for her a bowl of colts head broth and that she should be kept for a time on simple diet  the great chief was unbounded in his expressions of gratitude for the recovery of his daughter he would fain have detained the captain a long time as his guest but the time for departure had arrived when the captains horse was brought for him to mount the chief declared that the steed was not worthy of him and sent for one of his best horses which he presented in its stead declaring that it made his heart glad to see his friend so well mounted he then appointed a young nez perce to accompany his guest to the next village and to carry his talk concerning them and the two parties separated with mutual expressions of good will  the vapor bath of which we have made mention is in frequent use among the nez perce tribe chiefly for cleanliness their sweating houses as they call them are small and close lodges and the vapor is produced by water poured slowly upon redhot stones  on passing the limits of opushyecuts domains the travellers left the elevated tablelands and all the wild and romantic scenery which has just been described they now traversed a gently undulating country of such fertility that it excited the rapturous admiration of two of the captains followers a kentuckian and a native of ohio they declared that it surpassed any land that they had ever seen and often exclaimed what a delight it would be just to run a plough through such a rich and teeming soil and see it open its bountiful promise before the share  another halt and sojourn of a night was made at the village of a chief named hemimelpilp where similar ceremonies were observed and hospitality experienced as at the preceding villages they now pursued a westsouthwest course through a beautiful and fertile region better wooded than most of the tracts through which they had passed in their progress they met with several bands of nez perces by whom they were invariably treated with the utmost kindness within seven days after leaving the domain of hemimelpilp they struck the columbia river at fort wallahwallah where they arrived on the 4th of march 1834     34       fort wallahwallahits commanderindians in its      neighborhoodexertions of mr pambrune for their      improvementreligioncode of

of the hudsons bay company situated just above the mouth of the river by the same name and on the left bank of the columbia it is built of driftwood and calculated merely for defence against any attack of the natives at the time of captain bonnevilles arrival the whole garrison mustered but six or eight men and the post was under the superintendence of mr pambrune an agent of the hudsons bay company  the great post and fort of the company forming the emporium of its trade on the pacific is fort vancouver situated on the right bank of the columbia about sixty miles from the sea and just above the mouth of the wallamut to this point the company removed its establishment from astoria in 1821 after its coalition with the northwest company  captain bonneville and his comrades experienced a polite reception from mr pambrune the superintendent for however hostile the members of the british company may be to the enterprises of american traders they have always manifested great courtesy and hospitality to the traders themselves  fort wallahwallah is surrounded by the tribe of the same name as well as by the skynses and the nez perces who bring to it the furs and peltries collected in their hunting expeditions the wallahwallahs are a degenerate wornout tribe the nez perces are the most numerous and tractable of the three tribes just mentioned mr pambrune informed captain bonneville that he had been at some pains to introduce the christian religion in the roman catholic form among them where it had evidently taken root but had become altered and modified to suit their peculiar habits of thought and motives of action retaining however the principal points of faith and its entire precepts of morality the same gentleman had given them a code of laws to which they conformed with scrupulous fidelity polygamy which once prevailed among them to a great extent was now rarely indulged all the crimes denounced by the christian faith met with severe punishment among them even theft so venial a crime among the indians had recently been punished with hanging by sentence of a chief  there certainly appears to be a peculiar susceptibility of moral and religious improvement among this tribe and they would seem to be one of the very very few that have benefited in morals and manners by an intercourse with white men the parties which visited them about twenty years previously in the expedition fitted out by mr astor complained of their selfishness their extortion and their thievish propensities the very reverse of those qualities prevailed among them during the prolonged sojourns of captain bonneville  the lower nez perces range upon the wayleeway immahah yenghies and other of the streams west of the mountains they hunt the beaver elk deer white bear and mountain sheep besides the flesh of these animals they use a number of roots for food some of which would be well worth transplanting and cultivating in the atlantic states among these is the camash a sweet root about the form and size of an onion and said to be really delicious the cowish also or biscuit root about the size of a walnut which they reduce to a very palatable flour together with the jackap aisish quako and others which they cook by steaming them in the ground  in august and september these indians keep along the rivers where they catch and dry great quantities of salmon which while they last are their principal food in the winter they congregate in villages formed of comfortable huts or lodges covered with mats they are generally clad in deer skins or woollens and extremely well armed above all they are celebrated for owning great numbers of horses which they mark and then suffer to range in droves in their most fertile plains these horses are principally of the pony breed but remarkably stout and longwinded they are brought in great numbers to the establishments of the hudsons bay company and sold for a mere trifle  such is the account given by captain bonneville of the nez perces who if not viewed by him with too partial an eye are certainly among the gentlest and least barbarous people of these remote wildernesses they invariably signified to him their earnest wish that an american post might be established among them and repeatedly declared that they would trade with americans in preference to any other people  captain bonneville had intended to remain some time in this neighborhood to form an acquaintance with the natives and to collect information and establish connections that might be advantageous in the way of trade the delays however which he had experienced on his journey obliged him to shorten his sojourn and to set off as soon as possible so as to reach the rendezvous at the portneuf at the appointed time he had seen enough to convince him that an american trade might be carried on with advantage in this quarter and he determined soon to return with a stronger party more completely fitted for the purpose  as he stood in need of some supplies for his journey he applied to purchase them of mr pambrune but soon found the difference between being treated as a guest or as a rival trader the worthy superintendent who had extended to him all the genial rites of hospitality now suddenly assumed a witheredup aspect and demeanor and observed that however he might feel disposed to serve him personally he felt bound by his duty to the hudsons bay company to do nothing which should facilitate or encourage the visits of other traders among the indians in that part of the country he endeavored to dissuade captain bonneville from returning through the blue mountains assuring him it would be extremely difficult and dangerous if not impracticable at this season of the year and advised him to accompany mr payette a leader of the hudsons bay company who was about to depart with a number of men by a more circuitous but safe route to carry supplies to the companys agent resident among the upper nez perces captain bonneville however piqued at his having refused to furnish him with supplies and doubting the sincerity of his advice determined to return by the more direct route through the mountains though varying his course in some respects from that by which he had come in consequence of information gathered among the neighboring indians  accordingly on the 6th of march he and his three companions accompanied by their nez perce guides set out on their return in the early part of their course they touched again at several of the nez perce villages where they had experienced such kind treatment on their way down they were always welcomed with cordiality and everything was done to cheer them on their journey  on leaving the wayleeway village they were joined by a nez perce whose society was welcomed on account of the general gratitude and good will they felt for his tribe he soon proved a heavy clog upon the little party being doltish and taciturn lazy in the extreme and a huge feeder his only proof of intellect was in shrewdly avoiding all labor and availing himself of the toil of others when on the march he always lagged behind the rest leaving to them the task of breaking a way through all difficulties and impediments and leisurely and lazily jogging along the track which they had beaten through the snow at the evening encampment when others were busy gathering fuel providing for the horses and cooking the evening repast this worthy sancho of the wilderness would take his seat quietly and cosily by the fire puffing away at his pipe and eyeing in silence but with wistful intensity of gaze the savory morsels roasting for supper  when mealtime arrived however then came his season of activity he no longer hung back and waited for others to take the lead but distinguished himself by a brilliancy of onset and a sustained vigor and duration of attack that completely shamed the efforts of his competitorsalbeit experienced trenchermen of no mean prowess never had they witnessed such power of mastication and such marvellous capacity of stomach as in this native and uncultivated gastronome having by repeated and prolonged assaults at length completely gorged himself he would wrap himself up and lie with the torpor of an anaconda slowly digesting his way on to the next repast  the gormandizing powers of this worthy were at first matters of surprise and merriment to the travellers but they soon became too serious for a joke threatening devastation to the fleshpots and he was regarded askance at his meals as a regular killcrop destined to waste the substance of the party nothing but a sense of the obligations they were under to his nation induced them to bear with such a guest but he proceeded speedily to relieve them from the weight of these obligations by eating a receipt in full     35       the uninvited guestfree and easy mannerssalutary jokes      a prodigal sonexit of the gluttona sudden change in      fortunedanger of a visit to poor

catastropheexit      of the merry vagabond  as captain bonneville and his men were encamped one evening among the hills near snake river seated before their fire enjoying a hearty supper they were suddenly surprised by the visit of an uninvited guest he was a ragged halfnaked indian hunter armed with bow and arrows and had the carcass of a fine buck thrown across his shoulder advancing with an alert step and free and easy air he threw the buck on the ground and without waiting for an invitation seated himself at their mess helped himself without ceremony and chatted to the right and left in the liveliest and most unembarrassed manner no adroit and veteran dinner hunter of a metropolis could have acquitted himself more knowingly the travellers were at first completely taken by surprise and could not but admire the facility with which this ragged cosmopolite made himself at home among them while they stared he went on making the most of the good cheer upon which he had so fortunately alighted and was soon elbow deep in pot luck and greased from the tip of his nose to the back of his ears  as the company recovered from their surprise they began to feel annoyed at this intrusion their uninvited guest unlike the generality of his tribe was somewhat dirty as well as ragged and they had no relish for such a messmate heaping up therefore an abundant portion of the provant upon a piece of bark which served for a dish they invited him to confine himself thereto instead of foraging in the general mess  he complied with the most accommodating spirit imaginable and went on eating and chatting and laughing and smearing himself until his whole countenance shone with grease and goodhumor in the course of his repast his attention was caught by the figure of the gastronome who as usual was gorging himself in dogged silence a droll cut of the eye showed either that he knew him of old or perceived at once his characteristics he immediately made him the butt of his pleasantries and cracked off two or three good hits that caused the sluggish dolt to prick up his ears and delighted all the company from this time the uninvited guest was taken into favor his jokes began to be relished his careless free and easy air to be considered singularly amusing and in the end he was pronounced by the travellers one of the merriest companions and most entertaining vagabonds they had met with in the wilderness  supper being over the redoubtable sheeweesheouaiter for such was the simple name by which he announced himself declared his intention of keeping company with the party for a day or two if they had no objection and by way of backing his selfinvitation presented the carcass of the buck as an earnest of his hunting abilities by this time he had so completely effaced the unfavorable impression made by his first appearance that he was made welcome to the camp and the nez perce guide undertook to give him lodging for the night the next morning at break of day he borrowed a gun and was off among the hills nor was anything more seen of him until a few minutes after the party had encamped for the evening when he again made his appearance in his usual frank careless manner and threw down the carcass of another noble deer which he had borne on his back for a considerable distance  this evening he was the life of the party and his open communicative disposition free from all disguise soon put them in possession of his history he had been a kind of prodigal son in his native village living a loose heedless life and disregarding the precepts and imperative commands of the chiefs he had in consequence been expelled from the village but in nowise disheartened at this banishment had betaken himself to the society of the border indians and had led a careless haphazard vagabond life perfectly consonant to his humors heedless of the future so long as he had wherewithal for the present and fearing no lack of food so long as he had the implements of the chase and a fair hunting ground  finding him very expert as a hunter and being pleased with his eccentricities and his strange and merry humor captain bonneville fitted him out handsomely as the nimrod of the party who all soon became quite attached to him one of the earliest and most signal services he performed was to exorcise the insatiate killcrop that hitherto oppressed the party in fact the doltish nez perce who had seemed so perfectly insensible to rough treatment of every kind by which the travellers had endeavored to elbow him out of their society could not withstand the goodhumored bantering and occasionally sharp wit of sheweeshe he evidently quailed under his jokes and sat blinking like an owl in daylight when pestered by the flouts and peckings of mischievous birds at length his place was found vacant at mealtime no one knew when he went off or whither he had gone but he was seen no more and the vast surplus that remained when the repast was over showed what a mighty gormandizer had departed  relieved from this incubus the little party now went on cheerily sheweeshe kept them in fun as well as food his hunting was always successful he was ever ready to render any assistance in the camp or on the march while his jokes his antics and the very cut of his countenance so full of whim and comicality kept every one in goodhumor  in this way they journeyed on until they arrived on the banks of the immahah and encamped near to the nez perce lodges here sheweeshe took a sudden notion to visit his people and show off the state of worldly prosperity to which he had so suddenly attained he accordingly departed in the morning arrayed in hunters style and well appointed with everything benefitting his vocation the buoyancy of his gait the elasticity of his step and the hilarity of his countenance showed that he anticipated with chuckling satisfaction the surprise he was about to give those who had ejected him from their society in rags but what a change was there in his whole appearance when he rejoined the party in the evening he came skulking into camp like a beaten cur with his tail between his legs all his finery was gone he was naked as when he was born with the exception of a scanty flap that answered the purpose of a fig leaf his fellowtravellers at first did not know him but supposed it to be some vagrant root digger sneaking into the camp but when they recognized in this forlorn object their prime wag sheweeshe whom they had seen depart in the morning in such high glee and high feather they could not contain their merriment but hailed him with loud and repeated peals of laughter  sheweeshe was not of a spirit to be easily cast down he soon joined in the merriment as heartily as any one and seemed to consider his reverse of fortune an excellent joke captain bonneville however thought proper to check his goodhumor and demanded with some degree of sternness the cause of his altered condition he replied in the most natural and selfcomplacent style imaginable that he had been among his cousins who were very poor they had been delighted to see him still more delighted with his good fortune they had taken him to their arms admired his equipments one had begged for this another for thatin fine what with the poor devils inherent heedlessness and the real generosity of his disposition his needy cousins had succeeded in stripping him of all his clothes and accoutrements excepting the fig leaf with which he had returned to camp  seeing his total want of care and forethought captain bonneville determined to let him suffer a little in hopes it might prove a salutary lesson and at any rate to make him no more presents while in the neighborhood of his needy cousins he was left therefore to shift for himself in his naked condition which however did not seem to give him any concern or to abate one jot of his goodhumor in the course of his lounging about the camp however he got possession of a deer skin whereupon cutting a slit in the middle he thrust his head through it so that the two ends hung down before and behind something like a south american poncho or the tabard of a herald these ends he tied together under the armpits and thus arrayed presented himself once more before the captain with an air of perfect selfsatisfaction as though he thought it impossible for any fault to be found with his toilet  a little further journeying brought the travellers to the petty village of nez perces governed by the worthy and affectionate old patriarch who had made captain bonneville the costly present of the very fine horse the old man welcomed them once more to his village with his usual cordiality and his respectable squaw and hopeful son cherishing grateful recollections of the hatchet and earbobs joined in a chorus of friendly gratulation  as the muchvaunted steed once the joy and pride of this interesting family was now nearly knocked up by travelling and totally inadequate to the mountain scramble that lay ahead captain bonneville restored him to the venerable patriarch with renewed acknowledgments for the invaluable gift somewhat to his surprise he was immediately supplied with a fine two years old colt in his stead a substitution which he afterward learnt according to indian custom in such cases he might have claimed as a matter of right we do not find that any after claims were made on account of this colt this donation may be regarded therefore as a signal punctilio of indian honor but it will be found that the animal soon proved an unlucky acquisition to the party  while at this village the nez perce guide had held consultations with some of the inhabitants as to the mountain tract the party were about to traverse he now began to wear an anxious aspect and to indulge in gloomy forebodings the snow he had been told lay to a great depth in the passes of the mountains and difficulties would increase as he proceeded he begged captain bonneville therefore to travel very slowly so as to keep the horses in strength and spirit for the hard times they would have to encounter the captain surrendered the regulation of the march entirely to his discretion and pushed on in the advance amusing himself with hunting so as generally to kill a deer or two in the course of the day and arriving before the rest of the party at the spot designated by the guide for the evenings encampment  in the meantime the others plodded on at the heels of the guide accompanied by that merry vagabond sheweeshe the primitive garb worn by this droll left all his nether man exposed to the biting blasts of the mountains still his wit was never frozen nor his sunshiny temper beclouded and his innumerable antics and practical jokes while they quickened the circulation of his own blood kept his companions in high goodhumor  so passed the first day after the departure from the patriarchs the second day commenced in the same manner the captain in the advance the rest of the party following on slowly sheweeshe for the greater part of the time trudged on foot over the snow keeping himself warm by hard exercise and all kinds of crazy capers in the height of his foolery the patriarchal colt which unbroken to the saddle was suffered to follow on at large happened to come within his reach in a moment he was on his back snapping his fingers and yelping with delight the colt unused to such a burden and half wild by nature fell to prancing and rearing and snorting and plunging and kicking and at length set off full speed over the most dangerous ground as the route led generally along the steep and craggy sides of the hills both horse and horseman were constantly in danger and more than once had a hairbreadth escape from deadly peril nothing however could daunt this madcap savage he stuck to the colt like a plaister sic up ridges down gullies whooping and yelling with the wildest glee never did beggar on horseback display more headlong horsemanship his companions followed him with their eyes sometimes laughing sometimes holding in their breath at his vagaries until they saw the colt make a sudden plunge or start and pitch his unlucky rider headlong over a precipice there was a general cry of horror and all hastened to the spot they found the poor fellow lying among the rocks below sadly bruised and mangled it was almost a miracle that he had escaped with life even in this condition his merry spirit was not entirely quelled and he summoned up a feeble laugh at the alarm and anxiety of those who came to his relief he was extricated from his rocky bed and a messenger dispatched to inform captain bonneville of the accident the latter returned with all speed and encamped the party at the first convenient spot here the wounded man was stretched upon buffalo skins and the captain who officiated on all occasions as doctor and surgeon to the party proceeded to examine his wounds the principal one was a long and deep gash in the thigh which reached to the bone calling for a needle and thread the captain now prepared to sew up the wound admonishing the patient to submit to the operation with becoming fortitude his gayety was at an end he could no longer summon up even a forced smile and at the first puncture of the needle flinched so piteously that the captain was obliged to pause and to order him a powerful dose of alcohol this somewhat rallied up his spirit and warmed his heart all the time of the operation however he kept his eyes riveted on the wound with his teeth set and a whimsical wincing of the countenance that occasionally gave his nose something of its usual comic curl  when the wound was fairly closed the captain washed it with rum and administered a second dose of the same to the patient who was tucked in for the night and advised to compose himself to sleep he was restless and uneasy however repeatedly expressing his fears that his leg would be so much swollen the next day as to prevent his proceeding with the party nor could he be quieted until the captain gave a decided opinion favorable to his wishes  early the next morning a gleam of his merry humor returned on finding that his wounded limb retained its natural proportions on attempting to use it however he found himself unable to stand he made several efforts to coax himself into a belief that he might still continue forward but at length shook his head despondingly and said that as he had but one leg it was all in vain to attempt a passage of the mountain  every one grieved to part with so boon a companion and under such disastrous circumstances he was once more clothed and equipped each one making him some parting present he was then helped on a horse which captain bonneville presented to him and after many parting expressions of good will on both sides set off on his return to his old haunts doubtless to be once more plucked by his affectionate but needy cousins     36       the difficult mountaina smoke and consultationthe      captains speechan icy turnpikedanger of a false step      arrival on snake riverreturn toportneufmeeting of      comrades  continuing their journey up the course of the immahah the travellers found as they approached the headwaters the snow increased in quantity so as to lie two feet deep they were again obliged therefore to beat down a path for their horses sometimes travelling on the icy surface of the stream at length they reached the place where they intended to scale the mountains and having broken a pathway to the foot were agreeably surprised to find that the wind had drifted the snow from off the side so that they attained the summit with but little difficulty here they encamped with the intention of beating a track through the mountains a short experiment however obliged them to give up the attempt the snow lying in vast drifts often higher than the horses heads  captain bonneville now took the two indian guides and set out to reconnoitre the neighborhood observing a high peak which overtopped the rest he climbed it and discovered from the summit a pass about nine miles long but so heavily piled with snow that it seemed impracticable he now lit a pipe and sitting down with the two guides proceeded to hold a consultation after the indian mode for a long while they all smoked vigorously and in silence pondering over the subject matter before them at length a discussion commenced and the opinion in which the two guides concurred was that the horses could not possibly cross the snows they advised therefore that the party should proceed on foot and they should take the horses back to the village where they would be well taken care of until captain bonneville should send for them they urged this advice with great earnestness declaring that their chief would be extremely angry and treat them severely should any of the horses of his good friends the white men be lost in crossing under their guidance and that therefore it was good they should not attempt it  captain bonneville sat smoking his pipe and listening to them with indian silence and gravity when they had finished he replied to them in their own style of language  my friends said he i have seen the pass and have listened to your words you have little hearts when troubles and dangers lie in your way you turn your backs that is not the way with my nation when great obstacles present and threaten to keep them back their hearts swell and they push forward they love to conquer difficulties but enough for the present night is coming on let us return to our camp  he moved on and they followed in silence on reaching the camp he found the men extremely discouraged one of their number had been surveying the neighborhood and seriously assured them that the snow was at least a hundred feet deep the captain cheered them up and diffused fresh spirit in them by his example still he was much perplexed how to proceed about dark there was a slight drizzling rain an expedient now suggested itself this was to make two light sleds place the packs on them and drag them to the other side of the mountain thus forming a road in the wet snow which should it afterward freeze would be sufficiently hard to bear the horses this plan was promptly put into execution the sleds were constructed the heavy baggage was drawn backward and forward until the road was beaten when they desisted from their fatiguing labor the night turned out clear and cold and by morning their road was incrusted with ice sufficiently strong for their purpose they now set out on their icy turnpike and got on well enough excepting that now and then a horse would sidle out of the track and immediately sink up to the neck then came on toil and difficulty and they would be obliged to haul up the floundering animal with ropes one more unlucky than the rest after repeated falls had to be abandoned in the snow notwithstanding these repeated delays they succeeded before the sun had acquired sufficient power to thaw the snow in getting all the rest of their horses safely to the other side of the mountain  their difficulties and dangers however were not yet at an end they had now to descend and the whole surface of the snow was glazed with ice it was necessary therefore to wait until the warmth of the sun should melt the glassy crust of sleet and give them a foothold in the yielding snow they had a frightful warning of the danger of any movement while the sleet remained a wild young mare in her restlessness strayed to the edge of a declivity one slip was fatal to her she lost her balance careered with headlong velocity down the slippery side of the mountain for more than two thousand feet and was dashed to pieces at the bottom when the travellers afterward sought the carcass to cut it up for food they found it torn and mangled in the most horrible manner  it was quite late in the evening before the party descended to the ultimate skirts of the snow here they planted large logs below them to prevent their sliding down and encamped for the night the next day they succeeded in bringing down their baggage to the encampment then packing all up regularly and loading their horses they once more set out briskly and cheerfully and in the course of the following day succeeded in getting to a grassy region  here their nez perce guides declared that all the difficulties of the mountains were at an end and their course was plain and simple and needed no further guidance they asked leave therefore to return home this was readily granted with many thanks and presents for their faithful services they took a long farewell smoke with their white friends after which they mounted their horses and set off exchanging many farewells and kind wishes  on the following day captain bonneville completed his journey down the mountain and encamped on the borders of snake river where he found the grass in great abundance and eight inches in height in this neighborhood he saw on the rocky banks of the river several prismoids of basaltes rising to the height of fifty or sixty feet  nothing particularly worthy of note occurred during several days as the party proceeded up along snake river and across its tributary streams after crossing gun creek they met with various signs that white people were in the neighborhood and captain bonneville made earnest exertions to discover whether they were any of his own people that he might join them he soon ascertained that they had been starved out of this tract of country and had betaken themselves to the buffalo region whither he now shaped his course in proceeding along snake river he found small hordes of shoshonies lingering upon the minor streams and living upon trout and other fish which they catch in great numbers at this season in fishtraps the greater part of the tribe however had penetrated the mountains to hunt the elk deer and ahsahta or bighorn  on the 12th of may captain bonneville reached the portneuf river in the vicinity of which he had left the winter encampment of his company on the preceding christmas day he had then expected to be back by the beginning of march but circumstances had detained him upward of two months beyond the time and the winter encampment must long ere this have been broken up halting on the banks of the portneuf he dispatched scouts a few miles above to visit the old camping ground and search for signals of the party or of their whereabouts should they actually have abandoned the spot they returned without being able to ascertain anything  being now destitute of provisions the travellers found it necessary to make a short hunting excursion after buffalo they made caches therefore on an island in the river in which they deposited all their baggage and then set out on their expedition they were so fortunate as to kill a couple of fine bulls and cutting up the carcasses determined to husband this stock of provisions with the most miserly care lest they should again be obliged to venture into the open and dangerous hunting grounds returning to their island on the 18th of may they found that the wolves had been at the caches scratched up the contents and scattered them in every direction they now constructed a more secure one in which they deposited their heaviest articles and then descended snake river again and encamped just above the american falls here they proceeded to fortify themselves intending to remain here and give their horses an opportunity to recruit their strength with good pasturage until it should be time to set out for the annual rendezvous in bear river valley  on the first of june they descried four men on the other side of the river opposite to the camp and having attracted their attention by a discharge of rifles ascertained to their joy that they were some of their own people from these men captain bonneville learned that the whole party which he had left in the preceding month of december were encamped on blackfoot river a tributary of snake river not very far above the portneuf thither he proceeded with all possible dispatch and in a little while had the pleasure of finding himself once more surrounded by his people who greeted his return among them in the heartiest manner for his longprotracted absence had convinced them that he and his three companions had been cut off by some hostile tribe  the party had suffered much during his absence they had been pinched by famine and almost starved and had been forced to repair to the caches at salmon river here they fell in with the blackfeet bands and considered themselves fortunate in being able to retreat from the dangerous neighborhood without sustaining any loss  being thus reunited a general treat from captain bonneville to his men was a matter of course two days therefore were given up to such feasting and merriment as their means and situation afforded what was wanting in good cheer was made up in good will the free trappers in particular distinguished themselves on the occasion and the saturnalia was enjoyed with a hearty holiday spirit that smacked of the game flavor of the wilderness     37       departure for the rendezvousa war party of blackfeeta      mock bustlesham fires at nightwarlike precautions      dangers of a night attacka panic among horsescautious

broke up the encampment and set out with his motley crew of hired and free trappers halfbreeds indians and squaws for the main rendezvous in bear river valley directing his course up the blackfoot river he soon reached the hills among which it takes its rise here while on the march he descried from the brow of a hill a war party of about sixty blackfeet on the plain immediately below him his situation was perilous for the greater part of his people were dispersed in various directions still to betray hesitation or fear would be to discover his actual weakness and to invite attack he assumed instantly therefore a belligerent tone ordered the squaws to lead the horses to a small grove of ashen trees and unload and tie them and caused a great bustle to be made by his scanty handful the leaders riding hither and thither and vociferating with all their might as if a numerous force was getting under way for an attack  to keep up the deception as to his force he ordered at night a number of extra fires to be made in his camp and kept up a vigilant watch his men were all directed to keep themselves prepared for instant action in such cases the experienced trapper sleeps in his clothes with his rifle beside him the shotbelt and powderflask on the stock so that in case of alarm he can lay his hand upon the whole of his equipment at once and start up completely armed  captain bonneville was also especially careful to secure the horses and set a vigilant guard upon them for there lies the great object and principal danger of a night attack the grand move of the lurking savage is to cause a panic among the horses in such cases one horse frightens another until all are alarmed and struggle to break loose in camps where there are great numbers of indians with their horses a night alarm of the kind is tremendous the running of the horses that have broken loose the snorting stamping and rearing of those which remain fast the howling of dogs the yelling of indians the scampering of white men and red men with their guns the overturning of lodges and trampling of fires by the horses the flashes of the fires lighting up forms of men and steeds dashing through the gloom altogether make up one of the wildest scenes of confusion imaginable in this way sometimes all the horses of a camp amounting to several hundred will be frightened off in a single night  the night passed off without any disturbance but there was no likelihood that a war party of blackfeet once on the track of a camp where there was a chance for spoils would fail to hover round it the captain therefore continued to maintain the most vigilant precautions throwing out scouts in the advance and on every rising ground  in the course of the day he arrived at the plain of white clay already mentioned surrounded by the mineral springs called beer springs by the trappers here the men all halted to have a regale in a few moments every spring had its jovial knot of hard drinkers with tin cup in hand indulging in a mock carouse quaffing pledging toasting bandying jokes singing drinking songs and uttering peals of laughter until it seemed as if their imaginations had given potency to the beverage and cheated them into a fit of intoxication indeed in the excitement of the moment they were loud and extravagant in their commendations of the mountain tap elevating it above every beverage produced from hops or malt it was a singular and fantastic scene suited to a region where everything is strange and peculiarthese groups of trappers and hunters and indians with their wild costumes and wilder countenances their boisterous gayety and reckless air quaffing and making merry round these sparkling fountains while beside them lay their weep ons ready to be snatched up for instant service painters are fond of representing banditti at their rude and picturesque carousels but here were groups still more rude and picturesque and it needed but a sudden onset of blackfeet and a quick transition from a fantastic revel to a furious melee to have rendered this picture of a trappers life complete  the beer frolic however passed off without any untoward circumstance and unlike most drinking bouts left neither headache nor heartache behind captain bonneville now directed his course up along bear river amusing himself occasionally with hunting the buffalo with which the country was covered sometimes when he saw a huge bull taking his repose in a prairie he would steal along a ravine until close upon him then rouse him from his meditations with a pebble and take a shot at him as he started up such is the quickness with which this animal springs upon his legs that it is not easy to discover the muscular process by which it is effected the horse rises first upon his fore legs and the domestic cow upon her hinder limbs but the buffalo bounds at once from a couchant to an erect position with a celerity that baffles the eye though from his bulk and rolling gait he does not appear to run with much swiftness yet it takes a stanch horse to overtake him when at full speed on level ground and a buffalo cow is still fleeter in her motion  among the indians and halfbreeds of the party were several admirable horsemen and bold hunters who amused themselves with a grotesque kind of buffalo bait whenever they found a huge bull in the plains they prepared for their teasing and barbarous sport surrounding him on horseback they would discharge their arrows at him in quick succession goading him to make an attack which with a dexterous movement of the horse they would easily avoid in this way they hovered round him feathering him with arrows as he reared and plunged about until he was bristled all over like a porcupine when they perceived in him signs of exhaustion and he could no longer be provoked to make battle they would dismount from their horses approach him in the rear and seizing him by the tail jerk him from side to side and drag him backward until the frantic animal gathering fresh strength from fury would break from them and rush with flashing eyes and a hoarse bellowing upon any enemy in sight but in a little while his transient excitement at an end would pitch headlong on the ground and expire the arrows were then plucked forth the tongue cut out and preserved as a dainty and the carcass left a banquet for the wolves  pursuing his course up bear river captain bonneville arrived on the 13th of june at the little snake lake where he encamped for four or five days that he might examine its shores and outlets the latter he found extremely muddy and so surrounded by swamps and quagmires that he was obliged to construct canoes of rushes with which to explore them the mouths of all the streams which fall into this lake from the west are marshy and inconsiderable but on the east side there is a beautiful beach broken occasionally by high and isolated bluffs which advance upon the lake and heighten the character of the scenery the water is very shallow but abounds with trout and other small fish  having finished his survey of the lake captain bonneville proceeded on his journey until on the banks of the bear river some distance higher up he came upon the party which he had detached a year before to circumambulate the great salt lake and ascertain its extent and the nature of its shores they had been encamped here about twenty days and were greatly rejoiced at meeting once more with their comrades from whom they had so long been separated the first inquiry of captain bonneville was about the result of their journey and the information they had procured as to the great salt lake the object of his intense curiosity and ambition the substance of their report will be found in the following

their power and policyresources of the countrydesigns of      foreign nations  it was on the 24th of july in the preceding year 1833 that the brigade of forty men set out from green river valley to explore the great salt lake they were to make the complete circuit of it trapping on all the streams which should fall in their way and to keep journals and make charts calculated to impart a knowledge of the lake and the surrounding country all the resources of captain bonneville had been tasked to fit out this favorite expedition the country lying to the southwest of the mountains and ranging down to california was as yet almost unknown being out of the buffalo range it was untraversed by the trapper who preferred those parts of the wilderness where the roaming herds of that species of animal gave him comparatively an abundant and luxurious life still it was said the deer the elk and the bighorn were to be found there so that with a little diligence and economy there was no danger of lacking food as a precaution however the party halted on bear river and hunted for a few days until they had laid in a supply of dried buffalo meat and venison they then passed by the head waters of the cassie river and soon found themselves launched on an immense sandy desert southwardly on their left they beheld the great salt lake spread out like a sea but they found no stream running into it a desert extended around them and stretched to the southwest as far as the eye could reach rivalling the deserts of asia and africa in sterility there was neither tree nor herbage nor spring nor pool nor running stream nothing but parched wastes of sand where horse and rider were in danger of perishing  their sufferings at length became so great that they abandoned their intended course and made towards a range of snowy mountains brightening in the north where they hoped to find water after a time they came upon a small stream leading directly towards these mountains having quenched their burning thirst and refreshed themselves and their weary horses for a time they kept along this stream which gradually increased in size being fed by numerous brooks after approaching the mountains it took a sweep toward the southwest and the travellers still kept along it trapping beaver as they went on the flesh of which they subsisted for the present husbanding their dried meat for future necessities  the stream on which they had thus fallen is called by some mary river but is more generally known as ogdens river from mr peter ogden an enterprising and intrepid leader of the hudsons bay company who first explored it the wild and halfdesert region through which the travellers were passing is wandered over by hordes of shoshokoes or root diggers the forlorn branch of the snake tribe they are a shy people prone to keep aloof from the stranger the travellers frequently met with their trails and saw the smoke of their fires rising in various parts of the vast landscape so that they knew there were great numbers in the neighborhood but scarcely ever were any of them to be met with  after a time they began to have vexatious proofs that if the shoshokoes were quiet by day they were busy at night the camp was dogged by these eavesdroppers scarce a morning but various articles were missing yet nothing could be seen of the marauders what particularly exasperated the hunters was to have their traps stolen from the streams one morning a trapper of a violent and savage character discovering that his traps had been carried off in the night took a horrid oath to kill the first indian he should meet innocent or guilty as he was returning with his comrades to camp he beheld two unfortunate diggers seated on the river bank fishing advancing upon them he levelled his rifle shot one upon the spot and flung his bleeding body into the stream the other indian fled and was suffered to escape such is the indifference with which acts of violence are regarded in the wilderness and such the immunity an armed ruffian enjoys beyond the barriers of the laws that the only punishment this desperado met with was a rebuke from the leader of the party the trappers now left the scene of this infamous tragedy and kept on westward down the course of the river which wound along with a range of mountains on the right hand and a sandy but somewhat fertile plain on the left as they proceeded they beheld columns of smoke rising as before in various directions which their guilty consciences now converted into alarm signals to arouse the country and collect the scattered bands for vengeance  after a time the natives began to make their appearance and sometimes in considerable numbers but always pacific the trappers however suspected them of deeplaid plans to draw them into ambuscades to crowd into and get possession of their camp and various other crafty and daring conspiracies which it is probable never entered into the heads of the poor savages in fact they are a simple timid inoffensive race unpractised in warfare and scarce provided with any weapons excepting for the chase their lives are passed in the great sand plains and along the adjacent rivers they subsist sometimes on fish at other times on roots and the seeds of a plant called the catstail they are of the same kind of people that captain bonneville found upon snake river and whom he found so mild and inoffensive  the trappers however had persuaded themselves that they were making their way through a hostile country and that implacable foes hung round their camp or beset their path watching for an opportunity to surprise them at length one day they came to the banks of a stream emptying into ogdens river which they were obliged to ford here a great number of shoshokoes were posted on the opposite bank persuaded they were there with hostile intent they advanced upon them levelled their rifles and killed twenty five of them upon the spot the rest fled to a short distance then halted and turned about howling and whining like wolves and uttering the most piteous wailings the trappers chased them in every direction the poor wretches made no defence but fled with terror neither does it appear from the accounts of the boasted victors that a weapon had been wielded or a weapon launched by the indians throughout the affair we feel perfectly convinced that the poor savages had no hostile intention but had merely gathered together through motives of curiosity as others of their tribe had done when captain bonneville and his companions passed along snake river  the trappers continued down ogdens river until they ascertained that it lost itself in a great swampy lake to which there was no apparent discharge they then struck directly westward across the great chain of california mountains intervening between these interior plains and the shores of the pacific  for three and twenty days they were entangled among these mountains the peaks and ridges of which are in many places covered with perpetual snow their passes and defiles present the wildest scenery partaking of the sublime rather than the beautiful and abounding with frightful precipices the sufferings of the travellers among these savage mountains were extreme for a part of the time they were nearly starved at length they made their way through them and came down upon the plains of new california a fertile region extending along the coast with magnificent forests verdant savannas and prairies that looked like stately parks here they found deer and other game in abundance and indemnified themselves for past famine they now turned toward the south and passing numerous small bands of natives posted upon various streams arrived at the spanish village and post of monterey  this is a small place containing about two hundred houses situated in latitude 37 north it has a capacious bay with indifferent anchorage the surrounding country is extremely fertile especially in the valleys the soil is richer the further you penetrate into the interior and the climate is described as a perpetual spring indeed all california extending along the pacific ocean from latitude 19 30 to 42 north is represented as one of the most fertile and beautiful regions in north america  lower california in length about seven hundred miles forms a great peninsula which crosses the tropics and terminates in the torrid zone it is separated from the mainland by the gulf of california sometimes called the vermilion sea into this gulf empties the colorado of the west the seedskedee or green river as it is also sometimes called the peninsula is traversed by stern and barren mountains and has many sandy plains where the only sign of vegetation is the cylindrical cactus growing among the clefts of the rocks wherever there is water however and vegetable mould the ardent nature of the climate quickens everything into astonishing fertility there are valleys luxuriant with the rich and beautiful productions of the tropics there the sugarcane and indigo plant attain a perfection unequalled in any other part of north america there flourish the olive the fig the date the orange the citron the pomegranate and other fruits belonging to the voluptuous climates of the south with grapes in abundance that yield a generous wine in the interior are salt plains silver mines and scanty veins of gold are said likewise to exist and pearls of a beautiful water are to be fished upon the coast  the peninsula of california was settled in 1698 by the jesuits who certainly as far as the natives were concerned have generally proved the most beneficent of colonists in the present instance they gained and maintained a footing in the country without the aid of military force but solely by religious influence they formed a treaty and entered into the most amicable relations with the natives then numbering from twentyfive to thirty thousand souls and gained a hold upon their affections and a control over their minds that effected a complete change in their condition they built eleven missionary establishments in the various valleys of the peninsula which formed rallying places for the surrounding savages where they gathered together as sheep into the fold and surrendered themselves and their consciences into the hands of these spiritual pastors nothing we are told could exceed the implicit and affectionate devotion of the indian converts to the jesuit fathers and the catholic faith was disseminated widely through the wilderness the growing power and influence of the jesuits in the new world at length excited the jealousy of the spanish government and they were banished from the colonies the governor who arrived at california to expel them and to take charge of the country expected to find a rich and powerful fraternity with immense treasures hoarded in their missions and an army of indians ready to defend them on the contrary he beheld a few venerable silverhaired priests coming humbly forward to meet him followed by a throng of weeping but submissive natives the heart of the governor it is said was so touched by this unexpected sight that he shed tears but he had to execute his orders the jesuits were accompanied to the place of their embarkation by their simple and affectionate parishioners who took leave of them with tears and sobs many of the latter abandoned their hereditary abodes and wandered off to join their southern brethren so that but a remnant remained in the peninsula the franciscans immediately succeeded the jesuits and subsequently the dominicans but the latter managed their affairs ill but two of the missionary establishments are at present occupied by priests the rest are all in ruins excepting one which remains a monument of the former power and prosperity of the order this is a noble edifice once the seat of the chief of the resident jesuits it is situated in a beautiful valley about half way between the gulf of california and the broad ocean the peninsula being here about sixty miles wide the edifice is of hewn stone one story high two hundred and ten feet in front and about fiftyfive feet deep the walls are six feet thick and sixteen feet high with a vaulted roof of stone about two feet and a half in thickness it is now abandoned and desolate the beautiful valley is without an inhabitantnot a human being resides within thirty miles of the place  in approaching this deserted missionhouse from the south the traveller passes over the mountain of san juan supposed to be the highest peak in the californias from this lofty eminence a vast and magnificent prospect unfolds itself the great gulf of california with the dark blue sea beyond studded with islands and in another direction the immense lava plain of san gabriel the splendor of the climate gives an italian effect to the immense prospect the sky is of a deep blue color and the sunsets are often magnificent beyond description such is a slight and imperfect sketch of this remarkable peninsula  upper california extends from latitude 31 10 to 42 on the pacific and inland to the great chain of snowcapped mountains which divide it from the sand plains of the interior there are about twentyone missions in this province most of which were established about fifty years since and are generally under the care of the franciscans these exert a protecting sway over about thirtyfive thousand indian converts who reside on the lands around the mission houses each of these houses has fifteen miles square of land allotted to it subdivided into small lots proportioned to the number of indian converts attached to the mission some are enclosed with high walls but in general they are open hamlets composed of rows of huts built of sunburnt bricks in some instances whitewashed and roofed with tiles many of them are far in the interior beyond the reach of all military protection and dependent entirely on the good will of the natives which never fails them they have made considerable progress in teaching the indians the useful arts there are native tanners shoemakers weavers blacksmiths stonecutters and other artificers attached to each establishment others are taught husbandry and the rearing of cattle and horses while the females card and spin wool weave and perform the other duties allotted to their sex in civilized life no social intercourse is allowed between the unmarried of the opposite sexes after working hours and at night they are locked up in separate apartments and the keys delivered to the priests  the produce of the lands and all the profits arising from sales are entirely at the disposal of the priests whatever is not required for the support of the missions goes to augment a fund which is under their control hides and tallow constitute the principal riches of the missions and indeed the main commerce of the country grain might be produced to an unlimited extent at the establishments were there a sufficient market for it olives and grapes are also reared at the missions  horses and horned cattle abound throughout all this region the former may be purchased at from three to five dollars but they are of an inferior breed mules which are here of a large size and of valuable qualities cost from seven to ten dollars  there are several excellent ports along this coast san diego san barbara monterey the bay of san francisco and the northern port of bondago all afford anchorage for ships of the largest class the port of san francisco is too well known to require much notice in this place the entrance from the sea is sixtyseven fathoms deep and within whole navies might ride with perfect safety two large rivers which take their rise in mountains two or three hundred miles to the east and run through a country unsurpassed for soil and climate empty themselves into the harbor the country around affords admirable timber for shipbuilding in a word this favored port combines advantages which not only fit it for a grand naval depot but almost render it capable of being made the dominant military post of these seas  such is a feeble outline of the californian coast and country the value of which is more and more attracting the attention of naval powers the russians have always a ship of war upon this station and have already encroached upon the californian boundaries by taking possession of the port of bondago and fortifying it with several guns recent surveys have likewise been made both by the russians and the english and we have little doubt that at no very distant day this neglected and until recently almost unknown region will be found to possess sources of wealth sufficient to sustain a powerful and prosperous empire its inhabitants themselves are but little aware of its real riches they have not enterprise sufficient to acquaint themselves with a vast interior that lies almost a terra incognita nor have they the skill and industry to cultivate properly the fertile tracts along the coast nor to prosecute that foreign commerce which brings all the resources of a country into profitable action     39       gay

halfbreeds of california spend the greater part of their time in the saddle they are fearless riders and their daring feats upon unbroken colts and wild horses astonished our trappers though accustomed to the bold riders of the prairies  a mexican horseman has much resemblance in many points to the equestrians of old spain and especially to the vainglorious caballero of andalusia a mexican dragoon for instance is represented as arrayed in a round blue jacket with red cuffs and collar blue velvet breeches unbuttoned at the knees to show his white stockings bottinas of deer skin a roundcrowned andalusian hat and his hair cued on the pommel of his saddle he carries balanced a long musket with fox skin round the lock he is cased in a cuirass of doublefold deer skin and carries a bulls hide shield he is forked in a moorish saddle high before and behind his feet are thrust into wooden box stirrups of moorish fashion and a tremendous pair of iron spurs fastened by chains jingle at his heels thus equipped and suitably mounted he considers himself the glory of california and the terror of the universe  the californian horsemen seldom ride out without the laso sic that is to say a long coil of cord with a slip noose with which they are expert almost to a miracle the laso now almost entirely confined to spanish america is said to be of great antiquity and to have come originally from the east it was used we are told by a pastoral people of persian descent of whom eight thousand accompanied the army of xerxes by the spanish americans it is used for a variety of purposes and among others for hauling wood without dismounting they cast the noose around a log and thus drag it to their houses the vaqueros or indian cattle drivers have also learned the use of the laso from the spaniards and employ it to catch the halfwild cattle by throwing it round their horns  the laso is also of great use in furnishing the public with a favorite though barbarous sport the combat between a bear and a wild bull for this purpose three or four horsemen sally forth to some wood frequented by bears and depositing the carcass of a bullock hide themselves in the vicinity the bears are soon attracted by the bait as soon as one fit for their purpose makes his appearance they run out and with the laso dexterously noose him by either leg after dragging him at full speed until he is fatigued they secure him more effectually and tying him on the carcass of the bullock draw him in triumph to the scene of action by this time he is exasperated to such frenzy that they are sometimes obliged to throw cold water on him to moderate his fury and dangerous would it be for horse and rider were he while in this paroxysm to break his bonds  a wild bull of the fiercest kind which has been caught and exasperated in the same manner is now produced and both animals are turned loose in the arena of a small amphitheatre the mortal fight begins instantly and always at first to the disadvantage of bruin fatigued as he is by his previous rough riding roused at length by the repeated goring of the bull he seizes his muzzle with his sharp claws and clinging to this most sensitive part causes him to bellow with rage and agony in his heat and fury the bull lolls out his tongue this is instantly clutched by the bear with a desperate effort he overturns his huge antagonist and then dispatches him without difficulty  beside this diversion the travellers were likewise regaled with bullfights in the genuine style of old spain the californians being considered the best bullfighters in the mexican dominions  after a considerable sojourn at monterey spent in these very edifying but not very profitable amusements the leader of this vagabond party set out with his comrades on his return journey instead of retracing their steps through the mountains they passed round their southern extremity and crossing a range of low hills found themselves in the sandy plains south of ogdens river in traversing which they again suffered grievously for want of water  in the course of their journey they encountered a party of mexicans in pursuit of a gang of natives who had been stealing horses the savages of this part of california are represented as extremely poor and armed only with stonepointed arrows it being the wise policy of the spaniards not to furnish them with firearms as they find it difficult with their blunt shafts to kill the wild game of the mountains they occasionally supply themselves with food by entrapping the spanish horses driving them stealthily into fastnesses and ravines they slaughter them without difficulty and dry their flesh for provisions some they carry off to trade with distant tribes and in this way the spanish horses pass from hand to hand among the indians until they even find their way across the rocky mountains  the mexicans are continually on the alert to intercept these marauders but the indians are apt to outwit them and force them to make long and wild expeditions in pursuit of their stolen horses  two of the mexican party just mentioned joined the band of trappers and proved themselves worthy companions in the course of their journey through the country frequented by the poor root diggers there seems to have been an emulation between them which could inflict the greatest outrages upon the natives the trappers still considered them in the light of dangerous foes and the mexicans very probably charged them with the sin of horsestealing we have no other mode of accounting for the infamous barbarities of which according to their own story they were guilty hunting the poor indians like wild beasts and killing them without mercy the mexicans excelled at this savage sport chasing their unfortunate victims at full speed noosing them round the neck with their lasos and then dragging them to death  such are the scanty details of this most disgraceful expedition at least such are all that captain bonneville had the patience to collect for he was so deeply grieved by the failure of his plans and so indignant at the atrocities related to him that he turned with disgust and horror from the narrators had he exerted a little of the lynch law of the wilderness and hanged those dexterous horsemen in their own lasos it would but have been a wellmerited and salutary act of retributive justice the failure of this expedition was a blow to his pride and a still greater blow to his purse the great salt lake still remained unexplored at the same time the means which had been furnished so liberally to fit out this favorite expedition had all been squandered at monterey and the peltries also which had been collected on the way he would have but scanty returns therefore to make this year to his associates in the united states and there was great danger of their becoming disheartened and abandoning the enterprise     40       travellers talesindian lurkersprognostics of

newlevied band  the horror and indignation felt by captain bonneville at the excesses of the californian adventurers were not participated by his men on the contrary the events of that expedition were favorite themes in the camp the heroes of monterey bore the palm in all the gossipings among the hunters their glowing descriptions of spanish bearbaits and bullfights especially were listened to with intense delight and had another expedition to california been proposed the difficulty would have been to restrain a general eagerness to volunteer  the captain had not long been at the rendezvous when he perceived by various signs that indians were lurking in the neighborhood it was evident that the blackfoot band which he had seen when on his march had dogged his party and were intent on mischief he endeavored to keep his camp on the alert but it is as difficult to maintain discipline among trappers at a rendezvous as among sailors when in port  buckeye the delaware indian was scandalized at this heedlessness of the hunters when an enemy was at hand and was continually preaching up caution he was a little prone to play the prophet and to deal in signs and portents which occasionally excited the merriment of his white comrades he was a great dreamer and believed in charms and talismans or medicines and could foretell the approach of strangers by the howling or barking of the small prairie wolf this animal being driven by the larger wolves from the carcasses left on the hunting grounds by the hunters follows the trail of the fresh meat carried to the camp here the smell of the roast and broiled mingling with every breeze keeps them hovering about the neighborhood scenting every blast turning up their noses like hungry hounds and testifying their pinching hunger by long whining howls and impatient barkings these are interpreted by the superstitious indians into warnings that strangers are at hand and one accidental coincidence like the chance fulfillment of an almanac prediction is sufficient to cover a thousand failures this little whining feastsmelling animal is therefore called among indians the medicine wolf and such was one of buckeyes infallible oracles  one morning early the soothsaying delaware appeared with a gloomy countenance his mind was full of dismal presentiments whether from mysterious dreams or the intimations of the medicine wolf does not appear danger he said was lurking in their path and there would be some fighting before sunset he was bantered for his prophecy which was attributed to his having supped too heartily and been visited by bad dreams in the course of the morning a party of hunters set out in pursuit of buffaloes taking with them a mule to bring home the meat they should procure they had been some few hours absent when they came clattering at full speed into camp giving the war cry of blackfeet blackfeet every one seized his weapon and ran to learn the cause of the alarm it appeared that the hunters as they were returning leisurely leading their mule well laden with prime pieces of buffalo meat passed close by a small stream overhung with trees about two miles from the camp suddenly a party of blackfeet who lay in ambush along the thickets sprang up with a fearful yell and discharged a volley at the hunters the latter immediately threw themselves flat on their horses put them to their speed and never paused to look behind until they found themselves in camp fortunately they had escaped without a wound but the mule with all the provant had fallen into the hands of the enemy this was a loss as well as an insult not to be borne every man sprang to horse and with rifle in hand galloped off to punish the blackfeet and rescue the buffalo beef they came too late the marauders were off and all that they found of their mule was the dents of his hoofs as he had been conveyed off at a round trot bearing his savory cargo to the hills to furnish the scampering savages with a banquet of roast meat at the expense of the white men  the party returned to camp balked of their revenge but still more grievously balked of their supper buckeye the delaware sat smoking by his fire perfectly composed as the hunters related the particulars of the attack he listened in silence with unruffled countenance then pointing to the west the sun has not yet set said he buckeye did not dream like a fool  all present now recollected the prediction of the indian at daybreak and were struck with what appeared to be its fulfilment they called to mind also a long catalogue of foregone presentiments and predictions made at various times by the delaware and in their superstitious credulity began to consider him a veritable seer without thinking how natural it was to predict danger and how likely to have the prediction verified in the present instance when various signs gave evidence of a lurking foe  the various bands of captain bonnevilles company had now been assembled for some time at the rendezvous they had had their fill of feasting and frolicking and all the species of wild and often uncouth merrymaking which invariably take place on these occasions their horses as well as themselves had recovered from past famine and fatigue and were again fit for active service and an impatience began to manifest itself among the men once more to take the field and set off on some wandering expedition  at this juncture m cerre arrived at the rendezvous at the head of a supply party bringing goods and equipments from the states this active leader it will be recollected had embarked the year previously in skinboats on the bighorn freighted with the years collection of peltries he had met with misfortune in the course of his voyage one of his frail barks being upset and part of the furs lost or damaged  the arrival of the supplies gave the regular finish to the annual revel a grand outbreak of wild debauch ensued among the mountaineers drinking dancing swaggering gambling quarrelling and fighting alcohol which from its portable qualities containing the greatest quantity of fiery spirit in the smallest compass is the only liquor carried across the mountains is the inflammatory beverage at these carousals and is dealt out to the trappers at four dollars a pint when inflamed by this fiery beverage they cut all kinds of mad pranks and gambols and sometimes burn all their clothes in their drunken bravadoes a camp recovering from one of these riotous revels presents a seriocomic spectacle black eyes broken heads lacklustre visages many of the trappers have squandered in one drunken frolic the hardearned wages of a year some have run in debt and must toil on to pay for past pleasure all are sated with this deep draught of pleasure and eager to commence another trapping campaign for hardship and hard work spiced with the stimulants of wild adventures and topped off with an annual frantic carousal is the lot of the restless trapper  the captain now made his arrangements for the current year cerre and walker with a number of men who had been to california were to proceed to st louis with the packages of furs collected during the past year another party headed by a leader named montero was to proceed to the crow country trap upon its various streams and among the black hills and thence to proceed to the arkansas where he was to go into winter quarters  the captain marked out for himself a widely different course he intended to make another expedition with twentythree men to the lower part of the columbia river and to proceed to the valley of the multnomah after wintering in those parts and establishing a trade with those tribes among whom he had sojourned on his first visit he would return in the spring cross the rocky mountains and join montero and his party in the month of july at the rendezvous of the arkansas where he expected to receive his annual supplies from the states  if the reader will cast his eye upon a map he may form an idea of the contempt for distance which a man acquires in this vast wilderness by noticing the extent of country comprised in these projected wanderings just as the different parties were about to set out on the 3d of july on their opposite routes captain bonneville received intelligence that wyeth the indefatigable leader of the salmonfishing enterprise who had parted with him about a year previously on the banks of the bighorn to descend that wild river in a bull boat was near at hand with a new levied band of hunters and trappers and was on his way once more to the banks of the columbia  as we take much interest in the novel enterprise of this eastern man and are pleased with his pushing and persevering spirit and as his movements are characteristic of life in the wilderness we will with the readers permission while captain bonneville is breaking up his camp and saddling his horses step back a year in time and a few hundred miles in distance to the bank of the bighorn and launch ourselves with wyeth in his bull boat and though his adventurous voyage will take us many hundreds of miles further down wild and wandering rivers yet such is the magic power of the pen that we promise to bring the reader safe to bear river valley by the time the last horse is saddled     41       a voyage in a bull boat  it was about the middle of august 1833 that mr nathaniel j wyeth as the reader may recollect launched his bull boat at the foot of the rapids of the bighorn and departed in advance of the parties of campbell and captain bonneville his boat was made of three buffalo skins stretched on a light frame stitched together and the seams paid with elk tallow and ashes it was eighteen feet long and about five feet six inches wide sharp at each end with a round bottom and drew about a foot and a half of watera depth too great for these upper rivers which abound with shallows and sandbars the crew consisted of two halfbreeds who claimed to be white men though a mixture of the french creole and the shawnee and potawattomie they claimed moreover to be thorough mountaineers and firstrate huntersthe common boast of these vagabonds of the wilderness besides these there was a nez perce lad of eighteen years of age a kind of servant of all work whose great aim like all indian servants was to do as little work as possible there was moreover a halfbreed boy of thirteen named baptiste son of a hudsons bay trader by a flathead beauty who was travelling with wyeth to see the world and complete his education add to these mr milton sublette who went as passenger and we have the crew of the little bull boat complete  it certainly was a slight armament with which to run the gauntlet through countries swarming with hostile hordes and a slight bark to navigate these endless rivers tossing and pitching down rapids running on snags and bumping on sandbars such however are the cockleshells with which these hardy rovers of the wilderness will attempt the wildest streams and it is surprising what rough shocks and thumps these boats will endure and what vicissitudes they will live through their duration however is but limited they require frequently to be hauled out of the water and dried to prevent the hides from becoming watersoaked and they eventually rot and go to pieces  the course of the river was a little to the north of east it ran about five miles an hour over a gravelly bottom the banks were generally alluvial and thickly grown with cottonwood trees intermingled occasionally with ash and plum trees now and then limestone cliffs and promontories advanced upon the river making picturesque headlands beyond the woody borders rose ranges of naked hills  milton sublette was the pelorus of this adventurous bark being somewhat experienced in this wild kind of navigation it required all his attention and skill however to pilot her clear of sandbars and snags of sunken trees there was often too a perplexity of choice where the river branched into various channels among clusters of islands and occasionally the voyagers found themselves aground and had to turn back  it was necessary also to keep a wary eye upon the land for they were passing through the heart of the crow country and were continually in reach of any ambush that might be lurking on shore the most formidable foes that they saw however were three grizzly bears quietly promenading along the bank who seemed to gaze at them with surprise as they glided by herds of buffalo also were moving about or lying on the ground like cattle in a pasture excepting such inhabitants as these a perfect solitude reigned over the land there was no sign of human habitation for the crows as we have already shown are a wandering people a race of hunters and warriors who live in tents and on horseback and are continually on the move at night they landed hauled up their boat to dry pitched their tent and made a rousing fire then as it was the first evening of their voyage they indulged in a regale relishing their buffalo beef with inspiring alcohol after which they slept soundly without dreaming of crows or blackfeet early in the morning they again launched the boat and committed themselves to the stream  in this way they voyaged for two days without any material occurrence excepting a severe thunder storm which compelled them to put to shore and wait until it was passed on the third morning they descried some persons at a distance on the river bank as they were now by calculation at no great distance from fort cass a trading post of the american fur company they supposed these might be some of its people a nearer approach showed them to be indians descrying a woman apart from the rest they landed and accosted her she informed them that the main force of the crow nation consisting of five bands under their several chiefs were but about two or three miles below on their way up along the river this was unpleasant tidings but to retreat was impossible and the river afforded no hiding place they continued forward therefore trusting that as fort cass was so near at hand the crows might refrain from any depredations  floating down about two miles further they came in sight of the first band scattered along the river bank all well mounted some armed with guns others with bows and arrows and a few with lances they made a wildly picturesque appearance managing their horses with their accustomed dexterity and grace nothing can be more spirited than a band of crow cavaliers they are a fine race of men averaging six feet in height lithe and active with hawks eyes and roman noses the latter feature is common to the indians on the east side of the rocky mountains those on the western side have generally straight or flat noses  wyeth would fain have slipped by this cavalcade unnoticed but the river at this place was not more than ninety yards across he was perceived therefore and hailed by the vagabond warriors and we presume in no very choice language for among their other accomplishments the crows are famed for possessing a billingsgate vocabulary of unrivalled opulence and for being by no means sparing of it whenever an occasion offers indeed though indians are generally very lofty rhetorical and figurative in their language at all great talks and high ceremonials yet if trappers and traders may be believed they are the most unsavory vagabonds in their ordinary colloquies they make no hesitation to call a spade a spade and when they once undertake to call hard names the famous pot and kettle of vituperating memory are not to be compared with them for scurrility of epithet  to escape the infliction of any compliments of this kind or the launching peradventure of more dangerous missiles wyeth landed with the best grace in his power and approached the chief of the band it was arapooish the quondam friend of rose the outlaw and one whom we have already mentioned as being anxious to promote a friendly intercourse between his tribe and the white men he was a tall stout man of good presence and received the voyagers very graciously his people too thronged around them and were officiously attentive after the crow fashion one took a great fancy to baptiste the flathead boy and a still greater fancy to a ring on his finger which he transposed to his own with surprising dexterity and then disappeared with a quick step among the crowd  another was no less pleased with the nez perce lad and nothing would do but he must exchange knives with him drawing a new knife out of the nez perces scabbard and putting an old one in its place another stepped up and replaced this old knife with one still older and a third helped himself to knife scabbard and all it was with much difficulty that wyeth and his companions extricated themselves from the clutches of these officious crows before they were entirely plucked  falling down the river a little further they came in sight of the second band and sheered to the opposite side with the intention of passing them the crows were not to be evaded some pointed their guns at the boat and threatened to fire others stripped plunged into the stream and came swimming across making a virtue of necessity wyeth threw a cord to the first that came within reach as if he wished to be drawn to the shore  in this way he was overhauled by every band and by the time he and his people came out of the busy hands of the last they were eased of most of their superfluities nothing in all probability but the proximity of the american trading post kept these land pirates from making a good prize of the bull boat and all its contents  these bands were in full march equipped for war and evidently full of mischief they were in fact the very bands that overran the land in the autumn of 1833 partly robbed fitzpatrick of his horses and effects hunted and harassed captain bonneville and his people broke up their trapping campaigns and in a word drove them all out of the crow country it has been suspected that they were set on to these pranks by some of the american fur company anxious to defeat the plans of their rivals of the rocky mountain company for at this time their competition was at its height and the trade of the crow country was a great object of rivalry what makes this the more probable is that the crows in their depredation seemed by no means bloodthirsty but intent chiefly on robbing the parties of their traps and horses thereby disabling them from prosecuting their hunting  we should observe that this year the rocky mountain company were pushing their way up the rivers and establishing rival posts near those of the american company and that at the very time of which we are speaking captain sublette was ascending the yellowstone with a keel boat laden with supplies so that there was every prospect of this eager rivalship being carried to extremes  the last band of crow warriors had scarcely disappeared in the clouds of dust they had raised when our voyagers arrived at the mouth of the river and glided into the current of the yellowstone turning down this stream they made for fort cass which is situated on the right bank about three miles below the bighorn on the opposite side they beheld a party of thirtyone savages which they soon ascertained to be blackfeet the width of the river enabled them to keep at a sufficient distance and they soon landed at fort cass this was a mere fortification against indians being a stockade of about one hundred and thirty feet square with two bastions at the extreme corners mtulloch an agent of the american company was stationed there with twenty men two boats of fifteen tons burden were lying here but at certain seasons of the year a steamboat can come up to the fort  they had scarcely arrived when the blackfeet warriors made their appearance on the opposite bank displaying two american flags in token of amity they plunged into the river swam across and were kindly received at the fort they were some of the very men who had been engaged the year previously in the battle at pierres hole and a fiercelooking set of fellows they were tall and hawknosed and very much resembling the crows they professed to be on an amicable errand to make peace with the crows and set off in all haste before night to overtake them wyeth predicted that they would lose their scalps for he had heard the crows denounce vengeance on them for having murdered two of their warriors who had ventured among them on the faith of a treaty of peace it is probable however that this pacific errand was all a pretence and that the real object of the blackfeet braves was to hang about the skirts of the crow band steal their horses and take the scalps of stragglers  at fort cass mr wyeth disposed of some packages of beaver and a quantity of buffalo robes on the following morning august 18th he once more launched his bull boat and proceeded down the yellowstone which inclined in an eastnortheast direction the river had alluvial bottoms fringed with great quantities of the sweet cottonwood and interrupted occasionally by bluffs of sandstone the current occasionally brings down fragments of granite and porphyry  in the course of the day they saw something moving on the bank among the trees which they mistook for game of some kind and being in want of provisions pulled toward shore they discovered just in time a party of blackfeet lurking in the thickets and sheered with all speed to the opposite side of the river  after a time they came in sight of a gang of elk wyeth was immediately for pursuing them rifle in hand but saw evident signs of dissatisfaction in his halfbreed hunters who considered him as trenching upon their province and meddling with things quite above his capacity for these veterans of the wilderness are exceedingly pragmatical on points of venery and woodcraft and tenacious of their superiority looking down with infinite contempt upon all raw beginners the two worthies therefore sallied forth themselves but after a time returned emptyhanded they laid the blame however entirely on their guns two miserable old pieces with flint locks which with all their picking and hammering were continually apt to miss fire these great boasters of the wilderness however are very often exceeding bad shots and fortunate it is for them when they have old flint guns to bear the blame  the next day they passed where a great herd of buffalo was bellowing on a prairie again the castor and pollux of the wilderness sallied forth and again their flint guns were at fault and missed fire and nothing went off but the buffalo wyeth now found there was danger of losing his dinner if he depended upon his hunters he took rifle in hand therefore and went forth himself in the course of an hour he returned laden with buffalo meat to the great mortification of the two regular hunters who were annoyed at being eclipsed by a greenhorn  all hands now set to work to prepare the midday repast a fire was made under an immense cottonwood tree that overshadowed a beautiful piece of meadow land rich morsels of buffalo hump were soon roasting before it in a hearty and prolonged repast the two unsuccessful hunters gradually recovered from their mortification threatened to discard their old flint guns as soon as they should reach the settlements and boasted more than ever of the wonderful shots they had made when they had guns that never missed fire  having hauled up their boat to dry in the sun previous to making their repast the voyagers now set it once more afloat and proceeded on their way they had constructed a sail out of their old tent which they hoisted whenever the wind was favorable and thus skimmed along down the stream their voyage was pleasant notwithstanding the perils by sea and land with which they were environed whenever they could they encamped on islands for the greater security if on the mainland and in a dangerous neighborhood they would shift their camp after dark leaving their fire burning dropping down the river some distance and making no fire at their second encampment sometimes they would float all night with the current one keeping watch and steering while the rest slept in such case they would haul their boat on shore at noon of the following day to dry for notwithstanding every precaution she was gradually getting watersoaked and rotten  there was something pleasingly solemn and mysterious in thus floating down these wild rivers at night the purity of the atmosphere in these elevated regions gave additional splendor to the stars and heightened the magnificence of the firmament the occasional rush and laving of the waters the vague sounds from the surrounding wilderness the dreary howl or rather whine of wolves from the plains the low grunting and bellowing of the buffalo and the shrill neighing of the elk struck the ear with an effect unknown in the daytime  the two knowing hunters had scarcely recovered from one mortification when they were fated to experience another as the boat was gliding swiftly round a low promontory thinly covered with trees one of them gave the alarm of indians the boat was instantly shoved from shore and every one caught up his rifle where are they cried wyeth  therethere riding on horseback cried one of the hunters  yes with white scarfs on cried the other  wyeth looked in the direction they pointed but descried nothing but two bald eagles perched on a low dry branch beyond the thickets and seeming from the rapid motion of the boat to be moving swiftly in an opposite direction the detection of this blunder in the two veterans who prided themselves on the sureness and quickness of their sight produced a hearty laugh at their expense and put an end to their vauntings  the yellowstone above the confluence of the bighorn is a clear stream its waters were now gradually growing turbid and assuming the yellow clay color of the missouri the current was about four miles an hour with occasional rapids some of them dangerous but the voyagers passed them all without accident the banks of the river were in many places precipitous with strata of bituminous coal they now entered a region abounding with buffalothat everjourneying animal which moves in countless droves from point to point of the vast wilderness traversing plains pouring through the intricate defiles of mountains swimming rivers ever on the move guided on its boundless migrations by some traditionary knowledge like the finny tribes of the ocean which at certain seasons find their mysterious paths across the deep and revisit the remotest shores  these great migratory herds of buffalo have their hereditary paths and highways worn deep through the country and making for the surest passes of the mountains and the most practicable fords of the rivers when once a great column is in full career it goes straight forward regardless of all obstacles those in front being impelled by the moving mass behind at such times they will break through a camp trampling down everything in their course  it was the lot of the voyagers one night to encamp at one of these buffalo landing places and exactly on the trail they had not been long asleep when they were awakened by a great bellowing and tramping and the rush and splash and snorting of animals in the river they had just time to ascertain that a buffalo army was entering the river on the opposite side and making toward the landing place with all haste they moved their boat and shifted their camp by which time the head of the column had reached the shore and came pressing up the bank  it was a singular spectacle by the uncertain moonlight to behold this countless throng making their way across the river blowing and bellowing and splashing sometimes they pass in such dense and continuous column as to form a temporary dam across the river the waters of which rise and rush over their backs or between their squadrons the roaring and rushing sound of one of these vast herds crossing a river may sometimes in a still night be heard for miles  the voyagers now had game in profusion they could kill as many buffaloes as they pleased and occasionally were wanton in their havoc especially among scattered herds that came swimming near the boat on one occasion an old buffalo bull approached so near that the halfbreeds must fain try to noose him as they would a wild horse the noose was successfully thrown around his head and secured him by the horns and they now promised themselves ample sport the buffalo made prodigious turmoil in the water bellowing and blowing and floundering and they all floated down the stream together at length he found foothold on a sandbar and taking to his heels whirled the boat after him like a whale when harpooned so that the hunters were obliged to cast off their rope with which strange headgear the venerable bull made off to the prairies  on the 24th of august the bull boat emerged with its adventurous crew into the broad bosom of the mighty missouri here about six miles above the mouth of the yellowstone the voyagers landed at fort union the distributing post of the american fur company in the western country it was a stockaded fortress about two hundred and twenty feet square pleasantly situated on a high bank here they were hospitably entertained by mr mkenzie the superintendent and remained with him three days enjoying the unusual luxuries of bread butter milk and cheese for the fort was well supplied with domestic cattle though it had no garden the atmosphere of these elevated regions is said to be too dry for the culture of vegetables yet the voyagers in coming down the yellowstone had met with plums grapes cherries and currants and had observed ash and elm trees where these grow the climate cannot be incompatible with gardening  at fort union wyeth met with a melancholy memento of one of his men this was a powderflask which a clerk had purchased from a blackfoot warrior it bore the initials of poor more the unfortunate youth murdered the year previously at jacksons hole by the blackfeet and whose bones had been subsequently found by captain bonneville this flask had either been passed from hand to hand of the youth or perhaps had been brought to the fort by the very savage who slew him  as the bull boat was now nearly worn out and altogether unfit for the broader and more turbulent stream of the missouri it was given up and a canoe of cottonwood about twenty feet long fabricated by the blackfeet was purchased to supply its place in this wyeth hoisted his sail and bidding adieu to the hospitable superintendent of fort union turned his prow to the east and set off down the missouri  he had not proceeded many hours before in the evening he came to a large keel boat at anchor it proved to be the boat of captain william sublette freighted with munitions for carrying on a powerful opposition to the american fur company the voyagers went on board where they were treated with the hearty hospitality of the wilderness and passed a social evening talking over past scenes and adventures and especially the memorable fight at pierres hole  here milton sublette determined to give up further voyaging in the canoe and remain with his brother accordingly in the morning the fellowvoyagers took kind leave of each other and wyeth continued on his course there was now no one on board of his boat that had ever voyaged on the missouri it was however all plain sailing down the stream without any chance of missing the way  all day the voyagers pulled gently along and landed in the evening and supped then reembarking they suffered the canoe to float down with the current taking turns to watch and sleep the night was calm and serene the elk kept up a continual whinnying or squealing being the commencement of the season when they are in heat in the midst of the night the canoe struck on a sandbar and all hands were roused by the rush and roar of the wild waters which broke around her they were all obliged to jump overboard and work hard to get her off which was accomplished with much difficulty  in the course of the following day they saw three grizzly bears at different times along the bank the last one was on a point of land and was evidently making for the river to swim across the two halfbreed hunters were now eager to repeat the manoeuvre of the noose promising to entrap bruin and have rare sport in strangling and drowning him their only fear was that he might take fright and return to land before they could get between him and the shore holding back therefore until he was fairly committed in the centre of the stream they then pulled forward with might and main so as to cut off his retreat and take him in the rear one of the worthies stationed himself in the bow with the cord and slipnoose the other with the nez perce managed the paddles there was nothing further from the thoughts of honest bruin however than to beat a retreat just as the canoe was drawing near he turned suddenly round and made for it with a horrible snarl and a tremendous show of teeth the affrighted hunter called to his comrades to paddle off scarce had they turned the boat when the bear laid his enormous claws on the gunwale and attempted to get on board the canoe was nearly overturned and a deluge of water came pouring over the gunwale all was clamor terror and confusion every one bawled outthe bear roared and snarledone caught up a gun but water had rendered it useless others handled their paddles more effectually and beating old bruin about the head and claws obliged him to relinquish his hold they now plied their paddles with might and main the bear made the best of his way to shore and so ended the second exploit of the noose the hunters determined to have no more naval contests with grizzly bears  the voyagers were now out of range of crows and blackfeet but they were approaching the country of the rees or arickaras a tribe no less dangerous and who were generally hostile to small parties  in passing through their country wyeth laid by all day and drifted quietly down the river at night in this way he passed on until he supposed himself safely through the region of danger when he resumed his voyage in the open day on the 3d of september he had landed at midday to dine and while some were making a fire one of the hunters mounted a high bank to look out for game he had scarce glanced his eye round when he perceived horses grazing on the opposite side of the river crouching down he slunk back to the camp and reported what he had seen on further reconnoitering the voyagers counted twentyone lodges and from the number of horses computed that there must be nearly a hundred indians encamped there they now drew their boat with all speed and caution into a thicket of water willows and remained closely concealed all day as soon as the night closed in they reembarked the moon would rise early so that they had but about two hours of darkness to get past the camp the night however was cloudy with a blustering wind silently and with muffled oars they glided down the river keeping close under the shore opposite to the camp watching its various lodges and fires and the dark forms passing to and fro between them suddenly on turning a point of land they found themselves close upon a camp on their own side of the river it appeared that not more than one half of the band had crossed they were within a few yards of the shore they saw distinctly the savagessome standing some lying round the fire horses were grazing around some lodges were set up others had been sent across the river the red glare of the fires upon these wild groups and harsh faces contrasted with the surrounding darkness had a startling effect as the voyagers suddenly came upon the scene the dogs of the camp perceived them and barked but the indians fortunately took no heed of their clamor wyeth instantly sheered his boat out into the stream when unluckily it struck upon a sandbar and stuck fast it was a perilous and trying situation for he was fixed between the two camps and within rifle range of both all hands jumped out into the water and tried to get the boat off but as no one dared to give the word they could not pull together and their labor was in vain in this way they labored for a long time until wyeth thought of giving a signal for a general heave by lifting his hat the expedient succeeded they launched their canoe again into deep water and getting in had the delight of seeing the camp fires of the savages soon fading in the distance  they continued under way the greater part of the night until far beyond all danger from this band when they pulled to shore and encamped  the following day was windy and they came near upsetting their boat in carrying sail toward evening the wind subsided and a beautiful calm night succeeded they floated along with the current throughout the night taking turns to watch and steer the deep stillness of the night was occasionally interrupted by the neighing of the elk the hoarse lowing of the buffalo the hooting of large owls and the screeching of the small ones now and then the splash of a beaver or the gonglike sound of the swan  part of their voyage was extremely tempestuous with high winds tremendous thunder and soaking rain and they were repeatedly in extreme danger from driftwood and sunken trees on one occasion having continued to float at night after the moon was down they ran under a great snag or sunken tree with dry branches above the water these caught the mast while the boat swung round broadside to the stream and began to fill with water nothing saved her from total wreck but cutting away the mast she then drove down the stream but left one of the unlucky halfbreeds clinging to the snag like a monkey to a pole it was necessary to run in shore toil up laboriously along the eddies and to attain some distance above the snag when they launched forth again into the stream and floated down with it to his rescue  we forbear to detail all the circumstances and adventures of upward of a months voyage down the windings and doublings of this vast river in the course of which they stopped occasionally at a post of one of the rival fur companies or at a government agency for an indian tribe neither shall we dwell upon the changes of climate and productions as the voyagers swept down from north to south across several degrees of latitude arriving at the regions of oaks and sycamores of mulberry and basswood trees of paroquets and wild turkeys this is one of the characteristics of the middle and lower part of the missouri but still more so of the mississippi whose rapid current traverses a succession of latitudes so as in a few days to float the voyager almost from the frozen regions to the tropics  the voyage of wyeth shows the regular and unobstructed flow of the rivers on the east side of the rocky mountains in contrast to those of the western side where rocks and rapids continually menace and obstruct the voyager we find him in a frail bark of skins launching himself in a stream at the foot of the rocky mountains and floating down from river to river as they empty themselves into each other and so he might have kept on upward of two thousand miles until his little bark should drift into the ocean at present we shall stop with him at cantonment leavenworth the frontier post of the united states where he arrived on the 27th of september  here his first care was to have his nez perce indian and his halfbreed boy baptiste vaccinated as they approached the fort they were hailed by the sentinel the sight of a soldier in full array with what appeared to be a long knife glittering on the end of a musket struck baptiste with such affright that he took to his heels bawling for mercy at the top of his voice the nez perce would have followed him had not wyeth assured him of his safety when they underwent the operation of the lancet the doctors wife and another lady were present both beautiful women they were the first white women that they had seen and they could not keep their eyes off of them on returning to the boat they recounted to their companions all that they had observed at the fort but were especially eloquent about the white squaws who they said were white as snow and more beautiful than any human being they had ever beheld  we shall not accompany the captain any further in his voyage but will simply state that he made his way to boston where he succeeded in organizing an association under the name of the columbia river fishing and trading company for his original objects of a salmon fishery and a trade in furs a brig the may dacres had been dispatched for the columbia with supplies and he was now on his way to the same point at the head of sixty men whom he had enlisted at st louis some of whom were experienced hunters and all more habituated to the life of the wilderness than his first band of downeasters  we will now return to captain bonneville and his party whom we left making up their packs and saddling their horses in bear river valley     42       departure of captain bonneville for the

his planshis travelling companionsbuffalo      hunting more convivialityan interruption  it was the 3d of july that captain bonneville set out on his second visit to the banks of the columbia at the head of twentythree men he travelled leisurely to keep his horses fresh until on the 10th of july a scout brought word that wyeth with his band was but fifty miles in the rear and pushing forward with all speed this caused some bustle in the camp for it was important to get first to the buffalo ground to secure provisions for the journey as the horses were too heavily laden to travel fast a cache was digged as promptly as possible to receive all superfluous baggage just as it was finished a spring burst out of the earth at the bottom another cache was therefore digged about two miles further on when as they were about to bury the effects a line of horsemen with packhorses were seen streaking over the plain and encamped close by  it proved to be a small band in the service of the hudsons bay company under the command of a veteran canadian one of those petty leaders who with a small party of men and a small supply of goods are employed to follow up a band of indians from one hunting ground to another and buy up their peltries  having received numerous civilities from the hudsons bay company the captain sent an invitation to the officers of the party to an evening regale and set to work to make jovial preparations as the night air in these elevated regions is apt to be cold a blazing fire was soon made that would have done credit to a christmas dinner instead of a midsummer banquet the parties met in high goodfellowship there was abundance of such hunters fare as the neighborhood furnished and it was all discussed with mountain appetites they talked over all the events of their late campaigns but the canadian veteran had been unlucky in some of his transactions and his brow began to grow cloudy captain bonneville remarked his rising spleen and regretted that he had no juice of the grape to keep it down  a mans wit however is quick and inventive in the wilderness a thought suggested itself to the captain how he might brew a delectable beverage among his stores was a keg of honey but half exhausted this he filled up with alcohol and stirred the fiery and mellifluous ingredients together the glorious results may readily be imagined a happy compound of strength and sweetness enough to soothe the most ruffled temper and unsettle the most solid understanding  the beverage worked to a charm the can circulated merrily the first deep draught washed out every care from the mind of the veteran the second elevated his spirit to the clouds he was in fact a boon companion as all veteran canadian traders are apt to be he now became glorious talked over all his exploits his huntings his fightings with indian braves his loves with indian beauties sang snatches of old french ditties and canadian boat songs drank deeper and deeper sang louder and louder until having reached a climax of drunken gayety he gradually declined and at length fell fast asleep upon the ground after a long nap he again raised his head imbibed another potation of the sweet and strong flashed up with another slight blaze of french gayety and again fell asleep  the morning found him still upon the field of action but in sad and sorrowful condition suffering the penalties of past pleasures and calling to mind the captains dulcet compound with many a retch and spasm it seemed as if the honey and alcohol which had passed so glibly and smoothly over his tongue were at war within his stomach and that he had a swarm of bees within his head in short so helpless and woebegone was his plight that his party proceeded on their march without him the captain promised to bring him on in safety in the after part of the day  as soon as this party had moved off captain bonnevilles men proceeded to construct and fill their cache and just as it was completed the party of wyeth was descried at a distance in a moment all was activity to take the road the horses were prepared and mounted and being lightened of a great part of their burdens were able to move with celerity as to the worthy convive of the preceding evening he was carefully gathered up from the hunters couch on which he lay repentant and supine and being packed upon one of the horses was hurried forward with the convoy groaning and ejaculating at every jolt  in the course of the day wyeth being lightly mounted rode ahead of his party and overtook captain bonneville their meeting was friendly and courteous and they discussed sociably their respective fortunes since they separated on the banks of the bighorn wyeth announced his intention of establishing a small trading post at the mouth of the portneuf and leaving a few men there with a quantity of goods to trade with the neighboring indians he was compelled in fact to this measure in consequence of the refusal of the rocky mountain fur company to take a supply of goods which he had brought out for them according to contract and which he had no other mode of disposing of he further informed captain bonneville that the competition between the rocky mountain and american fur companies which had led to such nefarious stratagems and deadly feuds was at an end they having divided the country between them allotting boundaries within which each was to trade and hunt so as not to interfere with the other  in company with wyeth were travelling two men of science mr nuttall the botanist the same who ascended the missouri at the time of the expedition to astoria and mr townshend an ornithologist from these gentlemen we may look forward to important information concerning these interesting regions there were three religious missionaries also bound to the shores of the columbia to spread the light of the gospel in that far wilderness  after riding for some time together in friendly conversation wyeth returned to his party and captain bonneville continued to press forward and to gain ground at night he sent off the sadly sober and moralizing chief of the hudsons bay company under a proper escort to rejoin his people his route branching off in a different direction the latter took a cordial leave of his host hoping on some future occasion to repay his hospitality in kind  in the morning the captain was early on the march throwing scouts out far ahead to scour hill and dale in search of buffalo he had confidently expected to find game in abundance on the headwaters of the portneuf but on reaching that region not a track was to be seen  at length one of the scouts who had made a wide sweep away to the headwaters of the blackfoot river discovered great herds quietly grazing in the adjacent meadows he set out on his return to report his discoveries but night overtaking him he was kindly and hospitably entertained at the camp of wyeth as soon as day dawned he hastened to his own camp with the welcome intelligence and about ten oclock of the same morning captain bonnevilles party were in the midst of the game  the packs were scarcely off the backs of the mules when the runners mounted on the fleetest horses were full tilt after the buffalo others of the men were busied erecting scaffolds and other contrivances for jerking or drying meat others were lighting great fires for the same purpose soon the hunters began to make their appearance bringing in the choicest morsels of buffalo meat these were placed upon the scaffolds and the whole camp presented a scene of singular hurry and activity at daylight the next morning the runners again took the field with similar success and after an interval of repose made their third and last chase about twelve oclock for by this time wyeths party was in sight the game being now driven into a valley at some distance wyeth was obliged to fix his camp there but he came in the evening to pay captain bonneville a visit he was accompanied by captain stewart the amateur traveller who had not yet sated his appetite for the adventurous life of the wilderness with him also was a mr mkay a halfbreed son of the unfortunate adventurer of the same name who came out in the first maritime expedition to astoria and was blown up in the tonquin his son had grown up in the employ of the british fur companies and was a prime hunter and a daring partisan he held moreover a farm in the valley of the wallamut  the three visitors when they reached captain bonnevilles camp were surprised to find no one in it but himself and three men his party being dispersed in all directions to make the most of their present chance for hunting they remonstrated with him on the imprudence of remaining with so trifling a guard in a region so full of danger captain bonneville vindicated the policy of his conduct he never hesitated to send out all his hunters when any important object was to be attained and experience had taught him that he was most secure when his forces were thus distributed over the surrounding country he then was sure that no enemy could approach from any direction without being discovered by his hunters who have a quick eye for detecting the slightest signs of the proximity of indians and who would instantly convey intelligence to the camp  the captain now set to work with his men to prepare a suitable entertainment for his guests it was a time of plenty in the camp of prime hunters dainties of buffalo humps and buffalo tongues and roasted ribs and broiled marrowbones all these were cooked in hunters style served up with a profusion known only on a plentiful hunting ground and discussed with an appetite that would astonish the puny gourmands of the cities but above all and to give a bacchanalian grace to this truly masculine repast the captain produced his mellifluous keg of homebrewed nectar which had been so potent over the senses of the veteran of hudsons bay potations pottle deep again went round never did beverage excite greater glee or meet with more rapturous commendation the parties were fast advancing to that happy state which would have insured ample cause for the next days repentance and the bees were already beginning to buzz about their ears when a messenger came spurring to the camp with intelligence that wyeths people had got entangled in one of those deep and frightful ravines piled with immense fragments of volcanic rock which gash the whole country about the headwaters of the blackfoot river the revel was instantly at an end the keg of sweet and potent homebrewed was deserted and the guests departed with all speed to aid in extricating their companions from the volcanic ravine     43       a rapid marcha cloud of dustwild horsemenhigh jinks      horseracing and

 conscience  up and away is the first thought at daylight of the indian trader when a rival is at hand and distance is to be gained early in the morning captain bonneville ordered the half dried meat to be packed upon the horses and leaving wyeth and his party to hunt the scattered buffalo pushed off rapidly to the east to regain the plain of the portneuf his march was rugged and dangerous through volcanic hills broken into cliffs and precipices and seamed with tremendous chasms where the rocks rose like walls  on the second day however he encamped once more in the plain and as it was still early some of the men strolled out to the neighboring hills in casting their eyes round the country they perceived a great cloud of dust rising in the south and evidently approaching hastening back to the camp they gave the alarm preparations were instantly made to receive an enemy while some of the men throwing themselves upon the running horses kept for hunting galloped off to reconnoitre in a little while they made signals from a distance that all was friendly by this time the cloud of dust had swept on as if hurried along by a blast and a band of wild horsemen came dashing at full leap into the camp yelling and whooping like so many maniacs their dresses their accoutrements their mode of riding and their uncouth clamor made them seem a party of savages arrayed for war but they proved to be principally halfbreeds and white men grown savage in the wilderness who were employed as trappers and hunters in the service of the hudsons bay company  here was again high jinks in the camp captain bonnevilles men hailed these wild scamperers as congenial spirits or rather as the very game birds of their class they entertained them with the hospitality of mountaineers feasting them at every fire at first there were mutual details of adventures and exploits and broad joking mingled with peals of laughter then came on boasting of the comparative merits of horses and rifles which soon engrossed every tongue this naturally led to racing and shooting at a mark one trial of speed and skill succeeded another shouts and acclamations rose from the victorious parties fierce altercations succeeded and a general melee was about to take place when suddenly the attention of the quarrellers was arrested by a strange kind of indian chant or chorus that seemed to operate upon them as a charm their fury was at an end a tacit reconciliation succeeded and the ideas of the whole mongrel crowd whites halfbreeds and squaws were turned in a new direction they all formed into groups and taking their places at the several fires prepared for one of the most exciting amusements of the nez perces and the other tribes of the far west  the choral chant in fact which had thus acted as a charm was a kind of wild accompaniment to the favorite indian game of hand this is played by two parties drawn out in opposite platoons before a blazing fire it is in some respects like the old game of passing the ring or the button and detecting the hand which holds it in the present game the object hidden or the cache as it is called by the trappers is a small splint of wood or other diminutive article that may be concealed in the closed hand this is passed backward and forward among the party in hand while the party out of hand guess where it is concealed to heighten the excitement and confuse the guessers a number of dry poles are laid before each platoon upon which the members of the party in hand beat furiously with short staves keeping time to the choral chant already mentioned which waxes fast and furious as the game proceeds as large bets are staked upon the game the excitement is prodigious each party in turn bursts out in full chorus beating and yelling and working themselves up into such a heat that the perspiration rolls down their naked shoulders even in the cold of a winter night the bets are doubled and trebled as the game advances the mental excitement increases almost to madness and all the worldly effects of the gamblers are often hazarded upon the position of a straw  these gambling games were kept up throughout the night every fire glared upon a group that looked like a crew of maniacs at their frantic orgies and the scene would have been kept up throughout the succeeding day had not captain bonneville interposed his authority and at the usual hour issued his marching orders  proceeding down the course of snake river the hunters regularly returned to camp in the evening laden with wild geese which were yet scarcely able to fly and were easily caught in great numbers it was now the season of the annual fishfeast with which the indians in these parts celebrate the first appearance of the salmon in this river these fish are taken in great numbers at the numerous falls of about four feet pitch the indians flank the shallow water just below and spear them as they attempt to pass in wide parts of the river also they place a sort of chevauxdefrize or fence of poles interwoven with withes and forming an angle in the middle of the current where a small opening is left for the salmon to pass around this opening the indians station themselves on small rafts and ply their spears with great success  the table lands so common in this region have a sandy soil inconsiderable in depth and covered with sage or more properly speaking wormwood below this is a level stratum of rock riven occasionally by frightful chasms the whole plain rises as it approaches the river and terminates with high and broken cliffs difficult to pass and in many places so precipitous that it is impossible for days together to get down to the waters edge to give drink to the horses this obliges the traveller occasionally to abandon the vicinity of the river and make a wide sweep into the interior  it was now far in the month of july and the party suffered extremely from sultry weather and dusty travelling the flies and gnats too were extremely troublesome to the horses especially when keeping along the edge of the river where it runs between low sandbanks whenever the travellers encamped in the afternoon the horses retired to the gravelly shores and remained there without attempting to feed until the cool of the evening as to the travellers they plunged into the clear and cool current to wash away the dust of the road and refresh themselves after the heat of the day the nights were always cool and pleasant  at one place where they encamped for some time the river was nearly five hundred yards wide and studded with grassy islands adorned with groves of willow and cottonwood here the indians were assembled in great numbers and had barricaded the channels between the islands to enable them to spear the salmon with greater facility they were a timid race and seemed unaccustomed to the sight of white men entering one of the huts captain bonneville found the inhabitants just proceeding to cook a fine salmon it is put into a pot filled with cold water and hung over the fire the moment the water begins to boil the fish is considered cooked  taking his seat unceremoniously and lighting his pipe the captain awaited the cooking of the fish intending to invite himself to the repast the owner of the hut seemed to take his intrusion in good part while conversing with him the captain felt something move behind him and turning round and removing a few skins and old buffalo robes discovered a young girl about fourteen years of age crouched beneath who directed her large black eyes full in his face and continued to gaze in mute surprise and terror the captain endeavored to dispel her fears and drawing a bright ribbon from his pocket attempted repeatedly to tie it round her neck she jerked back at each attempt uttering a sound very much like a snarl nor could all the blandishments of the captain albeit a pleasant goodlooking and somewhat gallant man succeed in conquering the shyness of the savage little beauty his attentions were now turned toward the parents whom he presented with an awl and a little tobacco and having thus secured their goodwill continued to smoke his pipe and watch the salmon while thus seated near the threshold an urchin of the family approached the door but catching a sight of the strange guest ran off screaming with terror and ensconced himself behind the long straw at the back of the hut  desirous to dispel entirely this timidity and to open a trade with the simple inhabitants of the hut who he did not doubt had furs somewhere concealed the captain now drew forth that grand lure in the eyes of a savage a pocket mirror the sight of it was irresistible after examining it for a long time with wonder and admiration they produced a muskrat skin and offered it in exchange the captain shook his head but purchased the skin for a couple of buttonssuperfluous trinkets as the worthy lord of the hovel had neither coat nor breeches on which to place them  the mirror still continued the great object of desire particularly in the eyes of the old housewife who produced a pot of parched flour and a string of biscuit roots these procured her some trifle in return but could not command the purchase of the mirror the salmon being now completely cooked they all joined heartily in supper a bounteous portion was deposited before the captain by the old woman upon some fresh grass which served instead of a platter and never had he tasted a salmon boiled so completely to his fancy  supper being over the captain lighted his pipe and passed it to his host who inhaling the smoke puffed it through his nostrils so assiduously that in a little while his head manifested signs of confusion and dizziness being satisfied by this time of the kindly and companionable qualities of the captain he became easy and communicative and at length hinted something about exchanging beaver skins for horses the captain at once offered to dispose of his steed which stood fastened at the door the bargain was soon concluded whereupon the indian removing a pile of bushes under which his valuables were concealed drew forth the number of skins agreed upon as the price  shortly afterward some of the captains people coming up he ordered another horse to be saddled and mounting it took his departure from the hut after distributing a few trifling presents among its simple inhabitants during all the time of his visit the little indian girl had kept her large black eyes fixed upon him almost without winking watching every movement with awe and wonder and as he rode off remained gazing after him motionless as a statue her father however delighted with his new acquaintance mounted his newly purchased horse and followed in the train of the captain to whom he continued to be a faithful and useful adherent during his sojourn in the neighborhood  the cowardly effects of an evil conscience were evidenced in the conduct of one of the captains men who had been in the california expedition during all their intercourse with the harmless people of this place he had manifested uneasiness and anxiety while his companions mingled freely and joyously with the natives he went about with a restless suspicious look scrutinizing every painted form and face and starting often at the sudden approach of some meek and inoffensive savage who regarded him with reverence as a superior being yet this was ordinarily a bold fellow who never flinched from danger nor turned pale at the prospect of a battle at length he requested permission of captain bonneville to keep out of the way of these people entirely their striking resemblance he said to the people of ogdens river made him continually fear that some among them might have seen him in that expedition and might seek an opportunity of revenge ever after this while they remained in this neighborhood he would skulk out of the way and keep aloof when any of the native inhabitants approached such observed captain bonneville is the effect of selfreproach even upon the roving trapper in the wilderness who has little else to fear than the stings of his own guilty conscience     44       outfit of

countryconflagration of forests  it had been the intention of captain bonneville in descending along snake river to scatter his trappers upon the smaller streams in this way a range of country is trapped by small detachments from a main body the outfit of a trapper is generally a rifle a pound of powder and four pounds of lead with a bullet mould seven traps an axe a hatchet a knife and awl a camp kettle two blankets and where supplies are plenty seven pounds of flour he has generally two or three horses to carry himself and his baggage and peltries two trappers commonly go together for the purposes of mutual assistance and support a larger party could not easily escape the eyes of the indians it is a service of peril and even more so at present than formerly for the indians since they have got into the habit of trafficking peltries with the traders have learned the value of the beaver and look upon the trappers as poachers who are filching the riches from their streams and interfering with their market they make no hesitation therefore to murder the solitary trapper and thus destroy a competitor while they possess themselves of his spoils it is with regret we add too that this hostility has in many cases been instigated by traders desirous of injuring their rivals but who have themselves often reaped the fruits of the mischief they have sown  when two trappers undertake any considerable stream their mode of proceeding is to hide their horses in some lonely glen where they can graze unobserved they then build a small hut dig out a canoe from a cottonwood tree and in this poke along shore silently in the evening and set their traps these they revisit in the same silent way at daybreak when they take any beaver they bring it home skin it stretch the skins on sticks to dry and feast upon the flesh the body hung up before the fire turns by its own weight and is roasted in a superior style the tail is the trappers tidbit it is cut off put on the end of a stick and toasted and is considered even a greater dainty than the tongue or the marrowbone of a buffalo  with all their silence and caution however the poor trappers cannot always escape their hawkeyed enemies their trail has been discovered perhaps and followed up for many a mile or their smoke has been seen curling up out of the secret glen or has been scented by the savages whose sense of smell is almost as acute as that of sight sometimes they are pounced upon when in the act of setting their traps at other times they are roused from their sleep by the horrid warwhoop or perhaps have a bullet or an arrow whistling about their ears in the midst of one of their beaver banquets in this way they are picked off from time to time and nothing is known of them until perchance their bones are found bleaching in some lonely ravine or on the banks of some nameless stream which from that time is called after them many of the small streams beyond the mountains thus perpetuate the names of unfortunate trappers that have been murdered on their banks  a knowledge of these dangers deterred captain bonneville in the present instance from detaching small parties of trappers as he had intended for his scouts brought him word that formidable bands of the banneck indians were lying on the boisee and payette rivers at no great distance so that they would be apt to detect and cut off any stragglers it behooved him also to keep his party together to guard against any predatory attack upon the main body he continued on his way therefore without dividing his forces and fortunate it was that he did so for in a little while he encountered one of the phenomena of the western wilds that would effectually have prevented his scattered people from finding each other again in a word it was the season of setting fire to the prairies as he advanced he began to perceive great clouds of smoke at a distance rising by degrees and spreading over the whole face of the country the atmosphere became dry and surcharged with murky vapor parching to the skin and irritating to the eyes when travelling among the hills they could scarcely discern objects at the distance of a few paces indeed the least exertion of the vision was painful there was evidently some vast conflagration in the direction toward which they were proceeding it was as yet at a great distance and during the day they could only see the smoke rising in larger and denser volumes and rolling forth in an immense canopy at night the skies were all glowing with the reflection of unseen fires hanging in an immense body of lurid light high above the horizon  having reached gun creek an important stream coming from the left captain bonneville turned up its course to traverse the mountain and avoid the great bend of snake river being now out of the range of the bannecks he sent out his people in all directions to hunt the antelope for present supplies keeping the dried meats for places where game might be scarce  during four days that the party were ascending gun creek the smoke continued to increase so rapidly that it was impossible to distinguish the face of the country and ascertain landmarks fortunately the travellers fell upon an indian trail which led them to the headwaters of the fourche de glace or ice river sometimes called the grand rond here they found all the plains and valleys wrapped in one vast conflagration which swept over the long grass in billows of flame shot up every bush and tree rose in great columns from the groves and set up clouds of smoke that darkened the atmosphere to avoid this sea of fire the travellers had to pursue their course close along the foot of the mountains but the irritation from the smoke continued to be tormenting  the country about the headwaters of the grand rond spreads out into broad and level prairies extremely fertile and watered by mountain springs and rivulets these prairies are resorted to by small bands of the skynses to pasture their horses as well as to banquets upon the salmon which abound in the neighboring waters they take these fish in great quantities and without the least difficulty simply taking them out of the water with their hands as they flounder and struggle in the numerous long shoals of the principal streams at the time the travellers passed over these prairies some of the narrow deep streams by which they were intersected were completely choked with salmon which they took in great numbers the wolves and bears frequent these streams at this season to avail themselves of these great fisheries  the travellers continued for many days to experience great difficulties and discomforts from this wide conflagration which seemed to embrace the whole wilderness the sun was for a great part of the time obscured by the smoke and the loftiest mountains were hidden from view blundering along in this region of mist and uncertainty they were frequently obliged to make long circuits to avoid obstacles which they could not perceive until close upon them the indian trails were their safest guides for though they sometimes appeared to lead them out of their direct course they always conducted them to the passes  on the 26th of august they reached the head of the wayleeway river here in a valley of the mountains through which this headwater makes its way they found a band of the skynses who were extremely sociable and appeared to be well disposed and as they spoke the nez perce language an intercourse was easily kept up with them  in the pastures on the bank of this stream captain bonneville encamped for a time for the purpose of recruiting the strength of his horses scouts were now sent out to explore the surrounding country and search for a convenient pass through the mountains toward the wallamut or multnomah after an absence of twenty days they returned weary and discouraged they had been harassed and perplexed in rugged mountain defiles where their progress was continually impeded by rocks and precipices often they had been obliged to travel along the edges of frightful ravines where a false step would have been fatal in one of these passes a horse fell from the brink of a precipice and would have been dashed to pieces had he not lodged among the branches of a tree from which he was extricated with great difficulty these however were not the worst of their difficulties and perils the great conflagration of the country which had harassed the main party in its march was still more awful the further this exploring party proceeded the flames which swept rapidly over the light vegetation of the prairies assumed a fiercer character and took a stronger hold amid the wooded glens and ravines of the mountains some of the deep gorges and defiles sent up sheets of flame and clouds of lurid smoke and sparks and cinders that in the night made them resemble the craters of volcanoes the groves and forests too which crowned the cliffs shot up their towering columns of fire and added to the furnace glow of the mountains with these stupendous sights were combined the rushing blasts caused by the rarefied air which roared and howled through the narrow glens and whirled forth the smoke and flames in impetuous wreaths ever and anon too was heard the crash of falling trees sometimes tumbling from crags and precipices with tremendous sounds  in the daytime the mountains were wrapped in smoke so dense and blinding that the explorers if by chance they separated could only find each other by shouting often too they had to grope their way through the yet burning forests in constant peril from the limbs and trunks of trees which frequently fell across their path at length they gave up the attempt to find a pass as hopeless under actual circumstances and made their way back to the camp to report their failure     45       the skynsestheir traffichuntingfoodhorsesa horse      racedevotional feeling of the skynses nez perces and

between the main party and the skynses who had removed into the neighborhood of the camp these people dwell about the waters of the wayleeway and the adjacent country and trade regularly with the hudsons bay company generally giving horses in exchange for the articles of which they stand in need they bring beaver skins also to the trading posts not procured by trapping but by a course of internal traffic with the shy and ignorant shoshokoes and tooelicans who keep in distant and unfrequented parts of the country and will not venture near the trading houses the skynses hunt the deer and elk occasionally and depend for a part of the year on fishing their main subsistence however is upon roots especially the kamash this bulbous root is said to be of a delicious flavor and highly nutritious the women dig it up in great quantities steam it and deposit it in caches for winter provisions it grows spontaneously and absolutely covers the plains  this tribe was comfortably clad and equipped they had a few rifles among them and were extremely desirous of bartering for those of captain bonnevilles men offering a couple of good running horses for a light rifle their firstrate horses however were not to be procured from them on any terms they almost invariably use ponies but of a breed infinitely superior to any in the united states they are fond of trying their speed and bottom and of betting upon them  as captain bonneville was desirous of judging of the comparative merit of their horses he purchased one of their racers and had a trial of speed between that an american and a shoshonie which were supposed to be well matched the racecourse was for the distance of one mile and a half out and back for the first half mile the american took the lead by a few hands but losing his wind soon fell far behind leaving the shoshonie and skynse to contend together for a mile and a half they went head and head but at the turn the skynse took the lead and won the race with great ease scarce drawing a quick breath when all was over  the skynses like the nez perces and the flatheads have a strong devotional feeling which has been successfully cultivated by some of the resident personages of the hudsons bay company sunday is invariably kept sacred among these tribes they will not raise their camp on that day unless in extreme cases of danger or hunger neither will they hunt nor fish nor trade nor perform any kind of labor on that day a part of it is passed in prayer and religious ceremonies some chief who is generally at the same time what is called a medicine man assembles the community after invoking blessings from the deity he addresses the assemblage exhorting them to good conduct to be diligent in providing for their families to abstain from lying and stealing to avoid quarrelling or cheating in their play and to be just and hospitable to all strangers who may be among them prayers and exhortations are also made early in the morning on week days sometimes all this is done by the chief from horseback moving slowly about the camp with his hat on and uttering his exhortations with a loud voice on all occasions the bystanders listen with profound attention and at the end of every sentence respond one word in unison apparently equivalent to an amen while these prayers and exhortations are going on every employment in the camp is suspended if an indian is riding by the place he dismounts holds his horse and attends with reverence until all is done when the chief has finished his prayer or exhortation he says i have done upon which there is a general exclamation in unison with these religious services probably derived from the white men the tribes abovementioned mingle some of their old indian ceremonials such as dancing to the cadence of a song or ballad which is generally done in a large lodge provided for the purpose besides sundays they likewise observe the cardinal holidays of the roman catholic church  whoever has introduced these simple forms of religions among these poor savages has evidently understood their characters and capacities and effected a great melioration of their manners of this we speak not merely from the testimony of captain bonneville but likewise from that of mr wyeth who passed some months in a travelling camp of the flatheads during the time i have been with them says he i have never known an instance of theft among them the least thing even to a bead or pin is brought to you if found and often things that have been thrown away neither have i known any quarrelling nor lying this absence of all quarrelling the more surprised me when i came to see the various occasions that would have given rise to it among the whites the crowding together of from twelve to eighteen hundred horses which have to be driven into camp at night to be picketed to be packed in the morning the gathering of fuel in places where it is extremely scanty all this however is done without confusion or disturbance  they have a mild playful laughing disposition and this is portrayed in their countenances they are polite and unobtrusive when one speaks the rest pay strict attention when he is done another assents by yes or dissents by no and then states his reasons which are listened to with equal attention even the children are more peaceable than any other children i never heard an angry word among them nor any quarrelling although there were at least five hundred of them together and continually at play with all this quietness of spirit they are brave when put to the test and are an overmatch for an equal number of blackfeet  the foregoing observations though gathered from mr wyeth as relative to the flatheads apply in the main to the skynses also captain bonneville during his sojourn with the latter took constant occasion in conversing with their principal men to encourage them in the cultivation of moral and religious habits drawing a comparison between their peaceable and comfortable course of life and that of other tribes and attributing it to their superior sense of morality and religion he frequently attended their religious services with his people always enjoining on the latter the most reverential deportment and he observed that the poor indians were always pleased to have the white men present  the disposition of these tribes is evidently favorable to a considerable degree of civilization a few farmers settled among them might lead them captain bonneville thinks to till the earth and cultivate grain the country of the skynses and nez perces is admirably adapted for the raising of cattle a christian missionary or two and some trifling assistance from government to protect them from the predatory and warlike tribes might lay the foundation of a christian people in the midst of the great western wilderness who would wear the americans near their hearts  we must not omit to observe however in qualification of the sanctity of this sabbath in the wilderness that these tribes who are all ardently addicted to gambling and horseracing make sunday a peculiar day for recreations of the kind not deeming them in any wise out of season after prayers and pious ceremonies are over there is scarce an hour in the day says captain bonneville that you do not see several horses racing at full speed and in every corner of the camp are groups of gamblers ready to stake everything upon the allabsorbing game of hand the indians says wyeth appear to enjoy their amusements with more zest than the whites they are great gamblers and in proportion to their means play bolder and bet higher than white men  the cultivation of the religious feeling above noted among the savages has been at times a convenient policy with some of the more knowing traders who have derived great credit and influence among them by being considered medicine men that is men gifted with mysterious knowledge this feeling is also at times played upon by religious charlatans who are to be found in savage as well as civilized life one of these was noted by wyeth during his sojourn among the flatheads a new great man says he is rising in the camp who aims at power and sway he covers his designs under the ample cloak of religion inculcating some new doctrines and ceremonials among those who are more simple than himself he has already made proselytes of onefifth of the camp beginning by working on the women the children and the weakminded his followers are all dancing on the plain to their own vocal music the more knowing ones of the tribe look on and laugh thinking it all too foolish to do harm but they will soon find that women children and fools form a large majority of every community and they will have eventually to follow the new light or be considered among the profane as soon as a preacher or pseudo prophet of the kind gets followers enough he either takes command of the tribe or branches off and sets up an independent chief and medicine man     46       scarcity in the camprefusal of supplies by the hudsons      bay companyconduct of the indiansa hungry retreatjohn      days riverthe blue

antelopes  provisions were now growing scanty in the camp and captain bonneville found it necessary to seek a new neighborhood taking leave therefore of his friends the skynses he set off to the westward and crossing a low range of mountains encamped on the headwaters of the ottolais being now within thirty miles of fort wallahwallah the trading post of the hudsons bay company he sent a small detachment of men thither to purchase corn for the subsistence of his party the men were well received at the fort but all supplies for their camp were peremptorily refused tempting offers were made them however if they would leave their present employ and enter into the service of the company but they were not to be seduced  when captain bonneville saw his messengers return emptyhanded he ordered an instant move for there was imminent danger of famine he pushed forward down the course of the ottolais which runs diagonal to the columbia and falls into it about fifty miles below the wallahwallah his route lay through a beautiful undulating country covered with horses belonging to the skynses who sent them there for pasturage  on reaching the columbia captain bonneville hoped to open a trade with the natives for fish and other provisions but to his surprise they kept aloof and even hid themselves on his approach he soon discovered that they were under the influence of the hudsons bay company who had forbidden them to trade or hold any communion with him he proceeded along the columbia but it was everywhere the same not an article of provisions was to be obtained from the natives and he was at length obliged to kill a couple of his horses to sustain his famishing people he now came to a halt and consulted what was to be done the broad and beautiful columbia lay before them smooth and unruffled as a mirror a little more journeying would take them to its lower region to the noble valley of the wallamut their projected winter quarters to advance under present circumstances would be to court starvation the resources of the country were locked against them by the influence of a jealous and powerful monopoly if they reached the wallamut they could scarcely hope to obtain sufficient supplies for the winter if they lingered any longer in the country the snows would gather upon the mountains and cut off their retreat by hastening their return they would be able to reach the blue mountains just in time to find the elk the deer and the bighorn and after they had supplied themselves with provisions they might push through the mountains before they were entirely blocked by snow influenced by these considerations captain bonneville reluctantly turned his back a second time on the columbia and set off for the blue mountains he took his course up john days river so called from one of the hunters in the original astorian enterprise as famine was at his heels he travelled fast and reached the mountains by the 1st of october he entered by the opening made by john days river it was a rugged and difficult defile but he and his men had become accustomed to hard scrambles of the kind fortunately the september rains had extinguished the fires which recently spread over these regions and the mountains no longer wrapped in smoke now revealed all their grandeur and sublimity to the eye  they were disappointed in their expectation of finding abundant game in the mountains large bands of the natives had passed through returning from their fishing expeditions and had driven all the game before them it was only now and then that the hunters could bring in sufficient to keep the party from starvation  to add to their distress they mistook their route and wandered for ten days among high and bald hills of clay at length after much perplexity they made their way to the banks of snake river following the course of which they were sure to reach their place of destination  it was the 20th of october when they found themselves once more upon this noted stream the shoshokoes whom they had met with in such scanty numbers on their journey down the river now absolutely thronged its banks to profit by the abundance of salmon and lay up a stock for winter provisions scaffolds were everywhere erected and immense quantities of fish drying upon them at this season of the year however the salmon are extremely poor and the travellers needed their keen sauce of hunger to give them a relish  in some places the shores were completely covered with a stratum of dead salmon exhausted in ascending the river or destroyed at the falls the fetid odor of which tainted the air  it was not until the travellers reached the headwaters of the portneuf that they really found themselves in a region of abundance here the buffaloes were in immense herds and here they remained for three days slaying and cooking and feasting and indemnifying themselves by an enormous carnival for a long and hungry lent their horses too found good pasturage and enjoyed a little rest after a severe spell of hard travelling  during this period two horsemen arrived at the camp who proved to be messengers sent express for supplies from monteros party which had been sent to beat up the crow country and the black hills and to winter on the arkansas they reported that all was well with the party but that they had not been able to accomplish the whole of their mission and were still in the crow country where they should remain until joined by captain bonneville in the spring the captain retained the messengers with him until the 17th of november when having reached the caches on bear river and procured thence the required supplies he sent them back to their party appointing a rendezvous toward the last of june following on the forks of wind river valley in the crow country  he now remained several days encamped near the caches and having discovered a small band of shoshonies in his neighborhood purchased from them lodges furs and other articles of winter comfort and arranged with them to encamp together during the winter  the place designed by the captain for the wintering ground was on the upper part of bear river some distance off he delayed approaching it as long as possible in order to avoid driving off the buffaloes which would be needed for winter provisions he accordingly moved forward but slowly merely as the want of game and grass obliged him to shift his position the weather had already become extremely cold and the snow lay to a considerable depth to enable the horses to carry as much dried meat as possible he caused a cache to be made in which all the baggage that could be spared was deposited this done the party continued to move slowly toward their winter quarters  they were not doomed however to suffer from scarcity during the present winter the people upon snake river having chased off the buffaloes before the snow had become deep immense herds now came trooping over the mountains forming dark masses on their sides from which their deepmouthed bellowing sounded like the low peals and mutterings from a gathering thundercloud in effect the cloud broke and down came the torrent thundering into the valley it is utterly impossible according to captain bonneville to convey an idea of the effect produced by the sight of such countless throngs of animals of such bulk and spirit all rushing forward as if swept on by a whirlwind  the long privation which the travellers had suffered gave uncommon ardor to their present hunting one of the indians attached to the party finding himself on horseback in the midst of the buffaloes without either rifle or bow and arrows dashed after a fine cow that was passing close by him and plunged his knife into her side with such lucky aim as to bring her to the ground it was a daring deed but hunger had made him almost desperate  the buffaloes are sometimes tenacious of life and must be wounded in particular parts a ball striking the shagged frontlet of a bull produces no other effect than a toss of the head and greater exasperation on the contrary a ball striking the forehead of a cow is fatal several instances occurred during this great hunting bout of bulls fighting furiously after having received mortal wounds wyeth also was witness to an instance of the kind while encamped with indians during a grand hunt of the buffaloes one of the indians pressed a bull so closely that the animal turned suddenly on him his horse stopped short or started back and threw him before he could rise the bull rushed furiously upon him and gored him in the chest so that his breath came out at the aperture he was conveyed back to the camp and his wound was dressed giving himself up for slain he called round him his friends and made his will by word of mouth it was something like a death chant and at the end of every sentence those around responded in concord he appeared no ways intimidated by the approach of death i think adds wyeth the indians die better than the white men perhaps from having less fear about the future  the buffaloes may be approached very near if the hunter keeps to the leeward but they are quick of scent and will take the alarm and move off from a party of hunters to the windward even when two miles distant  the vast herds which had poured down into the bear river valley were now snowbound and remained in the neighborhood of the camp throughout the winter this furnished the trappers and their indian friends a perpetual carnival so that to slay and eat seemed to be the main occupations of the day it is astonishing what loads of meat it requires to cope with the appetite of a hunting camp  the ravens and wolves soon came in for their share of the good cheer these constant attendants of the hunter gathered in vast numbers as the winter advanced they might be completely out of sight but at the report of a gun flights of ravens would immediately be seen hovering in the air no one knew whence they came while the sharp visages of the wolves would peep down from the brow of every hill waiting for the hunters departure to pounce upon the carcass  besides the buffaloes there were other neighbors snowbound in the valley whose presence did not promise to be so advantageous this was a band of eutaw indians who were encamped higher up on the river they are a poor tribe that in a scale of the various tribes inhabiting these regions would rank between the shoshonies and the shoshokoes or root diggers though more bold and warlike than the latter they have but few rifles among them and are generally armed with bows and arrows  as this band and the shoshonies were at deadly feud on account of old grievances and as neither party stood in awe of the other it was feared some bloody scenes might ensue captain bonneville therefore undertook the office of pacificator and sent to the eutaw chiefs inviting them to a friendly smoke in order to bring about a reconciliation his invitation was proudly declined whereupon he went to them in person and succeeded in effecting a suspension of hostilities until the chiefs of the two tribes could meet in council the braves of the two rival camps sullenly acquiesced in the arrangement they would take their seats upon the hill tops and watch their quondam enemies hunting the buffalo in the plain below and evidently repine that their hands were tied up from a skirmish the worthy captain however succeeded in carrying through his benevolent mediation the chiefs met the amicable pipe was smoked the hatchet buried and peace formally proclaimed after this both camps united and mingled in social intercourse private quarrels however would occasionally occur in hunting about the division of the game and blows would sometimes be exchanged over the carcass of a buffalo but the chiefs wisely took no notice of these individual brawls  one day the scouts who had been ranging the hills brought news of several large herds of antelopes in a small valley at no great distance this produced a sensation among the indians for both tribes were in ragged condition and sadly in want of those shirts made of the skin of the antelope it was determined to have a surround as the mode of hunting that animal is called everything now assumed an air of mystic solemnity and importance the chiefs prepared their medicines or charms each according to his own method or fancied inspiration generally with the compound of certain simples others consulted the entrails of animals which they had sacrificed and thence drew favorable auguries after much grave smoking and deliberating it was at length proclaimed that all who were able to lift a club man woman or child should muster for the surround when all had congregated they moved in rude procession to the nearest point of the valley in question and there halted another course of smoking and deliberating of which the indians are so fond took place among the chiefs directions were then issued for the horsemen to make a circuit of about seven miles so as to encompass the herd when this was done the whole mounted force dashed off simultaneously at full speed shouting and yelling at the top of their voices in a short space of time the antelopes started from their hidingplaces came bounding from all points into the valley the riders now gradually contracting their circle brought them nearer and nearer to the spot where the senior chief surrounded by the elders male and female were seated in supervision of the chase the antelopes nearly exhausted with fatigue and fright and bewildered by perpetual whooping made no effort to break through the ring of the hunters but ran round in small circles until man woman and child beat them down with bludgeons such is the nature of that species of antelope hunting technically called a surround     47       a festive winterconversion of the shoshoniesvisit of two      free trappersgayety in the campa touch of the tender

and venison humps and haunches buffalo tongues and marrowbones were constantly cooking at every fire and the whole atmosphere was redolent with the savory fumes of roast meat it was indeed a continual feast of fat things and though there might be a lack of wine upon the lees yet we have shown that a substitute was occasionally to be found in honey and alcohol  both the shoshonies and the eutaws conducted themselves with great propriety it is true they now and then filched a few trifles from their good friends the big hearts when their backs were turned but then they always treated them to their faces with the utmost deference and respect and goodhumoredly vied with the trappers in all kinds of feats of activity and mirthful sports the two tribes maintained toward each other also a friendliness of aspect which gave captain bonneville reason to hope that all past animosity was effectually buried  the two rival bands however had not long been mingled in this social manner before their ancient jealousy began to break out in a new form the senior chief of the shoshonies was a thinking man and a man of observation he had been among the nez perces listened to their new code of morality and religion received from the white men and attended their devotional exercises he had observed the effect of all this in elevating the tribe in the estimation of the white men and determined by the same means to gain for his own tribe a superiority over their ignorant rivals the eutaws he accordingly assembled his people and promulgated among them the mongrel doctrines and form of worship of the nez perces recommending the same to their adoption the shoshonies were struck with the novelty at least of the measure and entered into it with spirit they began to observe sundays and holidays and to have their devotional dances and chants and other ceremonials about which the ignorant eutaws knew nothing while they exerted their usual competition in shooting and horseracing and the renowned game of hand  matters were going on thus pleasantly and prosperously in this motley community of white and red men when one morning two stark free trappers arrayed in the height of savage finery and mounted on steeds as fine and as fiery as themselves and all jingling with hawks bells came galloping with whoop and halloo into the camp  they were fresh from the winter encampment of the american fur company in the green river valley and had come to pay their old comrades of captain bonnevilles company a visit an idea may be formed from the scenes we have already given of conviviality in the wilderness of the manner in which these game birds were received by those of their feather in the camp what feasting what revelling what boasting what bragging what ranting and roaring and racing and gambling and squabbling and fighting ensued among these boon companions captain bonneville it is true maintained always a certain degree of law and order in his camp and checked each fierce excess but the trappers in their seasons of idleness and relaxation require a degree of license and indulgence to repay them for the long privations and almost incredible hardships of their periods of active service  in the midst of all this feasting and frolicking a freak of the tender passion intervened and wrought a complete change in the scene among the indian beauties in the camp of the eutaws and shoshonies the free trappers discovered two who had whilom figured as their squaws these connections frequently take place for a season and sometimes continue for years if not perpetually but are apt to be broken when the free trapper starts off suddenly on some distant and rough expedition  in the present instance these wild blades were anxious to regain their belles nor were the latter loath once more to come under their protection the free trapper combines in the eye of an indian girl all that is dashing and heroic in a warrior of her own racewhose gait and garb and bravery he emulateswith all that is gallant and glorious in the white man and then the indulgence with which he treats her the finery in which he decks her out the state in which she moves the sway she enjoys over both his purse and person instead of being the drudge and slave of an indian husband obliged to carry his pack and build his lodge and make his fire and bear his cross humors and dry blows no there is no comparison in the eyes of an aspiring belle of the wilderness between a free trapper and an indian brave  with respect to one of the parties the matter was easily arranged the beauty in question was a pert little eutaw wench that had been taken prisoner in some war excursion by a shoshonie she was readily ransomed for a few articles of trifling value and forthwith figured about the camp in fine array with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes and a tossedup coquettish air that made her the envy admiration and abhorrence of all the leatherndressed hardworking squaws of her acquaintance  as to the other beauty it was quite a different matter she had become the wife of a shoshonie brave it is true he had another wife of older date than the one in question who therefore took command in his household and treated his new spouse as a slave but the latter was the wife of his last fancy his latest caprice and was precious in his eyes all attempt to bargain with him therefore was useless the very proposition was repulsed with anger and disdain the spirit of the trapper was roused his pride was piqued as well as his passion he endeavored to prevail upon his quondam mistress to elope with him his horses were fleet the winter nights were long and dark before daylight they would be beyond the reach of pursuit and once at the encampment in green river valley they might set the whole band of shoshonies at defiance  the indian girl listened and longed her heart yearned after the ease and splendor of condition of a trappers bride and throbbed to be free from the capricious control of the premier squaw but she dreaded the failure of the plan and the fury of a shoshonie husband they parted the indian girl in tears and the madcap trapper more than ever with his thwarted passion  their interviews had probably been detected and the jealousy of the shoshonie brave aroused a clamor of angry voices was heard in his lodge with the sound of blows and of female weeping and lamenting at night as the trapper lay tossing on his pallet a soft voice whispered at the door of his lodge his mistress stood trembling before him she was ready to follow whithersoever he should lead  in an instant he was up and out he had two prime horses sure and swift of foot and of great wind with stealthy quiet they were brought up and saddled and in a few moments he and his prize were careering over the snow with which the whole country was covered in the eagerness of escape they had made no provision for their journey days must elapse before they could reach their haven of safety and mountains and prairies be traversed wrapped in all the desolation of winter for the present however they thought of nothing but flight urging their horses forward over the dreary wastes and fancying in the howling of every blast they heard the yell of the pursuer  at early dawn the shoshonie became aware of his loss mounting his swiftest horse he set off in hot pursuit he soon found the trail of the fugitives and spurred on in hopes of overtaking them the winds however which swept the valley had drifted the light snow into the prints made by the horses hoofs in a little while he lost all trace of them and was completely thrown out of the chase he knew however the situation of the camp toward which they were bound and a direct course through the mountains by which he might arrive there sooner than the fugitives through the most rugged defiles therefore he urged his course by day and night scarce pausing until he reached the camp it was some time before the fugitives made their appearance six days had they traversed the wintry wilds they came haggard with hunger and fatigue and their horses faltering under them the first object that met their eyes on entering the camp was the shoshonie brave he rushed knife in hand to plunge it in the heart that had proved false to him the trapper threw himself before the cowering form of his mistress and exhausted as he was prepared for a deadly struggle the shoshonie paused his habitual awe of the white man checked his arm the trappers friends crowded to the spot and arrested him a parley ensued a kind of crim con adjudication took place such as frequently occurs in civilized life a couple of horses were declared to be a fair compensation for the loss of a woman who had previously lost her heart with this the shoshonie brave was fain to pacify his passion he returned to captain bonnevilles camp somewhat crestfallen it is true but parried the officious condolements of his friends by observing that two good horses were very good pay for one bad wife     48       breaking up of winter quartersmove to green rivera      trapper and his riflean arrival in campa free trapper      and his squaw in distressstory of a blackfoot belle  the winter was now breaking up the snows were melted from the hills and from the lower parts of the mountains and the time for decamping had arrived captain bonneville dispatched a party to the caches who brought away all the effects concealed there and on the 1st of april 1835 the camp was broken up and every one on the move the white men and their allies the eutaws and shoshonies parted with many regrets and sincere expressions of goodwill for their intercourse throughout the winter had been of the most friendly kind  captain bonneville and his party passed by hams fork and reached the colorado or green river without accident on the banks of which they remained during the residue of the spring during this time they were conscious that a band of hostile indians were hovering about their vicinity watching for an opportunity to slay or steal but the vigilant precautions of captain bonneville baffled all their manoeuvres in such dangerous times the experienced mountaineer is never without his rifle even in camp on going from lodge to lodge to visit his comrades he takes it with him on seating himself in a lodge he lays it beside him ready to be snatched up when he goes out he takes it up as regularly as a citizen would his walkingstaff his rifle is his constant friend and protector  on the 10th of june the party was a little to the east of the wind river mountains where they halted for a time in excellent pasturage to give their horses a chance to recruit their strength for a long journey for it was captain bonnevilles intention to shape his course to the settlements having already been detained by the complication of his duties and by various losses and impediments far beyond the time specified in his leave of absence  while the party was thus reposing in the neighborhood of the wind river mountains a solitary free trapper rode one day into the camp and accosted captain bonneville he belonged he said to a party of thirty hunters who had just passed through the neighborhood but whom he had abandoned in consequence of their ill treatment of a brother trapper whom they had cast off from their party and left with his bag and baggage and an indian wife into the bargain in the midst of a desolate prairie the horseman gave a piteous account of the situation of this helpless pair and solicited the loan of horses to bring them and their effects to the camp  the captain was not a man to refuse assistance to any one in distress especially when there was a woman in the case horses were immediately dispatched with an escort to aid the unfortunate couple the next day they made their appearance with all their effects the man a stalwart mountaineer with a peculiarly game look the woman a young blackfoot beauty arrayed in the trappings and trinketry of a free trappers bride  finding the woman to be quickwitted and communicative captain bonneville entered into conversation with her and obtained from her many particulars concerning the habits and customs of her tribe especially their wars and huntings they pride themselves upon being the best legs of the mountains and hunt the buffalo on foot this is done in spring time when the frosts have thawed and the ground is soft the heavy buffaloes then sink over their hoofs at every step and are easily overtaken by the blackfeet whose fleet steps press lightly on the surface it is said however that the buffaloes on the pacific side of the rocky mountains are fleeter and more active than on the atlantic side those upon the plains of the columbia can scarcely be overtaken by a horse that would outstrip the same animal in the neighborhood of the platte the usual hunting ground of the blackfeet in the course of further conversation captain bonneville drew from the indian woman her whole story which gave a picture of savage life and of the drudgery and hardships to which an indian wife is subject  i was the wife said she of a blackfoot warrior and i served him faithfully who was so well served as he whose lodge was so well provided or kept so clean i brought wood in the morning and placed water always at hand i watched for his coming and he found his meat cooked and ready if he rose to go forth there was nothing to delay him i searched the thought that was in his heart to save him the trouble of speaking when i went abroad on errands for him the chiefs and warriors smiled upon me and the young braves spoke soft things in secret but my feet were in the straight path and my eyes could see nothing but him  when he went out to hunt or to war who aided to equip him but i when he returned i met him at the door i took his gun and he entered without further thought while he sat and smoked i unloaded his horses tied them to the stakes brought in their loads and was quickly at his feet if his moccasins were wet i took them off and put on others which were dry and warm i dressed all the skins he had taken in the chase he could never say to me why is it not done he hunted the deer the antelope and the buffalo and he watched for the enemy everything else was done by me when our people moved their camp he mounted his horse and rode away free as though he had fallen from the skies he had nothing to do with the labor of the camp it was i that packed the horses and led them on the journey when we halted in the evening and he sat with the other braves and smoked it was i that pitched his lodge and when he came to eat and sleep his supper and his bed were ready  i served him faithfully and what was my reward a cloud was always on his brow and sharp lightning on his tongue i was his dog and not his wife  who was it that scarred and bruised me it was he my brother saw how i was treated his heart was big for me he begged me to leave my tyrant and fly where could i go if retaken who would protect me my brother was not a chief he could not save me from blows and wounds perhaps death at length i was persuaded i followed my brother from the village he pointed away to the nez perces and bade me go and live in peace among them we parted on the third day i saw the lodges of the nez perces before me i paused for a moment and had no heart to go on but my horse neighed and i took it as a good sign and suffered him to gallop forward in a little while i was in the midst of the lodges as i sat silent on my horse the people gathered round me and inquired whence i came i told my story a chief now wrapped his blanket close around him and bade me dismount i obeyed he took my horse to lead him away my heart grew small within me i felt on parting with my horse as if my last friend was gone i had no words and my eyes were dry as he led off my horse a young brave stepped forward are you a chief of the people cried he do we listen to you in council and follow you in battle behold a stranger flies to our camp from the dogs of blackfeet and asks protection let shame cover your face the stranger is a woman and alone if she were a warrior or had a warrior at her side your heart would not be big enough to take her horse but he is yours by right of war you may claim him but lookhis bow was drawn and the arrow readyyou never shall cross his back the arrow pierced the heart of the horse and he fell dead  an old woman said she would be my mother she led me to her lodge my heart was thawed by her kindness and my eyes burst forth with tears like the frozen fountains in springtime she never changed but as the days passed away was still a mother to me the people were loud in praise of the young brave and the chief was ashamed i lived in peace  a party of trappers came to the village and one of them took me for his wife this is he i am very happy he treats me with kindness and i have taught him the language of my people as we were travelling this way some of the blackfeet warriors beset us and carried off the horses of the party we followed and my husband held a parley with them the guns were laid down and the pipe was lighted but some of the white men attempted to seize the horses by force and then a battle began the snow was deep the white men sank into it at every step but the red men with their snowshoes passed over the surface like birds and drove off many of the horses in sight of their owners with those that remained we resumed our journey at length words took place between the leader of the party and my husband he took away our horses which had escaped in the battle and turned us from his camp my husband had one good friend among the trappers that is he pointing to the man who had asked assistance for them he is a good man his heart is big when he came in from hunting and found that we had been driven away he gave up all his wages and followed us that he might speak good words for us to the white captain     49       rendezvous at wind rivercampaign of montero and his      brigade in the crow countrywars between the crows and      blackfeetdeathof arapooishblackfeet lurkerssagacity      of the horsedependence of the hunter on his horsereturn      to the settlements  on the 22d of june captain bonneville raised his camp and moved to the forks of wind river the appointed place of rendezvous in a few days he was joined there by the brigade of montero which had been sent in the preceding year to beat up the crow country and afterward proceed to the arkansas montero had followed the early part of his instructions after trapping upon some of the upper streams he proceeded to powder river here he fell in with the crow villages or bands who treated him with unusual kindness and prevailed upon him to take up his winter quarters among them  the crows at that time were struggling almost for existence with their old enemies the blackfeet who in the past year had picked off the flower of their warriors in various engagements and among the rest arapooish the friend of the white men that sagacious and magnanimous chief had beheld with grief the ravages which war was making in his tribe and that it was declining in force and must eventually be destroyed unless some signal blow could be struck to retrieve its fortunes in a pitched battle of the two tribes he made a speech to his warriors urging them to set everything at hazard in one furious charge which done he led the way into the thickest of the foe he was soon separated from his men and fell covered with wounds but his selfdevotion was not in vain the blackfeet were defeated and from that time the crows plucked up fresh heart and were frequently successful  montero had not been long encamped among them when he discovered that the blackfeet were hovering about the neighborhood one day the hunters came galloping into the camp and proclaimed that a band of the enemy was at hand the crows flew to arms leaped on their horses and dashed out in squadrons in pursuit they overtook the retreating enemy in the midst of a plain a desperate fight ensued the crows had the advantage of numbers and of fighting on horseback the greater part of the blackfeet were slain the remnant took shelter in a close thicket of willows where the horse could not enter whence they plied their bows vigorously  the crows drew off out of bowshot and endeavored by taunts and bravadoes to draw the warriors out of their retreat a few of the best mounted among them rode apart from the rest one of their number then advanced alone with that martial air and equestrian grace for which the tribe is noted when within an arrows flight of the thicket he loosened his rein urged his horse to full speed threw his body on the opposite side so as to hang by one leg and present no mark to the foe in this way he swept along in front of the thicket launching his arrows from under the neck of his steed then regaining his seat in the saddle he wheeled round and returned whooping and scoffing to his companions who received him with yells of applause  another and another horseman repeated this exploit but the blackfeet were not to be taunted out of their safe shelter the victors feared to drive desperate men to extremities so they forbore to attempt the thicket toward night they gave over the attack and returned allglorious with the scalps of the slain then came on the usual feasts and triumphs the scalpdance of warriors round the ghastly trophies and all the other fierce revelry of barbarous warfare when the braves had finished with the scalps they were as usual given up to the women and children and made the objects of new parades and dances they were then treasured up as invaluable trophies and decorations by the braves who had won them  it is worthy of note that the scalp of a white man either through policy or fear is treated with more charity than that of an indian the warrior who won it is entitled to his triumph if he demands it in such case the war party alone dance round the scalp it is then taken down and the shagged frontlet of a buffalo substituted in its place and abandoned to the triumph and insults of the million  to avoid being involved in these guerillas as well as to escape from the extremely social intercourse of the crows which began to be oppressive montero moved to the distance of several miles from their camps and there formed a winter cantonment of huts he now maintained a vigilant watch at night their horses which were turned loose to graze during the day under heedful eyes were brought in at night and shut up in strong pens built of large logs of cottonwood the snows during a portion of the winter were so deep that the poor animals could find but little sustenance here and there a tuft of grass would peer above the snow but they were in general driven to browse the twigs and tender branches of the trees when they were turned out in the morning the first moments of freedom from the confinement of the pen were spent in frisking and gambolling this done they went soberly and sadly to work to glean their scanty subsistence for the day in the meantime the men stripped the bark of the cottonwood tree for the evening fodder as the poor horses would return toward night with sluggish and dispirited air the moment they saw their owners approaching them with blankets filled with cottonwood bark their whole demeanor underwent a change a universal neighing and capering took place they would rush forward smell to the blankets paw the earth snort whinny and prance round with head and tail erect until the blankets were opened and the welcome provender spread before them these evidences of intelligence and gladness were frequently recounted by the trappers as proving the sagacity of the animal  these veteran rovers of the mountains look upon their horses as in some respects gifted with almost human intellect an old and experienced trapper when mounting guard upon the camp in dark nights and times of peril gives heedful attention to all the sounds and signs of the horses no enemy enters nor approaches the camp without attracting their notice and their movements not only give a vague alarm but it is said will even indicate to the knowing trapper the very quarter whence the danger threatens  in the daytime too while a hunter is engaged on the prairie cutting up the deer or buffalo he has slain he depends upon his faithful horse as a sentinel the sagacious animal sees and smells all round him and by his starting and whinnying gives notice of the approach of strangers there seems to be a dumb communion and fellowship a sort of fraternal sympathy between the hunter and his horse they mutually rely upon each other for company and protection and nothing is more difficult it is said than to surprise an experienced hunter on the prairie while his old and favorite steed is at his side  montero had not long removed his camp from the vicinity of the crows and fixed himself in his new quarters when the blackfeet marauders discovered his cantonment and began to haunt the vicinity he kept up a vigilant watch however and foiled every attempt of the enemy who at length seemed to have given up in despair and abandoned the neighborhood the trappers relaxed their vigilance therefore and one night after a day of severe labor no guards were posted and the whole camp was soon asleep toward midnight however the lightest sleepers were roused by the trampling of hoofs and giving the alarm the whole party were immediately on their legs and hastened to the pens the bars were down but no enemy was to be seen or heard and the horses being all found hard by it was supposed the bars had been left down through negligence all were once more asleep when in about an hour there was a second alarm and it was discovered that several horses were missing the rest were mounted and so spirited a pursuit took place that eighteen of the number carried off were regained and but three remained in possession of the enemy traps for wolves had been set about the camp the preceding day in the morning it was discovered that a blackfoot was entrapped by one of them but had succeeded in dragging it off his trail was followed for a long distance which he must have limped alone at length he appeared to have fallen in with some of his comrades who had relieved him from his painful encumbrance  these were the leading incidents of monteros campaign in the crow country the united parties now celebrated the 4th of july in rough hunters style with hearty conviviality after which captain bonneville made his final arrangements leaving montero with a brigade of trappers to open another campaign he put himself at the head of the residue of his men and set off on his return to civilized life we shall not detail his journey along the course of the nebraska and so from point to point of the wilderness until he and his band reached the frontier settlements on the 22d of august  here according to his own account his cavalcade might have been taken for a procession of tatterdemalion savages for the men were ragged almost to nakedness and had contracted a wildness of aspect during three years of wandering in the wilderness a few hours in a populous town however produced a magical metamorphosis hats of the most ample brim and longest nap coats with buttons that shone like mirrors and pantaloons of the most ample plenitude took place of the wellworn trappers equipments and the happy wearers might be seen strolling about in all directions scattering their silver like sailors just from a cruise  the worthy captain however seems by no means to have shared the excitement of his men on finding himself once more in the thronged resorts of civilized life but on the contrary to have looked back to the wilderness with regret though the prospect says he of once more tasting the blessings of peaceful society and passing days and nights under the calm guardianship of the laws was not without its attractions yet to those of us whose whole lives had been spent in the stirring excitement and perpetual watchfulness of adventures in the wilderness the change was far from promising an increase of that contentment and inward satisfaction most conducive to happiness he who like myself has roved almost from boyhood among the children of the forest and over the unfurrowed plains and rugged heights of the western wastes will not be startled to learn that notwithstanding all the fascinations of the world on this civilized side of the mountains i would fain make my bow to the splendors and gayeties of the metropolis and plunge again amidst the hardships and perils of the wilderness  we have only to add that the affairs of the captain have been satisfactorily arranged with the war department and that he is actually in service at fort gibson on our western frontier where we hope he may meet with further opportunities of indulging his peculiar tastes and of collecting graphic and characteristic details of the great western wilds and their motley inhabitants  we here close our picturings of the rocky mountains and their wild inhabitants and of the wild life that prevails there which we have been anxious to fix on record because we are aware that this singular state of things is full of mutation and must soon undergo great changes if not entirely pass away the fur trade itself which has given life to all this portraiture is essentially evanescent rival parties of trappers soon exhaust the streams especially when competition renders them heedless and wasteful of the beaver the furbearing animals extinct a complete change will come over the scene the gay free trapper and his steed decked out in wild array and tinkling with bells and trinketry the savage war chief plumed and painted and ever on the prowl the traders cavalcade winding through defiles or over naked plains with the stealthy war party lurking on its trail the buffalo chase the hunting camp the mad carouse in the midst of danger the night attack the stampede the scamper the fierce skirmish among rocks and cliffsall this romance of savage life which yet exists among the mountains will then exist but in frontier story and seem like the fictions of chivalry or fairy tale  some new system of things or rather some new modification will succeed among the roving people of this vast wilderness but just as opposite perhaps to the inhabitants of civilization the great chippewyan chain of mountains and the sandy and volcanic plains which extend on either side are represented as incapable of cultivation the pasturage which prevails there during a certain portion of the year soon withers under the aridity of the atmosphere and leaves nothing but dreary wastes an immense belt of rocky mountains and volcanic plains several hundred miles in width must ever remain an irreclaimable wilderness intervening between the abodes of civilization and affording a last refuge to the indian here roving tribes of hunters living in tents or lodges and following the migrations of the game may lead a life of savage independence where there is nothing to tempt the cupidity of the white man the amalgamation of various tribes and of white men of every nation will in time produce hybrid races like the mountain tartars of the caucasus possessed as they are of immense droves of horses should they continue their present predatory and warlike habits they may in time become a scourge to the civilized frontiers on either side of the mountains as they are at present a terror to the traveller and trader  the facts disclosed in the present work clearly manifest the policy of establishing military posts and a mounted force to protect our traders in their journeys across the great western wilds and of pushing the outposts into the very heart of the singular wilderness we have laid open so as to maintain some degree of sway over the country and to put an end to the kind of blackmail levied on all occasions by the savage chivalry of the mountains     appendix  nathaniel j wyeth and the trade of the far west  we have brought captain bonneville to the end of his western campaigning yet we cannot close this work without subjoining some particulars concerning the fortunes of his contemporary mr wyeth anecdotes of whose enterprise have occasionally been interwoven in the partycolored web of our narrative wyeth effected his intention of establishing a trading post on the portneuf which he named fort hall here for the first time the american flag was unfurled to the breeze that sweeps the great naked wastes of the central wilderness leaving twelve men here with a stock of goods to trade with the neighboring tribes he prosecuted his journey to the columbia where he established another post called fort williams on wappatoo island at the mouth of the wallamut this was to be the head factory of his company whence they were to carry on their fishing and trapping operations and their trade with the interior and where they were to receive and dispatch their annual ship  the plan of mr wyeth appears to have been well concerted he had observed that the rocky mountain fur company the bands of free trappers as well as the indians west of the mountains depended for their supplies upon goods brought from st louis which in consequence of the expenses and risks of a long land carriage were furnished them at an immense advance on first cost he had an idea that they might be much more cheaply supplied from the pacific side horses would cost much less on the borders of the columbia than at st louis the transportation by land was much shorter and through a country much more safe from the hostility of savage tribes which on the route from and to st louis annually cost the lives of many men on this idea he grounded his plan he combined the salmon fishery with the fur trade a fortified trading post was to be established on the columbia to carry on a trade with the natives for salmon and peltries and to fish and trap on their own account once a year a ship was to come from the united states to bring out goods for the interior trade and to take home the salmon and furs which had been collected part of the goods thus brought out were to be dispatched to the mountains to supply the trapping companies and the indian tribes in exchange for their furs which were to be brought down to the columbia to be sent home in the next annual ship and thus an annual round was to be kept up the profits on the salmon it was expected would cover all the expenses of the ship so that the goods brought out and the furs carried home would cost nothing as to freight  his enterprise was prosecuted with a spirit intelligence and perseverance that merited success all the details that we have met with prove him to be no ordinary man he appears to have the mind to conceive and the energy to execute extensive and striking plans he had once more reared the american flag in the lost domains of astoria and had he been enabled to maintain the footing he had so gallantly effected he might have regained for his country the opulent trade of the columbia of which our statesmen have negligently suffered us to be dispossessed  it is needless to go into a detail of the variety of accidents and crosspurposes which caused the failure of his scheme they were such as all undertakings of the kind involving combined operations by sea and land are liable to what he most wanted was sufficient capital to enable him to endure incipient obstacles and losses and to hold on until success had time to spring up from the midst of disastrous experiments  it is with extreme regret we learn that he has recently been compelled to dispose of his establishment at wappatoo island to the hudsons bay company who it is but justice to say have according to his own account treated him throughout the whole of his enterprise with great fairness friendship and liberality that company therefore still maintains an unrivalled sway over the whole country washed by the columbia and its tributaries it has in fact as far as its chartered powers permit followed out the splendid scheme contemplated by mr astor when he founded his establishment at the mouth of the columbia from their emporium of vancouver companies are sent forth in every direction to supply the interior posts to trade with the natives and to trap upon the various streams these thread the rivers traverse the plains penetrate to the heart of the mountains extend their enterprises northward to the russian possessions and southward to the confines of california their yearly supplies are received by sea at vancouver and thence their furs and peltries are shipped to london they likewise maintain a considerable commerce in wheat and lumber with the pacific islands and to the north with the russian settlements  though the company by treaty have a right to a participation only in the trade of these regions and are in fact but tenants on sufferance yet have they quietly availed themselves of the original oversight and subsequent supineness of the american government to establish a monopoly of the trade of the river and its dependencies and are adroitly proceeding to fortify themselves in their usurpation by securing all the strong points of the country  fort george originally astoria which was abandoned on the removal of the main factory to vancouver was renewed in 1830 and is now kept up as a fortified post and trading house all the places accessible to shipping have been taken possession of and posts recently established at them by the company  the great capital of this association their long established system their hereditary influence over the indian tribes their internal organization which makes every thing go on with the regularity of a machine and the low wages of their people who are mostly canadians give them great advantages over the american traders nor is it likely the latter will ever be able to maintain any footing in the land until the question of territorial right is adjusted between the two countries the sooner that takes place the better it is a question too serious to national pride if not to national interests to be slurred over and every year is adding to the difficulties which environ it  the fur trade which is now the main object of enterprise west of the rocky mountains forms but a part of the real resources of the country beside the salmon fishery of the columbia which is capable of being rendered a considerable source of profit the great valleys of the lower country below the elevated volcanic plateau are calculated to give sustenance to countless flocks and herds and to sustain a great population of graziers and agriculturists  such for instance is the beautiful valley of the wallamut from which the establishment at vancouver draws most of its supplies here the company holds mills and farms and has provided for some of its superannuated officers and servants this valley above the falls is about fifty miles wide and extends a great distance to the south the climate is mild being sheltered by lateral ranges of mountains while the soil for richness has been equalled to the best of the missouri lands the valley of the river des chutes is also admirably calculated for a great grazing country all the best horses used by the company for the mountains are raised there the valley is of such happy temperature that grass grows there throughout the year and cattle may be left out to pasture during the winter  these valleys must form the grand points of commencement of the future settlement of the country but there must be many such en folded in the embraces of these lower ranges of mountains which though at present they lie waste and uninhabited and to the eye of the trader and trapper present but barren wastes would in the hands of skilful agriculturists and husbandmen soon assume a different aspect and teem with waving crops or be covered with flocks and herds  the resources of the country too while in the hands of a company restricted in its trade can be but partially called forth but in the hands of americans enjoying a direct trade with the east indies would be brought into quickening activity and might soon realize the dream of mr astor in giving rise to a flourishing commercial empire     wreck of a japanese junk on the northwest coast  the following extract of a letter which we received lately from mr wyeth may be interesting as throwing some light upon the question as to the manner in which america has been peopled  are you aware of the fact that in the winter of 1833 a japanese junk was wrecked on the northwest coast in the neighborhood of queen charlottes island and that all but two of the crew then much reduced by starvation and disease during a long drift across the pacific were killed by the natives the two fell into the hands of the hudsons bay company and were sent to england i saw them on my arrival at vancouver in 1834     instructions

purpose of enabling you to carry into execution your designs of exploring the country to the rocky mountains and beyond with a view of ascertaining the nature and character of the various tribes of indians inhabiting those regions the trade which might be profitably carried on with them the quality of the soil the productions the minerals the natural history the climate the geography and topography as well as geology of the various parts of the country within the limits of the territories belonging to the united states between our frontier and the pacific has been duly considered and submitted to the war department for approval and has been sanctioned  you are therefore authorised to be absent from the army until october 1833  it is understood that the government is to be at no expence in reference to your proposed expedition it having originated with yourself and all that you required was the permission from the proper authority to undertake the enterprise you will naturally in providing yourself for the expedition provide suitable instruments and especially the best maps of the interior to be found it is desirable besides what is enumerated as the object of enterprise that you note particularly the number of warriors that may belong to each tribe or nation that you may meet with their alliances with other tribes and their relative position as to a state of peace or war and whether their friendly or warlike dispositions towards each other are recent or of long standing you will gratify us by describing the manner of their making war of the mode of subsisting themselves during a state of war and a state of peace their arms and the effect of them whether they act on foot or on horse back detailing the discipline and manuvers of the war parties the power of their horses size and general discription in short any information which you may conceive would be useful to the government you will avail yourself of every opportunity of informing us of your position and progress and at the expiration of your leave of absence will join your proper station  i have the honor to be sir your ot st  signed alexr macomb maj genl comg  to cap b l e
