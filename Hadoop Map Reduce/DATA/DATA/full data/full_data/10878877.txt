augusta and her publisher  now mark you my masters this is comedyold play   everybody who has any connection with birmingham will be acquainted with the vast publishing establishment still known by the short title of meesons which is perhaps the most remarkable institution of the sort in europe there areor rather there were at the date of the beginning of this historythree partners in meesonsmeeson himself the managing partner mr addison and mr roscoeand people in birmingham used to say that there were others interested in the affair for meesons was a company limited  however this may be meeson and co was undoubtedly a commercial marvel it employed more than two thousand hands and its works lit throughout with the electric light cover two acres and a quarter of land one hundred commercial travellers at three pounds a week and a commission went forth east and west and north and south to sell the books of meeson which were largely religious in their nature in all lands and fiveandtwenty tame authors who were illustrated by thirteen tame artists satat salaries ranging from one to five hundred a yearin vaultlike hutches in the basement and week by week poured out that hatwork for which meesons was justly famous then there were editors and viceeditors and heads of the various departments and subheads and financial secretaries and readers and many managers but what their names were no man knew because at meesons all the employees of the great house were known by numbers personalities and personal responsibility being the abomination of the firm nor was it allowed to anyone having dealings with these items ever to see the same number twice presumably for fear lest the number should remember that he was a man and a brother and his heart should melt towards the unfortunate and the financial interests of meesons should suffer in short meesons was an establishment created for and devoted to moneymaking and the fact was kept studiously and even insolently before the eyes of everybody connected with itwhich was of course as it should be in this happy land of commerce after all that has been written the reader will not be surprised to learn that the partners in meesons were rich beyond the dreams of avarice their palaces would have been a wonder even in ancient babylon and would have excited admiration in the corruptest and most luxurious days of rome where could one see such horses such carriages such galleries of sculpture or such collections of costly gems as at the palatial halls of messrs meeson addison and roscoe  and to think as the mighty meeson himself would say with a lordly wave of his right hand to some astonished wretch of an author whom he has chosen to overwhelm with the sight of this magnificence to think that all this comes out of the brains of chaps like you why young man i tell you that if all the money that has been paid to you scribblers since the days of elizabeth were added together it would not come up to my little pile but mind you it aint so much fiction that has done the trickits religion its piety as pays especially when its printed  then the unsophisticated youth would go away his heart too full for words but pondering how these things were and byandby he would pass into the meeson meltingpot and learn something about it  one day king meeson sat in his counting house counting out his money or at least looking over the books of the firm he was in a very bad temper and his heavy brows were wrinkled up in a way calculated to make the countinghouse clerks shake on their stools meesons had a branch establishment at sydney in australia which establishment had until lately been payingit is true not as well as the english one but still fifteen or twenty per cent but now a wonder had come to pass a great american publishing firm had started an opposition house in melbourne and their cuteness was more than the cuteness of meeson did meesons publish an edition of the works of any standard author at threepence per volume the opposition company brought out the same work at twopencehalfpenny did meesons subsidise a newspaper to puff their undertakings the opposition firm subsidised two to cry them down and so on and now the results of all this were becoming apparent for the financial year just ended the australian branch had barely earned a beggarly net dividend of seven per cent  no wonder mr meeson was furious and no wonder that the clerks shook upon their stools  this must be seen into no 3 said mr meeson bringing his fist down with a bang on to the balancesheet  no 3 was one of the editors a mildeyed little man with blue spectacles he had once been a writer of promise but somehow meesons had got him for its own and turned him into a publishers hack  quite so sir he said humbly it is very badit is dreadful to think of meesons coming down to seven per centseven per cent and he held up his hands  dont stand there like a stuck pig no 3 said mr meeson fiercely but suggest something  well sir said no 3 more humbly than ever for he was terribly afraid of his employer i think perhaps that somebody had better go to australia and see what can be done  i know one thing that can be done said mr meeson with a snarl all those fools out there can be sacked and sacked they shall be and whats more ill go and sack them myself that will do no 3 that will do and no 3 departed and glad enough he was to go  as he went a clerk arrived and gave a card to the great man  miss augusta smithers he read then with a grunt show miss augusta smithers in  presently miss augusta smithers arrived she was a tall wellformed young lady of about twentyfive with pretty golden hair deep grey eyes a fine forehead and a delicate mouth just now however she looked very nervous  well miss smithers what is it asked the publisher  i came mr meesoni came about my book  your book miss smithers this was an affectation of forgetfulness let me seeforgive me but we publish so many books oh yes i remember jemimas vow oh well i believe it is going on fairly  i saw you advertised the sixteenth thousand the other day put in miss smithers apologetically  did wedid we ah then you know more about it than i do and he looked at his visitor in a way that conveyed clearly enough that he considered the interview was ended  miss smithers rose and then with a spasmodic effort sat down again the fact is mr meeson she saidthe fact is that i thought that perhaps as jemimas vow had been such a great success you might perhapsin short you might be inclined to give me some small sum in addition to what i have received  mr meeson looked up his forehead was wrinkled till the shaggy eyebrows nearly hid the sharp little eyes  what he said what  at this moment the door opened and a young gentleman came slowly in he was a very nicelooking young man tall and well shaped with a fair skin and jolly blue eyesin short a typical young englishman of the better sort aetate suo twentyfour i have said that he came slowly in but that scarcely conveys the gay and dégagé air of independence which pervaded this young man and which would certainly have struck any observer as little short of shocking when contrasted with the wormlike attitude of those who crept round the feet of meeson this young man had not indeed even taken the trouble to remove his hat which was stuck upon the back of his head his hands were in his pockets a sacrilegious whistle hovered on his lips and he opened the door of the sanctum sanctorum of the meeson establishment with a kick  how do uncle he said to the commercial terror who was sitting there behind his formidable books addressing him even as though he were an ordinary man why whats up  just then however he caught sight of the very handsome young lady who was seated in the office and his whole demeanour underwent a most remarkable change out came the hands from his pockets off went the hat and turning he bowed really rather nicely considering how impromptu the whole performance was  what is it eustace asked mr meeson sharply  oh nothing uncle nothingit can bide and without waiting for an invitation he took a chair and sat down in such a position that he could see miss smithers without being seen of his uncle  i was saying miss smithers or rather i was going to say went on the elder meeson that in short i do not in the least understand what you can mean you will remember that you were paid a sum of fifty pounds for the copyright of jemimas vow  great heavens murmured master eustace behind what a do  at the time an alternative agreement offering you seven per cent on the published price of the book was submitted to you and had you accepted it you would doubtless have realized a larger sum and mr meeson contracted his hairy eyebrows and gazed at the poor girl in a way that was to say the least alarming but augusta though she felt sadly inclined to flee still stood to her guns for to tell the truth her need was very great  i could not afford to wait for the seven per cent mr meeson she said humbly  oh ye gods seven per cent when he makes about fortyfive murmured eustace in the background  possibly miss smithers possibly went on the great man you must really forgive me if i am not acquainted with the exact condition of your private affairs i am however aware from experience that the money matters of most writing people are a little embarrassed  augusta winced and mr meeson rising heavily from his chair went to a large safe which stood near and extracted from it a bundle of agreements these he glanced at one by one till he found what he was looking for  here is the agreement he said let me see ah i thought socopyright fifty pounds half proceeds of rights of translation and a clause binding you to offer any future work you may produce during the next five years to our house on the seven per cent agreement or a sum not exceeding one hundred pounds for the copyright now miss smithers what have you to say you signed this paper of your own free will it so happens that we have made a large profit on your book indeed i dont mind telling you that we have got as much as we gave you back from america for the sale of the american rights but that is no ground for your coming to ask for more money than you agreed to accept i never heard of such a thing in the whole course of my professional experience never and he paused and once more eyed her sternly  at any rate there ought to be something to come to me from the rights of translationi saw in the paper that the book was to be translated into french and german said augusta faintly  oh yes no doubteustace oblige me by touching the bell  the young gentleman did so and a tall melancholylooking clerk appeared  no 18 snarled mr meeson in the tone of peculiar amiability that he reserved for his employees make out the translation account of jemimas vow and fill up a cheque of balance due to the author  no 18 vanished like a thin unhappy ghost and mr meeson once more addressed the girl before him if you want money miss smithers he said you had better write us another book i am not going to deny that your work is good worka little too deep and not quite orthodox enough perhaps but still good i tested it myself when it came to handwhich is a thing i dont often doand saw it was good selling quality and you see i didnt make a mistake i believe jemimas vow will sell twenty thousand without stoppingheres the account  as he spoke the spectrelike clerk put down a neatlyruled bit of paper and an unsigned cheque on the desk before his employer and then smiled a shadowy smile and vanished  mr meeson glanced through the account signed the cheque and handed it together with the account to augusta who proceeded to read it it ran thus   augusta smithers in account with meeson  co                                                 £  s d to sale of right of translation of             7  0 0 jemimas vow

                                 augusta looked and then slowly crumpled up the cheque in her hand  if i understand mr meeson she said you have sold the two rights of translation of my book which you persuaded me to leave in your hands for £14 out of which i am to receive £3 1s  yes miss smithers will you be so kind as to sign the receipt the fact is that i have a good deal of business to attend to  no mr meeson suddenly said augusta rising to her feet and looking exceedingly handsome and imposing in her anger no i will not sign the receipt and i will not take this cheque and what is more i will not write you any more books you have entrapped me you have taken advantage of my ignorance and inexperience and entrapped me so that for five years i shall be nothing but a slave to you and although i am now one of the most popular writers in the country shall be obliged to accept a sum for my books upon which i cannot live do you know that yesterday i was offered a thousand pounds for the copyright of a book like jemimas vowits a large sum but i have the letter yes and i have the book in manuscript now and if i could publish it i should be lifted out of poverty together with my poor little sister and she gave a sob but she went on i cannot publish it and i will not let you have it and be treated like this i had rather starve i will publish nothing for five years and i will write to the papers and say whybecause i have been cheated mr meeson  cheated thundered the great man be careful young lady mind what you are saying i have a witness eustace you hear cheated eustace cheated  i hear said eustace grimly  yes mr meeson i said cheated and i will repeat it whether i am locked up for it or not good morning mr meeson and she curtseyed to him and then suddenly burst into a flood of tears  in a minute eustace was by her side  dont cry miss smithers for heavens sake dont i cant bear to see it he said  she looked up her beautiful grey eyes full of tears and tried to smile  thank you she said i am very silly but i am so disappointed if you only knew there i will go thank you and in another instant she had drawn herself up and left the room  well said mr meeson senior who had been sitting at his desk with his great mouth open apparently too much astonished to speak well there is a vixen for you but shell come round ive known them to do that sort of thing beforethere are one or two down there and he jerked his thumb in the direction where the twenty and five tame authors sat each like a rabbit in his little hutch and did hatwork by the yard who carried on like that but they are quiet enough nowthey dont show much spirit now i know how to deal with that sort of thinghalfpay and a double tale of copythats the ticket why that girl will be worth fifteen hundred a year to the house what do you think of it young man eh  i think answered his nephew on whose goodtempered face a curious look of contempt and anger had gathered i think that you ought to be ashamed of yourself     chapter ii  how eustace was disinherited   there was a pausea dreadful pause the flash had left the cloud but the answering thunder had not burst upon the ear mr meeson gasped then he took up the cheque which augusta had thrown upon the table and slowly crumpled it  what did you say young man he said at last in a cold hard voice  i said that you ought to be ashamed of yourself answered his nephew standing his ground bravely and what is more i meant it  oh now will you be so kind as to explain exactly why you said that and why you meant it  i meant it answered his nephew speaking in a full strong voice because that girl was right when she said that you had cheated her and you know that she was right i have seen the accounts of jemimas vowi saw them this morningand you have already made more than a thousand pounds clear profit on the book and then when she comes to ask you for something over the beggarly fifty pounds which you doled out to her you refuse and offer her three pounds as her share of the translation rightsthree pounds as against your eleven  go on interrupted his uncle pray go on  all right i am going that is not all you actually avail yourself of a disgraceful trick to entrap this unfortunate girl into an agreement whereby she becomes a literary bondslave for five years as soon as you see that she has genius you tell her that the expense of bringing out her book and of advertising up her name c c c will be very greatso great indeed that you cannot undertake it unless indeed she agrees to let you have the first offer of everything she writes for five years to come at somewhere about a fourth of the usual rate of a successful authors paythough of course you dont tell her that you take advantage of her inexperience to bind her by this iniquitous contract knowing that the end of it will be that you will advance her a little money and get her into your power and then will send her down there to the hutches where all the spirit and originality and genius will be crushed out of her work and she will become a hatwriter like the rest of themfor meesons is a strictly commercial undertaking you know and meesons public dont like genius they like their literature dull and holyand its an infernal shame thats what it is uncle and the young man whose blue eyes were by this time flashing fire for he had worked himself up as he went along brought his fist down with a bang upon the writing table by way of emphasising his words  have you done said his uncle  yes ive done and i hope that i have put it plain  very well and now might i ask you supposing that you should ever come to manage this business if your sentiments accurately represent the system upon which you would proceed  of course they do i am not going to turn cheat for anybody  thank you they seem to have taught you the art of plain speaking up at oxfordthough it appears with a sneer they taught you very little else well then now it is my turn to speak and i tell you what it is young man you will either instantly beg my pardon for what you have said or you will leave meesons for good and all  i wont beg your pardon for speaking the truth said eustace hotly the fact is that here you never hear the truth all these poor devils creep and crawl about you and darent call their souls their own i shall be devilish glad to get out of this place i can tell you all this chickery and pokery makes me sick the place stinks and reeks of sharp practice and moneymakingmoneymaking by fair means or foul  the elder man had up till now at all events to outward appearance kept his temper but this last flower of vigorous english was altogether too much for one whom the possession of so much money had for many years shielded from hearing unpleasant truths put roughly the mans face grew like a devils his thick eyebrows contracted themselves and his pale lips quivered with fury for a few seconds he could not speak so great was his emotion when at length he did his voice was as thick and laden with rage as a dense mist is with rain  you impudent young rascal he began you ungrateful foundling do you suppose that when my brother left you to starvewhich was all that you were fit fori picked you out of the gutter for this that you should have the insolence to come and tell me how to conduct my business now young man ill just tell you what it is you can be off and conduct a business of your own on whatever principles you choose get out of meesons sir and never dare to show your nose here again or ill give the porters orders to hustle you off the premises and now that isnt all ive done with you never you look to me for another sixpence im not going to support you any longer i can tell you and whats more do you know what im going to do just now im going off to old toddthats my lawyerand im going to tell him to make another will and to leave every farthing i haveand that isnt much short of two millions one way and anotherto addison and roscoe they dont want it but that dont matter you shant have itno not a farthing of it and i wont have a pile like that frittered away in charities and mismanagement there now my fine young gentleman just be off and see if your new business principles will get you a living  all right uncle im going said the young man quietly i quite understand what our quarrel means for me and to tell you the truth i am not sorry i have never wished to be dependent on you or to have anything to do with a business carried on as meesons is i have a hundred a year my mother left me and with the help of that and my education i hope to make a living still i dont want to part from you in anger because you have been very kind to me at times and as you remind me you picked me out of the gutter when i was orphaned or not far from it so i hope you will shake hands before i go  ah snarled his uncle you want to pipe down now do you but that wont do off you go and mind you dont set foot in pompadour hall mr meesons seat unless it is to get your clothes come cut  you misunderstand me said eustace with a touch of native dignity which became him very well probably we shall not meet again and i did not wish to part in anger that was all good morning and he bowed and left the office  confound him muttered his uncle as the door closed hes a good plucked oneshowed spirit but ill show spirit too meeson is a man of his word cut him off with a shilling not i cut him off with nothing at all and yet curse it i like the lad well ive done with him thanks to that minx of a smithers girl perhaps hes sweet on her then they can go and starve together and be hanged to them she had better keep out of my way for she shall smart for this so sure as my name is jonathan meeson ill keep her up to the letter of that agreement and if she tries to publish a book inside of this country or out of it ill crush heryes ill crush her if it cost me five thousand to do it and with a snarl he dropped his fist heavily upon the table before him  then he rose put poor augustas agreement carefully back into the safe which he shut with a savage snap and proceeded to visit the various departments of his vast establishment and to make such hay therein as had never before been dreamt of in the classic halls of meesons  to this hour the clerks of the great house talk of that dreadful day with bated breathfor as bloody hector raged through the greeks so did the great meeson rage through his hundred departments in the very first office he caught a wretched clerk eating sardine sandwiches without a moments hesitation he took the sandwiches and threw them through the window  do you suppose i pay you to come and eat your filthy sandwiches here he asked savagely there now you can go and look for them and see you here you neednt trouble to come back you idle worthless fellow off you go and remember you need not send to me for a character now thendouble quick  the unfortunate departed feebly remonstrating and meeson having glared around at the other clerks and warned them that unless they were carefulvery carefulthey would soon follow in his tracks continued his course of devastation  presently he met an editor no 7 it was who was bringing him an agreement to sign he snatched it from him and glanced through it  what do you mean by bringing me a thing like this he said its all wrong  it is exactly as you dictated to me yesterday sir said the editor indignantly  what do you mean to contradict me roared meeson look here no 7 you and i had better part now no words your salary will be paid to you till the end of the month and if you would like to bring an action for wrongful dismissal why im your man good morning no 7 good morning  next he crossed a courtyard where by slipping stealthily around the corner he came upon a jolly little errand boy who was enjoying a solitary game of marbles  whack came his cane across the seat of that errand boys trousers and in another minute he had followed the editor and the sandwichdevouring clerk  and so the merry game went on for half an hour or more till at last mr meeson was fain to cease his troubling being too exhausted to continue his destroying course but next morning there was promotion going on in the great publishing house eleven vacancies had to be filled  a couple of glasses of brown sherry and a few sandwiches which he hastily swallowed at a neighboring restaurant quickly restored him however and jumping into a cab he drove post haste to his lawyers messrs todd and james  is mr todd in he said to the managing clerk who came forward bowing obsequiously to the richest man in birmingham  mr todd will be disengaged in a few minutes sir he said may i offer you the times  damn the times was the polite answer i dont come here to read newspapers tell mr todd i must see him at once or else i shall go elsewhere  i am much afraid sirbegan the managing clerk  mr meeson jumped up and grabbed his hat now then which is it to be he said  oh certainly sir pray be seated answered the manager in great alarmmeesons business was not a thing to be lightly lost i will see mr todd instantly and he vanished  almost simultaneously with his departure an old lady was unceremoniously bundled out of an inner room clutching feebly at a reticule full of papers and proclaiming loudly that her head was going round and round the poor old soul was just altering her will for the eighteenth time in favor of a brand new charity highly recommended by royalty and to be suddenly shot from the revered presence of her lawyer out into the outer darkness of the clerks office was really too much for her  in another minute mr meeson was being warmly even enthusiastically greeted by mr todd himself mr todd was a nervouslooking jumpy little man who spoke in jerks and gushes in such a way as to remind one of a firehose through which water was being pumped intermittently  how do you do my dear sir delighted to have this pleasure he began with a sudden gush and then suddenly dried up as he noticed the ominous expression on the great mans brow i am sure i am very sorry that you were kept waiting my dear sir but i was at the moment engaged with an excellent and most christian testator  here he suddenly jumped and dried up again for mr meeson without the slightest warning ejaculated curse your christian testator and look here todd just you see that it does not happen again im a christian testator too and christians of my cut arent accustomed to be kept standing about just like officeboys or authors see that it dont happen again todd  i am sure i am exceedingly grieved circumstances  oh never mind all thati want my will  willwillforgive mea little confused thats all your manner is so full of hearty old middleages kind of vigour  here he stopped more suddenly even than usual for mr meeson fixed him with his savage eye and then jerked himself out of the room to look for the document in question  little idiot muttered meeson ill give him the sack too if he isnt more careful by jove why should i not have my own resident solicitor i could get a sharp hand with a damaged character for about £300 a year and i pay that old todd quite £2000 there is a vacant place in the hutches that i could turn into an office hang me if i dont do it i will make that little chirping grasshopper jump to some purpose ill warrant and he chuckled at the idea  just then mr todd returned with the will and before he could begin to make any explanations his employer cut him short with a sharp order to read the gist of it  this the lawyer proceeded to do it was very short and with the exception of a few legacies amounting in all to about twenty thousand pounds bequeathed all the testators vast fortune and estates including his by far the largest interest in the great publishing house and his palace with the paintings and other valuable contents known as pompadour hall to his nephew eustace h meeson  very well he said when the reading was finished now give it to me  mr todd obeyed and handed the document to his patron who deliberately rent it into fragments with his strong fingers and then completed its destruction by tearing it with his big white teeth this done he mixed the little pieces up threw them on the floor and stamped upon them with an air of malignity that almost frightened jerky little mr todd  now then he grimly said theres an end of the old love so lets on with the new take your pen and receive my instructions for my will  mr todd did as he was bid  i leave all my property real and personal to be divided in equal shares between my two partners alfred tom addison and cecil spooner roscoe there thats short and sweet and one way and another means a couple of millions  good heavens sir jerked out mr todd why do you mean to quite cut out your nephewand the other legatees he added by way of an afterthought  of course i do that is as regards my nephew the legatees may stand as before  well all i have to say went on the little man astonished into honesty is that it is the most shameful thing i ever heard of  indeed mr todd is it well now may i ask you am i leaving this property or are you dont trouble yourself to answer that however but just attend either you draw up that will at once while i wait or you say goodbye to about £2000 a year for thats what meesons business is worth i reckon now you take your choice  mr todd did take his choice in under an hour the will which was very short was drawn and engrossed  now then said meeson addressing himself to mr todd and the managing clerk as he took the quill between his fingers to sign do you two bear in mind that at the moment i execute this will i am of sound mind memory and understanding there you are now do you two witness                                       it was night and king capital in the shape of mr meeson sat alone at dinner in his palatial diningroom at pompadour dinner was over the powdered footman had departed with stately tread and the head butler was just placing the decanters of richly coloured wine before the solitary lord of all the dinner had been a melancholy failure dish after dish the cost of any one of which would have fed a poor child for a month had been brought up and handed to the master only to be found fault with and sent away on that night mr meeson had no appetite  johnson he said to the butler when he was sure the footman could not hear him has mr eustace been here  yes sir  has he gone  yes sir he came to fetch his things and then went away in a cab  where to  i dont know sir he told the man to drive to birmingham  did he leave any message  yes sir he bade me say that you should not be troubled with him again but that he was sorry that you had parted from him in anger  why did you not give me that message before  because mr eustace said i was not to give it unless you asked after him  very good johnson  yes sir  you will give orders that mr eustaces name is not to be mentioned in this house again any servant mentioning mr eustaces name will be dismissed  very good sir and johnson went  mr meeson gazed round him he looked at the long array of glass and silver at the spotless napery and costly flowers he looked at the walls hung with works of art which whatever else they might be were at least expensive at the mirrors and the soft waxlights at the marble mantelpieces and the bright warm fires for it was november at the rich wall paper and the soft deephued carpet and reflected that they were all his and then he sighed and his coarse heavy face sank in and grew sad of what use was this last extremity of luxury to him he had nobody to leave it to and to speak the truth it gave him but little pleasure such pleasure as he had in life was derived from making money not from spending it the only times when he was really happy were when he was in his counting house directing the enterprises of his vast establishment and adding sovereign by sovereign to his enormous accumulations that had been his one joy for forty years and it was still his joy  and then he fell to thinking of his nephew the only son of his brother whom he had once loved before he lost himself in publishing books and making money and sighed he had been attached to the lad in his own coarse way and it was a blow to him to cut himself loose from him but eustace had defied him andwhat was worsehe had told him the truth which he of all men could not bear he had said that his system of trade was dishonest that he took more than his due and it was so he knew it but he could not tolerate that it should be told him and that his whole life should thereby be discredited and even his accumulated gold tarnishedstamped as illgotten least of all could he bear it from his dependent he was not altogether a bad man nobody is he was only a coarse vulgar tradesman hardened and defiled by a long career of sharp dealing at the bottom he had his feelings like other men but he could not tolerate exposure or even contradiction therefore he had revenged himself and yet as he sat there in solitary glory he realized that to revenge does not bring happiness and could even find it in his heart to envy the steadfast honesty that had defied him at the cost of his own ruin  not that he meant to relent or alter his determination mr meeson never relented and never changed his mind had he done so he would not at that moment have been the master of two millions of money     chapter iii  augustas little sister   when augusta left meesons she was in a very sad condition of mind to explain which it will be necessary to say a word or two about that young ladys previous history her father had been a clergyman and like most clergymen not overburdened with the good things of this world when mr smithersor rather the rev james smithershad died he left behind him a widow and two childrenaugusta aged fourteen and jeannie aged two there had been two others both boys who had come into the world between augusta and jeannie but they had both preceded their father to the land of shadows mrs smithers had fortunately for herself a life interest in a sum of £7000 which being well invested brought her in £350 a year and in order to turn this little income to the best possible account and give her two girls the best educational opportunities possible under the circumstances she on her husbands death moved from the village where he had for many years been curate into the city of birmingham here she lived in absolute retirement for some seven years and then suddenly died leaving the two girls then respectively nineteen and eight years of age to mourn her loss and friendless as they were to fight their way in the hard world  mrs smithers had been a saving woman and on her death it was found that after paying all debts there remained a sum of £600 for the two girls to live on and nothing else for their mothers fortune died with her now it will be obvious that the interest arising from six hundred pounds is not sufficient to support two young people and therefore augusta was forced to live upon the principal from an early age however she augusta had shown a strong literary tendency and shortly after her mothers death she published her first book at her own expense it was a dead failure and cost her fiftytwo pounds the balance between the profit and loss account after awhile however she recovered from this blow and wrote jemimas vow which was taken up by meesons and strange as it may seem proved the success of the year of the nature of the agreement into which she entered with meesons the reader is already acquainted and he will not therefore be surprised to learn that under its cruel provisions augusta notwithstanding her name and fame was absolutely prohibited from reaping the fruits of her success she could only publish with meesonss and at the fixed pay of seven per cent on the advertised price of her work now something over three years had elapsed since the death of mrs smithers and it will therefore be obvious that there was not much remaining of the six hundred pounds which she had left behind her the two girls had indeed lived economically enough in a couple of small rooms in a back street but their expenses had been enormously increased by the serious illness from a pulmonary complaint of the little girl jeannie now a child between twelve and thirteen years of age on that morning augusta had seen the doctor and been crushed into the dust by the expression of his conviction that unless her little sister was moved to a warmer climate for a period of at least a year she would not live through the winter and might die at any moment  take jeannie to a warmer climate he might as well have told augusta to take her to the moon alas she had not the money and did not know where to turn to get it oh reader pray to heaven that it may never be your lot to see your best beloved die for the want of a few hundred pounds wherewith to save her life  it was in this terrible emergency that she haddriven thereto by her agony of mindtried to get something beyond her strict and legal due out of meesonsmeesons that had made hundreds and hundreds out of her book and paid her fifty pounds we know how she fared in that attempt on leaving their office augusta bethought her of her banker perhaps he might be willing to advance something it was a horrible task but she determined to undertake it so she walked to the bank and asked to see the manager he was out but would be in at three oclock she went to a shop near and got a bun and glass of milk and waited till she was ashamed to wait any longer and then she walked about the streets till three oclock at the stroke of the hour she returned and was shown into the managers private room where a dry unsympathetic looking little man was sitting before a big book it was not the same man whom augusta had met before and her heart sank proportionately  what followed need not be repeated here the manager listened to her faltering tale with a few stereotyped expressions of sympathy and when she had done regretted that speculative loans were contrary to the custom of the bank and politely bowed her out  it was nearly four oclock upon a damp drizzling afternoona november afternoonthat hung like a living misery over the black slush of the birmingham streets and would in itself have sufficed to bring the lightest hearted happiest mortal to the very gates of despair when augusta wet wearied and almost crying at last entered the door of their little sittingroom she entered very quietly for the maidofallwork had met her in the passage and told her that miss jeannie was asleep she had been coughing very much about dinnertime but now she was asleep  there was a fire in the grate a small one for the coal was economised by means of two large firebricks and on a table augustas writing table placed at the further side of the room was a paraffinlamp turned low drawn up in front but a little to one side of the fire was a sofa covered with red rep and on the sofa lay a fairhaired little form so thin and fragile that it looked like the ghost or outline of a girl rather than a girl herself it was jeannie her sick sister and she was asleep augusta stole softly up to look at her it was a sweet little face that her eyes fell on although it was so shockingly thin with long curved lashes delicate nostrils and a mouth shaped like a bow all the lines and grooves which the chisel of pain knows so well how to carve were smoothed out of it now and in their place lay the shadow of a smile  augusta looked at her and clenched her fists while a lump rose in her throat and her grey eyes filled with tears how could she get the money to save her the year before a rich man a man who was detestable to her had wanted to marry her and she would have nothing to say to him he had gone abroad else she would have gone back to him and married himat a price marry him yes she would marry him she would do anything for money to take her sister away what did she care for herself when her darling was dyingdying for the want of two hundred pounds  just then jeannie woke up and stretched her arms out to her  so you are back at last dear she said in her sweet childish voice it has been so lonely without you why how wet you are take off your jacket at once gussie or you will soon be as ill asand here she broke out into a terrible fit of coughing that seemed to shake her tender frame as the wind shakes a reed  her sister turned and obeyed and then came and sat by the sofa and took the thin little hand in hers  well gussie and how did you get on with the printerdevil this was her impolite name for the great meeson will he give you any more money  no dear we quarrelled that was all and i came away  then i suppose that we cant go abroad  augusta was too moved to answer she only shook her head the child buried her face in the pillow and gave a sob or two presently she was quiet and lifted it again gussie love she said dont be angry but i want to speak to you listen my sweet gussie my angel oh gussie you dont know how i love you it is all no good it is useless struggling against it i must die sooner or later though i am only twelve and you think me such a child i am old enough to understand that i think she added after pausing to cough that pain makes one old i feel as though i were fifty well so you see i may as well give up fighting against it and die at once i am only a burden and anxiety to youi may as well die at once and go to sleep  dont jeannie dont said her sister in a sort of cry you are killing me  jeannie laid her hot hand upon augustas arm try and listen to me dear she said even if it hurts because i do so want to say something why should you be so frightened about me can any place that i can go be worse than this place can i suffer more pain anywhere or be more hurt when i see you crying think how wretched it has all been there has only been one beautiful thing in our lives for years and years and that was your book even when i am feeling worstwhen my chest aches you knowi grow quite happy when i think of what the papers wrote about you the times and the saturday review and the spectator and the rest of them they said that you had geniustrue genius you remember and that they expected one day to see you at the head of the literature of the time or near it the printerdevil cant take away that gussie he can take the money but he cant say that he wrote the book though she added with a touch of childish spite and vivacity i have no doubt that he would if he could and then there were those letters from the great authors up in london yes i often think of them too well dearest old girl the best of it is that i know it is all true i know i cant tell you how that you will be a great woman in spite of all the meesons in creation for somehow you will get out of his power and if you dont five years is not all ones lifeat least not if people have a life at the worst he can only take all the money and then when you are great and rich and famous and more beautiful than ever and when the people turn their heads as you come into the room like we used to at school when the missionary came to lecture i know that you will think of me because you wont forget me as some sisters do and of how years and years before so long ago that the time looks quite small when you think of it i told you that it would be so just before i died  here the girl who had been speaking with a curious air of certainty and with a gravity and deliberation extraordinary for one so young suddenly broke off to cough her sister threw herself on her knees beside her and clasping her in her arms implored her in broken accents not to talk of dying jeannie drew augustas golden head down on her breast and stroked it  very well gussie i wont say any more about it she said but it is no good hiding the truth dear i am tired of fighting against it it is no goodnone at all anyhow we have loved each other very much dear and perhapssomewhere elsewe may againand the brave little heart again broke down and overcome by the prescience of approaching separation they both sobbed bitterly there upon the sofa presently came a knock at the door and augusta sprang up and turned to hide her tears it was the maidofallwork bringing the tea and as she came blundering in a sense of the irony of things forced itself into augustas soul here they were plunged into the most terrible sorrow weeping at the inevitable approach of that chill end and still appearances must be kept up even before a maidofallwork society even when represented by a maidofallwork cannot do away with the intrusion of domestic griefs or any other griefs and in our hearts we know it and act up to it far gone indeed must we be in mental or physical agony before we abandon the attempt to keep up appearances  augusta drank a little tea and ate a very small bit of breadandbutter as in the case of mr meeson the events of the day had not tended to increase her appetite jeannie drank a little milk but ate nothing when this form had been gone through and the maidofallwork had once more made her appearance and cleared the table jeannie spoke again  gus she said i want you to put me to bed and then come and read to me out of jemimas vowwhere poor jemima dies you know it is the most beautiful thing in the book and i want to hear it again  her sister did as she wished and taking down jemimas vow jeannies own copy as it was called being the very first that had come into the house she opened it at the part jeannie had asked for and read aloud keeping her voice as steady as she could as a matter of fact however the scene itself was as powerful as it was pathetic and quite sufficient to account for any unseemly exhibitions of feeling on the part of the reader however she struggled through it till the last sentence was reached it ran thusand so jemima stretched out her hand to him and said goodbye and presently knowing that she had now kept her promise and being happy because she had done so she went to sleep  ah murmured the blueeyed child who listened i wish that i was as good as jemima but though i have no vow to keep i can say goodbye and i can go to sleep  augusta made no answer and presently jeannie dozed off her sister looked at her with eager affection she is giving up she said to herself and if she gives up she will die i know it it is because we are not going away how can i get the money now that that horrible man is gone how can i get it and she buried her head in her hand and thought presently an idea struck her she might go back to meeson and eat her words and sell him the copyright of her new book for £100 as the agreement provided that would not be enough however for travelling with an invalid is expensive but she might offer to bind herself over to him for a term of years as a tame author like those who worked in the hutches she was sure that he would be glad to get her if only he could do so at his own price it would be slavery worse than any penal servitude and even now she shudders at the prospect of prostituting her great abilities to the necessities of such work as meesons made their thousands out ofwork out of which every spark of originality was stamped into nothingness as though it were the mark of the beast yes it would be dreadfulit would break her heart but she was prepared to have her heart broken and her genius wrung out of her by inches if only she could get two hundred pounds wherewith to take jeannie away to the south of france mr meeson would no doubt make a hard bargainthe hardest he could but still if she would consent to bind herself for a sufficient number of years at a sufficiently low salary he would probably advance her a hundred pounds besides the hundred for the copyright of the new book  and so having made up her mind to the sacrifice she went to bed and wearied out with misery to sleep and even as she slept a presence that she could not see was standing near her bed and a voice that she could not hear was calling through the gloom another mortal had bent low at the feet of that unknown god whom men name death and been borne away on his rushing pinions into the spaces of the hid one more human item lay still and stiff one more account was closed for good or evil the echo of one more tread had passed from the earth for ever the old millionnumbered tragedy in which all must take a part had repeated itself once more down to its last and most awful scene yes the grim farce was played out and the little actor jeannie was white in death  just at the dawn augusta dreamed that somebody with cold breath was breathing on her face and woke up with a start and listened jeannies bed was on the other side of the room and she could generally hear her movements plainly enough for the sick child was a restless sleeper but now she could hear nothing not even the faint vibration of her sisters breath the silence was absolute and appalling it struck tangibly upon her sense as the darkness struck upon her eyeballs and filled her with a numb unreasoning terror she slipped out of bed and struck a match in another few seconds she was standing by jeannies white little bed waiting for the wick of the candle to burn up presently the light grew jeannie was lying on her side her white face resting on her white arm her eyes were wide open but when augusta held the candle near her she did not shut them or flinch her hand toooh heavens the fingers were nearly cold  then augusta understood and lifting up her arms in agony she shrieked till the whole house rang     chapter iv  augustas decision   on the second day following the death of poor little jeannie smithers mr eustace meeson was strolling about birmingham with his hands in his pockets and an air of indecision on his decidedly agreeable and gentlemanlike countenance eustace meeson was not particularly cast down by the extraordinary reverse of fortune which he had recently experienced he was a young gentleman of a cheerful nature and besides it did not so very much matter to him he was in a blessed condition of celibacy and had no wife and children dependant upon him and he knew that somehow or other it would go hard if with the help of the one hundred a year that he had of his own he did not manage with his education to get a living by hook or by crook so it was not the loss of the society of his respected uncle or the prospective enjoyment of two millions of money which was troubling him indeed after he had once cleared his goods and chattels out of pompadour hall and settled them in a room in an hotel he had not given the matter much thought but he had given a good many thoughts to augusta smithers grey eyes and by way of getting an insight into her character he had at once invested in a copy of jemimas vow thereby somewhat against his will swelling the gains of meesons to the extent of several shillings now jemimas vow though simple and homely was a most striking and powerful book which fully deserved the reputation that it had gained and it affected eustacewho was in so much different from most young men of his age that he really did know the difference between good work and badmore strongly than he would have liked to own indeed at the termination of the story what between the beauty of augustas pages the memory of augustas eyes and the knowledge of augustas wrongs mr eustace meeson began to feel very much as though he had fallen in love accordingly he went out walking and meeting a clerk whom he had known in the meeson establishmentone of those who had been discharged on the same day as himselfhe obtained from him miss smithers address and began to reflect as to whether or no he should call upon her unable to make up his mind he continued to walk till he reached the quiet street where augusta lived and suddenly perceiving the house of which the clerk had told him yielded to temptation and rang  the door was answered by the maidofallwork who looked at him a little curiously but said that miss smithers was in and then conducted him to a door which was half open and left him in that kindly and agreeable fashion that maidsofallwork have eustace was perplexed and looking through the door to see if anyone was in the room discovered augusta herself dressed in some dark material seated in a chair her hands folded on her lap her pale face set like a stone and her eyes gleaming into vacancy he paused wondering what could be the matter and as he did so his umbrella slipped from his hand making a noise that rendered it necessary for him to declare himself  augusta rose as he advanced and looked at him with a puzzled air as though she was striving to recall his name or where she had met him  i beg your pardon he stammered i must introduce myself as the girl has deserted mei am eustace meeson  augustas face hardened at the name if you have come to me from messrs meeson and coshe said quickly and then broke off as though struck by some new idea  indeed no said eustace i have nothing in common with messrs meeson now except my name and i have only come to tell you how sorry i was to see you treated as you were by my uncle you remember i was in the office  yes she said with a suspicion of a blush i remember you were very kind  well you see he went on i had a great row with my uncle after that and it ended in his turning me out of the place bag and baggage and informing me that he was going to cut me off with a shilling which he added reflectively he has probably done by now  do i understand you mr meeson to mean that you quarrelled with your uncle about me and my books  yes that is so he said  it was very chivalrous of you she answered looking at him with a newborn curiosity augusta was not accustomed to find knightserrant thus prepared at such cost to themselves to break a lance in her cause least of all was she prepared to find that knight bearing the hateful crest of meesonif indeed meeson had a crest  i ought to apologise she went on presently after an awkward pause for making such a scene in the office but i wanted money so dreadfully and it was so hard to be refused but it does not matter now it is all done with  there was a dull hopeless ring about her voice that awoke his curiosity for what could she have wanted the money and why did she no longer want it  i am sorry he said will you tell me what you wanted it so much for  she looked at him and then acting upon impulse rather then reflection said in a low voice  if you like i will show you  he bowed wondering what was coming next rising from her chair augusta led the way to a door which opened out of the sittingroom and gently turned the handle and entered eustace followed her the room was a small bedroom of which the faded calico blind had been pulled down as it happened however the sunlight such as it was beat full upon the blind and came through it in yellow bars they fell upon the furniture of the bare little room they fell upon the iron bedstead and upon something lying on it which he did not at first notice because it was covered with a sheet  augusta walked up to the bed and gently lifted the sheet revealing the sweet face fringed round about with golden hair of little jeannie in her coffin  eustace gave an exclamation and started back violently he had not been prepared for such a sight indeed it was the first such sight that he had ever seen and it shocked him beyond words augusta familiarised as she was herself with the companionship of this beauteous clay cold terror had forgotten that suddenly and without warning to bring the living into the presence of the dead is not the wisest or the kindest thing to do for to the living more especially to the young the sight of death is horrible it is such a fearsome comment on their health and strength youth and strength are merry but who can be merry with yon dead thing in the upper chamber take it away thrust it underground it is an insult to us it reminds us that we too die like others what business has its pallor to show itself against our ruddy cheeks  i beg your pardon whispered augusta realising something of all this in a flash i forgot you do not knowyou must be shockedforgive me  who is it he said gasping to get back his breath  my sister she answered it was to try and save her life that i wanted the money when i told her that i could not get it she gave up and died your uncle killed her come  greatly shocked he followed her back into the sittingroom and thenas soon as he got his composureapologised for having intruded himself upon her in such an hour of desolation  i am glad to see you she said simply i have seen nobody except the doctor once and the undertaker twice it is dreadful to sit alone hour after hour face to face with the irretrievable if i had not been so foolish as to enter into that agreement with messrs meeson i could have got the money by selling my new book easily enough and i should have been able to take jeannie abroad and i believe that she would have livedat least i hoped so but now it is finished and cannot be helped  i wish i had known blundered eustace i could have lent you the money i have a hundred and fifty pounds  you are very good she answered gently but it is no use talking about it now it is finished  then eustace rose and went away and it was not till he found himself in the street that he remembered that he had never asked augusta what her plans were indeed the sight of poor jeannie had put everything else out of his head however he consoled himself with the reflection that he could call again a week or ten days after the funeral  two days later augusta followed the remains of her dearly beloved sister to their last resting place and then came home on foot for she was the only mourner and sat in her black gown before the little fire and reflected upon her position what was she to do she could not stay in these rooms it made her heart ache every time her eyes fell upon the empty sofa opposite dinted as it was with the accustomed weight of poor jeannies frame where was she to go and what was she to do she might get literary employment but then her agreement with messrs meeson stared her in the face that agreement was very widely drawn it bound her to offer all literary work of any sort that might come from her pen during the next five years to messrs meeson at the fixed rate of seven per cent on the published price obviously as it seemed to her though perhaps erroneously this clause might be stretched to include even a newspaper article and she knew the malignant nature of mr meeson well enough to be quite certain that if possible that would be done it was true she might manage to make a bare living out of her work even at the beggarly pay of seven per cent but augusta was a person of spirit and determined that she would rather starve than that meeson should again make huge profits out of her labour this avenue being closed to her she turned her mind elsewhere but look where she might the prospect was equally dark  augustas remarkable literary success had not been of much practical advantage to her for in this country literary success does not mean so much as it does in some others as a matter of fact indeed the average briton has at heart a considerable contempt if not for literature at least for those who produce it literature in his mind is connected with the idea of garrets and extreme poverty and therefore having the national respect for money he in secret if not in public despises it a tree is known by its fruit says he let a man succeed at the bar and he makes thousands upon thousands a year and is promoted to the highest offices in the state let a man succeed in art and he will be paid one or two thousand pounds apiece for his most potboilery portraits but your literary menwhy with a few fortunate exceptions the best of them barely make a living what can literature be worth if a man cant make a fortune out of it so argues the britonno doubt with some of his sound common sense not that he has no respect for genius all men bow to true genius even when they fear and envy it but he thinks a good deal more of genius dead than genius living however this may be there is no doubt but that if through any causesuch for instance as the sudden discovery by the great and highly civilized american people that the seventh commandment was probably intended to apply to authors amongst the rest of the worldthe pecuniary rewards of literary labor should be put more upon an equality with those of other trades literatureas a professionwill go up many steps in popular esteem at present if a member of a family has betaken himself to the high and honourable calling for surely it is both of letters his friends and relations are apt to talk about him in a shy and diffident not to say apologetic way much as they would had he adopted another sort of bookmaking as a means of livelihood  thus it was that notwithstanding her success augusta had nowhere to turn in her difficulty she had absolutely no literary connection nobody had called upon her and sought her out in consequence of her book one or two authors in london and a few unknown people from different parts of the country and abroad had written to herthat was all had she lived in town it might have been different but unfortunately for her she did not  the more she thought the less clear did her path become until at last she got an inspiration why not leave england altogether she had nothing to keep her here she had a cousina clergymanin new zealand whom she had never seen but who had read jemimas vow and written her a kind letter about it that was the one delightful thing about writing books one made friends all over the world surely he would take her in for a while and put her in the way of earning a living where meeson would not be to molest her why should she not go she had twenty pounds left and the furniture which included an expensive invalid chair and books would fetch another thirty or soenough to pay for a secondclass passage and leave a few pounds in her pocket at the worst it would be a change and she could not go through more there than she did here so that very night she sat down and wrote to her clergyman cousin     chapter v  the rms kangaroo   it was on a tuesday evening that a mighty vessel was steaming majestically out of the mouth of the thames and shaping her imposing course straight at the ball of the setting sun most people will remember reading descriptions of the steamship kangaroo and being astonished at the power of her engines the beauty of her fittings and the extraordinary speedabout eighteen knotswhich she developed in her trials with an unusually low expenditure of coal for the benefit of those who have not however it may be stated that the kangaroo the little kangaroo as she was ironically named among sailor men was the very latest development of the science of modern shipbuilding everything about her from the electric light and boiler tubes up was on a new and patent system  four hundred feet and more she measured from stem to stern and in that space were crowded and packed all the luxuries of a palace and all the conveniences of an american hotel she was a beautiful and a wonderful thing to look on as with her holds full of costly merchandise and her decks crowded with her living freight of about a thousand human beings she steamed slowly out to sea as though loth to leave the land where she was born but presently she seemed to gather up her energies and to grow conscious of the thousands and thousands of miles of wide tossing water which stretched between her and the faroff harbour where her mighty heart should cease from beating and be for a while at rest quicker and quicker she sped along and spurned the churning water from her swift sides she was running under a full head of steam now and the coastline of england grew faint and low in the faint low light till at last it almost vanished from the gaze of a tall slim girl who stood forward clinging to the starboard bulwark netting and looking with deep grey eyes across the waste of waters presently augusta for it was she could see the shore no more and turned to watch the other passengers and think she was sad at heart poor girl and felt what she wasa very waif upon the sea of life not that she had much to regret upon the vanished coastline a little grave with a white cross over itthat was all she had left no friends to weep for her none but even as she thought it a recollection rose up in her mind of eustace meesons pleasant handsome face and of his kind words and with it came a pang as she reflected that in all probability she should never see the one or hear the other again why she wondered had he not come to see her again she should have liked to bid him goodbye and had half a mind to send him a note and tell him of her going this on second thoughts however she had decided not to do for one thing she did not know his address andwell there was an end of it  could she by the means of clairvoyance have seen eustaces face and heard his words she would have regretted her decision for even as that great vessel plunged on her fierce way right into the heart of the gathering darkness he was standing at the door of the lodginghouse in the little street in birmingham  gone he was saying miss smithers gone to new zealand what is her address  she didnt leave no address sir replies the dirty maidofallwork with a grin she went from here two days ago and was going on to the ship in london  what was the name of the ship he asked in despair kankoncongereel replies the girl in triumph and shuts the door in his face  poor eustace he had gone to london to try and get some employment and having after some difficulty succeeded in obtaining a billet as reader in latin french and english to a publishing house of good repute at a salary of £180 a year he had hurried back to birmingham for the sole purpose of seeing miss augusta smithers with whom if the whole truth must be told he had to his credit be it said fallen deeply truly and violently in love indeed so far was he in this way gone that he had determined to make all the progress that he could and if he thought that there was any prospect of success to declare his passion this was perhaps a little premature but then in these matters people are apt to be more premature than is generally supposed human nature is very swift in coming to conclusions in matters in which that strange mixture we call the affections are involved perhaps because although the conclusion is not altogether a pleasing one the affections at any rate in the beginning are largely dependent on the senses  pity a poor young man to come from london to birmingham to woo ones greyeyed mistress in a thirdclass carriage too and find her gone to new zealand whither circumstances prevented him from following her without leaving a word or a line or even an address behind her it was too bad well there was no remedy in the matter so he walked to the railway station and groaned and swore all the way back to london  augusta on board the kangaroo was however in utter ignorance of this act of devotion on the part of her admirer indeed she did not even know that he was her admirer feeling a curious sinking sensation within her she was about to go below to her cabin which she shared with a ladysmaid not knowing whether to attribute it to sentimental qualms incidental to her lonely departure from the land of her birth or to other qualms connected with the first experience of life upon the ocean wave about that moment however a burly quartermaster addressed her in gruff tones and informed her that if she wanted to see the last of hold halbion she had better go aft a bit and look over the port side and she would see the something or other light accordingly more to prove to herself that she was not seasick than for any other reason she did so and standing as far aft as the secondclass passengers were allowed to go stared at the quick flashes of the lighthouse as second by second they sent their message across the great waste of sea  as she stood there holding on to a stanchion to steady herself for the vessel large as she was had begun to get a bit of a roll on she was suddenly aware of a bulky figure of a man which came running or rather reeling against the bulwarks alongside of her where itor rather hewas instantly and violently ill augusta was not unnaturally almost horrified into following the figures example when suddenly growing faint or from some other cause it loosed its hold and rolled into the scuppers where it lay feebly swearing augusta obeying a tender impulse of humanity hurried forward and stretched out the hand of succour and presently between her help and that of the bulwark netting the man struggled to his feet as he did so his face came close to hers and in the dim light she recognised the fat coarse features now blanched with misery of mr meeson the publisher there was no doubt about it it was her enemy the man whose behavior had indirectly as she believed caused the death of her little sister she dropped his hand with an exclamation of disgust and dismay and as she did so he recognised who she was  hullo he said with a faint and rather feeble attempt to assume his fine old crusted publishingcompany manners hullo miss jemimasmithers i mean what on earth are you doing here  i am going to new zealand mr meeson she answered sharply and i certainly did not expect to have the pleasure of your company on the voyage  going to new zealand he said are you why so am i at least i am going there first then to australia what do you mean to do theretry and run round our little agreement eh it wont be any good i tell you plainly we have our agents in new zealand and a house in australia and if you try to get the better of meesons there meesons will be even with you miss smithersoh heavens i feel as though i were coming to pieces  dont alarm yourself mr meeson she answered i am not going to publish any more books at present  that is a pity he said because your stuff is good selling stuff any publisher would find money in it i suppose you are secondclass miss smithers so we shant see much of each other and perhaps if we should meet it might be as well if we didnt seem to have any acquaintance it dont look well for a man in my position to know secondclass passengers especially young lady passengers who write novels  you need not be afraid mr meeson i have no wish to claim your acquaintance said augusta  at this point her enemy was taken violently worse again and being unable to stand the sight and sound of his writhing and groaning she fled forward and reflecting on this strange and awkward meeting went down to her own berth where with lucid intervals she remained helpless and half stupid for the next three days on the fourth day however she reappeared on deck quite recovered and with an excellent appetite she had her breakfast and then went and sat forward in as quiet a place as she could find she did not want to see mr meeson any more and she did want to escape from the stories of her cabinmate the ladysmaid this good person would after the manner of her kind insist upon repeating to her a succession of histories connected with members of the families with whom she had lived many of which were sufficient to make the hair of a respectable young lady like augusta stand positively on end no doubt they were interesting to her in her capacity of a novelist but as they were all of the same colour and as their tendency was absolutely to destroy any belief she might have in virtue as an inherent quality in highly developed woman or honour in man augusta soon wearied of these chroniques scandaleuses so she went forward and was sitting looking at the white horses chasing each other across the watery plain and reflecting upon what the condition of mind of those ladies whose histories she had recently heard would be if they knew that their most secret and in some cases disgraceful and tragic love affairs were the common talk of a dozen servants halls when suddenly she was astonished by the appearance of a splendid official bearing a book at first from the quantity of gold lace with which his uniform was adorned augusta took him to be the captain but it presently transpired that he was only the chief steward  please miss he said touching his hat and holding out the book in his hand towards her the captain sends his compliments and wants to know if you are the young lady who wrote this  augusta glanced at the work it was a copy of jemimas vow then she replied that she was the writer of it and the steward vanished  later on in the morning came another surprise the gorgeous official again appeared touched his cap and said that the captain desired him to say that orders had been given to have her things moved to a cabin further aft at first augusta demurred to this not from any love of the ladysmaid but because she had a truly british objection to being ordered about  captains orders miss said the man touching his cap again and she yielded  nor had she any cause to regret doing so for to her huge delight she found herself moved into a charming deckcabin on the starboard side of the vessel some little way abaft the engineroom it was evidently an officers cabin for there over the head of the bed was the picture of a young lady he adored and also some neatly fitted shelves of books a rack of telescopes and other seamanlike contrivances  am i to have this cabin to myself asked augusta of the steward  yes miss those are the captains orders it is mr joness cabin mr jones is the second officer but he has turned in with mr thomas the first officer and given up the cabin to you  i am sure its very kind of mr jones murmured augusta not knowing what to make of this turn of fortune but surprises were not to end there a few minutes afterwards just as she was leaving the cabin a gentleman in uniform came up in whom she recognized the captain he was accompanied by a pretty fairhaired woman very becomingly dressed  excuse me miss smithers i believe he said with a bow  yes  i am captain alton i hope you like your new cabin let me introduce you to lady holmhurst wife of lord holmhurst the new zealand governor you know lady holmhurst this is miss smithers whose book you were talking so much about  oh i am delighted to make your acquaintance miss smithers said the great lady in a manner that evidently was not assumed captain alton has promised that i shall sit next to you at dinner and then we can have a good talk i dont know when i have been so much delighted with anything as i was with your book i have read it three times what do you think of that for a busy woman  i think there is some mistake said augusta hurriedly and with a slight blush i am a secondclass passenger on board this ship and therefore cannot have the pleasure of sitting next to lady holmhurst  oh that is all right miss smithers said the captain with a jolly laugh you are my guest and i shall take no denial  when we find genius for once in our lives we are not going to lose the opportunity of sitting at its feet added lady holmhurst with a little movement towards her which was neither curtsey nor bow but rather a happy combination of both the compliment was augusta felt sincere however much it exaggerated the measure of her poor capacities and putting other things aside was coming as it did from one woman to another peculiarly graceful and surprising she blushed and bowed scarcely knowing what to say when suddenly mr meesons harsh tones pitched just now in a respectful key broke upon her ear mr meeson was addressing no less a person than lord holmhurst gcmg lord holmhurst was a stout short dark little man with a somewhat pompous manner and a kindly face he was a colonial governor of the first water and was perfectly aware of the fact  now a colonial governor even though he be a gcmg when he is at home is not a name to conjure with and does not fill an exclusive place in the eye of the english world there are many colonial governors in the present and past tense to be found in the purlieus of south kensington where their presence creates no unusual excitement but when one of this honourable corps sets foot upon the vessel destined to bear him to the shores that he shall rule all this changes he puts off the body of the ordinary betitled individual and puts on the body of the celestial brotherhood in short from being nobody out of the common he becomes and very properly so a great man nobody knew this better than lord holmhurst and to a person fond of observing such things nothing could have been more curious to notice than the small but gradual increase of the pomposity of his manner as the great ship day by day steamed further from england and nearer to the country where he was king it went up degree by degree like a thermometer which is taken down into the bowels of the earth or gradually removed into the sunlight at present however the thermometer was only rising  i was repeating my lord said the harsh voice of mr meeson that the principle of an hereditary peerage is the grandest principle our country has yet developed it gives us something to look forward to in one generation we make the money in the next we take the title which the money buys look at your lordship your lordship is now in a proud position but as i have understood your lordships father was a trader like me  humwell not exactly mr meeson broke in lord holmhurst dear me i wonder who that exceedingly nicelooking girl lady holmhurst is talking to can be  now your lordship to put a case went on the remorseless meeson who like most people of his stamp had an almost superstitious veneration for the aristocracy i have made a great deal of money as i do not mind telling your lordship what is there to prevent my successorsupposing i have a successorfrom taking advantage of that money and rising on it to a similar position to that so worthily occupied by your lordship  exactly mr meeson a most excellent idea for your successor excuse me but i see lady holmhurst beckoning to me and he fled precipitately still followed by mr meeson  john my dear said lady holmhurst i want to introduce you to miss smithersthe miss smithers whom we have all been talking about and whose book you have been reading miss smithers my husband  lord holmhurst who when he was not deep in the affairs of state had a considerable eye for a pretty girland what man worthy of the name has notbowed most politely and was proceeding to tell augusta in very charming language how delighted he was to make her acquaintance when mr meeson arrived on the scene and perceived augusta for the first time quite taken aback at finding her apparently upon the very best of terms with people of such quality he hesitated to consider what course to adopt whereon lady holmhurst in a somewhat formal way for she was not very fond of mr meeson mistaking his hesitation went on to introduce him thereupon all in a moment as we do sometimes take such resolutions augusta came to a determination she would have nothing more to do with mr meesonshe would repudiate him then and there come what would of it  so as he advanced upon her with outstretched hand she drew herself up and in a cold and determined voice said i already know mr meeson lady holmhurst and i do not wish to have anything more to do with him mr meeson has not behaved well to me  pon my word murmured lord holmhurst to himself i dont wonder she has had enough of him sensible young woman that  lady holmhurst looked a little astonished and a little amused suddenly however a light broke upon her  oh i see she said i suppose that mr meeson published jemimas vow of course that accounts for it why i declare there is the dinner bell come along miss smithers or we shall lose the place the captain has promised us and accordingly they went leaving mr meeson who had not yet realized the unprecedented nature of the position positively gasping on the deck and on board the kangaroo there were no clerks and editors on whom he could wreck his wrath  and now my dear miss smithers said lady holmhurst when dinner being over they were sitting together in the moonlight near the wheel perhaps you will tell me why you dont like mr meeson whom bytheway i personally detest but dont if you dont wish to you know  but augusta did wish to and then and there she unfolded her whole sad story into her newfound friends sympathetic ear and glad enough the poor girl was to find a confidant to whom she could unbosom her sorrows  well upon my word said lady holmhurst when she had listened with tears in her eyes to the history of poor little jeannies death upon my word of all the brutes i ever heard of i think that this publisher of yours is the worst i will cut him and get my husband to cut him too but no i have a better plan than that he shall tear up that agreement so sure as my name is bessie holmhurst he shall tear it up ororand she nodded her little head with an air of infinite wisdom     chapter vi  mr tombey goes forward   from that day forward the voyage on the kangaroo was until the last dread catastrophe a very happy one for augusta lord and lady holmhurst made much of her and all the rest of the firstclass passengers followed suit and soon she found herself the most popular character on board the two copies of her book that there were on the ship were passed on from hand to hand till they would hardly hang together and really at last she got quite tired of hearing of her own creations but this was not all augusta was it will be remembered an exceedingly pretty woman and melancholy as the fact may seem it still remains a fact that a pretty woman is in the eyes of most people a more interesting object than a man or than a lady who is not built that way thus it came to pass that what between her youth her beauty her talent and her misfortunesfor lady holmhurst had not exactly kept that history to herselfaugusta was all of a sudden elevated into the position of a perfect heroine it really almost frightened the poor girl who had been accustomed to nothing but sorrow illtreatment and grinding poverty to suddenly find herself in this strange position with every man on board that great vessel at her beck and call but she was human and therefore of course she enjoyed it it is something when one has been wandering for hour after hour in the wet and melancholy night suddenly to see the fair dawn breaking and burning overhead and to know that the worst is over for now there will be light whereby to set our feet it is something too to the most christian soul to utterly and completely triumph over one who had done all in his power to crush and destroy you whose grasping greed has indirectly been the cause of the death of the person you loved best in the whole world round and she did triumph as mr meesons conduct to her got about the little society of the shipwhich was after all a very fair example of all society in miniaturefell away from this publishing prince and not even the jingling of his moneybags could lure it back he the great the practically omnipotent the owner of two millions and the hard master of hundreds upon whose toil he battened was practically cut even the clerk who was going out on a chance of getting a place in a new zealand bank would have nothing to say to him and what is more he felt it more even than an ordinary individual would have done he the printerdevil as poor little jeannie used to call him he to be slighted and flouted by a pack of people whom he could buy up three times over and all on account of a wretched authoressan authoress if you please it made mr meeson very wilda state of affairs which was brought to a climax when one morning lord holmhurst who had for several days been showing a growing dislike to his society actually almost cut him dead that is he did not notice his outstretched hand and passed him with a slight bow  never mind my lordnever mind muttered mr meeson after that somewhat pompous but amiable noblemans retreating form well see if i cant come square with you im a dog who can pull a string or two in the english press i am those who have the money and have got a hold of people so that they must write what they tell them aint people to be cut by any colonial governor my lord and in his anger he fairly shook his fist at the unconscious peer  seem to be a little out of temper mr meeson said a voice at his elbow the owner of which was a big young man with hard but kindly features and a large moustache what has the governor been doing to you  doing mr tombey hes been cutting me thats allme meesoncutting me as dead as offal or something like it i held out my hand and he looked right over it and marched by  ah said mr tombey who was a wealthy new zealand landowner and now why do you suppose he did that  why ill tell you why its all about that girl  miss smithers do you mean said tombey the big with a curious flash of his deepset eyes  yes miss smithers she wrote a book and i bought the book for fifty pounds and stuck a clause in that she should give me the right to publish anything she wrote for five years at a pricea common sort of thing enough in one way and another when you are dealing with some idiot who dont know any better well as it happened this book sold like wildfire and in time the young lady comes to me and wants more money wants to get out of the hanging clause in the agreement wants everything like a female oliver twist and when i say no you dont loses her temper and makes a scene and it turns out that what she wanted the money for was to take a sick sister or cousin or aunt or someone out of england and when she could not do it and the relation died then she emigrates and goes and tells the people on board ship that it is all my fault  and i suppose that that is a conclusion that you do not feel drawn to mr meeson  no tombey i dont business is business and if i happen to have got to windward of the young woman why so much the better for me shes getting her experience thats all and she aint the first and wont be the last but if she goes saying much more about me i go for her for slander thats sure  on the legal ground that the greater the truth the greater the libel i presume  confound her went on meeson without noticing his remark and contracting his heavy eyebrows theres no end to the trouble she has brought on me i quarrelled with my nephew about her and now shes dragging my name through the dirt here and ill bet the story will go all over new zealand and australia  yes said mr tombey i fancy you will find it take a lot of choking and now mr meeson with your permission i will say a word and try and throw a new light upon a very perplexing matter it never seems to have occurred to you what an outandout blackguard you are so i may as well put it to you plainly if you are not a thief you are at least a very wellcoloured imitation you take a girls book and make hundreds upon hundreds out of it and give her fifty you tie her down so as to provide for successful swindling of the same sort during future years and then when she comes to beg a few pounds of you you show her the door and now you wonder mr meeson that respectable people will have nothing to do with you well now i tell you my opinion is that the only society to which you would be really suited is that of cowhide good morning and the large young man walked off his very moustachios curling with wrath and contempt thus for a second time did the great mr meeson hear the truth from the lips of babes and sucklings and the worst of it was that he could not disinherit number two as he had number one  now this will strike the reader as being very warm advocacy on the part of mr tombey who being called in to console and bless cursed with such extraordinary vigour it may even strike the discerning readerand all readers or at least nearly all readers are of course discerning far too much so indeedthat there must have been a reason for it and the discerning reader will be right augustas grey eyes had been too much for mr tombey as they had been too much for eustace meeson before him his passion had sprung up and ripened in that peculiarly rapid and vigorous fashion that passions do on board ship a passenger steamer is cupids own hotbed and in this way differs from a sailingship on the sailingship indeed the preliminary stages are the same the seed roots as strongly and grows and flowers with equal vigour but here comes the melancholy partit withers and decays with equal rapidity the voyage is too long too much is mutually revealed the matrimonial iron cannot be struck while it is hot and long before the weary ninety days are over it is once more cold and black or at the best glows with but a feeble heat but on the steamship there is no time for this as any traveller knows myselfi the historianhave with my own eyes seen a couple meet for the first time at maderia get married at the cape and go on as man and wife in the same vessel to natal and therefore it came to pass that very evening a touching and on the whole melancholy little scene was enacted near the smokestack of the kangaroo  mr tombey and miss augusta smithers were leaning together over the bulwarks and watching the phosphorescent foam go flashing past mr tombey was nervous and ill at ease miss smithers very much at ease and reflecting that her companions moustachios would very well become a villain in a novel  mr tombey looked at the starspangled sky on which the southern cross hung low and he looked at the phosphorescent sea but from neither did inspiration come inspiration is from within and not from without at last however he made a gallant and a desperate effort  miss smithers he said in a voice trembling with agitation  yes mr tombey answered augusta quietly what is it  miss smithers he went onmiss augusta i dont know what you will think of me but i must tell you i cant keep it any longer i love you  augusta fairly jumped mr tombey had been very even markedly polite and she not being a fool had seen that he admired her but she had never expected this and the suddenness with which the shot was fired was somewhat bewildering  why mr tombey she said in a surprised voice you have only known me for a little more than a fortnight  i fell in love with you when i had only known you for an hour he answered with evident sincerity please listen to me i know i am not worthy of you but i do love you so very dearly and i would make you a good husband indeed i would i am well off though of course that is nothing and if you dont like new zealand i would give it up and go to live in england do you think that you can take me if you only knew how dearly i love you i am sure you would  augusta collected her wits as well as she could the man evidently did love her there was no doubting the sincerity of his words and she liked him and he was a gentleman if she married him there would be an end of all her worries and troubles and she could rest contentedly on his strong arm woman even gifted woman is not made to fight the world with her own hand and the prospect had allurements but while she thought eustace meesons bonny face rose before her eyes and as it did so a faint feeling of repulsion to the man who was pleading with her took form and colour in her breast eustace meeson of course was nothing to her no word or sign of affection had passed between them and the probability was that she would never set her eyes upon him again and yet that face rose up between her and this man who was pleading at her side many women likely enough have seen some such vision from the past and have disregarded it only to find too late that that which is thrust aside is not necessarily hidden for alas those faces of our departed youth have an uncanny trick of rising from the tomb of our forgetfulness but augusta was not of the great order of opportunists because a thing might be convenient it did not according to the dictates of her moral sense follow that it was lawful therefore she was a woman to be respected for a woman who except under most exceptional circumstances gives her instincts the lie in order to pander to her convenience or her desire for wealth and social ease is not altogether a woman to be respected  in a very few seconds she had made up her mind  i am very much obliged to you mr tombey she said you have done me a great honour the greatest honour man can do to a woman but i cannot marry you  are you sure gasped the unfortunate tombey for his hopes had been high is there no hope for me perhaps there is somebody else  there is nobody else mr tombey and i am sorry to say you dont know how much it pains me to say it i cannot hold out any prospect that i shall change my mind  he dropped his head upon his hands for a minute and then lifted it again  very well he said slowly it cant be helped i never loved any woman before and i never shall again it is a pity with a hard little laughthat so much firstclass affection should be wasted but there you are it is all part and parcel of the pleasant experiences which make up our lives goodbye miss smithers at least goodbye as a friend  we can still be friends she faltered  oh no he answered with another laugh that is an exploded notion friendship of that nature is not very safe under any circumstances certainly not under these the relationship is antagonistic to the facts of life and the friends or one or other of them will drift either into indifference and dislike orsomething warmer you are a novelist miss smithers perhaps some day you will write a book to explain why people fall in love where their affection is not wanted and what purpose their distress can possibly serve and now once more good bye and he lifted her hand to his lips and gently kissed it and then with a bow turned and went  from all of which it will be clearly seen that mr tombey was decidedly a young man above the average and one who took punishment very well augusta looked after him and sighed deeply and even wiped away a tear then she turned and walked aft to where lady holmhurst was sitting enjoying the balmy southern air through which the great ship was rushing with outspread sails like some huge white bird and chatting to the captain as she came up the captain made his bow and departed saying that he had something to see to and for a minute lady holmhurst and augusta were left alone  well augusta said lady holmhurst for she called her augusta now and what have you done with that young man mr tombeythat very nice young man she added with emphasis  i think that mr tombey went forward said augusta  the two women looked at each other and womanlike each understood what the other meant lady holmhurst had not been altogether innocent in the tombey affair  lady holmhurst said augusta taking the bull by the horns mr tombey has been speaking to me and has  proposed to you suggested lady holmhurst admiring the southern cross through her eyeglasses you said he went forward you know  has proposed to me answered augusta ignoring the little joke i regret she went on hurriedly that i have not been able to fall in with mr tombeys plans  ah said lady holmhurst i am sorry for some things mr tombey is such a very nice young man and so very gentlemanlike i thought that perhaps it might suit your views and it would have simplified your future arrangements but as to that of course while you are in new zealand i shall be able to see to that bytheway it is understood that you come to stay with us for a few months at government house before you hunt up your cousin  you are very good to me lady holmhurst said augusta with something like a sob  suppose my dear answered the great lady laying her little hand upon augustas beautiful hair that you were to drop the lady holmhurst and call me bessie it sounds so much more sociable you know and besides it is shorter and does not waste so much breath  then augusta sobbed outright for her nerves were shaken you dont know what your kindness means to me she said i have never had a friend and since my darling died i have been so very lonely     chapter vii  the catastrophe   and so these two fair women talked making plans for the future as though all things endured forever and all plans were destined to be realized but even as they talked somewhere up in the high heavens the voice that rules the world spoke a word and the messenger of fate rushed forth to do its bidding on board the great ship was music and laughter and the sweet voices of singing women but above it hung a pall of doom not the most timid heart dreamed of danger what danger could there be aboard of that grand ship which sped across the waves with the lightness and confidence of the swallow there was naught to fear a prosperous voyage was drawing to its end and mothers put their babes to sleep with as sure a heart as though they were on solid english ground oh surely when his overflowing load of sorrows and dire miseries was meted out to man some gentle spirit pleaded for himthat he should not have foresight added to the tale that he should not see the falling knife or hear the water lapping that one day shall entomb him or was it kept back because man having knowledge would be man without reasonfor terror would make him mad and he would end his fears by hurrying their fulfilment at least we are blind to the future and let us be thankful for it  presently lady holmhurst got up from her chair and said that she was going to bed but that first of all she must kiss dick her little boy who slept with his nurse in another cabin augusta rose and went with her and they both kissed the sleeping child a bonny boy of five and then they kissed each other and separated for the night  some hours afterwards augusta woke up feeling very restless for an hour or more she lay thinking of mr tombey and many other things and listening to the swift lap lap of the water as it slipped past the vessels sides and the occasional tramp of the watch as they set fresh sails at last her feeling of unrest got too much for her and she rose and partially very partially dressed herselffor in the gloom she could only find her flannel vest and petticoattwisted her long hair in a coil round her head put on a hat and a thick ulster that hung upon the doorfor they were running into chilly latitudesand slipped out on deck  it was getting towards dawn but the night was still dark looking up augusta could only just make out the outlines of the huge bellying sails for the kangaroo was rushing along before the westerly wind under a full head of steam and with every inch of her canvas set to ease the screw there was something very exhilarating about the movement the freshness of the night and the wild sweet song of the wind as it sang amongst the rigging augusta turned her face toward it and being alone stretched out her arms as though to catch it the whole scene awoke some answering greatness in her heart something that slumbers in the bosom of the higher race of human beings and only stirsand then but faintlywhen the passions move them or when nature communes with her nobler children she felt that at that moment she could write as she had never written yet all sorts of beautiful ideas all sorts of aspirations after that noble calm and purity of thought and life for which we pray and long but are not allowed to reach came flowing into her heart she almost thought that she could hear her lost jeannies voice calling down the gale and her strong imagination began to paint her hovering like a seabird upon white wings high above the mainmasts taper point and gazing through the darkness into the soul of her she loved then by those faint and imperceptible degrees with which thoughts fade one into another from jeannie her thought got round to eustace meeson she wondered if he had ever called at the lodgings at birmingham after she left somehow she had an idea that he was not altogether indifferent to her there had been a look in his eyes she did not quite understand she almost wished now she had sent him a line or a message perhaps she would do so from new zealand just then her meditations were interrupted by a step and turning round she found herself face to face with the captain  why miss smithers he said what on earth are you doing here at this hourmaking up romances  yes she answered laughing and with perfect truth the fact of the matter is i could not sleep and so i came on deck and very pleasant it is  yes said the captain if you want something to put into your stories you wont find anything better than this the kangaroo is showing her heels isnt she miss smithers thats the beauty of her she can sail as well as steam and when she has a strong wind like this abaft it would have to be something very quick that would catch her i believe that we have been running over seventeen knots an hour ever since midnight i hope to make kerguelen island by seven oclock to correct my chronometers  what is kerguelen island asked augusta  oh it is a desert place where nobody goes except now and then a whaler to fill up with water i believe that the astronomers sent an expedition there a few years ago to observe the transit of venus but it was a failure because the weather was so mistyit is nearly always misty there well i must be off miss smithers good night or rather good morning  before the words were well out of his mouth there was a wild shout forwardship ahead then came an awful yell from a dozen voicesstarboard hardastarboard for gods sake  with a wild leap like the leap of a man suddenly shot the captain left her side and rushed on to the bridge at the same instant the enginebell rang and the steeringchains began to rattle furiously on the rollers at her feet as the steam steeringgear did its work then came another yell  its a whalerno lights and an answering shriek of terror from some big black object that loomed ahead before the echoes had died away before the great ship could even answer to her helm there was a crash such as augusta had never heard and a sickening shock that threw her on her hands and knees on the deck shaking the iron masts till they trembled as though they were willow wands and making the huge sails flap and for an instant fly aback the great vessel rushing along at her frightful speed of seventeen knots had plunged into the ship ahead with such hideous energy that she cut her clean in twocut her in two and passed over her as though she were a pleasureboat  shriek upon shriek of despair came piercing the gloomy night and then as augusta struggled to her feet she felt a horrible succession of bumps accompanied by a crushing grinding noise it was the kangaroo driving right over the remains of the whaler  in a very few seconds it was done and looking astern augusta could just make out something black that seemed to float for a second or two upon the water and then disappear into its depths it was the shattered hull of the whaler  then there arose a faint murmuring sound that grew first into a hum then into a roar and then into a clamour that rent the skies and up from every hatchway and cabin in the great ship human beingsmen women and childrencame rushing and tumbling with faces white with terrorwhite as their nightgear some were absolutely naked having slipped off their nightdress and had no time to put on anything else some had put on ulsters and greatcoats others had blankets thrown round them or carried their clothes in their hands up they came hundreds and hundreds of them for there were a thousand souls on board the kangaroo pouring aft like terrified spirits flying from the mouth of hell and from them arose such a hideous clamour as few have lived to hear  augusta clung to the nettings to let the rush go by trying to collect her scattered senses and to prevent herself from catching the dreadful contagion of the panic being a brave and coolheaded woman she presently succeeded and with her returning clearness of vision she realized that she and all on board were in great peril it was clear that so frightful a collision could not have taken place without injury to their own vessel nothing short of an ironclad ram could have stood such a shock probably they would founder in a few minutes and all be drowned in a few minutes she might be dead her heart stood still at the horror of the thought but once more she recovered herself well after all life had not been pleasant and she had nothing to fear from another world she had done no wrong then suddenly she began to think of the others where was lady holmhurst and where were the boy and the nurse acting upon the impulse she did not stay to realize she ran to the saloon hatchway it was fairly clear now for most of the people were on deck and she found her way to the childs cabin with but little difficulty there was a light in it and the first glance showed her that the nurse had gone gone and deserted the childfor there he lay asleep with a smile upon his little round face the shock had scarcely wakened the boy and knowing nothing of shipwrecks he had just shut his eyes and gone to sleep again  dick dick she said shaking him  he yawned and sat up and then threw himself down again saying dick sleepy  yes but dick must wake up and auntie he called her auntie will take him up on deck to look for mummy wont it be nice to go on deck in the dark  yes said dick with confidence and augusta took him on her knee and hurried him into such of his clothes as came handy as quickly as she could on the cabindoor was a warm little peajacket which the child wore when it was cold this she put on over his blouse and flannel shirt and then by an afterthought took the two blankets off his bunk and wrapped them round him at the foot of the nurses bed was a box of biscuits and some milk the biscuits she emptied into the pockets of her ulster and having given the child as much of the milk as he would drink swallowed the rest herself then pinning a shawl which lay about round her own shoulders she took up the child and made her way with him on to the deck at the head of the companion she met lord holmhurst himself rushing down to look after the child  i have got him lord holmhurst she cried the nurse has run away where is your wife  bless you he said fervently you are a good girl bessie is aft somewhere i would not let her come they are trying to keep the people off the boatsthey are all mad  are we sinking she asked faintly  god knowsah here is the captain pointing to a man who was walking or rather pushing his way rapidly towards them through the maddened screeching mob lord holmhurst caught him by the arm  let me go he said roughly trying to shake himself loose oh it is you lord holmhurst  yes step in here for one second and tell us the worst speak up man and let us know all  very well lord holmhurst i will we have run down a whaler of about five hundred tons which was cruising along under reduced canvas and showing no lights our fore compartment is stove right in bulging out the plates on each side of the cutwater and loosening the fore bulkhead the carpenter and his mates are doing their best to shore it up from the inside with balks of timber but the water is coming in like a mill race and i fear there are other injuries all the pumps are at work but theres a deal of water and if the bulkhead goes  we shall go too said lord holmhurst calmly well we must take to the boats is that all  in heavens name is that not enough said the captain looking up so that the light that was fixed in the companion threw his ghastly face into bold relief no lord holmhurst it is not all the boats will hold something over three hundred people there are about one thousand souls aboard the kangaroo of whom more than three hundred are women and children  therefore the men must drown said lord holmhurst quietly gods will be done  your lordship will of course take a place in the boats said the captain hurriedly i have ordered them to be prepared and fortunately day is breaking i rely upon you to explain matters to the owners if you escape and clear my character the boats must make for kerguelen land it is about seventy miles to the eastward  you must give your message to someone else captain was the answer i shall stay and share the fate of the other men  there was no pomposity about lord holmhurst nowall that had goneand nothing but the simple gallant nature of the english gentleman remained  no no said the captain as they hurried aft pushing their way through the feardistracted crowd have you got your revolver  yes  well then keep it handy you may have to use it presently they will try and rush the boats  by this time the grey dawn was slowly breaking throwing a cold and ghastly light upon the hideous scene of terror round about the boats were gathered the officers and some of the crew doing their best to prepare them for lowering indeed one had already been got away in it was lady holmhurst who had been thrown there against her will shrieking for her child and husband and about a score of women and children together with halfadozen sailors and an officer  augusta caught sight of her friends face in the faint light bessie bessie lady holmhurst she cried i have got the boy it is all righti have got the boy  she heard her and waved her hand wildly towards her and then the men in the boat gave way and in a second it was out of earshot just then a tall form seized augusta by the arm she looked up it was mr tombey and she saw that in his other hand he held a revolver  thank god he shouted in her ear i have found you this waythis way quick and he dragged her aft to where two sailors standing by the davits that supported a small boat were lowering her to the level of the bulwarks  now then women shouted an officer who was in charge of the operation some men made a rush  women first women first  i am in no hurry said augusta stepping forward with the trembling child in her arms and her action for a few seconds produced a calming effect for the men stopped  come on said mr tombey stooping to lift her over the side only to be nearly knocked down by a man who made a desperate effort to get into the boat it was mr meeson and recognising him mr tombey dealt him a blow that sent him spinning back  a thousand pounds for a place he roared ten thousand pounds for a seat in a boat and once more he scrambled up at the bulwarks trampling down a child as he did so and was once more thrown back  mr tombey took augusta and the child into his strong arms and put her into the boat as he did so he kissed her forehead and murmured god bless you goodbye  at that instant there was a loud report forward and the stern of the vessel lifted perceptibly the bulkhead had given way and there arose such a yell as surely was seldom heard before to augustas ears it seemed to shape itself into the word sinking  up from the bowels of the ship poured the firemen the appearance of whose blackened faces lined with white streaks of perspiration added a new impulse of terror to the panicstricken throng aft they came accompanied by a crowd of sailors and emigrants  rush the boats sung out a voice with a strong irish accent or sure well be drowned  taking the hint the maddened mob burst towards the boats like a flood blaspheming and shrieking as it came in a moment the women and children who were waiting to take to the boat in which augusta and the two seamen were already were swept aside and a determined effort was made to rush it headed by a great irishman the same who had called out  augusta saw mr tombey lord holmhurst who had come up and the officer lift their pistols which exploded almost simultaneously and the irishman and another man pitched forward on to their hands and knees  never mind the pistols lads shouted a voice as well be shot as drown there isnt room for half of us in the boats come on and a second fearful rush was made which bore the three gentlemen firing as they went right up against the nettings  bill halloaed the man who was holding on to the foremost tackle lower away we shall be rushed and swamped  bill obeyed with heart and soul and down sank the boat below the level of the upper decks just as the mob was getting the mastery in five seconds more they were hanging close over the water and whilst they were in this position a man leapt at the boat from the bulwarks he struck on the thwarts rolled off into the water and was no more seen a lady the wife of a colonial judge threw her child augusta tried to catch it but missed and the boy sank and was lost in another moment the two sailors had shoved off from the ships side as they did so the stern of the kangaroo lifted right out of the water so that they could see under her rudderpost just then too with a yell of terror mr meeson in whom the elementary principle of selfpreservation at all costs was strongly developed cast himself from the side and fell with a splash within a few feet of the boat rising to the surface he clutched hold of the gunwale and implored to be taken in  knock the old varmint over the knuckles bill shouted the other man hell upset us  no no cried augusta her womans heart moved at seeing her old enemy in such a case there is plenty of room in the boat  hold on then said the man addressed whose name was johnnie when we get clear well haul you in  and the reader may be sure mr meeson did hold on pretty tight till after rowing about fifty yards the two men halted and proceeded not without some risk and troublefor there was a considerable sea runningto hoist mr meesons large form over the gunwale of the boat  meanwhile the horrors on board the doomed ship were redoubling as she slowly settled to her watery grave forward the steam foghorn was going unceasingly bellowing like a thousand furious bulls while now and again a rocket still shot up through the misty morning air round the boats a hideous war was being waged augusta saw a great number of men jump into one of the largest lifeboats which was still hanging to the davits having evidently got the better of those who were attempting to fill it with the women and children the next second they lowered the after tackle but by some hitch or misunderstanding not the foremost one with the result that the stern of the boat fell while the bow remained fixed and every soul in it some forty or fifty people was shot out into the water another boat was overturned by a sea as it settled on the water another one full of women and children got to the water all right but remained fastened to the ship by the bow tackle when a couple of minutes afterwards the kangaroo went down nobody had a knife at hand wherewith to cut the rope and the boat was dragged down with her and all its occupants drowned the remaining boats with the exception of the one in which lady holmhurst was and which had been got away before the rush began were never lowered at all or sank as soon as lowered it was impossible to lower them owing to the mad behaviour of the panicstricken crowds who fought like wild beasts for a place in them a few gentlemen and soberheaded sailors could do nothing against a mob of frantic creatures each bent on saving his own life if it cost the lives of all else on board  and thus it was exactly twenty minutes from the time that the kangaroo sank the whaler for although these events have taken some time to describe they did not take long to enact that her own hour came and with the exception of some eightandtwenty souls all told the hour also of every living creature who had taken passage in her     chapter viii  kerguelen land   as soon as mr meeson saved from drowning by her intervention lay gasping at the bottom of the boat augusta overcome by a momentary faintness let her head fall forward on to the bundle of blankets in which she had wrapped up the child she had rescued and who too terrified to speak or cry stared about him with wideopened and frightened eyes when she lifted it a few seconds later a ray from the rising sun had pierced the mist and striking full on the sinking ship as her stern well out of the water and her bow well under it she rolled sullenly to and fro in the trough of the heavy sea seemed to wrap her from hull to truck in wild and stormy light  shes goingby george shes going said the seaman johnnie and as he said it the mighty ship slowly reared herself up on end slowlyvery slowly amidst the hideous and despairing shrieks of the doomed wretches on board of her she lifted her stern higher and higher and plunged her bows deeper and deeper they shrieked they cried to heaven for help but heaven heeded them not for mans agony cannot avert mans doom now for a space she was standing almost upright upon the water out of which about a hundred feet of her vast length towered like some monstrous ocean growth whilst men fell from her in showers like flies benumbed by frost down into the churning foam beneath then suddenly with a swift and awful rush with a rending sound of breaking spars a loud explosion of her boilers and a smothered boom of bursting bulkheads she plunged down into the measureless deeps and was seen no more forever  the water closed in over where she had been boiling and foaming and sucking down all things in the wake of her last journey while the steam and prisoned air came up in huge hissing jets and bubbles that exploded into spray on the surface  the men groaned the child stared stupified and augusta cried out oh oh like one in pain  row back she gasped row back and see if we cannot pick some of them up  no no shouted meeson they will sink the boat  taint much use anyway said johnnie i doubt that precious few of them will come up again they have gone too deep  however they got the boats head round againslowly enough augusta thoughtand as they did so they heard a feeble cry or two but by the time that they had reached the spot where the kangaroo went down there was no living creature to be seen nothing but the wash of the great waves over which the mist once more closed thick and heavy as a pall they shouted and once they heard a faint answer and rowed towards it but when they got to the spot whence the sound seemed to proceed they could see nothing except some wreckage they were all dead their agony was done their cries no more ascended to the pitiless heavens and wind and sky and sea were just as they had been  oh my god my god wept augusta clinging to the thwarts of the tossing boat  one boat got awaywhere is it asked mr meeson who a wet and wretched figure was huddled up in the sternsheets as he rolled his wild eyes round striving to pierce the curtain of the mist  theres something said johnnie pointing through a fogdog in the mist that seemed to grow denser rather than otherwise as the light increased at a round boatlike object that had suddenly appeared to the starboard of them  they rowed up to it it was a boat but empty and floating bottom upwards closer examination showed that it was the cutter which when full of women and children had been fastened to the vessel and dragged down with her as she sank at a certain depth the pressure of the water had been too great and had torn the ring in the bow bodily out of her so that she returned to the surface but those in her did not returnat least not yet once more two or three days hence they would arise from the watery depths and look upon the skies with eyes that could not see and then vanish for ever  turning from this awful and most moving sight they rowed slowly through quantities of floating wreckagebarrels hencoops in one of these they found two drowned fowls which they secured and many other articles such as oars and wicker deckchairsand began to shout vigorously in the hope of attracting the attention of the survivors in the other boat which they imagined could not be far off their efforts however proved fruitless owing to the thickness of the fog and in the considerable sea which was running it was impossible to see more than twenty yards or so also what between the wind and the wash and turmoil of the water the sound of their voices did not travel far the ocean is a large place and a rowingboat is easily lost sight of upon its furrowed surface therefore it is not wonderful that although the two boats were at the moment within half a mile of each other they never met and each took its separate course in the hope of escaping the fate of the vessel the boat in which were lady holmhurst and some twenty other passengers together with the second officer and a crew of six men after seeing the kangaroo sink and picking up one survivor shaped a course for kerguelen land believing that they and they alone remained to tell the tale of that awful shipwreck and here it may be convenient to state that before nightfall they were picked up by a sealingwhaler that sailed with them to albany on the coast of australia thence an account of the disaster which as the reader will remember created a deep impression was telegraphed home and thence in due course the widowed lady holmhurst and most of the other women who escaped were taken back to england  to return to our heroine and mr meeson  the occupants of the little boat sat looking at each other with white scared faces till at last the man called johnnie who bytheway was not a tar of a very amiable cast of countenance possibly owing to the fact that his nose was knocked almost flat against the side of his face swore violently and said it was no good stopping there all the etceteraed day thereupon bill who was a more joviallooking man remarked that he johnnie was etceteraed well right so they had better hoist the foresail  at this point augusta interposed and told them that the captain just as the vessel came into collision had informed her that he was making kerguelen land which was not more than sixty or seventy miles away they had a compass in the boat and they knew the course the kangaroo was steering when she sank accordingly without wasting further time they got as much sail up as the little boat could carry in the stiff breeze and ran nearly due east before the steady westerly wind all day long they ran across the misty ocean the little boat behaving splendidly without sighting any living thing till at last the night closed in again there was fortunately a bag of biscuits in the boat and a breaker of water also there was unfortunately a breaker of rum from which the two sailors bill and johnnie were already taking quite as much as was good for them consequently though they were cold and wet with the spray they had not to face the added horrors of starvation and thirst at sundown they shortened sail considerably only leaving enough canvas up to keep the boat ahead of the sea  somehow the long night wore away augusta scarcely closed her eyes but little dick slept like a top upon her bosom sheltered by her arms and the blanket from the cold and penetrating spray in the bottom of the boat lay mr meeson to whom augusta pitying his conditionfor he was shivering dreadfullyhad given the other blanket keeping nothing for herself except the woollen shawl  at last however there came a faint glow in the east and the daylight began to break over the stormy sea augusta turned her head and stared through the mist  what is that she said in a voice trembling with excitement to the sailor bill who was taking his turn at the tiller and she pointed to a dark mass that loomed up almost over them  the man looked and then looked again and then hallowed out joyfully landland ahead  up struggled mr meeson on to his kneeshis legs were so stiff that he could not standand began to stare wildly about him  thank god he cried where is it is it new zealand if ever i get there ill stop there ill never get on a ship again  new zealand growled the sailor are you a fool its kerguelen land thats what it iswhere it rains all day and nobody livesnot even a nigger its like enough that youll stop there though for i dont reckon that anybody will come to take you off in a hurry  mr meeson collapsed with a groan and a few minutes afterwards the sun rose while the mist grew less and less till at last it almost disappeared revealing a grand panorama to the occupants of the boat for before them was line upon line of jagged and lofty peaks stretching as far as the eye could reach gradually melting in the distance into the cold white gleam of snow bill slightly altered the boats course to the southward and sailing round a point she came into comparatively calm water then due north of them running into the land they saw the mouth of a great fjord bounded on each side by towering mountain banks so steep as to be almost precipitous around whose lofty sides thousands of sea fowl wheeled awaking the echoes with their clamour right into this beautiful fjord they sailed past a line of flat rocks on which sat huge fantastic monsters that the sailors said were sealions along the line of beetling cliff till they came to a spot where the shore on which grew a rank soddenlooking grass shelved gently up from the waters edge to the frowning and precipitous background and here to their huge delight they discovered two huts roughly built of old ships timbers placed within a score of yards of each other and a distance of some fifty paces from the waters edge  well theres a house anyway said the flatnosed johnnie though it dont look as though it had paid rates and taxes lately  let us land and get out of this horrible boat said mr meeson feebly a proposition that augusta seconded heartily enough accordingly the sail was lowered and getting out the oars the two sailors rowed the boat into a little natural harbour that opened out of the main creek and in ten minutes her occupants were once more stretching their legs upon dry land that is if any land in kerguelen island that region of perpetual wet could be said to be dry  their first care was to go up to the huts and examine them with a result that could scarcely be called encouraging the huts had been built some yearswhether by the expedition which in 1874 came thither to observe the transit of venus or by former parties of shipwrecked mariners they never discoveredand were now in a state of ruin mosses and lichens grew plentifully upon the beams and even on the floor while great holes in the roof let in the wet which lay in little slimy puddles beneath still with all their drawbacks they were decidedly better than the open beach a very short experience of which in that inclement climate would certainly have killed them and they thankfully decided to make the best of them accordingly the smaller of the two huts was given up to augusta and the boy dick while mr meeson and the sailors took possession of the large one their next task was to move up their scanty belongings the boat having first been carefully beached and to clean out the huts and make them as habitable as possible by stretching the sails of the boat on the damp floors and covering up the holes in the roof as best they could with stones and bits of board from the bottom of the boat the weather was fortunately dry and as they all with the exception of mr meeson who seemed to be quite prostrated worked with a will not excepting master dickwho toddled backwards and forwards after augusta in high glee at finding himself on terra firmaand by midday everything that could be done was done then they made a fire of some driftwoodfor fortunately they had a few matchesand augusta cooked the two fowls they had got out of the floating hencoop as well as circumstances would allowwhich as a matter of fact was not very welland they had dinner of which they all stood sadly in need  after dinner they reckoned up their resources of water there was an ample supply for not far from the huts a stream ran down into the fjord for food they had the best part of a bag of biscuits weighing about a hundred pounds also there was the cask of rum which the men had moved into their own hut but that was not all for there were plenty of shellfish about if they could find means to cook them while the rocks around were covered with hundreds of penguins including specimens of the great king penguin which only required to be knocked on the head there was therefore little fear of their perishing of starvation as sometimes happens to ship wrecked people indeed immediately after dinner the two sailors went out and returned with as many birds eggsmostly penguinas they could carry in their hats scarcely had they got in however when the rain which is the prevailing characteristic of these latitudes set in in the most pitiless fashion and soon the great mountains with which they were surrounded and those before them were wrapped in dense veils of fleecy vapour hour after hour the rain fell without ceasing penetrating through their miserable roof and fallingdrop drip dropupon the sodden floor augusta sat by herself in the smaller hut doing what she could to amuse little dick by telling him stories nobody knows how hard she found it to have to invent stories when she was thus overwhelmed with misfortune but it was the only way of keeping the poor child from crying as the sense of cold and misery forced itself into his little heart so she told him about robinson crusoe and then she told him that they were playing at being robinson crusoe to which the child very sensibly replied that he did not at all like the game and wanted his mamma  and meanwhile it grew darker and colder and damper hour by hour till at last the light went out and left her with nothing to keep her company but the moaning wind the falling rain and the wild cries of the seabirds when something disturbed them from their rest the child was asleep at last wrapped up in a blanket and one of the smaller sails and augusta feeling quite worn out with solitude and the pressure of heavy thoughts began to think that the best thing she could do would be to try to follow his example when suddenly there came a knock at the boards which served for a door to the shanty  who is it she cried with a start  memr meeson answered a voice can i come in  yes if you like said augusta sharply though in her heart she was really glad to see him or rather to hear him for it was too dark to see anything it is wonderful how under the pressure of a great calamity we forget our quarrels and our spites and are ready to jump at the prospect of the human companionship of our deadliest enemy and the moral of that is as the white queen says that as we are all night and day face to face with the last dread calamitydeathwe should throughout our lives behave as though we saw the present shadow of his hand but that will never happen in the world while human nature is human natureand when will it become anything else  put up the door again said augusta when from a rather rawer rush of air than usual she gathered that her visitor was within the hut  mr meeson obeyed groaning audibly those two brutes are getting drunk he said swallowing down rum by the gallon i have come because i could not stop with them any longerand i am so ill miss smithers so ill i believe that i am going to die sometimes i feel as though all the marrow in my bones were ice andandat others just as though somebody were shoving a redhot wire up them cant you do anything for me  i dont see what is to be done answered augusta gently for the mans misery touched her in spite of her dislike for him you had better lie down and try to go to sleep  to sleep he moaned how can i sleep my blanket is wringing wet and my clothes are damp and he fairly broke down and began to groan and sob  try and go to sleep urged augusta again  he made no answer but by degrees he grew quieter overwhelmed perhaps by the solemn presence of the darkness augusta laid her head against the biscuitbag and at last sank into blissful oblivion for to the young sleep is a constant friend once or twice she woke but only to drop off again and when she finally opened her eyes it was quite light and the rain had ceased  her first care was for little dick who had slept soundly throughout the night and appeared to be none the worse she took him outside the hut and washed his face and hands in the stream and then sat him down to a breakfast of biscuit as she returned she met the two sailors who although they were now fairly sober bore upon their faces the marks of a fearful debauch evidently they had been drinking heavily she drew herself up and looked at them and they slunk past her in silence  then she returned to the hut mr meeson was sitting up when she entered and the bright light from the open door fell full upon his face his appearance fairly shocked her the heavy cheeks had fallen in there were great purple rings round his hollow eyes and his whole aspect was one of a man in the last stage of illness  i have had such a night he said oh heaven such a night i dont believe that i shall live through another  nonsense said augusta eat some biscuit and you will feel better  he took a piece of the biscuit which she gave him and attempted to swallow it but could not  it is no use he said i am a dying man sitting in those wet clothes in the boat has finished me  and augusta looking at his face could not but believe him     chapter ix  augusta to the rescue   after breakfastthat is after augusta had eaten some biscuit and a wing that remained from the chickens she had managed to cook upon the previous daybill and johnnie the two sailors set to work at her suggestion to fix up a long fragment of driftwood on a point of rock and to bind it on to a flag that they happened to find in the locker of the boat there was not much chance of its being seen by anybody in that mistladen atmosphere even if anybody came there to see it of which there was still less chance still they did it as a sort of duty by the time this task was finished it was midday and for a wonder there was little wind and the sun shone out brightly on returning to the huts augusta got the blankets out to dry and set the two sailors to roast some of the eggs they had found on the previous day this they did willingly enough for they were now quite sober and very much ashamed of themselves then after giving dick some more biscuit and four roasted eggs which he took to wonderfully she went to mr meeson who was lying groaning in the hut and persuaded him to come and sit out in the warmth  by this time the wretched mans condition was pitiable for though his strength was still whole in him he was persuaded that he was going to die and could touch nothing but some rumandwater  miss smithers he said as he sat shivering upon the rocks i am going to die in this horrible place and i am not fit to die to think of me he went on with a sudden burst of his old fire to think of me dying like a starved dog in the cold when i have two millions of money waiting to be spent there in england and i would give them allyes every farthing of themto find myself safe at home again by jove i would change places with any poor devil of a writer in the hutches yes i would turn author on twenty pounds a monththat will give you some idea of my condition miss smithers to think that i should ever live to say that i would care to be a beggarly author who could not make a thousand a year if he wrote till his fingers fell offoh oh and he fairly sobbed at the horror and degradation of the thought  augusta looked at the poor wretch and then bethought her of the proud creature she had known raging terribly through the obsequious ranks of clerks and carrying desolation to the hutches and the manyheaded editorial department she looked and was filled with reflections on the mutability of human affairs  alas how changed that meeson  yes he went on recovering himself a little i am going to die in this horrible place and all my money will not even give me a decent funeral addison and roscoe will get itconfound themas though they had not got enough already it makes me mad when i think of those addison girls spending my money or bribing peers to marry them with it or something of that sort i disinherited my own nephew eustace and kicked him out to sink or swim and now i cant undo it and i would give anything to alter it we quarrelled about you miss smithers because i would not give you any more money for that book of yours i wish i had given it to youanything you wanted i didnt treat you well but miss smithers a bargain is a bargain it would never have done to give way on principle you must understand that miss smithers dont revenge yourself on me about it now that i am helpless because you see it was a matter of principle  i am not in the habit of revenging myself mr meeson answered augusta with dignity but i think that you have done a very wicked thing to disinherit your nephew in that fashion and i dont wonder that you feel uncomfortable about it  the expression of this vigorous opinion served to disturb mr meesons conscience all the more and he burst out into laments and regrets  well said augusta at last if you dont like your will you had better alter it there are enough of us here to witness a will and if anything happens to you it will override the otherwill it not  this was a new idea and the dying man jumped at it  of course of course he said i never thought of that before i will do it at once and cut addison and roscoe out altogether eustace shall have every farthing i never thought of that before come give me your hand ill get up and see about it  stop a minute said augusta how are you going to write a will without pen or pencil or paper or ink  mr meeson sank back with a groan this difficulty had not occurred to him  are you sure nobody has got a pencil and a bit of paper he asked it would do so long as the writing remained legible  i dont think so said augusta but i will inquire accordingly she went and asked bill and johnnie but neither of them had a pencil or a single scrap of paper and she returned sadly to communicate the news  i have got it i have got it said mr meeson as she approached the spot where he lay upon the rock if there is no paper or pen we must write it in blood upon some linen we can make a pen from the feathers of a bird i read somewhere in a book of somebody who did that it will do as well as anything else  here was an idea indeed and one that augusta jumped at but in another moment her enthusiasm received a check where was there any linen to write on  yes she said if you can find some linen you have got on a flannel shirt so have the two sailors and little dick is dressed in flannel too  it was a fact as it happened not one of the party had a scrap of linen on them or anything that would answer the purpose indeed they had only one pockethandkerchief between them and it was a red rag full of holes augusta had had one but it had blown overboard when they were in the boat what would they not have given for that pockethandkerchief now  yes said mr meeson it seems we have none i havent even get a banknote or i might have written in blood upon that though i have got a hundred sovereigns in goldi grabbed them up before i bolted from the cabin but i sayexcuse me miss smithers butumahoh hang modestyhavent you got some linen on somewhere or other that you could spare a bit of you shant lose by giving it to me there i promise that i will tear up the agreement if ever i get out of thiswhich i shantwhich i shantand i will write on the linen that it is to be torn up yes and that you are to have five thousand pounds legacy too miss smithers surely you can spare me a little bitjust off the skirt or somewhere you know miss smithers it never will be missed and it is so very important  augusta blushed and no wonder i am sorry to say i have nothing of the sort about me mr meesonnothing except flannel she said i got up in the middle of the night before the collision and there was no light in the cabin and i put on whatever came first meaning to come back and dress afterwards when it got light  stays said mr meeson desperately forgive me for mentioning them but surely you put on your stays one could write on them you know  i am very sorry mr meeson she answered but i did not put any on  not a cuff or a collar he said catching at a last straw of hope  augusta shook her head sadly  then there is an end of it groaned mr meeson eustace must lose the money poor lad poor lad i have behaved very badly to him  augusta stood still racking her brain for some expedient for she was determined that eustace meeson should not lose the chance of that colossal fortune if she could help it it was but a poor chance at the best for mr meeson might not be dying after all and if he did die it was probable that his fate would be their fate also and no record would remain of them or of mr meesons testamentary wishes as things looked at present there was every prospect of their all perishing miserably on that desolate shore  just then the sailor bill who had been up to the flagstaff on the rock on the chance of catching sight of some passing vessel came walking past his flannel shirtsleeves were rolled up to the elbows of his brawny arms and as he stopped to speak to augusta she noticed something that made her start and gave her an idea  there aint nothing to be seen said the man roughly and it is my belief that there wont be neither here we are and here we stops till we dies and rots  ah i hope not said augusta bytheway mr bill will you let me look at the tattoo on your arm  certainly miss said bill with alacrity holding his great arm within an inch of her nose it was covered with various tattoos flags ships and what not in the middle of which written in small letters along the side of the forearm was the sailors namebill jones  who did it mr bill asked augusta  who did it why i did it myself a chap made me a bet that i could not tattoo my own name on my own arm so i showed him and a poor sort of hand i should have been at tattooing if i could not  augusta said no more till bill had gone on then she spoke  now mr meeson do you see how you can make your will she said quietly  see no he answered i dont  well i do you can tattoo itor rather get the sailor to tattoo it it need not be very long  tattoo it what on and what with he asked astonished  you can have it tattooed on the back of the other sailor johnnie if he will allow you and as for material you have some revolver cartridges if the gunpowder is mixed with water it would do i should think  pon my word said mr meeson you are a wonderful woman whoever would have thought of such a thing except a woman go and ask the man johnnie theres a good girl if he would mind my will being tattooed upon his back  well said augusta its a queer sort of message but ill try accordingly taking little dick by the hand she went across to where the two sailors were sitting outside their hut and putting on her sweetest smile first of all asked mr bill if he would mind doing a little tattooing for her to this mr bill finding time hang heavy upon his hands and wishing to be kept out of the temptation of the rumcask graciously assented saying that he had seen some sharp fishbones lying about which would be the very thing though he shook his head at the idea of using gunpowder as the medium he said it would not do at all well and then as though suddenly seized by an inspiration started off down to the shore  then augusta as gently and nicely as she could approached the question with johnnie who was sitting with his back against the hut his battered countenance wearing a peculiarly illfavored expression probably owing to the fact that he was suffering from severe pain in his head as a result of the debauch of the previous night  slowly and with great difficulty for his understanding was none of the clearest she explained to him what was required and that it was suggested that he should provide the necessary corpus vile upon which it was proposed that the experiment should be made when at last he understood what it was asked that he should do johnnies countenance was a sight to see and his language was more striking than correct the upshot of it was however that he would see mr meeson collectively and mr meesons various members separately especially his eyes somewhere first  augusta retreated till his wrath had spent itself and then once more returned to the charge  she was sure she said that mr johnnie would not mind witnessing the document if anybody else could be found to submit to the pain of the tattooing all that would be necessary would be for him to touch the hand of the operator while his johnnies name was tattooed as witness to the will well he said i dont know how as i mind doing that since its you as asked me miss and not the dd old hulks of a meeson i would not lift a finger to save him from ell miss and thats a fact  then that is a promise mr johnnie said augusta sweetly ignoring the garnishing with which the promise was adorned and on mr johnnie stating that he looked at it in that light she returned to mr meeson on her way she met bill carrying in his hands a loathsomelooking fish with long feelers and a head like a parrot in short a cuttlefish  now heres luck miss said bill exultingly i saw this gentleman lying down on the beach there this morning hes a cuttle thats what he is and ill have his inkbag out of him in a brace of shakes just the ticket for tattooing miss as good as the best indianinkgunpowder is a fool to it  by this time they had reached mr meeson and here the whole matter including johnnies obstinate refusal to be tattooed was explained to bill  well said augusta at length it seems thats the only thing to be done but the question is how to do it i can only suggest mr meeson that the will should be tattooed on you  oh said mr meeson feebly on me me tattooed like a savagetattooed with my own will  it wouldnt be much use either governor begging your pardon said bill that is if you are agoing to croak as you say cause where would the will be then we might skin you with a sharp stone perhaps after youve done the trick you know he added reflectively but then we have no salt so i doubt if youd keep and if we set your hide in the sun i reckon the writing would shrivel up so that all the courts of law in london could not make head or tail of it  mr meeson groaned loudly as well he might these frank remarks would have been trying to any man much more were they so to this opulent merchant prince who had always set the highest value on what bill rudely called his hide  theres the infant went on bill meditatively hes young and white and i fancy his topcrust would work wonderful easy but youd have to hold him for i expect that hed yell proper  yes said mr meeson let the will be tattooed upon the child hed be some use that way  yes said bill and thered allus be something left to remind me of a very queer time provided he lives to get out of it which is doubtful cuttleink wont rub out ill warrant  i wont have dick touched said augusta indignantly it would frighten the child into fits and besides nobody has a right to mark him for life in that way  well then theres about an end of the question said bill and this gentlemans money must go wherever it is he dont want it to  no said augusta with a sudden flush there is not mr eustace meeson was once very kind to me and rather than he should lose the chance of getting what he ought to have ii will be tattooed  well bust me said bill with enthusiasm bust me if you aint a goodplucked one for a female woman and if i was that there young man i should make bold to tell you so  yes said mr meeson that is an excellent idea you are young and strong and as there is lots of food here i dare say that you will take a long time to die you might even live for some months let us begin at once i feel dreadfully weak i dont think that i can live through the night and if i know that i have done all i can to make sure that eustace gets his own perhaps dying will be a little easier     chapter x  the last of mr meeson   augusta turned from the old man with a gesture of impatience not unmixed with disgust his selfishness was of an order that revolted her  i suppose she said sharply to bill that i must have this will tattooed upon my shoulders  yes miss thats it said bill you see miss one wants space for a doccymint if it were a ship or a flag now or a fancy pictur of your young man i might manage it on your arm but there must be breadth for a legal doccymint more especially as i should like to make a good job of it while i is about it i dont want none of them laryers aturning up their noses at bill jones tattooing  very well said augusta with an inward sinking of the heart i will go and get ready  accordingly she adjourned into the hut and removed the body of her dress and turned down the flannel garment underneath it in such a fashion as to leave as much of her neck bare as is to be seen when a lady has on a moderately low dress then she came out again dressed or rather undressed for the sacrifice meanwhile bill had drawn out the inkbag of the cuttle had prepared a little round fragment of wood which he sharpened like a pencil by rubbing it against a stone and had put a keen edge on to a long white fishbone that he had selected  now mr bill i am ready said augusta seating herself resolutely upon a flat stone and setting her teeth  my word miss but you have a fine pair of shoulders said the sailor contemplating the white expanse with the eye of an artist i never had such a bit of material to work on afore hang me if it aint almost a pity to mark em not but what highclass tattooing is an ornimint to anybody from a princess down and in that you are fortunit miss for i larnt tattooing from them as can tattoo i did  augusta bit her lip and the tears came into her eyes she was only a woman and had a womans little weakness and though she had never appeared in a low dress in her life she knew that her neck was one of her greatest beauties and was proud of it it was hard to think that she would be marked all her life with this ridiculous willthat is if she escapedand what was more for the benefit of a young man who had no claim upon her at all  that was what she said to herself but as she said it something in her told her that it was not true something told her that this young mr eustace meeson had a claim upon herthe highest claim that a man could have upon a woman for the truth must outshe loved him it seemed to have come home to her quite clearly here in this dreadful desolate place here in the very shadow of an awful death that she did love him truly and deeply and that being so she would not have been what she wasa gentlenatured devoted womanhad she not at heart rejoiced at this opportunity of selfsacrifice even though that selfsacrifice was of the hardest sort seeing that it involved what all women hatethe endurance of a ridiculous position for love can do all things it can even make its votaries brave ridicule  go on she said sharply and let us get it over as soon as possible  very well miss what is it to be old gentleman cut it short you know  i leave all my property to eustace h meeson thats as short as i can get it and if properly witnessed i think that it will cover everything said mr meeson with a feeble air of triumph anyhow i never heard of a will that is to carry about two millions being got into nine words before  bill poised his fishbone and next second augusta gave a start and a little shriek for the operation had begun  never mind miss said bill consolingly youll soon get used to it  after that augusta set her teeth and endured in silence though it really hurt her very much for bill was more careful of the artistic effect and the permanence of the work than of the feelings of the subject fiat experimentum in corpore vili he would have said had he been conversant with the classics without much consideration for the corpus vile so he pricked and dug away with his fishbone which he dipped continually in the cuttleink and with the sharp piece of wood till augusta began to feel perfectly faint  for three hours the work continued and at the end of that time the body of the will was finishedfor bill was a rapid workerbeing written in mediumsized letters right across her shoulders but the signatures yet remained to be affixed  bill asked her if she would like to let them stand over till the morrowbut this although she felt ill with the pain she declined to do she was marked now marked with the ineffaceable mark of bill so she might as well be marked to some purpose if she put off the signing of the document till the morrow it might be too late mr meeson might be dead johnnie might have changed his mind or a hundred things so she told them to go on and finish it as quickly as possible for there was only about two hours more daylight  fortunately mr meeson was more or less acquainted with the formalities that are necessary in the execution of a will namely that the testator and the two witnesses should all sign in the presence of each other he also knew that it was sufficient if in cases of illness some third person held the pen between the testators fingers and assisted him to write his name or even if someone signed for the testator in his presence and by his direction and arguing from this knowledge he came to the conclusionafterwards justified in the great case of meeson v addison and anotherthat it would be sufficient if he inflicted the first prick of his signature and then kept his hand upon bills while the rest was done this accordingly he did clumsily running the point of the sharp bone so deep into the unfortunate augusta that she fairly shrieked aloud and then keeping his hand upon the sailors arm while he worked in the rest of the signature j meeson when it was done the turn of johnnie came johnnie had at length aroused himself to some interest in what was going on and had stood by watching all the time since mr meeson having laid his finger upon augustas shoulder had solemnly declared the writing thereon to be his last will and testament as he johnnie could not tattoo the same process was gone through with reference to his signature as in the case of mr meeson then bill jones signed his own name as the second witness to the will and just as the light went out of the sky the document was finally executedthe date of the execution being alone omitted augusta got up off the flat stone where she had been seated during this torture for something like five hours and staggering into the hut threw herself down upon the sail and went off into a dead faint it was indeed only by a very strong exercise of the will that she had kept herself from fainting long before  the next thing she was conscious of was a dreadful smarting in her back and on opening her eyes found that it was quite dark in the hut so weary was she however that after stretching out her hand to assure herself that dick was safe by her side she shut her eyes again and went fast asleep when she woke the daylight was creeping into the damp and squalid hut revealing the heavy form of mr meeson tossing to and fro in a troubled slumber on the further side she got up feeling dreadfully sore about the back and awaking the child took him out to the stream of water and washed him and herself as well as she could it was very cold outside so cold that the child cried and the rain clouds were coming up fast so she hurried back to the hut and together with dick made her breakfast off some biscuit and some roast penguins eggs which were not at all bad eating she was indeed quite weak with hunger having swallowed no food for many hours and felt proportionately better after it  then she turned to examine the condition of mr meeson the will had been executed none too soon for it was evident to her that he was in a very bad way indeed his face was sunken and hectic with fever his teeth were chattering and his talk though he was now awake was quite incoherent she tried to get him to take some food but he would swallow nothing but water having done all that she could for him she went out to see the sailors and met them coming down from the flagstaff they had evidently been though not to any great extent at the rum cask again for bill looked sheepish and shaky while the illfavored johnnie was more sulky than ever she gazed at them reproachfully and then asked them to collect some more penguins eggs which johnnie refused pointblank to do saying that he wasnt going to collect eggs for landlubbers to eat she might collect eggs for herself bill however started on the errand and in about an hours time returned just as the rain set in in good earnest bearing six or seven dozen fresh eggs tied up in his coat  augusta with the child by her sat in the miserable hut attending to mr meeson while outside the pitiless rain poured down in a steady unceasing sheet of water that came through the wretched roof in streams she did her best to keep the dying man dry but it proved to be almost an impossibility for even when she succeeded in preventing the wet from falling on him from above it got underneath him from the reeking floor while the heavy damp of the air gathered on his garments till they were quite sodden  as the hours went on his consciousness came back to him and with it his terror for the end and his remorse for his past life for alas the millions he had amassed could not avail him now  i am going to die he groaned i am going to die and ive been a bad man ive been the head of a publishing company all my life  augusta gently pointed out to him that publishing was a very respectable business when fairly and properly carried on and not one that ought to weigh heavy upon a man at the last like the record of a career of successful usury or burgling  he shook his heavy head yes yes he groaned but meesons is a company and you are talking of private firms they are straight most of them far too straight i used always to say but you dont know meesonsyou dont know the customs of the trade at meesons  augusta reflected that she knew a good deal more about meesons than she liked  listen he said with desperate energy sitting up upon the sail and i will tell youi must tell you  asterisks so dear to the heart of the lady novelist will best represent the confession that followed words are not equal to the task                                       augusta listened with rising hair and realised how very trying must be the life of a private confessor  oh please stop she said faintly at last i cant bear iti cant indeed  ah he said as he sunk back exhausted i thought that when you understood the customs at meesons you would feel for me in my present position think girl think what i must suffer with such a past standing face to face with an unknown future  then came a silence  take him away take him away suddenly shouted out mr meeson staring around him with frightened eyes  who asked augusta who  himthe tall thin man with the big book i know him he used to be number 25he died years ago he was a very clever doctor but one of his patients brought a false charge against him and ruined him so he had to take to writing poor devil we made him edit a medical encyclopaediatwelve volumes for £300 to be paid on completion and he went mad and died at the eleventh volume so of course we did not pay his widow anything and now hes come for mei know he has listen hes talking dont you hear him oh heavens he says that i am going to be an author and he is going to publish for me for a thousand yearsgoing to publish on the quarterprofit system with an annual account the usual trade deductions and no vouchers oh oh lookthey are all comingthey are pouring out of the hutches they are going to murder mekeep them off keep them off and he howled and beat the air with his hands  augusta utterly overcome by this awful sight knelt down by his side and tried to quiet him but in vain he continued beating his hands in the air trying to keep off the ghostly train till at last with one awful howl he fell back dead  and that was the end of meeson and the works that he published and the money that he made and the house that he built and the evil that he didare they not written in the book of the commercial kings  well said augusta faintly to herself when she had got her breath back a little i am glad that it is over anyway i do hope that i may never be called on to nurse the head of another publishing company  auntie auntie gasped dick why do the gentleman shout so  then taking the frightened child by the hand augusta made her way through the rain to the other hut in order to tell the two sailors what had come to pass it had no door and she paused on the threshold to prospect the faint foggy light was so dim that at first she could see nothing presently however her eyes got accustomed to it and she made out bill and johnnie sitting opposite to each other on the ground between them was the breaker of rum bill had a large shell in his had which he had just filled from the cask for augusta saw him in the act of replacing the spigot  my gocurse you my go said johnnie as bill lifted the shell of spirits to his lips youve had seven goes and ive only had six  you be blowed said bill swallowing the liquor in a couple of great gulps ah thats better now ill fill for you mate fair does i says fair does and no favour and he filled accordingly  mr meeson is dead said augusta screwing up her courage to interrupt this orgie  the two men stared at her in drunken surprise which johnnie broke  now is he miss he said with a hiccough is he well a good job too says i a useless old landlubber he was i doubt hes off to a warmer place than this ere kerguelen land and i drinks his health which bytheway i never had the occasion to do before heres to the health of the departed and he swallowed the shellfull of rum at a draught  your sentiment i echoes said bill johnnie the shell give us the shell to drink the ealth of the dear departed  then augusta returned to her hut with a heavy heart she covered up the dead body as best she could telling little dick that mr meeson was gone byby and then sat down in that chill and awful company it was very depressing but she comforted herself somewhat with the reflection that on the whole mr meeson dead was not so bad as mr meeson in the animated flesh  presently the night set in once more and worn out with all that she had gone through augusta said her prayers and went to sleep with little dick locked fast in her arms  some hours afterwards she was awakened by loud and uproarious shouts made up of snatches of drunken songs and that peculiar class of english that hovers ever round the lips of the british tar evidently bill and johnnie were raging drunk and in this condition were taking the midnight air  the shouting and swearing went reeling away towards the waters edge and then all of a sudden they culminated in a fearful yellafter which came silence  what could it mean wondered augusta and whilst she was still wondering dropped off to sleep again     chapter xi  rescued   augusta woke up just as the dawn was stealing across the sodden sky it was the smarting of her shoulders that woke her she rose leaving dick yet asleep and remembering the turmoil of the night hurried to the other hut it was empty  she turned and looked about her about fifteen paces from where she was lay the shell that the two drunkards had used as a cup going forward she picked it up it still smelt disgustingly of spirits evidently the two men had dropped it in the course of their midnight walk or rather roll where had they gone to  straight in front of her a rocky promontory ran out fifty paces or more into the waters of the fjordlike bay she walked along it aimlessly till presently she perceived one of the sailors hats lying on the ground or rather floating in a pool of water clearly they had gone this way on she went to the point of the little headland sheer over the water there was nothing to be seen not a single vestige of bill and johnnie aimlessly enough she leant forward and stared over the rocky wall and down into the clear water and then started back with a little cry  no wonder that she started for there on the sand beneath a fathom and a half of quiet water lay the bodies of the two illfated men they were locked in each others arms and lay as though they were asleep upon that ocean bed how they came to their end she never knew perhaps they quarrelled in their drunken anger and fell over the little cliff or perhaps they stumbled and fell not knowing whither they were going who can say at any rate there they were and there they remained till the outgoing tide floated them off to join the great army of their companions who had gone down with the kangaroo and so augusta was left alone  with a heavy heart she returned to the hut pressed down by the weight of solitude and the sense that in the midst of so much death she could not hope to escape there was no human creature left alive in that vast lonely land except the child and herself and so far as she could see their fate would soon be as the fate of the others when she got back to the hut dick was awake and was crying for her  the still stiff form of mr meeson stretched out beneath the sail frightened the little lad he did not know why augusta took him into her arms and kissed him passionately she loved the child for his own sake and besides he and he alone stood between her and utter solitude then she took him across to the other hut which had been vacated by the sailors for it was impossible to stay in the one with the body which was too heavy for her to move in the centre of the sailors hut stood the cask of rum which had been the cause of their destruction it was nearly empty nowso light indeed that she had no difficulty in rolling it to one side she cleaned out the place as well as she could and returning to where mr meesons body lay fetched the bag of biscuits and the roasted eggs after which they had their breakfast  fortunately there was but little rain that morning so augusta took dick out to look for eggs not because they wanted any more but in order to employ themselves together they climbed up on to a rocky headland where the flag was flying and looked out across the troubled ocean there was nothing in sight so far as the eye could seenothing but the white wavehorses across which the black cormorants steered their swift unerring flight she looked and looked till her heart sank within her  will mummy soon come in a boat to take dick away asked the child at her side and then she burst into tears  when she had recovered herself they set to collecting eggs an occupation which notwithstanding the screams and threatened attacks of the birds delighted dick greatly soon they had as many as she could carry so they went back to the hut and lit a fire of driftwood and roasted some eggs in the hot ashes she had no pot to boil them in thus one way and another the day wore away and at last the darkness began to fall over the rugged peaks behind and the wild wilderness of sea before she put dick to bed and he went off to sleep indeed it was wonderful to see how well the child bore the hardships through which they were passing he never had an ache or a pain or even a cold in the head  after dick was asleep augusta sat or rather lay in the dark listening to the moaning of the wind as it beat upon the shanty and passed away in gusts among the cliffs and mountains beyond the loneliness was something awful and together with the thought of what the end of it would probably be quite broke her spirit down she knew that the chances of her escape were small indeed ships did not often come to this dreadful and uninhabited coast and if one should happen to put in there it was exceedingly probable that it would touch at some other point and never see her or her flag and then in time the end would come the supply of eggs would fail and she would be driven to supporting life upon such birds as she could catch till at last the child sickened and died and she followed it to that dim land that lies beyond kerguelen and the world she prayed that the child might die first it was awful to think that perhaps it might be the other way about she might die first and the child might be left to starve beside her the morrow would be christmas day last christmas day she had spent with her dead sister at birmingham she remembered that they went to church in the morning and after dinner she had finished correcting the last revises of jemimas vow well it seemed likely that long before another christmas came she would have gone to join little jeannie and then being a good and religious girl augusta rose to her knees and prayed to heaven with all her heart and soul to rescue them from their terrible position or if she was doomed to perish at least to save the child  and so the long cold night wore away in thought and vigil till at last some two hours before the dawn she got to sleep when she opened her eyes again it was broad daylight and little dick who had been awake some time beside her was sitting up playing with the shell which bill and johnnie had used to drink rum out of she rose and put the childs things a little to rights and then as it was not raining told him to run outside while she went through the form of dressing by taking off such garments as she had shaking them and putting them on again she was slowly going through this process and wondering how long it would be before her shoulders ceased to smart from the effects of the tattooing when dick came running in without going through the formality of knocking  oh auntie auntie he sang out in high glee heres a big ship coming sailing along is it mummy and daddie coming to fetch dick  augusta sank back faint with the sudden revulsion of feeling if there was a ship they were savedsnatched from the very jaws of death but perhaps it was the childs fancy she threw on the body of her dress and her long yellow hairwhich she had in default of better means been trying to comb out with a bit of woodstreaming behind her she took the child by the hand and flew as fast as she could go down the little rocky promontory off which bill and johnnie had met their end before she got halfway down it she saw that the childs tale was truefor there sailing right up the fjord from the open sea was a large vessel she was not two hundred yards from where she stood and her canvas was being rapidly furled preparatory to the anchor being dropped  thanking providence for the sight as she never thanked anything before augusta sped on till she got to the extreme point of the promontory and stood there waving dicks little cap towards the vessel which moved slowly and majestically on till presently across the clear water came the splash of the anchor followed by the sound of the fierce rattle of the chain through the hawsepipes then there came another soundthe glad sound of human voices cheering she had been seen  five minutes passed and then she saw a boat lowered and manned the oars were got out and presently it was backing water within ten paces of her  go round there she called pointing to the little bay and i will meet you  by the time that she had got to the spot the boat was already beached and a tall thin kindlyfaced man was addressing her in an unmistakable yankee accent cast away miss he said interrogatively  yes gasped augusta we are the survivors of the kangaroo which sank in a collision with a whaler about a week ago  ah said the captain with a whaler then i guess thats where my consort has gone to shes been missing about a week and i put in here to see if i could get upon her tracksalso to fill up with water well she was well insured anyway and when last we spoke her she had made a very poor catch but perhaps miss you will at your convenience favour me with a few particulars  accordingly augusta sketched the history of their terrible adventure in as few words as possible and the tale was one that made even the phlegmatic yankee captain stare then she took him followed by the crew to the hut where meeson lay dead and to the other hut where she and dick had slept upon the previous night  wall miss said the captain whose name was thomas i guess that you and the youngster will be almost ready to vacate these apartments so if you please i will send you off to the ship the harpoonthats her nameof norfolk in the united states you will find her well flavoured with oil for we are about full to the hatches but perhaps under the circumstances you will not mind that anyway my missus who is aboardhaving come the cruise for her healthand who is an englishwoman like you will do all she can to make you comfortable and i tell you what it is miss if i was in any way pious i should just thank the almighty that i happened to see that there bit of a flag with my spyglass as i was sailing along the coast at sunup this morning for i had no intention of putting in at this creek but at one twenty miles along and now miss if youll go aboard some of us will stop and just tuck up the dead gentleman as well as we can  augusta thanked him from her heart and going into the hut got her hat and the roll of sovereigns which had been mr meesons but which he had told her to take leaving the blankets to be brought by the men  then two of the sailors got into the little boat belonging to the kangaroo in which augusta had escaped and rowed her and dick away from that hateful shore to where the whalera foreandaftschoonerwas lying at anchor as they drew near she saw the rest of the crew of the harpoon among whom was a woman watching their advent from the deck who when she got her foot upon the companion ladder one and all set up a hearty cheer in another moment she was on deckwhich notwithstanding its abominable smell of oil seemed to her the fairest and most delightful place that her eyes had ever rested onand being almost hugged by mrs thomas a pleasantlooking woman of about thirty the daughter of a suffolk farmer who had emigrated to the states and then of course she had to tell her story all over again after which she was led off to the cabin occupied by the captain and his wife and which thenceforth was occupied by augusta mrs thomas and little dick the captain shaking down where he could and here for the first time for nearly a week she was able to wash and dress herself properly and oh the luxury of it nobody knows what the delights of clean linen really mean till he or she has had to dispense with it under circumstances of privation nor have they the slightest idea of what a difference to ones wellbeing and comfort is made by the possession or nonpossession of an article so common as a comb whilst augusta was still combing out her hair with sighs of delight mrs thomas knocked at the door and was admitted  my miss what beautiful hair you have now that it is combed out she said in admiration why whatever is that upon your shoulders  then augusta had to tell the tale of the tattooing which bytheway it struck her it was wise to do so seeing that she thus secured a witness to the fact that she was already tattooed on leaving kerguelen land and that the operation had been of such recent infliction that the flesh was still inflamed with it this was the more necessary as the tattooing was undated  mrs thomas listened to the story with her mouth open lost between admiration of augustas courage and regret that her shoulders should have been ruined in that fashion  well the least that he alluding to eustace can do is to marry you after you have spoilt yourself in that fashion for his benefit said the practical mrs thomas  nonsense mrs thomas said augusta blushing till the tattoo marks on her shoulders looked like blue lines in a sea of crimson and stamping her foot with such energy that her hostess jumped  there was no reason why she should give an innocent remark such a warm reception but then as the reader will no doubt have observed the reluctance that some young women show to talking of the possibility of their marriage to the man they happen to have set their hearts on is only equalled by the alacrity with which they marry him when the time comes  having set dick and augusta down to a breakfast of porridge and coffee which both of them thought delicious though the fare was really rather coarse mrs thomas being unable to restrain her curiosity rowed off to the land to see the huts and also mr meesons remains which though not a pleasant sight were undoubtedly an interesting one with her too went most of the crew bent upon the same errand and also on obtaining water of which the harpoon was short  as soon as she was left alone augusta went back to the cabin taking dick with her and laid down on the berth with a feeling of safety and thankfulness to which she had long been a stranger where very soon she fell sound asleep     chapter xii  southampton quay   when augusta opened her eyes again she became conscious of a violent rolling motion that she could not mistake they were at sea  she got up smoothed her hair and went on deck to find that she had slept for many hours for the sun was setting she went aft to where mrs thomas was sitting near the wheel with little dick beside her and after greeting them turned to watch the sunset the sight was a beautiful one enough for the great waves driven by the westerly wind which in these latitudes is nearly always blowing half a gale were rushing past them wild and free and the sharp spray of their foaming crests struck upon her forehead like a whip the sun was setting and the arrows of the dying light flew fast and far across the billowy bosom of the deep fast and far they flew from the stormy glory in the west lighting up the pale surfaces of cloud and tinging the grey waters of that majestic sea with a lurid hue of blood they kissed the bellying sails and seemed to rest upon the vessels lofty trucks and then travelled on and away and away through the great empyrean of space till they broke and vanished upon the horizons rounded edge there behind themmiles behindkerguelen land reared its fierce cliffs against the twilight sky clear and desolate they towered in an unutterable solitude and on their snowy surfaces the sunbeams beat coldly as the warm breath of some human passion beating on aphrodites marble breast  augusta gazed upon those drear cliffs that had so nearly proved her monumental pile and shuddered it was as a hideous dream  and then the dark and creeping shadows of the night threw their veils around and over them and they vanished they were swallowed up in blackness and she lost sight of them and of the great seas that forever beat and churn about their stony feet nor except in dreams did she again set her eyes upon their measureless solitude  the night arose in strength and shook a golden dew of stars from the tresses of her streaming clouds till the wonderful deep heavens sparkled with a myriad gemmy points the west wind going on his way sung his wild chant amongst the cordage and rushed among the sails as with a rush of wings the ship leant over like a maiden shrinking from a kiss then shivering fled away leaping from billow to billow as they rose and tossed their white arms about her fain to drag her down and hold her to oceans heaving breast  the rigging tautened and the huge sails flapped in thunder as the harpoon sped upon her course and all around was greatness and the present majesty of power augusta looked aloft and sighed she knew not why the swift blood of youth coursed through her veins and she rejoiced exceedingly that life and all its possibilities yet lay before her but a little more of that dreadful place and they would have lain behind her days would have been numbered before she scarce had time to strike a blow in the great human struggle that rages ceaselessly from age to age the voice of her genius would have been hushed just as its notes began to thrill and her message would never have been spoken in the world but now time was once more before her and oh the nearness of death had taught her the unspeakable value of that one asset on which we can relylife not indeed that life for which so many livethe life led for self and having for its principle if not its only end the gratification of the desires of self but an altogether higher lifea life devoted to telling that which her keen instinct knew was truth and however imperfectly painting with the pigment of her noble art those visions of beauty which sometimes seemed to rest upon her soul like shadows from the heaven of our hones                                       three months have passedthree long months of tossing waters and everpresent winds the harpoon shaping her course for norfolk in the united states had made but a poor passage of it she got into the southeast trades and all went well till they made st pauls rocks where they were detained by the doldrums and variable winds afterwards she passed into the northeast trades and then further north met a series of westerly gales that ultimately drove her to the azores just as her crew were getting very short of water and provisions and here augusta bid farewell to her friend the yankee skipper for the whaler that had saved her life and dicks after refitting once more set sail upon its almost endless voyage she stood on the breakwater at ponta delgada and watched the harpoon drop past the men recognized her and cheered lustily and captain thomas took off his hat for the entire ships company down to the cabinboy were headoverheels in love with augusta and the extraordinary offerings that they had made her on parting most of them connected in some way or other with that noble animal the whale sufficed to fill a goodsized packingcase augusta waved her handkerchief to them in answer but she could not see much of them because her eyes were full of tears she had had quite enough of the harpoon and yet she was loth so say farewell to her for her days on board had in many respects been restful and happy ones they had given her space and time to brace herself up before she plunged once more into the struggle of active life besides she had throughout been treated with that unvarying kindness and consideration for which the american people are justly noted in their dealings with all persons in misfortune  but augusta was not the only person who with sorrow watched the departure of the harpoon first there was little dick who had acquired a fine yankee drawl and grown quite half an inch on board of her and who fairly howled when his particular friend a remarkably fierce and grislylooking boatswain brought him as a parting offering a large whales tooth patiently carved by himself with a spirited picture of their rescue on kerguelen land then there was mrs thomas herself when they finally reached the island of st michael in the azores augusta had offered to pay fifty pounds being half of the hundred sovereigns given to her by mr meeson to captain thomas as a passage fee knowing that he was by no moans overburdened with the goods of this world but he stoutly declined to touch a farthing saying that it would be unlucky to take money from a castaway augusta as stoutly insisted and finally a compromise was come to mrs thomas was anxious being seized with that acute species of homesickness from which suffolk people are no more exempt than other folk to visit the land where she was born and the people midst whom she was bred up but this she could not well afford to do therefore augustas proffered fifty pounds was appropriated to this purpose and mrs thomas stopped with augusta at ponta delgada waiting for the london and west india line packet to take them to southampton  so it came to pass that they stood together on the ponta delgada breakwater and together saw the harpoon sail off towards the setting sun  then came a soft dreamy fortnight in the fair island of st michael where nature is ever as a bride and never reaches the stage of the hardworked toilworn mother lank and lean with the burden of maternity the mental act of looking back to this time in after years always recalled to augustas senses the odor of orangeblossoms and the sight of the rich pomegranatebloom blushing the roses down it was a pleasant time for the english consul there most hospitably entertained themwith much more personal enthusiasm indeed than he generally considered it necessary to show towards shipwrecked voyagersa class of people of whom consular representatives abroad must get rather tired with their eternal misfortunes and their perennial want of clothes indeed the only drawback to her enjoyment was that the consul a gallant official with red hair equally charmed by her adventures her literary fame and her person showed a decided disposition to fall in love with her and a redhaired and therefore ardent consular officer is under those circumstances a somewhat alarming personage but the time went on without anything serious happening and at last one morning after breakfast a man came running up with the information that the mail was in sight  and so augusta took an affectionate farewell of the goldenhaired consul who gazed at her through his eyeglass and sighed when he thought of what might have been in the sweet byandby and the ships bell rang and the screw began to turn leaving the consul still sighing on the horizon and in due course augusta and mrs thomas found themselves standing on the quay at southampton the centre of an admiring and enthusiastic crowd  the captain had told the extraordinary tale to the port officials when they boarded the vessel and on getting ashore the port officials had made haste to tell every living soul they met the wonderful news that two survivors of the illfated kangaroothe history of whose tragic end had sent a thrill of horror through the englishspeaking worldwere safe and sound on board the west india boat thus by the time that augusta mrs thomas and dick were safe on shore their story or rather sundry distorted versions of it was flashing up the wires to the various press agencies and running through southampton like wildfire scarcely were their feet set upon the quay when with a rush and a bound wild men with notebooks in their hands sprang upon them and beat them down with a rain of questions augusta found it impossible to answer them all at once so contented herself with saying yes yes yes to everything out of which monosyllable she afterwards found to her surprise these fierce and active pressmen contrived to make up a sufficiently moving tale which included glowing accounts of the horrors of the shipwreck and what rather took her aback a positive statement that she and the sailors had lived for a fortnight upon the broiled remains of mr meeson one interviewer being a small man and therefore unable to kick and fight his way through the ring which surrounded augusta and mrs thomas seized upon little dick and commenced to chirp and snap his fingers at him in the intervals of asking him such questions as he thought suitable to his years  dick dreadfully alarmed fled with a howl but this did not prevent a column and a half of matter headed the infants tale of woe from appearing that very day in a journal noted for the accuracy and unsensational character of its communications nor was the army of interviewers the only terror that they had to face little girls gave them bouquets an old lady whose brain was permeated with the idea that shipwrecked people went about in a condition of undress for much longer than was necessary after the event arrived with an armful of underclothing streaming on the breeze and last but not least a tall gentleman with a beautiful moustache thrust into augustas hand a note hastily written in pencil which when opened proved to be an offer of marriage  however at last they found themselves in a firstclass carriage ready to start or rather starting the interviewing gentlemen two of whom had their heads jammed through the window were forcibly drawn awaystill asking questions by the officialsthe tall gentleman with the moustache who was hovering in the background smiled a soft farewell in which modesty struggled visibly with hope the stationmaster took off his cap and in another minute they were rolling out of southampton station  augusta sank back with a sigh of relief and then burst out laughing at the thought of the gentleman with the fair moustachios on the seat opposite to her somebody had thoughtfully placed a number of the days papers she took up the first that came to hand and glanced at it idly with the idea of trying to pick up the thread of events her eyes fell instantly upon the name of mr gladstone printed all over the sheet in type of varying size and she sighed life on the ocean wave had been perilous and disagreeable enough but at any rate she had been free from mr gladstone and his doings whatever evil might be said of him he was not an old man of the sea turning the paper over impatiently she came upon the reports of the probate divorce and admiralty division of the high court the first report ran thus                                       before the right honourable the president  in the matter of meeson deceased  this was an application arising out of the loss of rms kangaroo on the eighteenth of december last it will be remembered that out of about a thousand souls on board that vessel the occupants of one boat onlytwentyfive people in allwere saved among the drowned was mr meeson the head of the wellknown birmingham publishing company of meeson addison and roscoe and co limited who was at the time on a visit to new zealand and australia in connection with the business of the company  mr fiddlestick qc who with mr pearl appeared for the applicants and who was somewhat imperfectly heard stated that the facts connected with the sinking of the kangaroo would probably still be so fresh in his lordships mind that it would not be necessary for him to detail them although he had them upon affidavit before him his lordship would remember that but one boatload of people had survived from this perhaps the most terrible shipwreck of the generation among the drowned was mr meeson and this application was on behalf of the executors of his will for leave to presume his death the property which passed under the will was very large indeed amounting in all mr fiddlestick understood to about two millions sterling which perhaps might incline his lordship to proceed very carefully in allowing probate to issue  the president wellthe amount of the property has got nothing to do with the principles on which the court acts with regard to the presumption of death mr fiddlestick  quite so my lord and i think that in this case your lordship will be satisfied that there is no reason why probate should not issue it is humanly speaking impossible that mr meeson can have escaped the general destruction  the president have you any affidavit from anybody who saw mr meeson in the water  no my lord i have an affidavit from a sailor named okers the only man who was picked up in the water after the kangaroo foundered which states that he believes that he saw mr meeson spring from the ship into the water but the affidavit does not carry the matter further he cannot swear that it was mr meeson  the president well i think that that will do the court is necessarily adverse to allowing the presumption of death except on evidence of the most satisfactory nature still considering that nearly four months have now passed since the foundering of the kangaroo under circumstances which make it exceedingly improbable that there were any other survivors i think that it may fairly presume that mr meeson shared the fate of the other passengers  mr fiddlestick the death to be presumed from the 18th of december  the president yes from the eighteenth  mr fiddlestick if your lordship pleases                                       augusta put down the paper with a gasp there was she safe and sound with the true last will of mr meeson tattooed upon her and probate had issuedwhatever that mysterious formula might meanto another will not the real last will it meant as she in her ignorance supposed that her will was no good that she had endured that abominable tattooing to no purpose and was to no purpose scarred for life  it was too much and in a fit of vexation she flung the times out of the window and cast herself back on the cushion feeling very much inclined to cry     chapter xiii  eustace buys a paper   in due course the train that bore augusta and her fortunes timed to reach waterloo at 540 pm rolled into the station the train was a fast one but the telegraph had been faster all the evening papers had come out with accounts more or less accurate of their escape and most of them had added that the two survivors would reach waterloo by the 540 train the consequence was that when the train drew up at the platform augusta on looking out was horrified to see a dense mass of human beings being kept in check by a line of policemen  however the guard was holding the door open so there was nothing for it but to get out which she did taking dick by the hand a proceeding that necessarily put her identity beyond a doubt the moment she got her foot on to the platform the crowd saw her and there arose such a tremendous shout of welcome that she very nearly took refuge again in the carriage for a moment she stood hesitating and the crowd seeing how sweet and beautiful she was for the three months of sea air had made her stouter and even more lovely cheered again with that peculiar enthusiasm which a discerning public always shows for a pretty face but even while she stood bewildered on the platform she heard a loud make waymake way there and saw the multitude being divided by a little knot of officials who were escorting somebody dressed in widows weeds  in another second there was a cry of joy and a sweet pale faced little lady had run at the child dick and was hugging him against her heart and sobbing and laughing both at once  oh my boy my boy cried lady holmhurst for it was she i thought you were deadlong ago dead  and then she turned and before all the people there clung about augustas neck and kissed her and blessed her because she had saved her only child and half removed the deadweight of her desolation whereat the crowd cheered and wept and yelled and swore with excitement and blessed their stars that they were there to see  and then in a haze of noise and excitement they were led through the cheering mob to where a carriage and pair were standing and were helped into it mrs thomas being placed on the front seat and lady holmhurst and augusta on the back the former with the gasping dick upon her knee  and now little dick is out of the story  then another event occurred which we must go back a little to explain  when eustace meeson had come to town after being formally disinherited he had managed to get a billet as latin french and old english reader in a publishing house of repute as it happened on this very afternoon he was strolling down the strand having finished a rather stiff days work and with a mind filled with those idle and somewhat confused odds and ends of speculation with which most brain workers will be acquainted he looked older and paler than when we last met him for sorrow and misfortune had laid their heavy hands upon him when augusta had departed he had discovered that he was head over heels in love with her in that unfortunate wayfor ninetynine times out of a hundred it is unfortunatein which many men of susceptibility do occasionally fall in love in their youtha way that brands the heart for life in a fashion that can no more be effaced than the stamp of a hot iron can be effaced from the physical body such an affectionwhich is not altogether of the earthwill when it overcomes a man prove either the greatest blessing of his life or one of the heaviest most enduring curses that a malignant fate can heap upon his head for if he achieves his desire even though he serve his seven years surely for him life will be robbed of half its evil but if he lose her either through misfortune or because he gave all this to one who did not understand the gift or one who looked at love and on herself as a currency wherewith to buy her place and the luxury of days then he will be of all men among the most miserable for nothing can give him back that which has gone from him  eustace had never seen augusta but twice in his life but then passion does not necessarily depend upon constant previous intercourse with its object love at first sight is common enough and in this instance eustace was not altogether dependent upon the spoken words of his adored or on his recollection of her very palpable beauty for he had her books to those who know something of the writersufficient let us say to enable him to put an approximate value on his or her sentiments so as to form a more or less accurate guess as to when he is speaking from his own mind when he is speaking from the mind of the puppet in hand and when he is merely putting a casea persons books are full of information and bring that person into a closer and more intimate contact with the reader than any amount of personal intercourse for whatever is best and whatever is worst in an individual will be reflected in his pages seeing that unless he is the poorest of hack authors he must of necessity set down therein the images that pass across the mirrors of his heart  thus it seemed to eustace who knew jemimas vow and also her previous abortive work almost by heart that he was very intimately acquainted with augusta and as he was walking home that may evening he was reflecting sadly enough of all that he had lost through that cruel shipwreck he had lost augusta and what was more he had lost his uncle and his uncles vast fortune for he too had seen the report of the application re meeson in the times and though he knew that he was disinherited it was a little crushing he had lost the fortune for augustas sake and now he had lost augusta also and he reflected not without dismay on the long dreary existence that stretched away before him filled up as it were with prospective piles of latin proofs with a sigh he halted at the wellingtonstreet crossing in the strand which owing to the constant stream of traffic at this point is one of the worst in london there was a block at the moment as there generally is and he stood for some minutes watching the frantic dashes of an old woman who always tried to cross it at the wrong time not without some amusement presently however a boy with a bundle of unfolded globes under his arm came rushing along making the place hideous with his howls  wonderful escape of a lady and han infant he roared account of the survivors of the kangaroowonderful escapedesert islandarrival of the magnolia with the criminals  eustace jumped and instantly bought a copy of the paper stepping into the doorway of a shop where they sold masonic jewels of every size and hue in order to read it the very first thing that his eye fell on was an editorial paragraph  in another column ran the paragraph will be found a short account telegraphed to us from southampton just as we are going to press of the most remarkable tale of the sea that we are acquainted with the escape of miss augusta smithers and of the little lord holmhurstas we suppose that we must now call himfrom the illfated kangaroo and their subsequent rescue on kerguelen land by the american whaler will certainly take rank as the most romantic incident of its kind in the recent annals of shipwreck miss smithers who will be better known to the public as the authoress of that charming book jemimas vow which took the town by storm about a year ago will arrive at waterloo station by the 540 train and we shall then  eustace read no more sick and faint with an extraordinary revulsion of feeling he leant against the door of the masonic shop which promptly opened in the most hospitable manner depositing him upon his back on the floor of the establishment in a second he was up and had bounded out of the shop with such energy that the shopman was on the point of holloaing stop thief it was exactly five oclock and he was not more than a quarter of a mile or so from waterloo station a hansom was sauntering along in front of him he sprang into it waterloo main line he shouted as hard as you can go and in another moment he was rolling across the bridge five or six minutes drive brought him to the station to which an enormous number of people were hurrying collected together partly by a rumour of what was going on and partly by that magnetic contagion of excitement which runs through a london mob like fire through dry grass  he dismissed the hansom throwing the driver halfacrown which considering that halfcrowns were none too plentiful with him was a rash thing to do and vigorously shouldered his way through the crush till he reached the spot where the carriage and pair were standing the carriage was just beginning to move on  stop he shouted at the top of his voice to the coachman who pulled up again in another moment he was alongside and there sweeter and more beautiful than in ever he once more saw his love  she started at his voice which she seemed to know and their eyes met their eyes met and a great light of happiness shot into her sweet face and shone there till it was covered up and lost in the warm blush that followed  he tried to speak but could not twice he tried and twice he failed and meanwhile the mob shouted like anything at last however he got it outthank god he stammered thank god you are safe  for answer she stretched out her hand and gave him one sweet look he took it and once more the carriage began to move on  where are you to be found he had the presence of mind to ask  at lady holmhursts come tomorrow morning i have something to tell you she answered and in another minute the carriage was gone leaving him standing there in a condition of mind which really can be better imagined than described     chapter xiv  at hanoversquare   eustace could never quite remember how he got through the evening of that eventful day everything connected with it seemed hazy to him as however fortunately for the reader of this history we are not altogether dependent on the memory of a young man in love which is always a treacherous thing to deal with having other and exclusive sources of information we may as well fill the gap first of all he went to his club and seized a redbook in which he discovered that lord holmhursts or rather lady holmhursts london house was in hanoversquare then he walked to his rooms in one of the little sidestreets opening out of the strand and went through the form of eating some dinner after which a terrible fit of restlessness got possession of him and he started out walking for three solid hours did that young man walk which was no doubt a good thing for him for one never gets enough exercise in london and at the end of that time having already been to hammersmith and back he found himself gravitating towards hanoversquare once there he had little difficulty in finding the number there was a light in the drawingroom floor and the night being warm one of the windows was open so that the lamplight shone softly through the lace curtains eustace crossed over to the other side of the street and leaning against the iron railings of the square looked up he was rewarded for his pains for through the filmy curtain he could make out the forms of two ladies seated side by side upon an ottoman with their faces towards the window and in one of these he had no difficulty in recognising augusta her head was leaning on her hand and she was talking earnestly to her companion he wondered what she was talking of and had half a mind to go and ring and ask to see her why should he wait till tomorrow morning presently however better counsels prevailed and though sorely against his will he stopped where he was till a policeman thinking his rapt gaze suspicious gruffly requested him to move on  to gaze at ones only love through an open window is no doubt a delightful occupation if a somewhat tantalising one but if eustaces ears had been as good as his eyes and he could have heard the conversation that was proceeding in the drawingroom he would have been still more interested  augusta had just been unfolding that part of her story which dealt with the important document tattooed upon her shoulders to which lady holmhurst had listened ore rotundo  and so the young man is coming here tomorrow morning said lady holmhurst how delightful i am sure he looked a very nice young man and he had very fine eyes it is the most romantic thing that i ever heard of  it may be delightful for you bessie said augusta rather tartly but i call it disgusting it is all very well to be tattooed upon a desert islandnot that that was very nice i can tell you but it is quite another thing to have to show the results in a london drawingroom of course mr meeson will want to see this will whatever it may be worth and i should like to ask you bessie how i am to show it to him it is on my neck  i have not observed said lady holmhurst drily that ladies as a rule have an insuperable objection to showing their necks if you have any doubt on the point i recommend you to get an invitation to a london ball all you will have to do will be to wear a low dress the fact of being tattooed does not make it any more improper for you to show your shoulders than it would be if they were not tattooed  i have never worn a low dress said augusta and i do not want to show my shoulders  ah well said lady holmhurst darkly i daresay that that feeling will soon wear off but of course if you wont you wont and under those circumstances you had better say nothing about the willthough she added learnedly of course that would be compounding a felony  would it i dont quite see where the felony comes in  well of course it is this way you steal the willthats felony and if you dont show it to him i suppose you compound it it is a double offencecompound felony  nonsense answered augusta to this exposition of the law which was it will be admitted almost as lucid and convincing as that of an average qc how can i steal my own shoulders it is impossible  oh no not at all you dont know what funny things you can do i once had a cousin whom i coached for his examination for the bar and i learnt a great deal about it then poor fellow he was plucked eight times  i am sure i dont wonder at it said augusta rudely well i suppose i must put on this low dress but it is horridperfectly horrid you will have to lend me one that is all  my dear answered lady holmhurst with a glance at her widows weeds i have no low dresses though perhaps i can find some among the things i put away before we sailed and her eyes filled with tears  augusta took her hand and they began to talk of that great bereavement and of their own wonderful survival till at last she led the conversation round to little dick and bessie holmhurst smiled again at the thought that her darling boy her only child was safe asleep up stairs and not as she had believed washing to and fro at the bottom of the ocean she took augustas hand and kissed it and blessed her for having saved her child till suddenly somewhat to the relief of the latter the butler opened the door and said that two gentlemen wanted very particularly to speak to miss smithers and then she was once more handed over to her old enemies the interviewers and after them came the representatives of the company and then more special reporters and then an artist from one of the illustrated papers who insisted upon her giving him an appointment in language that though polite indicated that he meant to have his way and so on till nearly midnight when she rushed off to bed and locked her door  next morning augusta appeared at breakfast dressed in an exceedingly becoming low dress which lady holmhurst sent up to her with her hot water she had never worn one before and it certainly is trying to put on a low dress for the first time in full daylightindeed she felt as guilty as does a person of temperate habits when he is persuaded to drink a brandy and soda before getting up however there was no help for it so throwing a shawl over her shoulders she descended  my dear do let me see said lady holmhurst as soon as the servant had left the room  with a sigh augusta uncovered her shoulders and her friend ran round the table to look at them there on her neck was the will the cuttle ink had proved an excellent medium and the tattooing was as fresh as the day on which it had been done and would no doubt remain so till the last hour of her life  well said lady holmhurst i hope the young man will be duly grateful i should have to be very much in love and she looked meaningly at augusta before i would spoil myself in that fashion for any man  augusta blushed at the insinuation and said nothing at ten oclock just as they were half through breakfast there came a ring at the bell  here he is said lady holmhurst clapping her hands well if this isnt the very funniest thing that i ever heard of i told jones to show him in here  hardly were the words out of her mouth when the butler who looked as solemn as a mute in his deep mourning opened the door and announced mr eustace meeson in those deep and commanding tones which flunkeys and flunkeys alone have at their command there was a moments pause augusta half rose from her chair and then sat down again and noticing her embarrassment lady holmhurst smiled maliciously then came in eustace himself looking rather handsome exceedingly nervous and beautifully got upin a frockcoat with a flower in it  oh how do you do he said to augusta holding out his hand which she took rather coldly  how do you do mr meeson she answered let me introduce you to lady holmhurst mr meeson lady holmhurst eustace bowed and put his hat down on the butterdish for he was very much overcome  i hope that i have not come too early he said in great confusion as he perceived his mistake i thought that you would have done breakfast  oh not at all mr meeson said lady holmhurst wont you have a cup of tea augusta give mr meeson a cup of tea  he took the tea which he did not want in the least and then there came an awkward silence nobody seemed to know how to begin the conversation  how did you find the house mr meeson said lady holmhurst at last miss smithers gave you no address and there are two lady holmhurstsmy motherinlaw and myself  oh i looked it out and then i walked here last night and saw you both sitting at the window  indeed said lady holmhurst and why did you not come in you might have helped to protect miss smithers from the reporters  i dont know he answered confusedly i did not like to and besides a policeman thought i was a suspicious character and told me to move on  dear me mr meeson you must have been having a good look at us  here augusta interposed fearing least her admirerfor with an unerring instinct she now guessed how matters stoodshould say something foolish a young man who is capable of standing to stare at a house in hanoversquare is she thought evidently capable of anything  i was surprised to see you yesterday she said how did you know we were coming  eustace told her that he had seen it in the globe i am sure you cannot have been so surprised as i was he went on i had made sure that you were drowned i went up to birmingham to call on you after you had gone and found that you had vanished and left no address the maidservant declared that you had sailed in a ship called the conger eelwhich i afterwards found out was kangaroo and then she went down and after a long time they published a full list of the passengers and your name was not among them and i thought that after all you might have got off the ship or something then some days afterwards came a telegram from albany in australia giving the names of lady holmhurst and the others who were saved and specially mentioning miss smithersthe novelist and lord holmhurst as being among the drowned and that is how the dreadful suspense came to an end it was awful i can tell you  both of the young women looked at eustaces face and saw that there was no mistaking the real nature of the trial through which he had passed so real was it that it never seemed to occur to him that there was anything unusual in his expressing such intense interest in the affairs of a young lady with whom he was outwardly at any rate on the terms of merest acquaintance  it was very kind of you to think so much about me said augusta gently i had no idea that you would call again or i would have left word where i was going  well thank god you are safe and sound at any rate answered eustace and then with a sudden burst of anxiety you are not going back to new zealand just yet are you  i dont know i am rather sick of the sea just now  no indeed she is not said lady holmhurst she is going to stop with me and dick miss smithers saved dicks life you know when the nurse poor thing had run away and now dear you had better tell mr meeson about the will  the will what will asked eustace  listen and you will hear  and eustace did listen with open eyes and ears while augusta getting over her shyness as best she might told the whole story of his uncles death and of the way in which he had communicated his testamentary wishes  and do you mean to tell me said eustace astounded that you allowed him to have his confounded will tattooed upon your neck  yes answered augusta i did and what is more mr meeson i think that you ought to be very much obliged to me for i daresay that i shall often be sorry for it  i am very much obliged answered eustace i had no right to expect such a thing and in short i do not know what to say i should never have thought that any woman was capable of such a sacrifice forfor a comparative stranger  then came another awkward pause  well mr meeson said augusta at last rising brusquely from her chair the document belongs to you and so i suppose that you had better see it not that i think that it will be of much use to you however as i see that probate had been allowed to issue whatever that may mean of mr meesons other will  i do not know that that will matter said eustace as i heard a friend of mine mr short who is a barrister talk about some case the other day in which probate was revoked on the production of a subsequent will  indeed answered augusta i am very glad to hear that then perhaps after all i have been tattooed to some purpose well i suppose you had better see it and with a gesture that was half shy and half defiant she drew the lace shawl from her shoulders and turned her back towards him so that he might see what was inscribed across it  eustace stared at the broad line of letters which with the signatures written underneath might mean a matter of two millions of money to him  thank you he said at last and taking up the lace shawl he threw it over her again  if you will excuse me for a few minutes mr meeson interrupted lady holmhurst at this point i have to go to see about the dinner and before augusta could interfere she had left the room  eustace closed the door behind her and turned feeling instinctively that a great crisis in his fortunes had come there are some men who rise to an emergency and some who shrink from it and the difference is that difference between him who succeeds and him who fails in life and in all that makes life worth living  eustace belonged to the class that rises and not to that which shrinks     chapter xv  eustace consults a lawyer   augusta was leaning against the marble mantelpieceindeed one of her arms was resting upon it for she was a tall woman perhaps she too felt that there was something in the air at any rate she turned away her head and began to play with a bronze japanese lobster which adorned the mantelpiece  now for it said eustace to himself drawing a long breath to try and steady the violent pulsations of his heart  i dont know what to say to you miss smithers he began  best say nothing more about it she put in quickly i did it and i am glad that i did it what do a few marks matter if a great wrong is prevented thereby i am not ever likely to have to go to court besides mr meeson there is another thing it was through me that you lost your inheritance it is only right that i should try to be the means of bringing it back to you  she dropped her head again and once more began to play with the bronze lobster holding her arm in such a fashion that eustace could not see her face but if he could not see her face she could see his in the glass and narrowly observed its every change which on the whole though natural was rather mean of her  poor eustace grew pale and paler yet till his handsome countenance became positively ghastly it is wonderful how frightened young men are the first time that they propose it wears off afterwardswith practice one gets accustomed to anything  miss smithersaugusta he gasped i want to say something to you and he stopped dead  yes mr meeson she answered cheerfully what is it  i want to tell youand again he hesitated  what you are going to do about the will suggested augusta  nono nothing about the willplease dont laugh at me and put me off  she looked up innocentlyas much as to say that she never dreamed of doing either of these things she had a lovely face and the glance of the grey eyes quite broke down the barrier of his fears  oh augusta augusta he said dont you understand i love you i love you no woman was ever loved before as i love you i fell in love with you the very first time i saw you in the office at meesons when i had the row with my uncle about you and ever since then i have got deeper and deeper in love with you when i thought that you were drowned it nearly broke my heart and often and often i wished that i were dead too  it was augustas turn to be disturbed now for though a ladys composure will stand her in good stead up to the very verge of an affair of this sort it generally breaks down in medias res anyhow she certainly dropped her eyes and colored to her hair while her breast began to heave tumultuously  do you know mr meeson she said at last without daring to look at his imploring face that this is only the fourth time that we have seen each other including yesterday  yes i know he said but dont refuse me on that account you can see me as often as you likethis was generous of master eustaceand really i know you better than you think i should think that i have read each of your books twenty times  this was a happy stroke for however free from vanity a person may be it is not in the nature of a young woman to hear that somebody has read her book twenty times without being pleased  i am not my books said augusta  no but your books are part of you he answered and i have learnt more about your real self through them than i should have done if i had seen you a hundred times instead of four  augusta slowly raised her grey eyes till they met his own and looked at him as though she were searching out his soul and the memory of that long sweet look is with him yet  he said no more nor had she any words but somehow nearer and nearer they drew one to the other till his arms were around her and his lips were pressed upon her lips happy man and happy girl they will live to find that life has joys for those who are good and are well off but that it has no joys so holy and so complete as that which they were now experiencingthe first kiss of true and honest love  a little while afterwards the butler came in in a horribly sudden manner and found augusta and eustace the one very red and the other very pale standing suspiciously close to each other but he was a very welltrained butler and a man of experience who had seen much and guessed more and he looked innocent as a babe unborn  just then too lady holmhurst came in again and looked at the pair of them with an amusing twinkle in her eye lady holmhurst like her butler was also a person of experience  wont you come into the drawing room she said and they did looking rather sheepish  and there eustace made a clean breast of it announcing that they were engaged to be married and although this was somewhat of an assumption seeing that no actual words of troth had passed between them augusta stood there never offering a word in contradiction  well mr meeson said lady holmhurst i think that you are the luckiest man of my acquaintance for augusta is not only one of the sweetest and loveliest girls that i have ever met she is also the bravest and the cleverest you will have to look out mr meeson or you will be known as the husband of the great augusta meeson  i will take the risk he answered humbly i know that augusta has more brains in her little finger than i have in my whole body i dont know how she can look at a fellow like me  dear me how humble we are said lady holmhurst well that is the way of men before marriage and now as augusta carries both your fortunes on her back as well as in her face and brain i venture to suggest that you had better go and see a lawyer about the matter that is if you have quite finished your little talk i suppose that you will come and dine with us mr meeson and if you like to come a little early say halfpast six i daresay that augusta will arrange to be in to hear what you have found out about this will you know and nowan revoir  i think that that is a very nice young man my dear said lady holmhurst as soon as eustace had bowed himself out it was rather audacious of him to propose to you the fourth time that he set eyes upon you but i think that audacity is on the whole a good quality in the male sex another thing is that if that will is worth anything he will be one of the wealthiest men in the whole of england so taking it altogether i think i may congratulate you my dear and now i suppose that you have been in love with this young man all along i guessed as much when i saw your face as he ran up to the carriage yesterday and i was sure of it when i heard about the tattooing no girl would allow herself to be tattooed in the interest of abstract justice oh yes i know all about it and now i am going out walking in the park with dick and i should advise you to compose yourself for that artist is coming to draw you at twelve  and she departed and left augusta to her reflections which werewell not unpleasant ones  meanwhile eustace was marching towards the temple as it happened in the same lodginghouse where he had been living for the last few months two brothers of the name of short had rooms and with these young gentlemen he had become very friendly the two shorts were twins and so like one another that it was more than a month before eustace could be sure which of them he was speaking to when they were both at college their father died leaving his property equally between them and as this property on realisation was not found to amount to more than four hundred a year the twins very rightly concluded that they had better do something to supplement their moderate income accordingly by a stroke of genius they determined that one of them should become a solicitor and the other a barrister and then tossed up as to which should take to which trade the idea of course was that in this manner they would be able to afford each other mutual comfort and support john would give james briefs and james reflected glory would shine back on john in short they were anxious to establish a legal dong firm of the most approved pattern  accordingly they passed their respective examinations and john took rooms with another budding solicitor in the city while james hired chambers in pumpcourt but there the matter stopped for as john did not get any work of course he could not give any to james and so it came to pass that for the past three years neither of the twins had found the law as profitable as they anticipated in vain did john sit and sigh in the city clients were few and far between scarcely enough to pay his rent and in vain did james artistically robed wander like the evil one from court to court seeking what he might devour occasionally he had the pleasure of taking a note for another barrister who was called away which means doing another mans work for nothing once too a man with whom he had a nodding acquaintance rushed up to him and thrusting a brief into his hands asked him to hold it for him telling him that it would be on in a short time and that there was nothing in itnothing at all scarcely had poor james struggled through the brief when the case was called on and it may suffice to say that at its conclusion the judge gazed at him mildly over his spectacles and could not help wondering that any learned counsel had been found who would consent to waste the time of the court in such a case as the one to which he had been listening clearly james friend would not so consent and had passed on the responsibility minus the fee on another occasion james was in the probate court on motion day and a solicitora real live solicitorcame up to him and asked him to make a motion marked mr 2 gns for leave to dispense with a corespondent this motion he made and the corespondent was dispensed with in the approved fashion but when he turned round the solicitor had vanished and he never saw him more or the two guineas either however the brief his only one remained and after that he took to hovering about the divorce court partly in the hope of once more seeing that solicitor and partly with a vague idea of drifting into practice in the division  now eustace had often when in the shorts sittingroom in the lodginghouse in the strand heard the barrister james hold forth learnedly on the matter of wills and therefore he naturally enough turned towards him in his recent dilemma knowing the address of his chambers in pumpcourt he hurried thither and was in due course admitted by a very small child who apparently filled the responsible office of clerk to mr james short and several other learned gentlemen whose names appeared upon the door  the infant regarded eustace when he opened the door with a look of such preternatural sharpness that it almost frightened him the beginning of that eagle glance was full of inquiring hope and the end of resigned despair the child had thought that eustace might be a client come to tread the paths which no client ever had trod hence the hope and the despair in his eyes eustace had nothing of the solicitors clerk about him clearly he was not a client  mr short was in that door to the right eustace knocked and entered into a bare little chamber about the size of a large housemaids closet furnished with a table three chairs one a basket easy and a bookcase with a couple of dozen of law books and some old volumes of reports and a broad windowsill in the exact centre of which lay the solitary and venerated brief  mr james short was a short stout young man with black eyes a hooked nose and a prematurely bald head indeed this baldness of the head was the only distinguishing mark between james and john and therefore a thing to be thankful for though of course useless to the perplexed acquaintance who met them in the street when their hats were on at the moment of eustaces entry mr short had been engaged in studying that intensely legal print the sporting times which however from some unexplained bashfulness he had hastily thrown under the table filling its space with a law book snatched at hazard from the shelf  all right old fellow said eustace whose quick eyes had caught the quick flutter of the vanishing paper dont be alarmed its only me  ah said mr james short when he had shaken hands with him you see i thought that it might have been a clienta client is always possible however improbable and one has to be ready to meet the possibility  quite so old fellow said eustace but do you know as it happens i am a clientand a big one too it is a matter of two millions of moneymy uncles fortune there was another will and i want to take your advice  mr short fairly bounded out of the chair in exultation and then struck by another thought sank back into it again  my dear meeson he said i am sorry i cannot hear you  eh said eustace what do you mean  i mean that you are not accompanied by a solicitor and it is not the etiquette of the profession to which i belong to see a client unaccompanied by a solicitor  oh hang the etiquette of the profession  my dear meeson if you came to me as a friend i should be happy to give you any legal information in my power and i flatter myself that i know something of matters connected with probate but you yourself said that you have come as a client and in that case the personal relationship sinks into the background and is superseded by the official relationship under these circumstances it is evident that the etiquette of the profession intervenes which overmastering force compels me to point out to you how improper and contrary to precedent it would be for me to listen to you without the presence of a properly qualified solicitor  oh lord gasped eustace i had no idea that you were so particular i thought perhaps that you would be glad of the job  certainlycertainly in the present state of my practice as he glanced at the solitary brief i should be the last to wish to turn away work let me suggest that you should go and consult my brother john in the poultry i believe business is rather slack with him just now so i think it probable that you will find him disengaged indeed i dare say that i may go so far as to make an appointment for him herelet us say in an hours time stop i will consult my clerk dick  the infant appeared  i believe that i have no appointment for this morning  no sir said dick with a twinkle in his eye one moment sir i will consult the book and he vanished to return presently with the information that mr shorts time was not under any contributions that day  very good said mr short then make an entry of an appointment with mr john short and mr meeson at two precisely  yes sir said dick departing to the unaccustomed task  as soon as eustace had departed from tweedledum to tweedledee or in other words from james barrister to john solicitor dick was again summoned and bade go to a certain mr thomson on the next floor mr thomson had an excellent library which had come to him by will on the strength of this bequest he had become a barristeratlaw and the object of dicks visit was to request the loan of the eighth volume of the statutes revised containing the wills act of 1 vic cap 26 brown on probate dixon on probate and powles on brown to the study of which valuable books mr james short devoted himself earnestly whilst awaiting his clients return  meanwhile eustace had made his way in a twopenny bus to one of those busy courts in the city where mr john short practised as a solicitor mr shorts office was eustace discovered by referring to a notice board on the seventh floor of one of the tallest houses he had ever seen however up he went with a stout heart and after some five minutes of a struggle that reminded him forcibly of climbing the ladders of a cornish mine he arrived at a little door right at the very top of the house on which was painted mr john short solicitor eustace knocked and the door was opened by a small boy so like the small boy he had seen at mr james shorts at the temple that he fairly started afterwards the mystery was explained like their masters the two small boys were brothers  mr john short was within and eustace was ushered into his presence to all appearance he was consulting a voluminous mass of correspondence written on large sheets of brief paper but when he looked at it closely it seemed to eustace that the edges of the paper were very yellow and the ink was much faded this however was not to be wondered at seeing that mr john short had taken them over with the other fixtures of the office     chapter xvi  short on legal etiquette   well meeson what is it have you come to ask me to lunch asked mr john short do you know i actually thought that you might have been a client  well by jove old fellow and so i am answered eustace i have been to your brother and he has sent me on to you because he says that it is not the etiquette of the profession to see a client unless a solicitor is present so he has referred me to you  perfectly right perfectly right of my brother james meeson considering how small are his opportunities of becoming cognizant with the practice of his profession it is extraordinary how well he is acquainted with its theory and now what is the point  well do you know short as the point is rather a long one and as your brother said that he should expect us at two precisely i think that we had better take the bus back to the temple when i can tell the yarn to both of you at once  very well i do not as a general rule like leaving my office at this time of day as it is apt to put clients to inconvenience especially such of them as come from a distance but i will make an exception for you meeson william he went on to the counterpart of the pumpcourt infant if anyone calls to see me will you be so good as to tell them that i am engaged in an important conference at the chambers of mr short in pumpcourt but that i hope to be back by halfpast three  yes sir said william as he shut the door behind them certainly sir and then having placed the musty documents upon the shelf whence they could be fetched down without difficulty on the slightest sign of a client that ingenious youth with singular confidence that nobody would be inconvenienced thereby put a notice on the door to the effect that he would be back immediately and adjourned to indulge in the passionately exhilarating game of chuck farthing with various other small clerks of his acquaintance  in due course eustace and his legal adviser arrived at pumpcourt and oh how the heart of james the barrister swelled with pride when for the first time in his career he saw a real solicitor enter his chambers accompanied by a real client he would indeed have preferred it if the solicitor had not happened to be his twinbrother and the client had been some other than his intimate friend but still it was a blessed sighta veryblessed sight  will you be seated gentlemen he said with much dignity  they obeyed  and now meeson i suppose that you have explained to my brother the matter on which you require my advice  no i havent said eustace i thought i might as well explain it to you both together eh  hum said james it is not quite regular according to the etiquette of the profession to which i have the honour to belong it is not customary that matters should be so dealt with it is usual that papers should be presented but that i will overlook as the point appears to be pressing  thats right said eustace well i have come to see about a will  so i understand said james but what will and where is it  well its a will in my favour and is tattooed upon a ladys neck  the twins simultaneously rose from their chairs and looked at eustace with such a ridiculous identity of movement and expression that he fairly burst out laughing  i presume meeson that this is not a hoax said james severely i presume that you know too well what is due to learned counsel to attempt to make one of their body the victim of a practical joke  surely meeson added john you have sufficient respect for the dignity of the law not to tamper with it in any such way as my brother has indicated  oh certainly not i assure you it is all square it is a true bill or rather a true will  proceed said james resuming his seat this is evidently a case of an unusual nature  you are right there old boy said eustace and now just listen and he proceeded to unfold his moving tale with much point and emphasis  when he had finished john looked at james rather helplessly the case was beyond him but james was equal to the occasion he had mastered that first great axiom which every young barrister should lay to heartnever appear to be ignorant  this case he said as though he were giving judgment is doubtless of a remarkable nature and i cannot at the moment lay my hand upon any authority bearing on the pointif indeed any such are to be found but i speak offhand and must not be held too closely to the obiter dictum of a viva voce opinion it seems to me that notwithstanding its peculiar idiosyncrasies and the various cruces that it presents it will upon closer examination be found to fall within those general laws that govern the legal course of testamentary disposition if i remember arighti speak offhandthe act of 1 vic cap 26 specifies that a will shall be in writing and tattooing may fairly be defined as a rude variety of writing it is i admit usual that writing should be done on paper or parchment but i have no doubt that the young ladys skin if carefully removed and dried would make excellent parchment at present therefore it is parchment in its green stage and perfectly available for writing purposes  to continue it appearsi am taking mr meesons statement as being perfectly accuratethat the will was properly and duly executed by the testator or rather by the person who tattooed in his presence and at his command a form of signature which is very well covered by the section of the act of 1 vic cap 26 it seems too that the witnesses attested in the presence of each other and of the testator it is true that there was no attestation clause but the supposed necessity for an attestation clause is one of those fallacies of the lay mind which perhaps cluster more frequently and with a greater persistence round questions connected with testamentary disposition than those of any other branch of the law therefore we must take the will to have been properly executed in accordance with the spirit of the statute  and now we come to what at present strikes me as the crux the will is undated does that invalidate it i answer with confidence no and mark evidencethat of lady holmhurstcan be produced that this will did not exist upon miss augusta smithers previous to dec 19 on which day the kangaroo sank and evidence can also be producedthat of mrs thomasthat it did exist on christmas day when miss smithers was rescued it is therefore clear that it must have got upon her back between dec 19 and dec 25  quite so old fellow said eustace much impressed at this coruscation of legal lore evidently you are the man to tackle the case but i say what is to be done next you see im afraid its too late probate has issued whatever that may mean  probate has issued echoed the great james struggling with his rising contempt and is the law so helpless that probate which has been allowed to issue under an erroneous apprehension of the facts cannot be recalled most certainly not so soon as the preliminary formalities are concluded a writ must be issued to revoke the probate and claiming that the court should pronounce in favour of the later will or stay there is no executorthere is no executora very important pointclaiming a grant of letters of administration with the will annexed i think that will be the better course  but how can you annex miss smithers to a grant of letters of administration whatever that may mean said eustace feebly  that reminds me said james disregarding the question and addressing his brother you must at once file miss smithers in the registry and see to the preparation of the usual affidavit of scripts  certainly certainly said john as though this were the most simple business in the world  what gasped eustace as a vision of augusta impaled upon an enormous billguard rose before his eyes you cant file a lady its impossible  impossible or not it must be done before any further steps are taken let me see i believe that dr probate is the sitting registrar at somerset house this sittings it would be well if you made an appointment for tomorrow  yes said john  well went on james i think that is all for the present you will of course let me have the instructions and other papers with all possible speed i suppose that other counsel besides myself will be ultimately retained  oh that reminds me said eustace about money you know i dont quite see how i am going to pay for all this game i have got about fifty pounds spare cash in the world and thats all and i know enough to be aware that fifty pounds do not go far in a lawsuit  blankly james looked at john and john at james this was very trying  fifty pounds will go a good way in outofpocket fees suggested james at length rubbing his bald head with his handkerchief  possibly answered john pettishly but how about the remuneration of the plaintiffs legal advisers cant youaddressing eustacemanage to get the money from someone  well said eustace theres lady holmhurst perhaps if i offered to share the spoil with her if there was any  dear me no said john that would be maintenance  certainly not chimed in james holding up his hand in dismay most clearly it would be champerty and did it come to the knowledge of the court nobody can say what might not happen  indeed answered eustace with a sigh i dont quite know what you mean but i seem to have said something very wrong the odds on a handicap are childs play to understand beside this law he added sadly  it is obvious james said john that putting aside other matters this would prove independent of pecuniary reward a most interesting case for you to conduct  that is so john replied james but as you must be well aware the etiquette of my profession will not allow me to conduct a case for nothing upon that point above all others etiquette rules us with a rod of iron the stomach of the bar collective and individual is revolted and scandalised at the idea of one of its members doing anything for nothing  yes put in eustace i have always understood they were regular nailers  quite so my dear james quite so said john with a sweet smile a fee must be marked upon the brief of learned counsel and that fee be paid to him together with many other smaller fees for learned counsel is like the cigaretteboxes and newfashioned weighingmachines at the stations he does not work unless you drop something down him but there is nothing to prevent learned counsel from returning that fee and all the little fees indeed james you will see that this practice is common amongst the most eminent of your profession when for instance they require an advertisement or wish to pay a delicate compliment to a constituency what do they do then they wait till they find £500 marked upon a brief and then resign their fee why should you not do the same in this case in your own interest of course if we win the cause the other side or the estate will pay the costs and if we lose you will at least have had the advantage the priceless advantage of a unique advertisement  very well john let it be so said james with magnanimity your check for fees will be duly returned but it must be understood that they are to be presented  not at the bank said john hastily i have recently had to oblige a client he added by way of explanation to eustace and my balance is rather low  no said james i quite understand i was going to say are to be presented to my clerk  and with this solemn farce the conference came to an end     chapter xvii  how augusta was filed   that very afternoon eustace returned to lady holmhursts house in hanoversquare to tell his dear augusta that she must attend on the following morning to be filed in the registry at somerset house as may be imagined though willing to go any reasonable length to oblige her newfound lover augusta not unnaturally resisted this course violently and was supported in her resistance by her friend lady holmhurst who however presently left the room leaving them to settle it as they liked  i do think that it is a little hard said augusta with a stamp of her foot that after all that i have gone through i should be taken off to have my unfortunate back stared at by a doctor some one or other and then be shut up with a lot of musty old wills in a registry  well my dearest girl said eustace either it must be done or else the whole thing must be given up mr john short declares that it is absolutely necessary that the document should be placed in the custody of the officer of the court  but how am i going to live in a cupboard or in an iron safe with a lot of wills asked augusta feeling very cross indeed  i dont know i am sure said eustace mr john short says that that is a matter which the learned doctor will have to settle his own opinion is that the learned doctorconfound himwill order that you should accompany him about wherever he goes till the trial comes off for you see in that way you would never be out of the custody of an officer of the court but went on eustace gloomily all i can tell him if he makes that order is that if he takes you about with him he will have to take me too  why said augusta  why because i dont trust himthats why old oh yes i dare say he is old and besides just think this learned gentleman has practised for twenty years in the divorce court now i ask you what can you expect from a gentleman however learned who has practised for twenty years in the divorce court i know him went on eustace vindictivelyi know him he will fall in love with you himself why he would be an old duffer if he didnt  really said augusta bursting out laughing you are too ridiculous eustace  i dont know about being ridiculous augusta but if you think i am going to let you be marched about by that learned doctor without my being there to look after you you are mistaken why of course he would fall in love with you or some of his clerks would nobody could be near you for a couple of days without doing so  do you think so said augusta looking at him very sweetly  yes i do he answered and thus the conversation came to an end and was not resumed till dinnertime  on the following morning at eleven oclock eustace who had managed to get a few days leave from his employers arrived with mr john short to take augusta and lady holmhurstwho was going to chaperon herto somerset house whither notwithstanding her objections of the previous day she had at last consented to go mr short was introduced and much impressed both the ladies by the extraordinary air of learning and command which was stamped upon his countenance he wanted to inspect the will at once but augusta struck at this saying that it would be quite enough to have her shoulders stared at once that day with a sigh and a shake of the head at her unreasonableness mr john short submitted and then the carriage came round and they were all driven off to somerset house presently they were there and after threading innumerable chilly passages reached a dismal room with an almanack a dirty deal table and a few chairs in it wherein were congregated several solicitors clerks waiting their turn to appear before the registrar here they waited for halfanhour or more to augustas considerable discomfort for she soon found that she was an object of curiosity and closest attention to the solicitors clerks who never took their eyes off her presently she discovered the reason for having remarkably quick ears she overheard one of the solicitors clerks a callow little man with yellow hair and an enormous diamond pin whose appearance somehow reminded her of a newborn chicken tell another who was evidently of the jewish faith that she augusta was the respondent in the famous divorce case of jones v jones and was going to appear before the registrar to submit herself to cross examination in some matter connected with a grant of alimony now as all london was talking about the alleged iniquities of the mrs jones in question whose moral turpitude was only equalled by her beauty augusta did not feel best pleased although she perceived that she instantly became an object of heartfelt admiration to the clerks  presently however somebody poked his head through the door which he opened just wide enough to admit it and bawling out  short re meeson vanished as abruptly as he had come  now lady holmhurst if you please said mr john short allow me to show the way if you will kindly follow with the willthis way please  in another minute the unfortunate will found herself in a large and lofty room at the top of which with his back to the light sat a most agreeablelooking middleaged gentleman who as they advanced rose with a politeness that one does not generally expect from officials on a fixed salary and bowing asked them to be seated  well what can i do for you mrah mrand he put on his eyeglasses and referred to his notesmr shortyou wish to file a will i understand and there are peculiar circumstances of some sort in the case  yes sir there are said mr john short with much meaning the will to be filed in the registry is the last true will of jonathan meeson of pompadour hall in the county of warwick and the property concerned amounts to about two millions upon last motion day the death of jonathan meeson who was supposed to have sunk in the kangaroo was allowed to be presumed and probate has been taken out as a matter of fact however the said jonathan meeson perished in kerguelen land some days after the shipwreck and before he died he duly executed a fresh will in favour of his nephew eustace h meeson the gentleman before you miss augusta smithers  what said the learned registrar is this miss smithers whom we have been reading so much about latelythe kerguelen land heroine  yes i am miss smithers she said with a little blush and this is lady holmhurst whose husbandand she checked herself  it gives me much pleasure to make your acquaintance miss smithers said the learned doctor courteously shaking hands and bowing to lady holmhurstproceedings which eustace watched with the jaundiced eye of suspicion hes beginning already said that ardent lover to himself i knew how it would be trust my gus into his custodynever i had rather be committed for contempt  the best thing that i can do sir went on john short impatiently for to his severe eye these interruptions were not seemly will be to at once offer you inspection of the document which i may state is of an unusual character and he looked at augusta who poor girl coloured to the eyes  quite so quite so said the learned registrar well has miss smithers got the will perhaps she will produce it  miss smithers is the will said mr john short  ohi am afraid that i do not quite understand  to be more precise sir the will is tattooed on miss smithers  what almost shouted the learned doctor literally bounding from his chair  the will is tattooed upon miss smitherss back continued mr john short in a perfectly unmoved tone and it is now my duty to offer you inspection of the document and to take your instructions as to how you propose to file it in the registry  inspection of the documentinspection of the document gasped the astonished doctor how am i to inspect the document  i must leave that to you sir said mr john short regarding the learned registrars shrinking form with contempt not unmixed with pity the will is on the ladys back and i on behalf of the plaintiff mean to get a grant with the document annexed  lady holmhurst began to laugh and as for the learned doctor anything more absurd than he looked intrenched as he was behind his office chair with perplexity written on his face it would be impossible to imagine  well he said at length i suppose that i must come to a decision it is a painful matter very to a person of modest temperament however i cannot shrink from my duty and must face it therefore he went on with an air of judicial sternness therefore miss smithers i must trouble you to show me this alleged will there is a cupboard there and he pointed to the corner of the room where you can makeummake the necessary preparations  oh it isnt quite so bad as that said augusta with a sigh and she began to remove her jacket  dear me he said observing her movement with alarm i suppose she is hardened he continued to himself but i dare say one gets used to this sort of thing upon desert islands  meanwhile poor augusta had got her jacket off she was dressed in an evening dress and had a white silk scarf over her shoulder this she removed  oh he said i seein evening dress well of course that is quite a different matter and so that is the willwell i have had some experience but i never saw or heard of anything like it before signed and attested but not dated ah unless he added the date is lower down  no said augusta there is no date i could not stand any more tattooing it was all done at one sitting and i got faint  i dont wonder at it i am sure i think it is the bravest thing i ever heard of and he bowed with much grace  ah muttered eustace hes beginning to pay compliments now insidious old hypocrite  well went on the innocent and eminently respectable object of his suspicions of course the absence of a date does not invalidate a willit is matter for proof that is all but there i am not in a position to give any opinion about the case it is quite beyond me and besides that is not my business but now miss smithers as you have once put yourself in the custody of the registry in the capacity of a will might i ask if you have any suggestion to make as to how you are to be dealt with obviously you cannot be locked up with the other wills and equally obviously it is against the rules to allow a will to go out of the custody of the court unless by special permission of the court also it is clear that i cannot put any restraint upon the liberty of the subject and order you to remain with me indeed i doubt if it would be possible to do so by any means short of an act of parliament under these circumstances i am i confess a little confused as to what course should be taken with reference to this important alleged will  what i have to suggest sir said mr short is that a certified copy of the will should be filed and that there should be a special paragraph inserted in the affidavit of scripts detailing the circumstances  ah said the learned doctor polishing his eyeglasses you have given me an idea with miss smithers consent we will file something better than a certified copy of the willwe will file a photographic copy the inconvenience to miss smithers will be trifling and it may prevent questions being raised hereafter  have you any objections to that my dear asked lady holmhurst  oh no i suppose not said augusta mournfully i seem to be public property now  very well then excuse me for a moment said the learned doctor there is a photographer close by whom i have had occasion to employ officially i will write and see if he can come round  in a few minutes an answer came back from the photographer that he would be happy to wait upon doctor probate at three oclock up to which hour he was engaged  well said the doctor it is clear that i cannot let miss smithers out of the custody of the court till the photograph is taken let me see i think that yours was my last appointment this morning now what do you say to the idea of something to eat we are not five minutes drive from simpsons and i shall feel delighted if you will make a pleasure of a necessity  lady holmhurst who was getting very hungry said that she should be most pleased and accordingly they allwith the exception of mr john short who departed about some business saying that he would return at three oclockdrove off in lady holmhursts carriage to the restaurant where this delightful specimen of the genus registrar stood them a most sumptuous champagne lunch and made himself so agreeable that both the ladies nearly fell in love with him and even eustace was constrained to admit to himself that good things can come out of the divorce court finally the doctor wound up the proceedings which were of a most lively order and included an account of augustas adventures with a toast  i hear from lady holmhurst he said that you two young people are going to take the preliminary stepumtowards a possible future appearance in that court with which i had for many years the honor of being connectedthat is that you are going to get married now matrimony is according to my somewhat extended experience an undertaking of a venturesome order though cases occasionally come under ones observation where the results have proved to be in every way satisfactory and i must say that if i may form an opinion from the facts as they are before me i never knew an engagement entered into under more promising or more romantic auspices here the young gentleman quarrels with his uncle in taking the part of the young lady and thereby is disinherited of vast wealth then the young lady under the most terrible circumstances takes steps of a nature that not one woman in five hundred would have done to restore to him that wealth whether or no those steps will ultimately prove successful i do not know and if i did like herodotus i should prefer not to say but whether the wealth comes or goes it is impossible but that a sense of mutual confidence and a mutual respect and admirationthat is if a more quiet thing certainly also a more enduring thing than mere lovemust and will result from them mr meeson you are indeed a fortunate man in miss smithers you are going to marry beauty courage and genius and if you will allow an older man of some experience to drop the official and give you a word of advice it is this always try to deserve your good fortune and remember that a man who in his youth finds such a woman and is enabled by circumstances to marry her is indeed  smiled on by joy and cherished of the gods  and now i will end my sermon and wish you both health and happiness and fulness of days and he drank off his glass of champagne and looked so pleasant and kindly that augusta longed to kiss him on the spot and as for eustace he shook hands with him warmly and then and there a friendship began between the two which endures till now  and then they all went back to the office and there was the photographer waiting with all his apparatus and astonished enough he was when he found out what the job was that he had to do however the task proved an easy one enough as the light of the room was suitable and the dark lines of cuttle ink upon augustas neck would the man said come out perfectly in the photograph so he took two or three shots at her back and then departed saying that he would bring a lifesized reproduction to be filed in the registry in a couple of days  and after that the learned registrar also shook hands with them and said that he need detain them no longer as he now felt justified in allowing augusta out of his custody  and so they departed glad to have got over the first step so pleasantly     chapter xviii  augusta flies   of course augustas story so far as it was publicly known had created no small stir which was considerably emphasised when pictures of her appeared in the illustrated papers and it was discovered that she was young and charming but the excitement great as it was was as nothing compared to that which arose when the first whispers of the tale of the will which was tattooed upon her shoulders began to get about paragraphs and stories about this will appeared in the papers but of course she took no notice of these  on the fourth day however after she had been photographed for the purposes of the registry things came to a climax it so happened that on that morning lady holmhurst asked augusta to go to a certain shop in regentstreet to get some lace which she required to trim her widows dresses and accordingly at about halfpast twelve oclock she started accompanied by the ladys maid as soon as they shut the front door of the house in hanoversquare she noticed two or three doubtfullooking men who were loitering about and who instantly followed them staring at her with all their eyes she made her way along however without taking any notice until she got to regentstreet by which time there were quite a score of people walking after her whispering excitedly at each other in regentstreet itself the first thing that she saw was a man selling photographs evidently he was doing a roaring trade for there was a considerable crowd round him and he was shouting something which she could not catch presently a gentleman who had bought one of the photographs stopped just in front of her to look at it and as he was short and augusta was tall she could see over his shoulder and the next second started back with an indignant exclamation no wonder for the photograph was one of herself as she had been taken in the low dress in the registry there was no mistake about itthere was the picture of the will tattooed right across her shoulders  nor did her troubles end there for at that moment a man came bawling down the street carrying a number of the first edition of an evening paper  description and picture of the lovely eroine of the cockatoo he yelled with the will tattooed upon er taken from the original photograph facsimile picture  oh dear me said augusta to the maid that is really too bad let us go home  but meanwhile the crowd at her back had gathered and increased to an extraordinary extent and was slowly inclosing her in a circle the fact was that the man who had followed her from hanoversquare had told the others who joined their ranks who the lady was and she was now identified  thats her said one man  who said another  why the miss smithers as escaped from the kangaroo and has the will on her back in course  there was a howl of exultation from the mob and in another second the wretched augusta was pressed together with the ladys maid who began to scream with fright right up against a lamppost while a crowd of eager faces mostly unwashed were pushed almost into her own indeed so fierce was the crowd in its attempt to get a glimpse of the latest curiosity that she began to think that she would be thrown down and trampled under foot when timely relief arrived in the shape of two policemen and a gentleman volunteer who managed to rescue her and get them into a hansom cab which started for hanoversquare pursued by a shouting crowd of nondescript individuals  now augusta was a woman of goodnerve and resolution but this sort of thing was too trying and accordingly accompanied by lady holmhurst she went off that very day to some rooms in a little riverside hotel on the thames  when eustace walking down the strand that afternoon found every photographshop full of accurate pictures of the shoulders of his beloved he was simply furious and rushing to the photographer who had taken the picture in the registry threatened him with proceedings of every sort and kind the man admitted outright that he had put the photographs upon the market saying that he had never stipulated not to do so and that he could not afford to throw away five or six hundred pounds when a chance of making it came in his way  thereon eustace departed still vowing vengeance to consult the legal twins as a result of this within a week mr james short made a motion for and injunction against the photographer restraining the sale of the photographs in question on the ground that such sale being of copies of a document vital to a cause now pending in the court those copies having been obtained through the instrumentality of an officer of the court dr probate the sale thereof amounted to a contempt inasmuch as if for no other reason the photographer who obtained them became technically and for that purpose only an officer of the court and had therefore no right to part with them or any of them without the leave of the court it will be remembered that this motion gave rise to some very delicate questions connected with the powers of the court in such a matter and also incidentally with the law of photographic copyright it is also memorable for the unanimous and luminous judgment finally delivered by the lords justices of appeal whereby the sale of the photographs was stopped and the photographer was held to have been guilty of a technical contempt this judgment contained perhaps the most searching and learned definition of constructive contempt that has yet been formulated but for the text of this i must refer the student to the law reports because as it took two hours to deliver i fear that it would notwithstanding its many beauties be thought too long for the purpose of this history unfortunately however it did not greatly benefit augusta the victim of the unlawful dissemination of photographs of her shoulders inasmuch as the judgment was not delivered till a week after the great case of meeson v addison and another had been settled  about a week after augustas adventure in regentstreet a motion was made in the court of probate on behalf of the defendants messrs addison and roscoe who were the executors and principal beneficiaries under the former will of november 1885 demanding that the court should order the plaintiff to file a further and better affidavit of scripts with the original will got up by him attached the object of course being to compel an inspection of the document this motion which first brought the whole case under the notice of the public was strenuously resisted by mr james short and resulted in the matter being referred to the learned registrar for his report on the next motion day this report was presented and on its appearing from it that the photography had taken place in his presence and accurately represented the tattoo marks on the ladys shoulders the court declined to harass the will by ordering her to submit to any further inspection before the trial it was on this occasion that it transpired that the will was engaged to be married to the plaintiff a fact at which the court metaphorically opened its eyes after this the defendants obtained leave to amend their answer to the plaintiffs statement of claim at first they had only pleaded that the testator had not duly executed the alleged will in accordance with the provisions of 1 vic cap 26 sec 2 and that he did not know and approve the contents thereof but now they added a plea to the effect that the said alleged will was obtained by the undue influence of augusta smithers or as one of the learned counsel for the defendants put it much more clearly at the trial that the will had herself procured the will by an undue projection of her own will upon the unwilling mind of the testator  and so the time went on as often as he could eustace got away from london and went down to the little riverside hotel and was as happy as a man can be who has a tremendous law suit hanging over him the law no doubt is an admirable institution out of which a large number of people make a living and a proportion of benefit accrues to the community at large but woe unto those who form the subjectmatter of its operations for instance the court of chancery is an excellent institution in theory and looks after the affairs of minors upon the purest principles but how many of its wards after and as a result of one of its wellintentioned interferences have to struggle for the rest of their lives under a load of debt raised to pay the crushing costs to employ the court of chancery to look after wards is something as though one set a tame elephant to pick up pins no doubt he could pick them up but it would cost something to feed him it is a perfectly arguable proposition that the court of chancery produces as much wretchedness and poverty as it prevents and it certainly is a bold step except under the most exceptionable circumstances to place anybody in its custody who has money that can be dissipated in law expenses but of course these are revolutionary remarks which one cannot expect everybody to agree with least of all the conveyancing counsel of the court  however this may be certainly his impending lawsuit proved a fly in eustaces honey never a day passed but some fresh worry arose james and john the legal twins fought like heroes and held their own although their experience was so smallas men of talent almost invariably do when they are put to it but it was difficult for eustace to keep them supplied even with sufficient money for outofpocket expenses and of course as was natural in a case in which such enormous sums were at stake and in which the defendants were already men of vast wealth they found the flower of the entire talent and weight of the bar arrayed against them naturally eustace felt and so did mr james shortwho notwithstanding his pomposity and the technicality of his talk was both a clever and sensible manthat more counsel men of weight and experience ought to be briefed but there were absolutely no funds for this purpose nor was anybody likely to advance any upon the security of a will tattooed upon a young ladys back this was awkward because success in law proceedings so very often leans towards the weightiest purse and judges however impartial being but men after all are more apt to listen to an argument which is urged upon their attention by an attorneygeneral than on one advanced by an unknown junior  however there the fact was and they had to make the best of it and a point in their favour was that the case although of a most remarkable nature was comparatively simple and did not involve any great mass of documentary evidence     chapter xix  meeson v addison and another   the most wearisome times go by at last if only one lives to see the end of them and so it came to pass that at length on one fine morning about a quarter to ten of the law courts clock that projects its ghastly hideousness upon unoffending fleetstreet augusta accompanied by eustace lady holmhurst and mrs thomas the wife of captain thomas who had come up from visiting her relatives in the eastern counties in order to give evidence found herself standing in the big entrance to the new law courts feeling as though she would give five years of her life to be anywhere else  this way my dear said eustace mr john short said that he would meet us by the statue in the hall accordingly they passed into the archway by the oak stand where the causelists are displayed augusta glanced at them as she went and the first thing that her eyes fell on was probate and divorce division court i at 1030 meeson v addison and another and the sight made her feel ill in another moment they had passed a policeman of gigantic size monstrum horrendum informe ingens who watches and wards the foldingdoors through which so much human learning wretchedness and worry pass day by day and were standing in the long but narrow and illproportioned hall which appears to have been the best thing that the architectural talent of the nineteenth century was capable of producing  to the right of the door on entering is a statue of the architect of a pile of which england has certainly no cause to feel proud and here a black bag full of papers in his hand stood mr john short wearing that air of excitement upon his countenance which is so commonly to be seen in the law courts  here you are he said i was beginning to be afraid that you would be late we are first on the list you know the judge fixed it specially to suit the convenience of the attorneygeneral hes on the other side you know he added with a sigh im sure i dont know how poor james will get on there are more than twenty counsel against him for all the legatees under the former will are represented at any rate he is well up in his facts and there does not seem to me to be very much law in the case  meanwhile they had been proceeding up the long hall till they came to a poky little staircase which had just been dug out in the wall the necessity for a staircase at that end of the hall whereby the court floor could be reached having to all appearance originally escaped the attention of the architect on getting to the top of the staircase they turned to the left and then to the left again if they had had any doubt as to which road they should take it would have been speedily decided by the long string of wigs which were streaming away in the direction of divorce court no 1 thicker and thicker grew the wigs it was obvious that the cause célèbre of meeson v addison and another would not want for hearers indeed augusta and her friends soon realised the intensity of the public interest in a way that was as impressive as it was disagreeable for just past the admiralty court the passage was entirely blocked by an enormous mass of barristers there might have been five hundred or more of them there they were choked up together in their whitewigged ranks waiting for the door of the court to be opened at present it was guarded by six or eight attendants who with the help of a wooden barrier attempted to keep the surging multitude at baywhile those behind cried forward and those in front cried back  how on earth are we going to get through asked augusta and at that moment mr john short caught hold of an attendant who was struggling about in the skirts of the crowd like a fly in a cup of tea and asked him the same question explaining that their presence was necessary to the show  im bothered if i know sir you cant come this way i suppose i must let you through by the underground passage from the other court why he went on as he led the way to the admiralty court hang me if i dont believe that we shall all be crushed to death by them there barristers it would take a regiment of cavalry to keep them back and they are a ungry lot they are and they aint no work to do and thats why they comes kicking and tearing and worriting just to see a bit of painting on a young ladys shoulders  by this time they had passed through the admiralty court which was not sitting and been conducted down a sort of well that terminated in the space occupied by the judges clerks and other officers of the court in another minute they found themselves emerging in a similar space in the other court  before taking the seat that was pointed out to her and the other witnesses in the well of the court immediately below those reserved for queens counsel augusta glanced round the body of the court was as yet quite empty for the seething mob outside had not yet burst in though their repeated shouts of open the door could be plainly heard but the jury box was full not with a jury for the case was to be tried before the court itself but of various distinguished individuals including several ladies who had obtained orders the little gallery above was also crowded with smartlooking people as for the seats devoted to counsel in the cause they were crammed to overflowing with the representatives of the various defendantsso crammed indeed that the wretched james short sole counsel for the plaintiff had to establish himself and his papers in the centre of the third bench sometimes used by solicitors  heavens said eustace to augusta counting the heads there are twentythree counsel against us what will that unfortunate james do against so many  i dont know im sure said augusta with a sigh it doesnt seem quite fair does it but then you see there was no money  just then john short came up he had been to speak to his brother augusta being a novelist and therefore a professional student of human physiognomy was engaged in studying the legal types before her which she found resolved themselves into two classesthe sharp keenfaced class and the solid heavyjawed class  who on earth are they all she asked  oh he said thats the attorneygeneral he appears with fiddlestick qc pearl and bean for the defendant addison next to him is the solicitorgeneral who with playford qc middlestone blowhard and ross is for the other defendant roscoe next to him is turphy qc with the spectacles on he is supposed to have a great effect on a jury i dont know the name of his junior but he looks as though he were going to eat onedoesnt he he is for one of the legatees that man behind is stickon he is for one of the legatees also i suppose that he finds probate and divorce an interesting subject because he is always writing books about them next to him is howles who my brother says is the best comic actor in the court the short gentleman in the middle is telly he reports for the times you see as this is an important case he has got somebody to help him to take itthat long man with a big wig he bytheway writes novels like you do only not half such good ones the nextbut at this moment mr john short was interrupted by the approach of a rather goodlooking man who wore an eyeglass continually fixed in his right eye he was mr news of the great firm news and news who were conducting the case on behalf of the defendants  mr short i believe said mr news contemplating his opponents youthful form with pity not unmixed with compassion  yes  um mr short i have been consulting with my clients andum the attorney and solicitorgeneral and mr fiddlestick and we are quite willing to admit that there are circumstances of doubt in this case which would justify us in making an offer of settlement  before i can enter into that mr news said john with great dignity i must request the presence of my counsel  oh certainly said mr news and accordingly james was summoned from his elevated perch where he was once more going through his notes and the heads of his opening speech although he already knew his briefwhich to do it justice had been prepared with extraordinary care and elaborationalmost by heart and next moment for the first time in his life found himself in consultation with an attorney and a solicitorgeneral  look here short said the first of these great men addressing james as though he had known him intimately for years though as a matter of fact he had only that moment ascertained his name from mr fiddlestick who was himself obliged to refer to bean before he could be sure of itlook here short dont you think that we can settle this business youve got a strongish case but there are some ugly things against you as no doubt you know  i dont quite admit that said james  of courseof course said mr attorney but still in my judgment if you will not be offended at my expressing it you are not quite on firm ground supposing for instance your young lady is not allowed to give evidence  i think said a stout gentleman behind who wore upon his countenance the very sweetest and most infantile smile that eustace had ever seen breaking in rather hastily as though he was afraid that his learned leader was showing too much of his hand i think that the case is one that looked at from either point of view will bear settlement better than fightingeh fiddlestick but then im a man of peace and again he smiled most seductively at james  what are your terms asked james  the eminent counsel on the front bench turned round and stuck their wigs together like a lot of whiteheaded crows over a bone and the slightly less eminent but still highly distinguished juniors on the second bench craned forward to listen  they are going to settle it eustace heard the barrister who was reporting for the times say to his long assistant  they always do settle every case of public interest grunted the long man in answer we shant see miss smithers shoulders now well i shall get an introduction to her and ask her to show them to me i take a great interest in tattooing  meanwhile fiddlestick qc had been writing something on a strip of paper and handed to his leader the attorneygeneral who mr james short saw with respectful admiration had 500 guineas marked upon his brief he nodded carelessly and passed it on to his junior who gave it in turn to the solicitorgeneral and playford qc when it had gone the rounds mr news took it and showed it to his two privileged clients messrs addison and roscoe addison was a cholericlooking fatfaced man roscoe was sallow and had a thin straggly black beard when they looked at it addison groaned fiercely as a wounded bull and roscoe sighed and that sigh and groan told augustawho womanlike had all her wits about her and was watching every act of the dramamore than it was meant to do it told her that these gentlemen were doing something that they did not like and doing it because they evidently believed that they had no other course open to them then mr news gave the paper to mr john short who glanced at it and handed it on to his brother and eustace read it over his shoulder it was very short and ran thusterms offered half the property and defendants pay all costs  well short said eustace what do you say shall we take it  james removed his wig and thoughtfully rubbed his bald head it is a very difficult position to be put in he said of course a million is a large sum of money but there are two at stake my own view is that we had better fight the case out though of course this is a certainty and the result of the case is not  i am inclined to settle said eustace not because of the case for i believe in it but because of augustaof miss smithers you see she will have to show the tattooing again and that sort of thing is very unpleasant for a lady  oh as to that said james loftily at present she must remember that she is not a lady but a legal document however let us ask her  now augusta what shall we do said eustace when he had explained the offer you see if we take the offer you will be spared a very disagreeable time you must make up your mind quick for the judge will be here in a minute  oh never mind me said augusta quickly i am used to disagreeables no i shall fight i tell you they are afraid of you i can see it in the face of that horrid mr addison just now he positively glared at me and ground his teeth and he would not do that if he thought that he was going to win no dear i shall fight it out now  very well said eustace and he took a pencil and wrote declined with thanks at the foot of the offer  just at that moment there came a dull roar from the passage beyond the doors of the court were being opened another second and in rushed and struggled a hideous sea of barristers heavens how they fought and kicked a maddened herd of buffaloes could not have behaved more desperately on rushed the white wave of wigs bearing the strong men who hold the door before them like wreckage on a breaker on they came and in forty seconds the court was crowded to its utmost capacity and still there were hundreds of white wigged men behind it was a fearful scene  good gracious thought augusta to herself how on earth do they all get a living a question that many of them would have found it hard enough to answer  then suddenly an old gentleman near her whom she discovered to be the usher jumped up and called silence in commanding accents without producing much effect however on the palpitating mass of humanity in front then in came the officers of the court and a moment afterwards everybody rose as the judge entered and looking as augusta thought very cross when he saw the crowded condition of the court bowed to the bar and took his seat     chapter xx  james breaks down   the registrar not augustas dear doctor probate but another registrar rose and called on the case of meeson v addison and another and in an instant the wretched james short was on his legs to open the case  what is that gentlemans name augusta heard the judge ask of the clerk after making two or three frantic efforts to attract his attentiona proceeding that the position of his desk rendered very difficult  short my lord  do you appear alone for the plaintiff mr short asked the judge with emphasis  yes my lord i do answered james and as he said it every pair of eyes in that crowded assembly fixed themselves upon him and a sort of audible smile seemed to run round the court the thing not unnaturally struck the professional mind as ludicrous and without precedent  and who appears for the defendant  i understand my lord said the learned attorneygeneral that all my learned friends on these two benches appear together with myself for one or other of the defendants or are watching the case in the interest of legatees  here a decided titter interrupted him  i may add that the interests involved in this case are very large indeed which accounts for the number of counsel connected in one way or other with the defence  quite so mr attorney said the judge but really the forces seem a little out of proportion of course the matter is not one in which the court can interfere  if your lordship will allow me said james the only reason that the plaintiff is so poorly represented is that the funds to brief other council were i understand not forthcoming i am however well versed in the case and with your lordships permission will do my best with it  very well mr short said the learned judge looking at him almost with pity state your case  jamesin the midst of a silence that could be feltunfolded his pleadings and as he did so for the first time a sickening sense of nervousness took hold of him and made him tremble and of a sudden his mind became dark most of us have undergone this sensation at one time or another with less cause then had poor james there he was put up almost for the first time in his life to conduct singlehanded a most important case upon which it was scarcely too much to say the interest of the entire country was concentrated nor was this all opposed to him were about twenty counsel all of them men of experience and including in their ranks some of the most famous leaders in england and what was more the court was densely crowded with scores of men of his own profession every one of whom was he felt regarding him with curiosity not unmixed with pity then there was the tremendous responsibility which literally seemed to crush him though he had never quite realised it before  may it please your lordship he began and then as i have said his mind became a ghastly blank in which dim and formless ideas flitted vaguely to and fro  there was a pausea painful pause  read your pleadings aloud whispered a barrister who was sitting next him and realised his plight  this was an idea one can read pleadings when one cannot collect ones ideas to speak it is not usual to do so the counsel in a cause states the substance of the pleadings leaving the court to refer to them if it thinks necessary but still there was nothing absolutely wrong about it so he snatched at the papers and promptly began  i the plaintiff is the sole and universal legatee under the true last will of jonathan meeson deceased late of pompadour hall in the county of warwick who died on the 23rd of december 1885 the said will being undated but duly executed on or subsequent to the 22nd day of december 1885  here the learned judge lifted his eyebrows in remonstrance and cleared his throat preparatory to interfering but apparently thought better of it for he took up a blue pencil and made a note of the date of the will  ii went on james on the 21st day of may 1886 probate of an alleged will of the said jonathan meeson was granted to the defendants the said will bearing date the 10th day of november 1885 the plaintiff claims  1 that the court shall revoke probate of the said alleged will of the said jonathan meeson bearing date the 10th day of november 1885 granted to the defendants on the 21st day of may 1886  2 a grant of letters of administration to the plaintiff with the will executed on or subsequent to the 22nd day of december1885 annexed signed james short  may it please your lordship james began again feeling dimly that he had read enough pleadings the defendants have filed an answer pleading that the will of the 22nd of december was not duly executed in accordance with the statute and that the testator did not know and approve its contents and an amended answer pleading that the said alleged will if executed was obtained by the undue influence of augusta smithersand once more his nervousness overcame him and he pulled up with a jerk  then came another pause even more dreadful than the first  the judge took another note as slowly as he could and once more cleared his throat but poor james could not go on he could only wish that he might then and there expire rather than face the hideous humiliation of such a failure but he would have failed for his very brain was whirling like that of a drunken man had it not been for an occurrence that caused him for ever after to bless the name of fiddlestick qc as the name of an eminent counsel is not often blessed in this ungrateful world for fiddlestick qc who it will be remembered was one of the leaders for the defendants had been watching his unfortunate antagonist till realising how sorry was his plight a sense of pity filled his learned breast perhaps he may have remembered some occasion in the dim and distant corner of the past when he had suffered from a similar access of frantic terror or perhaps he may have been sorry to think that a young man should lose such an unrivalled opportunity of making a name anyhow he did a noble act as it happened he was sitting at the righthand corner of the queens counsel seats and piled upon the desk before him was a tremendous mass of law reports which his clerk had arranged there containing cases to which it might become necessary to refer now in the presence of these law reports mr fiddlestick in the goodness of his heart saw an opportunity of creating a diversion and he created it with a vengeance for throwing his weight suddenly forward as though by accident or in a movement of impatience he brought his bent arm against the pile with such force that he sent every book and there must have been more than twenty of them over the desk right on to the head and shoulders of his choleric client mr addison who was sitting immediately beneath on the solicitors bench  down went the books with a crash and a bang and carried away by their weight down went mr addison on to his nose among thema contingency that fiddlestick qc bytheway had not foreseen for he had overlooked the fact of his clients vicinity  the judge made an awful face and then realising the ludicrous nature of the scene his features relaxed into a smile but mr addison did not smile he bounded up off the floor books slipping off his back in every direction and holding his nose which was injured with one hand came skipping right at his learned adviser  you did it on purpose he almost shouted quite forgetting where he was just let me get at him ill have his wig off and then without waiting for any more the entire audience burst out into a roar of laughter which however unseemly was perfectly reasonable during which mr fiddlestick could be seen apologising in dumb show with a bland smile upon his countenance while mr news and mr roscoe between them dragged the outraged addison to his seat and proffered him handkerchiefs to wipe his bleeding nose  james saw the whole thing and forgetting his position laughed too and for some mysterious reason with the laugh his nervousness passed away  the usher shouted silence with tremendous energy and before the sound had died away james was addressing the court in a clear and vigorous voice conscious that he was a thorough master of his case and the words to state it in would not fail him fiddlestick qc had saved him  may it please your lordship he began the details of this case are of as remarkable an order as any that to my knowledge have been brought before the court the plaintiff eustace meeson is the sole nextofkin of jonathan meeson esquire the late head of the well known birmingham publishing firm of meeson addison and roscoe under a will bearing date the 8th of may 1880 the plaintiff was left sole heir to the great wealth of his unclethat is with the exception of some legacies under a second will now relied on by the defendants and dated the 10th november 1885 the plaintiff was entirely disinherited and the present defendants together with some six or eight legatees were constituted the sole beneficiaries on or about the 22nd december 1885 however the testator executed a third testamentary document under which the plaintiff takes the entire property and this is the document now propounded this testamentary document or rather willfor i submit that it is in every sense a properly executed willis tattooed upon the shoulderssensation in the courtis tattooed upon the shoulders of a young lady miss augusta smithers who will presently be called before your lordship and to prevent any misunderstanding i may as well at once state that since this event this lady has become engaged to be married to the plaintiff renewed sensation  such my lord are the main outlines of the case that i have to present for the consideration of the court which i think your lordship will understand is of so remarkable and unprecedented a nature that i must crave your lordships indulgence if i proceed to open it at some length beginning the history at its commencement  by this time james short had completely recovered his nerve and was indeed almost oblivious of the fact that there was anybody present in the court except the learned judge and himself going back to the beginning he detailed the early history of the relationship between eustace meeson and his uncle the publisher with which this record has nothing to do thence he passed to the history of augustas relation with the firm of meeson and co which as nearly everybody in the court not excepting the judge had read jemimas vow was very interesting to his auditors then he went on to the scene between augusta and the publisher and detailed how eustace had interfered which interference had led to a violent quarrel resulting in the young mans disinheritance passing on he detailed how the publisher and the published had taken passage in the same vessel and the tragic occurrences which followed down to augustas final rescue and arrival in england and finally ended his spirited opening by appealing to the court not to allow its mind to be influenced by the fact that since these events the two chief actors had become engaged to be married which struck him he said as a very fitting climax to so romantic a story  at last he ceased and amidst a little buzz of applause for the speech had really been a very fine one sat down as he did so he glanced at the clock he had been on his legs for nearly two hours and yet it seemed to him but a very little while in another moment he was up again and had called his first witnesseustace meeson  eustaces evidence was of a rather formal order and was necessarily limited to an account of the relations between his uncle and himself and between himself and augusta such as it was however he gave it very well and with a complete openness that appeared to produce a favorable impression on the court  then fiddlestick qc rose to crossexamine devoting his efforts to trying to make eustace admit that his behaviour had been of a nature to amply justify his uncles behaviour but there was not very much to be made out of it eustace detailed all that had passed freely enough and it simply amounted to the fact that there had been angry words between the two as regards the treatment that augusta had met with at the hands of the firm in short fiddlestick could not do anything with him and after ten minutes of it sat down without having advanced the case to any appreciable extent then several of the other counsel asked a question or two apiece after which eustace was told to stand down and lady holmhurst was called lady holmhursts evidence was very short merely amounting to the fact that she had seen augustas shoulders on board the kangaroo and that there was not then a sign of tattoo marks upon them and when she saw them again in london they were tattooed no attempt was made to crossexamine her and on the termination of her evidence the court adjourned for lunch when it reassembled james short called augusta and a murmur of expectation arose from the densely crowded audience asfeeling very sick at heart and looking more beautiful than evershe stepped towards the box  as she did so the attorneygeneral rose  i must object my lord he said on behalf of the defendants to this witness being allowed to enter the box  upon what grounds mr attorney said his lordship  upon the ground that her mouth is ipso facto closed if we are to believe the plaintiffs story this young lady is herself the will of jonathan meeson and being so is certainly i submit not competent to give evidence there is no precedent for a document giving evidence and i presume that the witness must be looked upon as a document  but mr attorney said the judge a document is evidence and evidence of the best sort  undoubtedly my lord and we have no objection to the document being exhibited for the court to draw its own conclusion from but we deny that it is entitled to speak in its own explanation a document is a thing which speaks by its written characters it cannot take to itself a tongue and speak by word of mouth also and in support of this i may call your lordships attention to the general principles of law governing the interpretation of written documents  i am quite aware of those principles mr attorney and i cannot see that they touch this question  as your lordship pleases then i will fall back upon my main contention that miss smithers is for the purposes of this case a document and nothing but a document and has no more right to open her mouth in support of the plaintiffs case than would any paper will if it could be miraculously endowed with speech  well said the judge it certainly strikes me as a novel point what have you to say to it mr short  all eyes were now turned upon james for it was felt that if the point was decided against him the case was lost  the point to which i wish you to address yourself mr short went on the learned judge isis the personality of miss smithers so totally lost and merged in what for want of a better term i must call her documentary capacity as to take away from her the right to appear before this court like any other sane human being and give evidence of events connected with its execution  if your lordship pleases said james i maintain that this is not so i maintain that the document remains the document and that for all purposes including the giving of evidence concerning its execution miss smithers still remains miss smithers it would surely be absurd to argue that because a person has a deed executed upon her she was ipso facto incapacitated from giving evidence concerning it on the mere ground that she was it further such a decision would be contrary to equity and good policy for persons could not so lightly be deprived of their natural rights also in this case the plaintiffs action would be absolutely put an end to by any such decision seeing that the signature of jonathan meeson and the attesting witnesses to the will could not of course be recognised in their tattooed form and there is no other living person who could depose under what circumstances the signature came to be there i submit that the objection should be overruled  this said his lordship in giving his decision is a very curious point and one which when first raised by the learned attorneygeneral struck me with some force but on considering it and hearing mr short i am convinced that it is an objection that cannot be supported here eustace gave a sigh of relief it is argued on the part of the defendant that miss smithers is for the purposes of this case a document a document and nothing but a document and as such that her mouth is shut now i think that the learned attorneygeneral cannot have thought this matter out when he came to that conclusion what are the circumstances a will is supposed to have been tattooed upon this ladys skin but is the skin the whole person does not the intelligence remain and the individuality i think that i can put what i mean more clearly by means of an illustration let us suppose that i were to uphold the defendants objection and that as a consequence the plaintiffs case were to break down then let us suppose that the plaintiff had persuaded the witness to be partially skinnedhere augusta nearly jumped from her seatand that she having survived the operation was again tendered to the court as a witness would the court then be able under any possibility to refuse to accept her evidence the document in the form of human parchment would then be in the hands of the officers of the court and the person from whom the parchment had been removed would also be before the court could it be still maintained that the two were so identical and inseparable that the disabilities attaching to a document must necessarily attach to the person in my opinion certainly not or to take another case let us suppose that the will had been tattooed upon the leg of a person and under similar circumstances the leg were cut off and produced before the court either in a flesh or a mummified condition could it then be seriously advanced that because the inscribed legstanding on the table before the courthad once belonged to the witness sitting in the witnessbox therefore it was not competent for the witness to give evidence on account of his or her documentary attributes certainly it could not therefore it seems to me that that which is separable must for the purpose of law be taken as already separated and that the will on the back of this witness must be looked upon as though it were in the hands at this moment of the officers of the court and consequently i overrule the objection  will your lordship take a note of your lordships decision asked the attorneygeneral in view of an appeal  certainly mr attorney let this witness be sworn     chapter xxi  grant as prayed   accordingly augusta was sworn and eustace observed that when she removed her veil to kiss the book the sight of her sweet face produced no small effect upon the crowded court  then james began his examination in chief and following the lines which he had laid down in his opening speech led her slowly whilst allowing her to tell her own story as much as possible to the time of the tattooing of the will on kerguelen land all along the history had evidently interested everybody in the courtnot excepting the judgeintensely but now the excitement rose to boiling point  well said james tell his lordship exactly how it came to pass that the will of mr meeson was tattooed upon your shoulders  in quiet but dramatic language augusta accordingly narrated every detail from the time when meeson confided to her his remorse at having disinherited his nephew up to the execution of the will at her suggestion by the sailor upon her own shoulders  and now miss smithers said james when she had done i am very sorry to have to do so but i must ask you to exhibit the document to the court  poor augusta coloured and her eyes filled with tears as she slowly undid the dustcloak which hid her shoulders for of course she had come in low dress the judge looking up sharply observed her natural distress  if you prefer it miss smithers said his lordship courteously i will order the court to be cleared of everyone except those who are actually engaged in the case  at these ominous words a shudder of disgust passed through the denselypacked ranks it would indeed they felt after all their striving be hard if they were deprived of the sight of the will and they stared at her despairingly to see what she would answer  i thank your lordship she said with a little bow but there would still be so many left that i do not think that it would greatly matter i hope that everybody will understand my position and extend their consideration to me  very well said the judge and without further ado she took off the cloak and the silk handkerchief beneath it and stood before the court dressed in a low black dress  i am afraid that i must ask you to come up here said his lordship accordingly she walked round mounted the bench and then turned her back to the judge in order that he might examine what was written on it this he did very carefully with the aid of a magnifying glass referring now and again to the photographic copy which doctor probate had filed in the registry  thank you he said presently that will do i am afraid that the learned counsel below will wish to have an opportunity of inspection  so augusta had to descend and slowly walk along the ranks stopping before every learned leader to be carefully examined while hundreds of eager eyes in the background were fixed upon her unfortunate neck however at last it came to an end  that will do miss smithers said the judge for whose consideration she felt deeply grateful you can put on your cloak again now accordingly she did so and reentered the box  the document which you have just shown the court miss smithers said james is the one which was executed upon you in kerguelen land on or about the 22nd day of december last year  it is  it was i understand executed in the presence of the testator and the two attesting witnesses all three being present together and the signature of each being tattooed in the presence of the other  it was  was the testator so far as you could judge at the time of the dictation and execution of the will of sound mind memory and understanding  most certainly he was  did you beyond the suggestions of which you have already given evidence in any way unduly influence the testators mind so as to induce him to make this will  i did not  and to those facts you swear  i do  then he passed on to the history of the death of the two sailors who had attested the will and to the account of augustas ultimate rescue finally closing his examinationinchief just as the clock struck four whereon the court adjourned till the following day  as may be imagined though things had gone fairly well so far nobody concerned of our party passed an overcomfortable night the strain was too great to admit of it and really they were all glad to find themselves in the courtwhich was if possible even more crowded on the following morningfilled with the hope that that day might see the matter decided one way or the other  as soon as the judge had come in augusta resumed her place in the witnessbox and the attorneygeneral rose to crossexamine her  you told the court miss smithers at the conclusion of your evidence that you are now engaged to be married to mr meeson the plaintiff now i am sorry to have to put a personal question to you but i must ask youwere you at the time of the tattooing of the will in love with mr meeson  this was a homethrust and poor augusta coloured up beneath it however her native wit came to her aid  if you will define sir what being in love is i will do my best to answer your question she said whereat the audience including his lordship smiled  the attorneygeneral looked puzzled as well he might for there are some things which are beyond the learning of even an attorneygeneral  well he said were you matrimonially inclined towards mr meeson  surely mr attorneygeneral said the judge the one thing does not necessarily include the other  i bow to your lordships experience said mr attorney tartly perhaps i had better put my question in this wayhad you at any time any prospect of becoming engaged to mr meeson  none whatever  did you submit to this tattooing which must have been painful with a view of becoming engaged to the plaintiff  certainly not i may point out she added with hesitation that such a disfigurement is not likely to add to anybodys attractions  please answer my questions miss smithers and do not comment on them how did you come then to submit yourself to such a disagreeable operation  i submitted to it because i thought it right to do so there being no other apparent means at hand of attaining the late mr meesons end alsoand she paused  also what  also i had a regard for mr eustace meeson and i knew that he had lost his inheritance through a quarrel about myself  ah now we are coming to it then you were tattooed out of regard for the plaintiff and not purely in the interests of justice  yes i suppose so  well mr attorney interposed the judge and what if she was  my object my lord was to show that this young lady was not the purely impassive medium in this matter that my learned friend mr short would lead the court to believe she was acting from motive  most people do said the judge drily but it does not follow that the motive was an improper one  then the learned gentleman continued his crossexamination directing all the ingenuity of his practised mind to trying to prove by augustas admissions first that the testator was acting under the undue influence of herself and secondly that when the will was executed he was non compos mentis to this end he dwelt at great length on every detail of the events between the tattooing of the will and the death of the testator on the following day making as much as was possible out of the fact that he died in a fit of mania but do what he would he could not shake her evidence upon any material point and when at last he sat down james short felt that his case had not received any serious blow  then a few more questions having been asked in crossexamination by various other counsel james rose to reexamine and with the object of rebutting the presumption of the testators mental unsoundness made augusta repeat all the details of the confession that the late publisher had made to her as regards his methods of trading it was beautiful to see the fury and horror portrayed upon the countenance of the choleric mr addison and the cadaverous mr roscoe when they saw the most cherished secrets of the customs of the trade as practised at meesons thus paraded in the open light of day while a dozen swiftpencilled reporters took every detail down  then at last augusta was told to stand down which she did thankfully enough and mrs thomas the wife of captain thomas was called she proved the finding of augusta on the island and that she had seen the hat of one of the sailors and the rumcask twothirds empty and also produced the shell out of which the men had drunk the rum which shell the judge had called augusta to identify what was most important however was that she gave the most distinct evidence that she had herself seen the late mr meeson interred and identified the body as that of the late publisher by picking out his photograph from among a bundle of a dozen that were handed to her also she swore that when augusta came aboard the whaler the tattoo marks on her back were not healed  no crossexamination of the witness worth the name having been attempted james called a clerk from the office of the late owners of the rms kangaroo who produced the roll of the ship on which the names of the two sailors johnnie butt and bill jones duly appeared  this closed the plaintiffs case and the attorneygeneral at once proceeded to call his witnesses reserving his remarks till the conclusion of the evidence he had only two witnesses mr todd the lawyer who drew and attested the will of nov 10 and his clerk who also attested it and their examination did not take long in crossexamination however both these witnesses admitted that the testator was in a great state of passion when he executed the will and gave details of the lively scene that then occurred  then the attorneygeneral rose to address the court for the defendants he said there were two questions before the court reserving for the present the question as to the admissibility of the evidence of augusta smithers and those werefirst did the tattoo marks upon the ladys neck constitute a will at all and secondly supposing that they did was it proved to the satisfaction of the court that these undated marks were duly executed by a sane and uninfluenced man in the presence of the witnesses as required by the statute he maintained in the first place that these marks were no will within the meaning of the statute but feeling that he was not on very sound ground on this point quickly passed on to the other aspects of the case with much force and ability he dwelt upon the strangeness of the whole story and how it rested solely upon the evidence of one witness augusta smithers it was only if the court accepted her evidence as it stood that it could come to the conclusion that the will was executed at all or indeed that the two attesting witnesses were on the island at all considering the relations which existed between this witness and the plaintiff was the court prepared to accept her evidence in this unreserved way was it prepared to decide that this will in favour of a man with whom the testator had violently quarrelled and had disinherited in consequence of that quarrel was not if indeed it was executed at all extorted by this lady from a weak and dying and possibly a deranged man and with this question the learned gentleman sat down  he was followed briefly by the solicitorgeneral and mr fiddlestick but though they talked fluently enough addressing themselves to various minor points they had nothing fresh of interest to adduce and finishing at halfpast three james rose to reply on the whole case on behalf of the plaintiff  there was a moments pause while he was arranging his notes and then just as he was about to begin the judge said quietly thank you mr short i do not think that i need trouble you and james sat down with a gasp for he knew that the cause was won  then his lordship began and after giving a masterly summary of the whole case concluded as followssuch are the details of the most remarkable probate cause that i ever remember to have had brought to my notice either during my career at the bar or on the bench it will be obvious as the learned attorneygeneral has said that the whole case really lies between two points is the document on the back of augusta smithers a sufficient will to carry the property and if so is the unsupported story of that lady as to the execution of the document to be believed now what does the law understand by the term will surely it understands some writing that expresses the wish or will of a person as to the disposition of his property after his decease this writing must be executed with certain formalities but if it is so executed by a person not labouring under any mental or other disability it is indefeasible except by the subsequent execution of a fresh testamentary document or by its destruction or attempted destruction animo revocandi or by marriage subject to these formalities required by the law the form of the documentprovided that its meaning is clearis immaterial now do the tattoo marks on the back of this lady constitute such a document and do they convey the true last will or wish of the testator that is the first point that i have to decide and i decide it in the affirmative it is true that it is not usual for testamentary documents to be tattooed upon the skin of a human being but because it is not usual it does not follow that a tattooed document is not a valid one the ninth section of the statute of 1 vic cap 26 specifies that no will shall be valid unless it shall be in writing but cannot this tattooing be considered as writing within the meaning of the act i am clearly of opinion that it can if only on the ground that the material used was inka natural ink it is true that of the cuttlefish but still ink for i may remark that the natural product of the cuttlefish was at one time largely used in this country for that very purpose further in reference to this part of the case it must be borne in mind that the testator was no eccentric being who from whim or perversity chose this extraordinary method of signifying his wishes as to the disposal of his property he was a man placed in about as terrible a position as it is possible to conceive he was if we are to believe the story of miss smithers most sincerely anxious to revoke a disposition of his property which he now standing face to face with the greatest issue of this life recognised to be unjust and which was certainly contrary to the promptings of nature as experienced by most men and yet in this terrible strait in which he found himself and notwithstanding the earnest desire which grew more intense as his vital forces ebbed he could find absolutely no means of carrying out his wish at length however this plan of tattooing his will upon the living flesh on a younger and stronger person is presented to him and he eagerly avails himself of it and the tattooing is duly carried out in his presence and at his desire and as duly signed and witnessed can it be seriously argued that a document so executed does not fulfil the bare requirements of the law i think that it cannot and am of opinion that such a document is as much a valid will as though it had been engrossed upon the skin of a sheep and duly signed and witnessed in the temple  and now i will come to the second point is the evidence of miss smithers to be believed first let us see where it is corroborated it is clear from the testimony of lady holmhurst that when on board the illfated kangaroo miss smithers had no tattoo marks upon her shoulders it is equally clear from the unshaken testimony of mrs thomas that when she was rescued by the american whaler her back was marked with tattooing then in the healing stagewith tattooing which could not possibly have been inflicted by herself or by the child who was her sole living companion it is also proved that there was seen upon the island by mrs thomas the dead body of a man which she was informed was that of mr meeson and which she here in court identified by means of a photograph also this same witness produced a shell which she picked up in one of the huts said to be the shell used by the sailors to drink the rum that led to their destruction and she swore that she saw a sailors hat lying on the shore now all this is corroborative evidence and of a sort not to be despised indeed as to one point that of the approximate date of the execution of the tattooing it is to my mind final still there does remain an enormous amount that must be accepted or not according as to whether or no credence can be placed in the unsupported testimony of miss smithers for we cannot call on a child so young as the present lord holmhurst to bear witness in a court of justice if miss smithers for instance is not speaking the truth when she declares that the signature of the testator was tattooed upon her under his immediate direction or that it was tattooed in the presence of the two sailors butt and jones whose signatures were also tattooed in the presence of the testator and of each otherno will at all was executed and the plaintiffs case collapses utterly since from the very nature of the facts evidence as to handwriting would of course be useless now i approach the decision of this point after anxious thought and some hesitation it is not a light thing to set aside a formally executed document such as the will of nov 10 upon which the defendants rely and to entirely alter the devolution of a vast amount of property upon the unsupported testimony of a single witness it seems to me however that there are two tests which the court can more or less set up as standards wherewith to measure the truth of the matter the first of these is the accepted probability of the action of an individual under any given set of circumstances as drawn from our common knowledge of human nature and the second the behaviour and tone of the witness both in the box and in the course of circumstances that led to her appearance there i will take the last of those two first and i may as well state without further delay that i am convinced of the truth of the story told by miss smithers it would to my mind be impossible for any man whose intelligence had been trained by years of experience in this and other courts and whose daily duty it is to discriminate as to the credibility of testimony to disbelieve the history so circumstantially detailed in the box by miss smithers sensation i watched her demeanour both under examination and crossexamination very closely indeed and i am convinced that she was telling the absolute truth so far as she knew it  and now to come to the second point it has been suggested as throwing doubt upon miss smithers story that the existence of an engagement to marry between her and the plaintiff may have prompted her to concoct a monstrous fraud for his benefit and this is suggested although at the time of the execution of the tattooing no such engagement did as a matter of fact exist or was within measurable distance of the parties it did not exist said the attorneygeneral but the disposing mind existed in other words that she was then in loveif notwithstanding mr attorneys difficulty in defining it i may use the term with the plaintiff this may or may not have been the case there are some things which it is quite beyond the power of any judge or jury to decide and one of them certainly isat what exact period of her acquaintance with a future husband a young ladys regard turns into a warmer feeling but supposing that the attorneygeneral is right and that although she at that moment clearly had no prospect of marrying him since she had left england to seek her fortune at the antipodes the plaintiff was looked upon by this lady with that kind of regard which is supposed to precede the matrimonial contract the circumstance in my mind tells rather in his favour than against him for in passing i may remark that this young lady has done a thing which is in its way little short of heroic the more so because it has a ludicrous side she has submitted to an operation which must not only have been painful but which is and always will be a blot upon her beauty i am inclined to agree with the attorneygeneral when he says that she did not make the sacrifice without a motive which may have sprung from a keen sense of justice and of gratitude to the plaintiff for his interference on her behalf or from a warmer feeling in either case there is nothing discreditable about itrather the reverse in fact and taken by itself there is certainly nothing here to cause me to disbelieve the evidence of miss smithers  one question only seems to me to remain is there anything to show that the testator was not at the time of the execution of the will of a sound and disposing mind and is there anything in his conduct or history to render the hypothesis of his having executed his will so improbable that the court should take the improbability into account as to the first point i can find nothing miss smithers expressly swore that it was not the case nor was her statement shaken by a very searching crossexamination she admitted indeed that shortly before death he wandered in his mind and thought that he was surrounded by the shades of authors waiting to be revenged upon him but it is no uncommon thing for the mind thus to fail at the last and it is not extraordinary that this dying man should conjure before his brain the shapes of those with some of whom he appears to have dealt harshly during his life nor do i consider it in any way impossible that when he felt his end approaching he should have wished to reverse the sentence of his anger and restore his nephew whose only offence had been a somewhat indiscreet use of the language of truth the inheritance to vast wealth of which he had deprived him such a course strikes me as being a most natural and proper one and perfectly in accordance with the first principles of human nature the whole tale is undoubtedly of a wild and romantic order and once again illustrates the saying that truth is stranger than fiction but i have no choice but to accept the fact that the deceased did by means of tattooing carried out by his order legally execute his true last will in favour of his nextofkin eustace h meeson upon the shoulders of augusta smithers on or about the 22nd day of december 1885 this being so i pronounce for the will propounded by the plaintiff and there will be a grant as prayed  with costs my lord asked james rising  no i am not inclined to go that length this litigation has arisen through the testators own act and the estate must bear the burden  if your lordship pleases said james and sat down  mr short said the judge clearing his throat i do not often speak in such a sense but i do feel called upon to compliment you upon the way in which you have singlehanded conducted this casein some ways one of the strangest and most important that has ever come before mehaving for your opponents so formidable an array of learned gentlemen the performance would have been creditable to anybody of greater experience and longer years as it is i believe it to be unprecedented  james turned colour bowed and sat down knowing that he was a made man and that it would be his own fault if his future career at the bar was not now one of almost unexampled prosperity     chapter xxii  st georges hanoversquare   the court broke up in confusion and augusta now that the strain was over noticed with amusement that the dark array of learned counsel who had been fighting with all their strength to win the case of their clients did not seem to be particularly distressed at the reverse that they had suffered but chatted away gaily as they tied up their papers with scraps of red tape she did not perhaps quite realize that having done their best and earned their little fees they did not feel called on to be heartbroken because the court declined to take the view they were paid to support but it was a very different matter with messrs addison and roscoe who had just seen two millions of money slip from their avaricious grasp they were rich men already but that fact did not gild the pill for the possession of money does not detract from the desire for the acquisition of more mr addison was purple with fury and mr roscoe hid his saturnine face in his hands and groaned just then the attorneygeneral rose and seeing james short coming forward to speak to his clients stopped him and shook hands with him warmly  let me congratulate you my dear fellow he said i never saw a case better done it was a perfect pleasure to me and i am very glad that the judge thought fit to compliment youa most unusual thing bytheway i can only say that i hope that i may have the pleasure of having you as my junior sometimes in the future bytheway if you have no other engagement i wish that you would call round at my chambers tomorrow about twelve  mr addison who was close by overheard this little speech and a new light broke upon him with a bound he plunged between james and the attorneygeneral  i see what it is now he said in a voice shaking with wrath ive been sold i am a victim to collusion youve had five hundred of my money confound you he shouted almost shaking his fist in the face of his learned and dignified adviser and now you are congratulating this man and he pointed his finger at james youve been bribed to betray me sir you are a rascal yes a rascal  at this point the learned attorneygeneral forgetting his learning and the exceeding augustness of his position actually reverted to those first principles of human nature of which the judge had spoken and doubled his fist indeed had not mr news utterly aghast at such a sight rushed up and dragged his infuriated client back there is no knowing what scandalous thing might not have happened  but somehow he was got rid of and everybody melted away leaving the ushers to go round and collect the blottingpaper and pens which strewed the empty court  and now good people said lady holmhurst i think that the best thing that we can do is all to go home and rest before dinner i ordered it at seven and it is halfpast five i hope that you will come too mr short and bring your brother with you for i am sure that you both of you deserve your dinner if ever anybody did  and so they all went and a very jolly dinner they had as well they might at last however it came to an end and the legal twins departed beaming like stars with happiness and champagne and then lady holmhurst departed also and left eustace and augusta alone  life is a queer thing said eustace here this morning i was a publishers reader at £180 a year and now tonight if this verdict holds it seems that i am one of the wealthiest men in england  yes dear said augusta and with all the world at your feet for life is full of opportunities to the rich you have a great future before you eustace i really am ashamed to marry so rich a man  my darling he said putting his arm round her whatever i have i owe to you do you know there is only one thing that i fear about all this money if it really comes to us and that is that you will be so taken up with what pleasureseeking people call social duties and the distribution of it that you will give up your writing so many women are like that whatever ability they have seems to vanish utterly away upon their weddingday they say afterwards that they have no time but i often think it is because they do not choose to make time  yes answered augusta but then that is because they do not really love their work whatever it may be those who really love their art as i love mine with heart and soul and strength will not be so easily checked of course distractions and cares come with marriage but on the other hand if one marries happily there comes quiet of mind and cessation from that ceaseless restlessness that is so fatal to good work you need not fear eustace if i can i will show the world that you have not married a dullard and if i cantwhy my dear it will be because i am one  that comes very nicely from the author of jemimas vow said eustace with sarcasm really my dear what between your fame as a writer and as the heroine of the shipwreck and of the great will case i think that i had better take a back seat at once for i shall certainly be known as the husband of the beautiful and gifted mrs meeson  oh no answered augusta dont be afraid nobody would dream of speaking slightingly of the owner of two millions of money  well never mind chaffing about the money said eustace we havent got it yet for one thing i have got something to ask you  i must be going to bed said augusta firmly  nononsense said eustace you are not going and he caught her by the arm  unhand me sir said augusta with majesty now what do you want you silly boy  i want to know if you will marry me next week  next week good gracious no said augusta why i have not got my things and for the matter of that i am sure i dont know where the money is coming from to pay for them with  things said eustace with fine contempt you managed to live on kerguelen land without things so i dont see why you cant get married without themthough for the matter of that i will get anything you want in six hours i never did hear such bosh as women talk about things listen dear for heavens sake lets get married and have a little quiet i can assure you that if you dont your life wont be worth having after this you will be hunted like a wild thing and interviewed and painted and worried to death whereas if you get marriedwell it will be better for us in a quiet way you know  well there is something in that said augusta but supposing that there should be an appeal and the decision should be reversed what would happen then  well then we should have to work for our livingthats all i have got my billet and you could write for the press until your five years agreement with meeson and co has run out i would put you in the way of that i see lots of writing people at my shop  well said augusta i will speak to bessie about it  oh of course lady holmhurst will say no said eustace gloomily she will think about the things and besides she wont want to lose you before she is obliged  that is all that i can do for you sir said augusta with decision therecomethats enough goodnight and breaking away from him she made a pretty little curtsey and vanished  now i wonder what she means to do meditated eustace as the butler brought him his hat i really should not wonder if she came round to it but then one never knows how a woman will take a thing if she will she will etc etc                                       and now it may strike the reader as very strange but as a matter of fact ten days from the date of the above conversation there was a smallandearly gathering at st georges hanoversquare close by i say small for the marriage had been kept quite secret in order to prevent curiositymongers from marching down upon it in their thousands as they would certainly have done had it been announced that the heroine of the great will case was going to be married therefore the party was very select augusta had no relations of her own and so she had asked dr probate with whom she had struck up a great friendship to come and give her away and though the old gentlemans previous career had had more connection with the undoing of the nuptial tie than with its contraction he could not find it in his heart to refuse  i shall be neglecting my duties you know my dear young lady he said shaking his head its very wrongvery wrong for i ought to be at the registry butwell perhaps i can manage to comevery wrong thoughvery wrong and quite out of my line of business i expect that i shall begin to address the courti mean the clergymanfor the petitioner  and so it came to pass that on this auspicious day the registering was left to look after itself and as a matter of history it may be stated that no question was asked in parliament about it  then there was lady holmhurst looking very pretty in her widows dress and her boy dick who was in the highest spirits and bursting with health and wonder at these strange proceedings on the part of his auntie and of course the legal twins brought up the rear  and there in the vestry stood augusta in her bridal dress as sweet a woman as ever the sun shone on and looking at her beautiful face dr probate nearly fell in love with her himself and yet it was a sad face just then she was happyvery as a loving woman who is about to be made a wife should be but when a great joy draws near to us it comes companioned by the shadows of our old griefs  the highest sort of happiness has a peculiar faculty of recalling to our minds that which has troubled them in the past the truth being that extremes in this as in other matters will sometimes touch which would seem to suggest that sorrow and happinesshowever varied in their bloomyet have a common root thus it was with augusta now as she stood in the vestry there came to her mind a recollection of her dear little sister and of how she had prophesied happy greatness and success for her now the happiness and the success were at hand and there in the aisle stood her own true love but yet the recollection of that dear face and of the little mound that covered it rested on them like a shadow it passed with a sigh and in its place there came the memory of poor mr tombey but for whom she would not have been standing there a bride and of his last words as he put her into the boat he was food for fishes now poor fellow and she was left alone with a great and happy career opening out before hera career in which her talents would have free space to work and yet how odd to think it two or three score of years and it would all be one and she would be as mr tombey was poor mr tombey perhaps it was as well that he was not there to see her happiness and let us hope that wherever it is we go after the last event we lose sight of the world and those we knew therein otherwise there must be more hearts broken in heaven above than in earth beneath  now then miss smithers broke in dr probate for the very last timenobody will call you that again you knowtake my arm his lordshipi mean the parsonis there                                       it was done and they were man and wife well even the happiest marriage is always a good thing to get over it was not a long drive back to hanoversquare and the very first sight that greeted them on their arrival was the infant from the city johns accompanied by his brother the infant from pumpcourt james who had presumably come to show him the way or more probably because he thought that there would be eatables goingholding in his hand a legallooking letter  marked immediate sir so i thought that i had better serve it at once said the first infant handing the letter to john  what is it asked eustace nervously he had grown to hate the sight of a lawyers letter with a deadly hate  notice of appeal i expect said john  open it man said eustace and lets get it over  accordingly john did so and read as follows  meeson v addison and another  dear sirafter consultation with our clients messrs addison and roscoe we are enabled to make you the following offer if no account is required of the mesne profits  thats a wrong term said james irritably mesne profits refer to profits derived from real estate just like a solicitor to make such a blunder  the term is perfectly appropriate replied his twin with warmth there was some real estate and therefore the term can properly be applied to the whole of the income  for heavens sake dont argue but get on said eustace dont you see that i am on tenterhooks  my clients continued john are ready to undertake that no appeal shall be presented to the recent case of meeson v addison and another if however the plaintiff insists upon an account the usual steps will be taken to bring the matter before a higher courtobediently yours  news and news john short esq  psan immediate reply will oblige  well meeson what do you say to that said john but i beg your pardon i forgot perhaps you would like to take counsels advice and he pointed to james who was rubbing his bald bead indignantly  oh no i should not answered eustace ive quite made up my mind let them stick to their mesne here james made a face well then to their middle or intermediate or their anything else profits no appeals for me if i can avoid it send news a telegram  that began james in his most solemn and legal tones is a view of the matter in which i am glad to be able to heartily coincide although it seems to me that there are several points which i will touch on one by one  good gracious no broke in lady holmhurst but i think it is rather mean of them dont you mr short  james looked puzzled i do not quite take lady holmhursts point he said plaintively  then you must be stupid said eustace dont you see the jokemesne profits mean of them  ah said james with satisfaction i perceive lady holmhurst does not seem to be aware that although mesnea totally erroneous wordis pronounced mean it is spelt mesne  i stand corrected said lady holmhurst with a little curtsey i thought that mr james short would take my ignorance into account and understand what i mean  this atrocious pun turned the laugh against the learned james and then the telegram to news and news having been dispatched they all went in to the wedding breakfast  in a general way wedding breakfasts are not particularly lively affairs there is a mock hilarity about them that does not tend to true cheerfulness and those of the guests who are not occupied with graver thoughts are probably thinking of the dyspepsia that comes after but this particular breakfast was an exception for the first time since her husbands unfortunate death lady holmhurst seemed to have entirely recovered her spirits and was her old self and a very charming self it was so charming indeed that even james forgot his learning and the responsibilities of his noble profession and talked like an ordinary christian indeed he even went so far as to pay her an elephantine compliment but as it was three sentences long and divided into points it shall not be repeated here  and then at length dr probate rose to propose the brides health and very nicely he did it as might have been expected from a man with his extraordinary familiarity with matrimonial affairs his speech was quite charming and aptly sprinkled with classical quotations  i have often he ended heard it advanced that all men are in reality equally favoured by the fates in their passage through the world i have always doubted the truth of that assertion and now i am convinced of its falsity mr eustace is a very excellent young man and if i may be allowed to say so a very goodlooking young man but what i would ask this assembled company has mr meeson done above the rest of men to justify his supreme good fortune why should this young gentleman be picked out from the multitude of young gentlemen to inherit two millions of money and to marry the most charmingyes the most charming the most talented and the bravest young lady that i have ever meta young lady who not only carries twenty fortunes on her face but another fortune in her brain and his fortune on her neckand such a fortune too sirand he bowed towards eustace  lovely thais sits beside thee take the goods the gods provide thee  i salute you as all men must salute one so supremely favoured humbly i salute you humbly i pray that you may continually deserve the almost unparalleled good that it has pleased providence to bestow upon you  and then eustace rose and made his speech and a very good speech it was considering the trying circumstances under which it was made he told them how he had fallen in love with augustas sweet face the very first time that he had set eyes upon it in the office of his uncle at birmingham he told them what he had felt when after getting some work in london he had returned to birmingham to find his ladylove flown and of what he had endured when he heard that she was among the drowned on board the kangaroo then he came to the happy day of the return and to that still happier day when he discovered that he had not loved her in vain finally ending thus  dr probate has said that i am a supremely fortunate man and i admit the truth of his remark i am indeed fortunate above my deserts so fortunate that i feel afraid when i turn and see my beloved wife sitting at my side i feel afraid lest i should after all be dreaming a dream and awake to find nothing but emptiness and then on the other hand is this colossal wealth which has come to me through her and there again i feel afraid but please heaven i hope with her help to do some good with it and remembering always that it is a great trust that has been placed in my hands and she also is a trust and a far more inestimable one and as i deal with her so may i be dealt with here and hereafter then by an afterthought he proposed the health of the legal twins who had so nobly borne the brunt of the affray singlehanded and disconcerted the attorneygeneral and all his learned host  thereon james rose to reply in terms of elephantine eloquence and would have gone through the whole case again had not lady holmhurst in despair pulled him by the sleeve and told him that he must propose her health which he did with sincerity lightly alluding to the fact that she was a widow by describing her as being in a discovert condition with all the rights and responsibilities of a femme sole  everybody burst out laughing not excepting poor lady holmhurst herself and james sat down not without indignation that a giddy world should object to an exact and legal definition of the status of the individual as set out by the law  and after that augusta went and changed her dress and then came the hurried goodbyes and to escape observation they drove off in a hansom cab amidst a shower of old shoes  and there in that hansom cab we will leave them     chapter xxiii  meesons once again   a month had passeda month of long summer days and such happiness as young people who truly love each other can get out of a honeymoon spent under the most favourable circumstances in the sweetest sunniest spots of the channel islands and now the curtain draws up for the last time in this history where it drew up for the firstin the inner office of meesons huge establishment  during the last fortnight certain communications had passed between mr john short being duly authorized thereto and the legal representatives of messrs addison and roscoe with the result that the interests of these gentlemen in the great publishing house had been bought up and that eustace meeson was now the sole owner of the vast concern which he intended to take under his personal supervision  now accompanied by john short whom he had appointed to the post of his solicitor both of his business and his private affairs and by augusta he was engaged in formally taking over the keys from the head manager who was known throughout the establishment as no 1  i wish to refer to the authors agreements of the early part of last year said eustace  no 1 produced them somewhat sulkily he did not like the appearance of this determined young owner upon the scene with his free and unmeesonlike ways  eustace turned them over and while he did so his happy wife stood by him marvelling at the kaleidoscopic changes in her circumstances when last she had stood in that office not a year ago it had been as a pitiful suppliant begging for a few pounds wherewith to try and save her sisters life and now  suddenly eustace stopped turning and drawing a document from the bundle glanced at it it was augustas agreement with meeson and co for jemimas vow the agreement binding her to them for five years which had been the cause of all her troubles and as she firmly believed of her little sisters death  there my dear said eustace to his wife there is a present for you take it  augusta took the document and having looked to see what it was shivered as she did so it brought the whole thing back so painfully to her mind  what shall i do with it she asked tear it up  yes he answered no stop a bit and taking it from her he wrote cancelled in big letters across it signed and dated it  there he said now send it to be framed and glazed and it shall be hung here in the office to show how they used to do business at meesons  no 1 snorted and looked at eustace aghast what would the young man be after next  are the gentlemen assembled in the hall asked eustace of him when the remaining documents were put away again  no 1 said that they were and accordingly to the hall they went wherein were gathered all the editors subeditors managers submanagers of the various departments clerks and other employees not forgetting the tame authors who a pale and mealy regiment had been marched up thither from the hutches and the tame artists with flying hairand were now being marshalled in lines by no 1 who had gone on before when eustace and his wife and john short got to the top of the hall where some chairs had been set the whole multitude bowed whereon he begged them to be seateda permission of which the tame authors who sat all day in their little wooden hutches and sometimes a good part of the night also did not seem to care to avail themselves of but the tame artists who had for the most part to work standing sat down readily  gentlemen said eustace first let me introduce you to my wife mrs meeson who in another capacity has already beennot greatly to her own profitconnected with this establishment having written the best work of fiction that has ever gone through our printingpresseshere some of the wilder spirits cheered and augusta blushed and bowedand who will i hope and trust write many even better books which we shall have the honour of giving to the world applause also gentlemen let me introduce you to mr john short my solicitor who together with his twin brother mr james short brought the great lawsuit in which i was engaged to a successful issue  and now i have to tell you why i have summoned you all to meet me here first of all to say that i am now the sole owner of this business having bought out messrs addison and roscoeand a good job too said a voiceand that i hope we shall work well together and secondly to inform you that i am going to totally revolutionise the course of business as hitherto practised in this establishmentsensationhaving with the assistance of mr short drawn up a scheme for that purpose i am informed in the statement of profits on which the purchase price of the shares of messrs addison and roscoe was calculated that the average net profits of this house during the last ten years have amounted to fiftyseven and a fraction per cent on the capital invested now i have determined that in future the net profits of any given undertaking shall be divided as followsten per cent to the author of the book in hand and ten per cent to the house then should there be any further profit it will be apportioned thus onethirdof which a moiety will go towards a pension fundto the employees of the house the division to be arranged on a fixed scaleenormous sensation especially among the tame authorsand the remainder to the author of the work thus supposing that a book paid cent per cent i shall take ten per cent and the employees would take twentysix and a fraction per cent and the author would take sixtyfour per cent  and here an interruption occurred it came from no 1 who could no longer retain his disgust  ill resign he said ill resign meesons content with ten per cent and outofpocket expenses when an authora mere authorgets sixty its shamefulshameful  if you choose to resign you can said eustace sharply but i advise you to take time to think it over gentlemen went on eustace i daresay that this seems a great change to you but i may as well say at once that i am no wild philanthropist i expect to make it pay and pay well to begin with i shall never undertake any work that i do not think will paythat is without an adequate guarantee or in the capacity of a simple agent and my own ten per cent will be the first charge on the profits then the authors ten of course if i speculate in a book and buy it out and out subject to the risks the case will be different but with a net ten per cent certain i am like people in any other line of business quite prepared to be satisfied and upon those terms i expect to become the publisher of all the best writers in england and i also expect that any good writer will in future be able to make a handsome income out of his work further it strikes me that you will most of you find yourselves better off at the end of the year than you do at present cheers one or two more matters i must touch on first and foremost the hutches which i consider a scandal to a great institution like this will be abolishedshouts of joy from the tame authorsand a handsome row of brick chambers erected in their place and further their occupants will in future receive a very permanent addition to their salaries renewed and delirious cheering lastly i will do away with this systemthis horrid systemof calling men by numbers as though they were convicts instead of free englishmen henceforth everybody in this establishment will be known by his own name loud cheers  and now one more thing i hope to see you all at dinner at pompadour hall this day next week when we will christen our new scheme and the new firm which however in the future as in the past will be known as meeson  co for as we are all to share in the profits of our undertaking i consider that we shall still be a company and i hope a prosperous and an honest company in the truest sense of the word and then amidst a burst of prolonged and rapturous cheering eustace and his wife bowed and were escorted out to the carriage that was waiting to drive them to pompadour hall  in halfanhours time they were reentering the palatial gates from which less than a year before eustace had been driven forth to seek his fortune there on either side were drawn up the long lines of menials gorgeous with plush and powder for mr meesons servants had never been discharged and there was the fat butler johnson at their head the same who had given his farewell message to his uncle  good gracious said augusta glancing up the marble steps there are six of those great footmen what on earth shall i do with them all  sack them said eustace abruptly the sight of those overfed brutes makes me sick  and then they were bowed inand under the close scrutiny of many pairs of eyes wandered off with what dignity they could command to dress for dinner  in due course they found themselves at dinner and such a dinner it took an hour and twenty minutes to get through or rather the six footmen took an hour and twenty minutes to carry the silver dishes in and out never since their marriage had eustace and augusta felt so miserable  i dont think that i like being so rich said augusta rising and coming down the long table to her husband when at last johnson had softly closed the door it oppresses me  so it does me said eustace and i tell you what it is gussie he went on putting his arm round her i wont stand having all these infernal fellows hanging round me i shall sell this place and go in for something quieter  and at that moment there came a dreadful diversion suddenly and without the slightest warning the doors at either end of the room opened through the one came two enormous footmen laden with coffee and cream etc and through the other johnson and another powdered monster bearing cognac and other liquors and there was augusta with eustaces arm round her absolutely too paralysed to stir just as the men came up she got away somehow and stood looking like an idiot while eustace coloured to his eyes indeed the only people who showed no confusion were those magnificent menials who never turned a single powdered hair but went through their solemn rites with perfectly unabashed countenances  i cant stand this said augusta feebly when they had at length departed i am going to bed i feel quite faint  all right said eustace i think that it is the best thing to do in this comfortless shop confound that fellow short why couldnt he come and dine i wonder if there is any place where one could go to smoke a pipe or rather a cigari suppose those fellows would despise me if i smoked a pipe there was no smoking allowed here in my uncles time so i used to smoke in the housekeepers room but i cant do that now  why dont you smoke herethe room is so big it would not smell said augusta  oh hang it all no said eustace think of the velvet curtains i cant sit and smoke by myself in a room fifty feet by thirty i should get the blues no i shall come upstairs too and smoke there  and he did  early very early in the morning augusta woke got up and put on a dressinggown  the light was streaming through the rich gold cloth curtains some of which she had drawn it lit upon the ewers made of solid silver on the fine lace hangings of the bed and the priceless inlaid furniture and played round the faces of the cupids on the frescoed ceiling augusta stared at it all and then thought of the late master of this untold magnificence as he lay dying in the miserable hut in kerguelen land what a contrast was here  eustace she said to her sleeping spouse wake up i want to say something to you  eh whats the matter said eustace yawning  eustace we are too richwe ought to do something with all this money  all right said eustace im agreeable what do you want to do  i want to give away a good sumsay two hundred thousand that isnt much out of all you haveto found an institution for brokendown authors  all right said eustace only you must see about it i cant be bothered bytheway he added waking up a little you remember what the old boy told you when he was dying i think that starving authors who have published with meesons ought to have the first right of election  i think so too said augusta and she went to the buhl writingtable to work out that scheme on paper which as the public is aware is now about to prove such a boon to the world of scribblers  i say gussie suddenly said her husband ive just had a dream  well she said sharply for she was busy with her scheme what is it  i dreamt that james short was a qc and making twenty thousand a year and that he had married lady holmhurst  i should not wonder if that came true answered augusta biting the top of her pen  then came another pause  gussie said eustace sleepily are you quite happy  yes of course i am that is i should be if it wasnt for those footmen and the silver waterjugs  i wonder at that said her husband  why  becauseyawnof that will upon your neckyawn i should not have believed that a woman could be quite happyyawnwho couldnever go to court  and he went to sleep again while disdaining reply augusta worked on   the end
