cities blazing in the fire     till as i gaze with staring eyes     the armies fade the lustre dies      then once again the glow returns     again the phantom city burns     and down the redhot valley lo     the phantom armies marching go      blinking embers tell me true     where are those armies marching to     and what the burning city is     that crumbles in your furnaces  illustration     my kingdom       down by a shining water well     i found a very little dell         no higher than my head     the heather and the gorse about     in summer bloom were coming out         some yellow and some red      i called the little pool a sea     the little hills were big to me         for i am very small     i made a boat i made a town     i searched the caverns up and down         and named them one and all      and all about was mine i said     the little sparrows overhead         the little minnows too     this was the world and i was king     for me the bees came by to sing         for me the swallows flew      i played there were no deeper seas     nor any wider plains than these         nor other kings than me     at last i heard my mother call     out from the house at evenfall         to call me home to tea      and i must rise and leave my dell     and leave my dimpled water well         and leave my heather blooms     alas and as my home i neared     how very big my nurse appeared         how great and cool the rooms  illustration  illustration     shadow march       all round the house is the jetblack night         it stares through the windowpane     it crawls in the corners hiding from the light         and it moves with the moving flame      now my little heart goes abeating like a drum         with the breath of bogie in my hair     and all round the candle the crooked shadows come         and go marching along up the stair      the shadow of the balusters the shadow of the lamp         the shadow of the child that goes to bed     all the wicked shadows coming tramp tramp tramp         with the black night overhead  illustration     wintertime       late lies the wintry sun abed     a frosty fiery sleepyhead     blinks but an hour or two and then     a bloodred orange sets again      before the stars have left the skies     at morning in the dark i rise     and shivering in my nakedness     by the cold candle bathe and dress      close by the jolly fire i sit     to warm my frozen bones a bit     or with a reindeersled explore     the colder countries round the door      when to go out my nurse doth wrap     me in my comforter and cap     the cold wind burns my face and blows     its frosty pepper up my nose      black are my steps on silver sod     thick blows my frosty breath abroad     and tree and house and hill and lake     are frosted like a weddingcake  illustration  illustration     the little land       when at home alone i sit     and am very tired of it     i have just to shut my eyes     to go sailing through the skies     to go sailing far away     to the pleasant land of play     to the fairy land afar     where the little people are     where the clovertops are trees     and the rainpools are the seas     and the leaves like little ships     sail about on tiny trips     and above the daisy tree         through the grasses     high oerhead the bumble bee         hums and passes      in that forest to and fro     i can wander i can go     see the spider and the fly     and the ants go marching by     carrying parcels with their feet     down the green and grassy street     i can in the sorrel sit     where the ladybird alit     i can climb the jointed grass         and on high     see the greater swallows pass         in the sky     and the round sun rolling by     heeding no such things as i      through that forest i can pass     till as in a lookingglass     humming fly and daisy tree     and my tiny self i see     painted very clear and neat     on the rainpool at my feet      should a leaflet come to land     drifting near to where i stand     straight ill board that tiny boat     round the rainpool sea to float      little thoughtful creatures sit     on the grassy coasts of it     little things with lovely eyes     see me sailing with surprise     some are clad in armour green     these have sure to battle been     some are pied with evry hue     black and crimson gold and blue     some have wings and swift are gone     but they all look kindly on      when my eyes i once again     open and see all things plain     high bare walls great bare floor     great big knobs on drawer and door     great big people perched on chairs     stitching tucks and mending tears     each a hill that i could climb     and talking nonsense all the time        o dear me        that i could be     a sailor on the rainpool sea     a climber in the clover tree     and just come back a sleepyhead     late at night to go to bed  illustration  illustration     in port       last to the chamber where i lie     my fearful footsteps patter nigh     and come from out the cold and gloom     into my warm and cheerful room      there safe arrived we turn about     to keep the coming shadows out     and close the happy door at last     on all the perils that we passed      then when mamma goes by to bed     she shall come in with tiptoe tread     and see me lying warm and fast     and in the land of nod at last  illustration  illustration     night and day       when the golden day is done       through the closing portal     child and garden flower and sun       vanish all things mortal      as the blinding showers fall       as the rays diminish     under evenings cloak they all       roll away and vanish      garden darkened daisy shut       child in bed they slumber     glowworm in the highway rut       mice among the lumber      in the darkness houses shine         parents move with candles     till on all the night divine         turns the bedroom

hedges     clearer grow and sparrows wings         beat on window ledges      these shall wake the yawning maid         she the door shall open     finding dew on garden glade         and the morning broken      there my garden grows again         green and rosy painted     as at eve behind the pane         from my eyes it fainted      just as it was shut away         toylike in the even     here i see it glow with day         under glowing heaven      every path and every plot         every bush of roses     every blue forgetmenot         where the dew reposes      up they cry the day is come

the nest     where all my lead soldiers are lying at rest     were gathered in autumn by nursie and me     in a wood with a well by the side of the sea      this whistle we made and how clearly it sounds     by the side of a field at the end of the grounds     of a branch of a plane with a knife of my own     it was nursie who made it and nursie alone      the stone with the white and the yellow and grey     we discovered i cannot tell how far away     and i carried it back although weary and cold     for though father denies it im sure it is gold      but of all of my treasures the last is the king     for theres very few children possess such a thing     and that is a chisel both handle and blade     which a man who was really a carpenter made  illustration  illustration

gravel walk     and when he puts his tools away     he locks the door and takes the key      away behind the currant row     where no one else but cook may go     far in the plots i see him dig
