85733078	the long vacation  by  charlotte m yonge      how the children leave us and no traces   linger of that smiling angelband gone for ever gone and in their places   weary men and anxious women stand                               adelaide a proctor      preface    if a book by an author who must call herself a veteran should be taken up by readers of a younger generation they are begged to consider the first few chapters as a sort of prologue introduced for the sake of those of elder years who were kind enough to be interested in the domestic politics of the mohuns and the underwoods  continuations are proverbially failures and yet it is perhaps a consequence of the writers realization of characters that some seem as if they could not be parted with and must be carried on in the mind and not only have their afterfates described but their minds and opinions under the modifications of advancing years and altered circumstances  turner and other artists have been known literally to see colours in absolutely different hues as they grew older and so no doubt it is with thinkers  the outlines may be the same the tints are insensibly modified and altered and the effect thus far changed  thus it is with the writers of fiction  the young write in full sympathy with as well as for the young they have a pensive satisfaction in feeling and depicting the full pathos of a tragedy and on the other hand they delight in their own mirth and fully share it with the beings of their imagination or they work out great questions with the unhesitating decision of their youth  but those who write in elder years look on at their young people not with inner sympathy but from the outside  their affections and comprehension are with the fathers mothers and aunts they dread rather than seek piteous scenes and they have learnt that there are two sides to a question that there are many stages in human life and that the success or failure of early enthusiasm leaves a good deal more yet to come  thus the vivid fancy passes away which the young are carried along with and the older feel refreshed by there is still a sense of experience and a pleasure in tracing the perspective from another point of sight where what was once distant has become near at hand the earnest of many a daydream has been gained and more than one ideal has been tried and merits and demerits have become apparent  and thus it is hoped that the long vacation may not be devoid of interest for readers who have sympathized in early days with beechcroft stoneborough and vale leston when they were peopled with the outcome of a youthful mind and that they may be ready to look with interest on the perplexities and successes attending on the matured characters in after years  if they will feel as if they were on a visit to friends grown older with their children about them and if the young will forgive the seeing with elder eyes and observing instead of participating that is all the veteran author would ask                                                     c m yonge  elderfield january 31 1895     contents    i      a chapter of retrospect  ii     a chapter of twaddle  iii    darby and joan

 chapter i  a chapter of retrospect    sorrow he gives and pain good store toil to bear for the neck which bore for duties rendered a duty more and lessons spelled in the painful lore   of a war which is waged eternally—anon   ah my gerald boy  there you are  quite well  gerald underwood of slight delicate mould with refined transparentlooking features and with hair and budding moustache too fair for his large dark eyes came bounding up the broad stair to the embrace of the aunt who stood at the top a little lame lady supported by an ivoryheaded staff  her deep blue eyes dark eyebrows and sweet though piquant face were framed by the straight crape line of widowhood whence a soft white veil hung on her shoulders  cherie sweet  you are well  and the vicar  getting on  how are they all at vale leston  all right  your mother got to church on easterday  this was to anna vanderkist a young person of the plump partridge order and fair rosy countenance ever ready for smiles and laughter  here are no end of flowers as the butler brought a hamper  daffodils  oh—and anemones  how delicious  i must take clement a bunch of those dear white violets  i know where they came from and she held them to her lips  some primroses too i hope  a few but the main body tied up in tight bunches like cauliflowers i dropped at kensington palace gardens  a yellow primrose is much more than a yellow primrose at present said mrs grinstead picking out the few spared from political purposes  clement will want his buttonhole to greet lance  so he is advanced to buttonholes  and lance  he is coming up for the press dinner and will sleep here to be ready for primroseday  thats prime whatever brings him  there children go and do the flowers and drink tea  i am going to read to your uncle to keep him fresh for lance  how bright she looks said gerald as anna began collecting vases from the tables in a drawingroom not professionally artistic but entirely domestic and full of grace and charm of taste looking over a suburban garden fresh with budding spring to a church spire  the thought of uncle lance has cheered them both very much  so the vicar is really recovering  since cousin marilda flew at the curates and told them that if they came near him with their worries they should never see a farthing of hers  and they are all well at home  is anything going on  chiefly defence of the copses from primrose marauders  you know the great agitation  they want to set up a china clay factory on penbeacon and turn the ewe not to say the leston into milk and water  the wretches  but they cant  it is yours  not the western quarry but they cannot get the stream without a piece of the land which belongs to hodnets farm for which they make astounding bids but any way nothing can be done till i am of age when the lease to hodnet is out except by act of parliament which is hardly worth while considering—  that you are near twenty  but surely you wont consent  well i dont want to break all your hearts cheries especially but why should all that space be nothing but a playground for us underwoods instead of making work for the million  and a horrid nasty million it would be retorted anna  you born yankee  dont worry aunt cherry about profaning the ewe just to spoil good calico with nasty yellow dust  i dont want to worry her but there never were such groovy people as you are  i shall think it over and make up my mind by the time i have the power  i wish you had to wait till fiveandtwenty so as to get more time and sense  gerald laughed and sauntered away  he was not yankee except that he had been born at boston  his father was english his mother a hungarian singer who had divorced and deserted his father the neerdoweel second son of an old family  when gerald was five years old his father was killed and he himself severely injured in a raid of the indians far west and he was brought home by an old friend of the family  his eldest uncles death made him heir to the estate but his life was a very frail one till his thirteenth year when he seemed to have outgrown the shock to spine and nerves  much had befallen the house of underwood since the days when we took leave of them still sorrowing under the loss of the main pillar of their house but sending forth the new founders with good hope  geraldine had made her home at st matthews with her brother clement and the little delicate orphan gerald but after three years she had yielded to the persevering constancy of mr grinstead a sculptor of considerable genius and repute much older than herself who was ready and willing to be a kind uncle to her little charge and who introduced her to all at home or abroad that was refined intellectual or beautiful  it was in the first summer after their marriage that he was charmed with the vivacity and musical talent of her young sister angela now upon the world again  angela had grown up as the pet and plaything of the sisters of st faiths at dearport which she regarded as another home and when crushed by grief at her eldest brothers death had hurried thither for solace  her family thought her safe there not realizing how far life is from having its final crisis over at oneandtwenty  new sisters came in old ones went to found fresh branches stricter rules grew up and were enforced by a superior out of sympathy with the girl who had always rebelled against what she thought dictation  it was decided that she could stay there no longer and her brother lancelot and his wife received her at marshlands with indignant sympathy for her wrongs but neither she nor her sisterinlaw were made to suit one another  with liberty her spirit and audacity revived and she showed so much attraction towards the salvation army that her brother declared their music to have been the chief deterrent from her becoming a hallelujah lass however in a brief visit to london she so much pleased mr grinstead that he invited her to partake in the winters journey to italy  poor man he little knew what he undertook  music art roman catholic services and novelty conspired to intoxicate her and her sister was thankful to carry her off northward before she had pledged herself to enter a convent  mountain air and scenery however proved equally dangerous  her enterprises inspired the two quiet people with constant fears for her neck but it was worse when they fell in with a party of very bohemian artists whom mr grinstead knew just well enough not to be able to shake them off  the climax came when she started off with them in costume at daybreak on an expedition to play the zither and sing at a village fete  she came back safe and sound but geraldine was already packed up to take her to munich where charles audley and stella now were and to leave her under their charge before she had driven mr grinstead distracted  there was a worse trouble at home  since the death of his good old mother and of felix underwood sir adrian vanderkist had been rapidly going downhill as though he had thrown off all restraint and as if the yearly birth of a daughter left him the more free to waste his patrimony  little or nothing had been heard direct from poor alda till clement was summoned by a telegram from ironbeam park to find his sister in the utmost danger with a newborn son by her side and her husband in the paroxysms of the terrible nemesis of indulgence in alcohol  sir adrian had quarrelled with all the family in turn except clement and this fact or else that gentleness towards a sufferer that had won on old fulbert underwood led him in a lucid interval to direct and sign a hurried will drawn up by his steward leaving the reverend edward clement underwood sole guardian to his children and executor together with his lawyer  it was done without clements knowledge or he would have remonstrated for never was there a more trying bequest than the charge which in a few days he found laid on him  he had of course already made acquaintance with the little girls poor children they had hitherto led a life as dreary as was possible to children who had each other and fresh air and open grounds their mother was more and more of an invalid and dreaded that their father should take umbrage at the least expense that they caused so that they were scrupulously kept out of his way fed dressed and even educated as plainly as possible by a governess cheap because she was passe and made up for her deficiencies by strictness amounting to harshness while they learnt to regard each new little sisters sex as a proof of naughtiness on her part or theirs  the first time they ever heard a mans step in the schoolroom passage was in those days of undefined sorrow alarm and silence after the governess had despatched the message to the only relation whose address she knew  the step came nearer there was a knock the sweet strong voice asked  are the poor little girls here and the tall figure was on one knee among them gathering as many as he could within his loving arms perhaps he recollected sister constance among the forlorn flock at bexley but these were even more desolate for they had no past of love and loyalty  but with that embrace it seemed to the four elders that their worst days were over  what mattered it to them that they —all eight of them—were almost destitute the birth of the poor little male heir preventing the sale of the property so terribly encumbered and the only available maintenance being the £5000 that mr thomas underwood had settled securely upon their mother  they began to know what love and kindness meant  kind uncles and aunts gathered round them  their mother seemed to be able to live when her twinsister hung over her and as soon as she could be moved the whole party left the gloom of ironbeam for vale leston where a house was arranged for them  lady vanderkist continued a chronic invalid watched over by her sister wilmet and her excellent young daughter mary  robina who had only one girl and had not forgotten her training as a teacher undertook with the assistance of sophia the second daughter the education of the little ones and the third and fourth emilia and anna were adopted into the childless homes of mrs travis underwood and mrs grinstead and lived there as daughters  business cares of the most perplexing kind fell however on clement underwoods devoted and unaccustomed head and in the midst arrived a telegram from charles audley summoning him instantly to munich  angela was in danger of fulfilling her childish design of marrying a duke or at least a graf  diplomates could not choose their society and she had utterly disdained all restraints from the babies as she chose to call mr and mrs audley and thus the wunderschones madchen had fascinated the count an unbelieving roman catholic of evil repute and had derided their remonstrances  clement hurried off but to find the bird flown  she had come down in the morning white and tearstained and had told stella that she could stay no longer kissed her and was gone out of the house before even charles could be called  stellas anxiety almost despair had however been relieved just before her brothers arrival by an electric message from vale leston with the words angela safe at home  letters followed and told how robina had found her sobbing upon her brother felixs grave  her explanation was that on the very night before her proposed betrothal she had dreamt that she was drifting down the ewe in the little boat miss ullin and saw felix under the willowtree holding out his bared arms to her  she said is that the scar of the scald and his only answer was the call angela angela and with the voice still sounding in her ears she awoke and determined instantly to obey the call coming to her as she felt from another world  if it were only from her own conscience still it was a cause of great thankfulness to her family and she soon made herself very valuable at vale leston in a course of epidemics which ran through the village and were in some cases very severe  the doctors declared that two of the little vanderkists owed their lives to her unremitting care  her destiny seemed to be fixed and she went off radiant to be trained at a london hospital as a nurse  her faculty in that line was undoubted  all the men in her ward were devoted to her and so were almost all the young doctors but the matron did not like her and at the end of the three years an act of independent treatment of a patient caused a tremendous commotion all the greater because many outsiders declared that she was right  but it almost led to a general expulsion of lady nurses  of course she had to retire and happily for her mother constance was just at that time sentenced by her rheumatism to spend the winter in a warm climate  she eagerly claimed angelas tendance and just at the end of the year there came an urgent request for a sister from england to form a foundation in one of the new cities of australia on the model of st faiths and thither mother constance proceeded with one sister and angela who had thenceforth gone on so well and quietly that her family hoped the time for angelas periodical breaking out had passed  the ensuing years had been tranquil as to family events though the various troubles and perplexities that fell on clement were endless both those parochial and ritualistic and those connected with the vanderkist affairs where his sister did not spare him her murmurs fulberts death in australia was a blow both to lancelot and to him though they had never had much hope of seeing this brother again  he had left the proceeds of his sheepfarm between lancelot bernard and angela  thus had passed about fourteen years since the death of felix when kind old mr grinstead died suddenly at a public meeting leaving his widow well endowed and the possessor of her pretty home at brompton when soon after the blow her sisters took her to the home at vale leston she had seemed oppressed by the full tide of young life overflowing there and as if she again felt the full force of the early sorrow in the loss that she had once said made vale leston to her a desolation  on her return to brompton she had still been in a passive state as though the taste of life had gone from her and there was nothing to call forth her interest or energy  the first thing that roused her was the dangerous illness of her brother clement the result of bloodpoisoning during a mission week in a pestilential locality after a long course of family worries and overwork in his parish  low lingering fever had threatened every organ in turn till in the early days of january a fatal time in the family he was almost despaired of  however dr brownlow and lancelot underwood had strength of mind to run the risk with the earnest cooperation of professor tom may of a removal to brompton where he immediately began to mend so that he was in april decidedly convalescent though with doubts as to a return to real health nor had he yet gone beyond his dressingroom since any exertion was liable to cause fainting     chapter ii  a chapter of twaddle    the blessing of my later years was with me when a boy—wordsworth   when mrs grinstead on her nephews arm came into her drawingroom after dinner she was almost as much dismayed as pleased to find a long black figure in a capacious armchair by the fire  you adventurous person she said how came you here  i could not help it with the prospect of lancey boy he said in smiling excuse holding out a hand in greeting to gerald and thanking anna who brought a cushion  hark there he is and gerald and anna sprang forward but were only in time to open the room door when there was a double cry of greeting not only of the slender brighteyed still youthful looking uncle but of the pleasant face of his wife  she exclaimed as lancelot hung over his brother—  indeed i would not have come but that i thought he was still in his room  thats a very bad compliment gertrude when i have just made my escape  i shall be too much for you said gertrude  here children take me off somewhere  to have some dinner said geraldine her hand on the bell  no no marilda feasted me  then dont go entreated clement  it is a treat to look at you two sunny people  let us efface ourselves and be seen and not heard returned gertrude sitting down between gerald and anna on a distant couch whence she contemplated the trio—clement of course with the extreme pallor languor and emaciation of long illness with a brow gaining in dignity and expression by the loss of hair and with a look of weary placid enjoyment as he listened to the talk of the other two lance with bright sweet animation and cheeriness still younglooking though his hair too was scantier and his musical tones subdued and geraldine pensive in eye and lip but often sparkling up with flashes of her inborn playfulness and like clement resting in the sunshine diffused by lance  this last was the editor and proprietor of the pursuivant an important local paper and had come up on journalistic business as well as for the fete  gertrude meantime had been choosing carpets and curtains  for said lance with a smack of exultation we are actually going back to our old quarters over the shop  oh  a responsive sound of satisfaction from geraldine  nothing amiss asked clement  far from it  we let marshlands to great advantage and there are many reasons for the flitting  i ought to be at headquarters and besides there are the sundays  we are too many now for picnicking in the classroom or sponging on the rectory  and said gertrude i dare not put his small family in competition with his organ  besides said lance the pursuivant is more exacting and the printing will harewoods books has brought in more business—  but how about space  we could squeeze but can you  we have devoured our two nextdoor neighbours  theres for you you know pratt the dentist had a swell halldoor and staircase which we absorb so we shall not eat in the back drawingroom nor come up the flight which used to be so severe on you cherry  i can only remember the arms that helped me up  i have never left off dreaming of the dear old step springing up the stair after the days work and the whistle to theodore  ah those were the jolly old days returned lance con amore  unbroken added clement in the same tone  better than vale leston asked gertrude  the five years there were as felix called those last hours of delight halcyon days said geraldine but the real home was in the rough and the smooth the contrivances the achievements the exultation at each step on the ladder the flashes of edgar the crowded holiday times—all happier than we knew  i hope your children will care as much  vale leston is their present paradise said gertrude  you should see master felixs face at the least hope of a visit and even little fulbert talks about boat and fish  what have you done with the lambs demanded clement  they have outgrown the old place in every direction and have got a spickandspan chessboard of a villa out on the minsterham road  they have not more children than you have  five lambkins to our four besides gussy and killy said lance though a—which is all that appears of the great achilles unlucky name—is articled to shapcote and as for gussy or rather mr tanneguy he is my right hand  we thought him a nice sort of youth when he was improving himself in london said clement  you both were very good to him said lance and those three years were not wasted  he is a far better subeditor and reporter than i was at his age with his french wit and cleverness  the only fault i find with him is that he longs for plateglass and flummery instead of old froggatts respectable panes  he has become the london assistant who was our bugbear said geraldine  i dont know how we should get on without him since we made pur daily said lance  how old ambitions get realized said geraldine  does his mother endure the retail work or has she not higher views for him asked clement  in fact ever since the first lambkin came on the stage any one would have thought those poor boys were her steps not good old lambs whereas felix always made a point of noticing them  gus was nine years old that last time he was there while i was ill and he left such an impression as to make him the hero model—aye gus is firstrate  i am glad you have not altered the old shop and office  catch me  but we are enlarging the readingroom and the new press demands space  then theres a diningroom for the young men and what do you think ive got  we not froggatt underwood and lamb but the church committee have bought st oswalds buildings for a coffee hotel and young mens lodginghouse  our own old house  oh is edgars great achilles there still  i rushed up to see  alas the barbarians have papered him out  but what do you think ive got  the old cupboard door where all our heights were marked on our birthdays  he set it up in his office said gertrude  i think he danced round it  i know he brought me and all the children to adore it and showed us just like a weather record where every one shot up after the measles and where clement got above you cherry and lance remained a bonny shrimp  a great move but it sounds comfortable said clement  yes for now lance will get a proper luncheon as he never has done since dear old mrs froggatt died said gertrude and he is an animal that needs to be made to eat  then the children want schooling of the newfashioned kinds  all this had become possible through fulberts legacy between his brothers and unmarried sister resulting in about £4000 apiece besides which the firm had gone on prospering  clement asked what was the present circulation of the pursuivant and as lance named it exclaimed—  what would old froggatt have said or even felix  it is his doing said lance the lines he traced out  my father says it is the writing with a conscience said gertrude  yes with life faculty and point so as to hinder the conscience from being a dead weight added geraldine  no wonder said lance with such contributors as the harewoods and such a warcorrespondent as aubrey may  just then the door began to open and a black silk personage disconsolately exclaimed—  master clement  master clem  wherever is the boy gone when he ought to be in his bed  ha sibby cried lance catching both hands and kissing the cheery witheredapple cheeks of the old nurse  you see your baby has begun to run alone  ah master lance twas your doing  you always was the mischief  no indeed sibby the long boy did it all by himself before ever i was in the house but ill bring him back again  may i not stay a little longer sibby said clement rather piteously to hear lance sing  i have been looking forward to it all day  if yell take yer jelly sir said sibby as its fainting yell be and bringing our hearts into our mouths  so sibby administered her jelly and heard histories of lances children then after exacting a promise that master lance should only sing once she withdrew as peremptory and almost as happy as in her once crowded nursery  what shall that once be clem asked lance  lead kindly light  is it not too much he inquired glancing towards his widowed sister  i want it as much as he does she answered fervently  at thirtyeight lances voice was if possible more perfect in sweetness purity and expression than it had been at twenty and never had the poem connected with all the crises of their joint lives come more home to their hearts filling them with aspiration as well as memory  then lance helped his brother up and was surprised after those cheerful tones to feel the weight so prone and feeble that geralds support on the other side was welcome  mrs grinstead followed to take gertrude to her room and find her childrens photographs  the two young people began to smile as soon as they were left alone  did you ever see bexley asked anna  yes—an awful hole and both indulged in a merry laugh  my mother mentions it with pious horror said anna  life is much more interesting when it is from hand to mouth said gerald with a yawn  if i went in for sentiment which i dont it would be for fiddlers ranch though it is now a great city called violinia with everything like everything else everywhere  not uncle lance  certainly not  for a man with that splendid talent to bury it behind a counter mitigated by a common church organ is as remarkable as absurd though he seems to thrive on it  it is a treat to see such innocent rapture all genuine too  you wornout old man laughed anna  aunt cherry has always said that selfabnegation is the secret of uncle lances charm  all very well in that generation—ces bons jours quand nous etions si miserables said gerald in his low maundering voice prosperity means the lack of object  does it  in these days when everything is used up  not to those two—  happy folk never to lose the sense of achievement  poor old man  you talk as if you were twenty years older than uncle lance  i sometimes think i am and that i left my youth at fiddlers ranch  wherewith he strolled to the piano and began to improvise something so yearning and melancholy that anna was not sorry when her uncle came back and mentioned the tune the old cow died of  was gerald the orphan of fiddlers ranch to be always the spoilt child of prosperity and the creature of modern life with more aspirations than he saw how to fulfil hampered as he was by duties scruples and affections     chapter iii  darby and joan                       my reason haply more to bandy word for word and frown for frown but now i see our lances are but straws                                    shakespeare   lancelot saw his brothers doctors the next morning and communicated to his wife the upshot of the interview when they were driving to their meeting in mrs grinsteads victoria each adorned with a big bunch of primroses  two doctors and not tom said gertrude  both brownlows  tom knows them well and wrote  one lives at the eastend and is sheet anchor to whittingtonia  he began with clement but made the case over to the cousin the fashionable one when we made the great removal  so they consulted  and fairly see the way out of the wood though not by any means quit of it poor tina but theres a great deal to be thankful for said lance with a long breath  indeed there is said the wife with a squeeze of the hand  but is there any more to be feared  everything lance answered heart chiefly but the lungs are not safe  he has been whirling his unfortunate machine faster and faster till no wonder the mainspring has all but broken down  his ideal always was working himself to death and only felix could withhold him so now he has fairly run himself down  no rest from that tremendous parish work with the bothers about curates school boards and board schools and the threatened ritual prosecution which came to nothing but worried him almost as much as if it had gone on besides all the trouble about poor alda and the loss of fulbert took a great deal out of him  when somers got a living there was no one to look after him and he never took warning  so when in that stinksmeech mission he breathed pestiferous air and drank pestiferous water he was finished up  theyve got typhus down there—a very good thing too he added vindictively  i put it further back than mr somers going said gertrude  he never was properly looked after since cherry married  what is he to do now  just nothing  if he wishes to live or have a chance of working again he must go to the seaside and vegetate attempt nothing for the next six months nor even think about st matthews for a year and as they told me afterwards be only able to go on cautiously even then  how did he take it  he laid his head against cherry who was standing by his chair put an arm round her and said there and she gave him such a smile as i would not have missed seeing on any account  mine now she said best he said  he is too much tired and worn out to vex himself about anything  where are they to go  not to ewmouth or all the family worries would come upon them  alda would give him no peace  certainly not there  brownlow advises rockquay  his delicate brother is a curate there and it agrees with him better than any other place  so i am to go and see for a house for them  it is the very best thing for cherry  indeed it is  was not she like herself last night  anna says she has never brightened up so much before  i do believe that if clement goes on mending the dear person will have a good time yet nay all the better now that she is free to be a thoroughgoing underwood again  you underwooder than underwood  exactly  i never did like—yes lance i am going to have it out i do think clement would have done better to let her alone  he did let her alone  he told me so  yes but she let out to me the difference between that time and the one of the first offer when dear felix could not keep back his delight at keeping her whereas she could not help seeing that she was a burthen on clements soul between fear of neglecting her and that whirl of parish work and that st wulstans hall was wanted for the girls school  besides wilmet persuaded her  she did  but it turned out well  the old man worshipped her and she was very fond of him  oh very well in a way but you know better lance  well perhaps he did not begin young enough  he was a good religious man but pro ecclesia dei had not been his warcry from his youth and he did not understand and thought it clerical good but outside his life  still she was happy  petting society art travels  i had rather have had our two first years of tiffs than all that sort of happiness  tiffs  i thought we might have gone in for the dunmow flitch  you might  do you mean that you forget how fractious and nasty and abominable i was and how many headaches i gave you  only what you had to put up with  you dont recollect that first visit of my fathers when i was so frightfully cross because you said we must ask the lambs and bruces to dinner  you came down in the morning white as a ghost an owl in its blinkers and though i know you would rather have died than have uttered a word no sooner were you off than he fell upon me with mrs daisy i give you to understand that you havent a husband made of such tough commodity as you are used to at home and if you worry him you will have to rue it  what an ass i must have looked  did i really go playing the martyr  a very smiling martyr pretending to be awfully jolly  i believe i requited papa by being very cross  at his interfering eh  no wonder  chiefly to conceal my fright but i did begin trying not to fly out as i used to do and i was frightened whenever i did so  poor daisy  that is why you always seemed to think every headache your fault  the final effect—i wont say cure—was from that book on education which said that a child should never know a cross word or look between father and mother  so you really have forgotten how horrid i could be  or never felt it  but to return to our muttons  i cant believe otherwise than that cherry liked her old man and if their parallel lines did not meet she never found it out  that is true  she liked him and leant on him and was constantly pleased and amused as well as idolized but i dont think the deep places in her heart were stirred  then there were constraints  he could not stand angelas freaks  and his politics—  he was not so very much advanced  enough not to like the pursuivant to lie about nor her writing for it even about art or books nor did his old bones enjoy the rivers at vale leston  now you will see a rebound  or will she be too tender of him to do what he disliked  that will be the test  now she has clement i expect an article will come on the first book they read together  lance laughed but returned to defend his sister  indeed she was attached to him  she was altogether drooping and crushed at vale leston in the autumn  it was too soon  she was overdone with the multitudes and in fact it was more the renewal of the old sorrow than the new one  anna tells me that when they returned there was the same objectless depression  she would not take up her painting again she said it was of no use there was no one to care  i remember her being asked once to do something for the kyrle society and mr grinstead did not like it but now clements illness has made a break and in a new place with him to occupy her instead of only that dawdling boy you will see what you shall see  ah gerald was the answer in a doubtful wistful tone just as they arrived     chapter iv  slum sea or season    for in spite of all her mother had taught her she was really remarkably fond of the water                                        jane taylor   mr and mrs lancelot underwood had not long been gone to their meeting when there ran into the drawingroom a girl a year older than anna with a taller better figure but a less clear complexion namely emilia the adopted child of mr travis underwood  she found anna freshening up the flowers and gerald in an armchair reading a weekly paper  i knew i should find you she cried kissing anna while gerald held out a finger or two without rising  i thought you would not be gone primrosing  a perspicacity that does you credit said gerald still behind his paper  are the cousins gone asked anna  of course they are cousin marilda in a bonnet like a primrose bank is to pick up fernan somewhere but i told her i was too true to my principles to let wild horses drag me there  let alone fat tame ones ejaculated gerald  what did she say asked anna  oh she opened her eyes and said she never should ask any one to act against principles but principles in her time were for church and state  is aunt cherry in the vortex  no she is reading to uncle clem or about the house somewhere  i dont think she would go now at least  uncle grins memory would forbid muttered gerald  he saw a good many things though he was a regular oldfashioned whig an edinburgh review man  youve got the censor there  oh let me see it  my respected cousins dont think it good for little girls  what are you going to do  i believe the doctors want uncle clem to get a long leave of absence and that we shall go to the seaside replied anna  oh then you will come to us for the season  we reckon on it  no indeed emmie i dont see how i can  those two are not in the least fit to go without some one  but then mother is reckoning on our having a season together  you lost the last  gerald laughed a little and hummed—             if i were na to marry a rich sodger lad            my friends would be dismal my minnie be mad   dont be so disgusting gerald  my friends have too much sense cried anna  but it is true enough as regards my minnie said emilia  well eight daughters are serious—baronets daughters observed gerald in his teasing voice  tocherless lasses without even the long pedigree laughed anna poor mother  the pedigree is long enough to make her keep poor vale leston suitors at arms length mumbled gerald but the sisters did not hear him for emilia was exclaiming—  i mean to be a worker  i shall make marilda let me have hospital training and either go out to aunt angela or have a hospital here come and help me annie  i have a hospital here laughed anna  but nan dear do come  you know such lots of swells  you would get one into real society if one is to have it lady rotherwood lady caergwent besides all your delightful artist friends and that would pacify mother and make it so much pleasanter for me  oh if you knew what the evenings are  what an inducement  it would not be so if annie were there  we should go out and miss the horrid aldermanic kind of dinners and at home when we had played the two old dears to sleep as i have to do every night while they nod over their piquet or backgammon we could have some fun together  now annie you would like it  you do care for good society now dont you  i did enjoy it very much when aunt cherry went with me but—  no buts no buts  you would come to the laundry girls and the cookingclass and all the rest with me and we should not have a dreary moment  have you done fiddling over those flowers  not yet vale leston flowers you know  besides aunt cherry cant bear them not artistic  tidy is enough for marilda  she does them herself or the housekeeper i cant waste time worrying over them  thats the reason they always look like a gardeners prize bouquet at a country horticultural show said gerald  what does it signify  they are only a testimony to sir gorgias midas riches  i do hate orchids  i wish them on their native rocks poor things said gerald  but poor fernan you do him an injustice  oh yes he does quantities of good works and so does marilda till i am quite sick of hearing of them  the piles of begging letters they get  and then they want them read and explained and answered sometimes  a means of good works observed gerald  how would you like it  docketing the crumbs from dives table exclaimed emilia  a clerk or secretary could do it said anna  of course  now if you have finished those flowers do come out with me  i want to go into ponters court and fernan wont let me go alone  have you any special object said gerald lazily or is it to refresh yourself with the atmosphere  that dear boy—that silky—has been taken up and theyve sent him to a reformatory  what a good thing  yes only i dont believe he did it  it was that nasty little bill nosey  i am sure that he got hold of the ladys parcel and stuffed it into silkys cap  emilia spoke with a vehemence that made them both laugh and gerald said—  but if he is in a reformatory what then  are we to condole with his afflicted family or bring bill nosey to confess  i thought i would see about it said emilia vaguely  well i decline to walk in the steps of the police as an amateur how about the dicksons  drifted away no one knows where  thats the worst of it  those poor things do shift about so  yes  i thought we had got hold of those boys with the gymnasium but work wants regulating  oh gerald i am glad you are coming  now i am free  just fancy they had a horrid stupid slow dinnerparty on easter monday of all the burgomasters and great oneeyers and would not let me go down and sing to the matchgirls  you had the pleasure of a study of the follies of wealth instead of the follies of poverty  oh to hear mrs brown discourse on her troubles with her first second and third coachman  was the irresistible ferdinand brown there  yes indeed with diamond beetle studs and a fresh twist to his moustache  it has grown long enough to be waxed  how happy that fellow would be if he were obliged to dig  i should like to scatter his wardrobe over ponters court  there nan have you finished as anna swept the scattered leaves into a basket  are you coming  i dont think i shall  you would only talk treason—well—social treason all the way and you dont want me and aunt cherry would have to lunch alone unless you wait till after  oh no i know a scrumptious place for lunch said gerald  you are right annie one lady is quite enough on ones hands in such regions  you have no jewellery emmie  do you see any verdure about me she retorted  so when geralds tardy movements had been overcome off they started to their beloved slum emilia looking as if she were setting forth for elysium and they were seen no more even when five oclock tea was spread and anna making it for her uncle lance and his wife who had just returned full of political news and likewise lance said that he had picked up some intelligence for his sister  he had met general mohun and sir jasper merrifield both connections of the underwoods  general mohun lived with his sister at rockstone sir jasper his brotherinlaw at clipstone not far off and they both recommended rockquay and its bay with as much praise said lance as the inhabitants ever give of a sea place  very good except for the visitors said geraldine  exactly so  overbuilt overeverythinged but still tolerable the general lives there with his sister and promises to write to me about houses and sir jasper in a house a few miles off  he is bernards fatherinlaw  yes said gertrude and my brother harry married a sister of lady merrifield a most delightful person as ever i saw  we tell my father that if she were not out in new zealand we should all begin to be jealous he is so enthusiastic about phyllis  you have never told us how dr may is  it is not easy to persuade him that he is not as young as he was said gertrude  i should say he was observed lance  in heart—thats true said gertrude but he does get tired and goes to sleep a good deal but he likes to go and see his old patients as much as they like to have him and ethel is always looking after him  it is just her life now that cocksmoor has grown so big and wants her less  things do settle themselves  if any one had told her twenty years ago that richard would have a great woollen factory living and cocksmoor and stoneborough meet and a separate parish be made with a disgusting papermill two churches and a clergymans wife—whats the female of whippersnapper lance—who treats her as—  as an extinct volcano murmured lance  she would have thought her heart would be broken pursued gertrude whereas now she owns that it is the best thing and a great relief for she could not attend to cocksmoor and my father both  we want her to take a holiday but she never will  once she did when blanche and hector came to stay but he was not happy hardly well and i dont think she will ever leave him again  mrs rivers is working still in london  oh yes i dont know what the charities of all kinds and descriptions would do without her  no said clement from his easychair  she is a most valuable person  she has such good judgment  it has been her whole life ever since poor george rivers fatal accident said gertrude  i hardly remember her before she was married except a sense that i was naughty with her and then she was terribly sad  but since she gave up abbotstoke to young dickie may she has been much brighter and she can do more than any one at cocksmoor  she manages cocksmoor and london affairs in her own way and has two houses and young mrs dickie on her hands to boot  how many societies is she chairwoman of said lance  i counted twentyfour pigeonholes in her cabinet one day and i believe there was a society for each of them but i must say she is quiet about them  it is fine to see the little henofthewalk of cocksmoor lower her crest to her said gertrude when ethel has not thought it worth while to assert herself being conscious of being an old fogey  and your bishop  norman  i do believe he is coming home next year  i think he really would if papa begged him but that he—my father i mean—said he would never do so though i believe nothing would be such happiness to him as to have norman and meta at home again  you know they came home on georges death but then those new somersetas went and chose him bishop and there he is for good  for good indeed said clement he is a great power there  so are his books added geraldine  will harewood sets great store by them  ah  i hear our young folks—or is that a carriage  emilia and gerald came in simultaneously with marilda expanded into a portly matron as goodhumoured as ever and betterlooking than long ago  she was already insisting on geralds coming to a party of hers and bringing his violin and only interrupted her persuasions to greet and congratulate clement  gerald lying back on a sofa and looking tired only replied in a bantering lazy manner  ah if i asked you to play to the chimneysweeps she said you would come fast enough you idle boy  and you annie do you know you are coming to me for the season when your uncle and aunt go out of town  indeed cousin marilda thank you i dont know it and i dont believe it  ah well see  you havent thought of the dresses you two are to have for the drawingroom from worths and lady caergwent to present you  anna shook her head laughingly while gerald muttered—  salmon are caught with gay flies  they closed round the teatable while marilda sighed—  aldas daughters are not like herself  a different generation said geraldine  see the beggars opera said lance—       i wonder any man alive will ever rear a daughter       for when shes drest with care and cost and made all neat and gay       as men should serve a cucumber she throws herself away   ah your time has not come yet lance  your little girls are at a comfortable age  there are different ways of throwing oneself away said clement perhaps each generation says it of the next  emmie is not throwing herself away except her chances said marilda  if she would only think of poor ferdy brown who is as good a fellow as ever lived  not much chance of that said geraldine  their eyes all met as each had glanced at the teatable where emilia and gerald were looking over a report together but geraldine shook her head  she was sure that gerald did not think of his cousins otherwise than as sisters but she was by no means equally sure of emilia to whom he was certainly a hero  anna had not heard the last of the season  her mother wrote to her and also to geraldine whom she piteously entreated not to let anna lose another chance in the midst of her bloom when she could get good introductions and marilda would do all she could for her  but anna was obdurate  she should never see any one in society like uncle clem  she had had a taste two years ago and she wished for no more  she should see the best pictures at the studios before leaving town and she neither could nor would leave her uncle and aunt to themselves  so the matter remained in abeyance till the place of sojourn had been selected and tried and meantime gerald spent what remained of the easter vacation in a little of exhibitions with anna a little of slumming with emilia a little of society impartially with swells and artists and a good deal of amiable lounging and of modern reading of all kinds  his aunt watched enjoyed yet could not understand his uncle said that he was an undeveloped creature     chapter v  a happy sprite    such trifles will their hearts engage   a shell a flower a feather if none of these a cup of joy   it is to be together—isaac williams   a retired soldier living with his sister in a wateringplace is apt to form to himself regular habits of which one of the most regular is the walking to the station in quest of his newspaper  here then it was that the tall greyhaired whitemoustached general mohun beheld emerging on the platform a slight figure in a grey suit bag in hand accompanied by a pretty pinkcheeked fairhaired knicker bockered little boy whose air of content and elation at being fathers companion made his sapphire eyes goodly to behold  mr underwood  i am glad to see you  i thought i would run down and look at the house you were so good as to mention for my sister and let this chap have a smell of the sea  there was a contention between general mohuns hospitality and lancelots intention of leaving his bag at the railway hotel but the former gained the day the more easily because there was an assurance that the nephew who slept at miss mohuns for the sake of his day school would take little felix underwood under his protection and show him his curiosities  the boys eyes grew round and he exclaimed—  foolish guillemots eggs  he is in the egg stage said his father smiling  i wont answer for guillemots said the general but nothing seems to come amiss to fergus though his chief turn is for stones  there was a connection between the families bernard underwood the youngest brother of lance having married the elder sister of the aforesaid fergus merrifield  miss mohun the sister who made a home for the general had looked out the house that lance had come to inspect  as it was nearly halfpast twelve oclock the party went round by the school where in the rear of the other rushing boys came fergus in all the dignity of the senior form  look at him said the general those are honours one only gets once or twice in ones life before beginning at the bottom again  fergus graciously received the introduction and the next sound that was heard was have you any good fossils about you in a tone as if he doubted whether so small a boy knew what a fossil meant but little felix was equal to the occasion  i once found a shepherds crown and father said it was a fossil seaurchin and that they are alive sometimes  echini  oh yes—recent you mean  there are lots of them here i dont go in for those mere recent things said fergus in a pre adamite tone but my sister does  i can take you down to a fisherman who has always got some  father may i  ive got my eighteenpence asked the boy turning up his animated face while fergus with an air of patronage vouched for the honesty of jacob green and undertook to bring his charge back in time for luncheon  lancelot underwood had entirely got over that sense of being in a false position which had once rendered society distasteful to him many more men of family were in the like position with himself than had been the case when his brother had begun life moreover he had personally achieved some standing and distinction through the pursuivant  general mohun was delighted with his companion whom he presented to his sister as the speedy consequence of her recommendation  she was rather surprised at the choice of an emissary but her heart was won when she found mr underwood as deep in the voluntary school struggle as she could be  her brother held up his hands and warned her that it was quite enough to be in the fray without going over it again and that the breath of parish troubles would frighten away the invalid  ill promise not to molest him she said  besides said lance one can look at other peoples parishes more philosophically than at ones own  he had begun to grow a little anxious about his boy but presently from the garden up from the cliffpath the two bounded in—little felix with the brightest of eyes and rosiest of cheeks and a great ruddy whitebeaded seaurchin held in triumph in his hands  oh please he cried my hands are too dirty to shake weve been digging in the sand  its too splendid  and they ought to have spines  when they are alive they walk on them  theres a bay  oh do come down and look for them  and pray what would become of aunt cherrys house sir  miss mohun may i take him to make his paws presentable  a jolly little kid pronounced fergus lingering before performing the same operation but he has not got his mind opened to stratification and only cares for recent rubbish  i wish it was a halfholiday i would show him something  the general who had a great turn for children and for the chase in any form was sufficiently pleased with little felixs good manners and bright intelligence about bird beast and fish as to volunteer to conduct him to the region most favourable to spouting razorfish and ambulatory seaurchins  the boy turned crimson and gasped—  oh thank you  thank you indeed said his father when he had been carried off to inspect ferguss museum in the lumberroom  to see a real general out of the wars was one great delight in coming here though i believe he would have been no more surprised to hear that you had been at agincourt than in afghanistan  its in history he said with an awestricken voice  when fergus after some shouting was torn from his beloved museum felix came down in suppressed ecstasy declaring it the loveliest and most delicious of places all bones and stones where his father must come and see what fergus thought was a megatheriums tooth  the long word was pronounced with a triumphant delicacy of utterance amid dancing bounds of the dainty tightlyhosed little legs  the general and his companion went their way while the other two had a more weary search resulting in the choice of not the most inviting of the houses but the one soonest available within convenient distance of church and sea  when it came to practical details miss mohun was struck by the contrast between her companions business promptness and the rapt musing look she had seen when she came on him listening to the measured cadence of the waves upon the cliffs and the reverberations in the hollows beneath  and when he went to hire a piano she albeit unmusical was struck by what her ears told her yet far more by the look of reverent admiration and wonder that his touch and his technical remarks brought out on the dealers face  has that man a bookseller and journalist missed his vocation she said to herself  yet he looks too strong and happy for that  has he conquered something and been the better for it  he made so many inquiries about fergus and his school that she began to think it must be with a view to his own pretty boy who came back all seawater and ecstasy with a store of limpets seaweeds scales purses and cuttlefishs backbones for the delectation of his sisters  above all he was eloquent on the shell of a lacemaker crab all over prickles which he had seen hanging in the window of a little tobacconist  he had been so much fascinated by it that general mohun regretted not having taken him to buy it though it appeared to be displayed more for ornament than for sale  it is a disgusting den added the general with ici on parle francais in the window and people hanging about among whom i did not fancy taking the boy  i know the place said miss mohun  strange to say it produces rather a nice girl under the compulsion of the school officer  she is plainly half a foreigner and when mr flight got up those theatricals last winter she sung most sweetly and showed such talent that i thought it quite dangerous  i remember said her brother  she was a fairy among the clods  the next morning to the amazement of miss mohun who thought herself one of the earliest of risers she not only met the father and son at early matins but found that they had been out for two hours enjoying seaside felicity watching the boats come in and delighting in the beauty of the fresh mackerel  if they had not all been dead sighed the tenderhearted little fellow  but ive got my lacemaker for audrey  the carapace of a pagurus as fergus translated it  adding i dont know the species  i can find out when father has time to let us look at the big natural history book in the shop said felix  we must not look at it unless he turns it over so pearl and i are saving up to buy it  for instance said his father laughing  oh i could not help getting something for them all pleaded the boy and pagurus was not dear  at least he is in the other way  take care fely—he wont stand caresses  i should think he was the first crab ever so embraced  i wonder you got entrance so early in the day said miss mohun  the girl was sweeping out the shop and singing the morning hymn so sweetly and truly that it would have attracted me anyway said lancelot  no doubt the seafaring men want baccy at all hours  she was much amazed at our request and called her mother who came out in remarkable dishabille and is plainly foreign  i cant think where i have seen such a pair of eyes—most likely in the head of some chorussinger indeed the voice had something of the quality anyway she stared at me to the full extent of them  so lancelot departed having put in hand negotiations for a tolerable house not far from st andrews church and studied the accommodation available for horses and the powers of the pianos on hire     chapter vi  st andrews rock    helpmates and hearthmates gladdeners of gone years   tender companions of our serious days who colour with your kisses smiles and tears   lifes worn web woven over wonted ways—lytton   how does he seem now said geraldine as lancelot came into the drawingroom of st andrews rock at rockquay in the full glare of a cold east windy may evening  pretty well fagged out but that does not greatly matter  i say cherry how will you stand this  till i saw you in this den i had no notion how shabby and dull and ugly it is  my dear lance if you did but know how refreshing it is to see anything shabby and dull and ugly mrs grinstead answered with imitative inflections which set anna vanderkist off into a fit of laughter infecting both her uncle and aunt  the former gravely said—  if you had only mentioned it in time i could have gratified you more effectually  i suppose it is aunt cherrys charity said anna recovering  the reflection that but for her the poor natives would never have been able to go to their german baths  oh no such philanthropy my dear  it is homeliness or rather homeyness that is dear to my bourgeoise mind  i was afraid of spickandspan sapgreen aestheticism but those curtains have done their own fading in pleasing shades that good old sofa can be lain upon and theres a real comfortable crack on that frame while as to the chiffonier is not it the marrow of the one mrs froggatt left us where wilmet kept all the things in want of mending  ah didnt you shudder when she turned the key said lance  not knowing what was good for me  but you will send for some of our things and make it nice entreated anna or gerald will never stay here  never fear well have it presentable by the vacation  as for uncle clement he would never see whether he was in a hermits cell if he only had one armchair and one print from raffaelle  there was a certain arch ring in her voice that had long been absent and anna looked joyous as she waited on them both  i am glad you brought her said lance as she set off with uncle clements tea  yes she would not hear of the charms of the season  so much the better for her  she is a good girl and will be all the happier down here as well as better  theres a whole hive of merrifields to make merry with her and by the bye cherry what should you think of housing a little chap for the school here where fergus merrifield is  your dear little felix  delightful  ouf  no he is booked for our grammar school  the grammar school was not good for any of you except the one whom nothing hurt  it is very different now  i have full confidence in the head and the tone is improved throughout  till my boys are ready for a public school i had rather they were among our own people  no cherry i cant do it i cant give up the delight of him yet no i cant nor lose his little voice out of the choir and have his music spoilt  i dont wonder  i dont think i spoil him  i really have flogged him once said lance half wistfully half playfully  how proud you are of it  it was for maltreating little joan vanderkist though if it had only been her brother i should have said go it boys  it was not till afterwards that it turned out that joan was too loyal not to bear the penalty of having tied our little audrey into a chair to be pelted with horsechestnuts  at adrians bidding  of course  i fancy the harewood boys set him on  and what i thought of was sending adrian here to be schooled at mrs edgars boarded by you mothered by anna and altogether saved from being made utterly detestable as he will inevitably be if he remains to tyrannize over vale leston  would his mother consent  you know he is entirely in clements power  it would only be another worry for clement  he need not have much of him and i believe he would prefer to have him under his own eye and anna will think it bliss to have him though what it may prove is another question  she will keep you from being too much bothered  my dear lance will you never understand that as furze and thistles are to a donkey so are shabbiness and bother to me—a native element  in the morning clement raised on his pillows in bed showed himself highly grateful for the proposal about his youngest ward  it is very good of you cherry he said  that poor boy has been very much on my mind  this is the way to profit by my enforced leisure  thats the way to make me dread him  you were to lie fallow  not exactly  i have thirteen or fourteen years reading and thinking to make up  i have done no more than get up a thing cursorily since i left vale leston  you are welcome to read and think provided it is nothing more recent than st chrysostom  so here is the letter to alda giving it to her open  short and to the purpose she said  alda submits to the inevitable he said  dont appear as if she had a choice  only mention the alleviations  no you are not to get up yet theres no place for you to sit in and the east wind is not greatly mitigated by the sea air  shall i send anna to read to you  in halfanhour if she is ready then meantime those two books if you please  she handed him his greek testament and bishop andrews and repaired to the drawingroom where she found anna exulting in the decorations brought from home and the flowers brought in from an itinerant barrow  i have been setting down what they must send us from home—your own chair and table and the liberty rugs and the casts of st cecilia and little st cyrillus for those bare corners and i am going out for a terracotta vase  oh my dear the room is charming but dont let us get too dependent on pretty things  they demoralize as much or more than ugly ones  do you mean that they are a luxury  is it not right to try to have everything beautiful  i dont know my dear  dont know exclaimed anna  yes my dear i really get confused sometimes as to what is mere lust of the eye and what is regard to whatever things are lovely i believe the principle is really in each case to try whether the high object or the gratification of the senses should stand first  well said anna laughing i suppose it is a high object not to alienate gerald as would certainly be done by the culture of the ugly—  or rather of that which pretends to be the reverse and is only fashion said her aunt who meantime was moving about adding nameless grace by her touch to all annas arrangements  may i send for the things then said anna demurely  oh yes certainly and you had better get the study armchair for your uncle  there is nothing so comfortable here  but i have news for you  what do you say to having little adrian here to go to school with the merrifield boy  what fun what fun  how delicious cried the sister springing about like a child  i suspected that the person to whom he would give most trouble would feel it most pleasure  you dont know what a funny delightful child he is  you didnt see him driving all the little girls in a team fourinhand  it would be much to say that mrs grinstead was enchanted by this proof of his charms but they were interrupted by marshall the polite patronizing butler bringing in a card  miss mohun would be glad to know how mr underwood was and whether there was anything that she could do for mrs grinstead  of course she was asked to come in and thus they met the quick slim active little spinster whose whole life had been work and the far younger widow whose vocation had been chiefly homemaking their first silent impressions were—  i hope she is not going to be pathetic and—  she is enough to take ones breath away  but i think she has tact  after a few exchanges of inquiry and answer miss mohun said—  my niece gillian is burning to see you after all your kindness to her  i shall be very glad  this is not quite a land of strangers  i told her i was sure you would not want her today  thank you  my brother is hardly up to afternoon visitors yet and we have not been able to arrange his refuge  you have transformed this room  or anna has  on which miss mohun begged for miss vanderkist to meet her nieces by and by at tea  gillian would call for her at four oclock and show her the way that it was hoped might soon be quite natural to her  gillians aunt jane said anna when the visitor had tripped out i never quite understood her way of talking of her  i think she worried her  your pronouns are confused annie  which worried which  or was it mutual  on the whole laughed anna back i prefer an aunt to be waited on to one who pokes me up  aunt log to aunt stork  to be poked will be wholesome  in due time there was a ring at the front door gillian merrifield was indulged with a kiss and smile from the heroine of her worship and anna found herself in the midst of a garland of bright girls she was a contrast to them with her fair underwood complexion her short plump vanderkist figure and the mourning she still wore for the fatherly uncle grinstead while the merrifield party were all in different shades of the brunette and wore bright spring raiment  they had only just come down the steps when they were greeted by a young clergyman who said he was on his way to inquire for mr underwood and as he looked as if he expected a reply from miss vanderkist she said her uncle was better and would be glad to see mr brownlow when he had rested after his journey  i hope he will not bother him she added i know who he is now he was at whittingtonia for a little while but broke down  theres no remembering all the curates there  my aunt likes his mother does he belong to this st andrews church  no to the old one  you begin to see the tower  is that where you go  to the old one in the morning but we have a dear little old chapel at clipstone where mr brownlow comes for the afternoon  it is all a good deal mixed up together  then another voice—  do you think mr underwood would preach to us  mr brownlow says he never heard any one like him  anna stood still  nobody is to dare to mention preaching to uncle clement for the next six months or they will deserve never to hear another sermon in their lives  what an awful penalty  for shame dolores  now as the short remainder of a steep street was surmounted here as you may see is the great hotel and next beyond is aunt janes beechcroft  on beyond where you see that queer tower is cliff house mr whites who married our aunt adeline only they are in italy and then comes carrara captain hendersons—  you are expected to rave about mrs hendersons beauty said the cousin dolores mohun as she opened miss mohuns gate between two copper beeches while anna listened to the merry tongues almost bewildered by the chatter so unlike the seclusion and silent watching of the last month but when mysie merrifield asked is it not quite overwhelming she said—  oh no it is like being among them all at vale leston  my sisters always tell me my tongue wants greasing when i come down  her tongue was to have exercise enough among the bevy of damsels who surrounded her in miss mohuns drawingroom—four merrifields ranging from twentytwo to twelve years old and one cousin dolores mohun with a father in new zealand  wont you be in the mousetrap presently asked number three by name valetta  if i did not know that she would drag it in cried dolores  what may it be asked anna  an essay society and not an essay society was the lucid answer gillian said you would be sure to belong to it  i am afraid i cant if it takes much time said anna in a pleading tone  my uncle is very far from well and i have a good deal to do in the way of reading to him and my little brother is coming to go to school with yours  mr underwood brought his little boy said gillian  fergus said he was one of the jolliest little chaps he had ever seen  uncle reginald quite lost his heart to him said mysie and aunt jane says he is a charming little fellow  oh felix underwood said anna  adrian is much more manly  you should see him ride and climb trees  the comparative value of brothers and cousins was very apparent however it was fixed that anna should attend the mousetrap and hear and contribute as she could find time  i did the erl king said valetta             who rideth so late in the forest so wild             it is the fond father and his loving child   oh spare us val cried her sister gillian  every one has done that  gerald parodied mine said anna             who trampeth so late in a shocking bad hat            tis the tipsy old father ahugging his brat   oh go on  i cant recollect any more but the erl kings daughter is a beggar woman and it ends with—             ill give thee a tanner and make him a bait            so in the gin palace was settled his fate   some of the party were scandalized others laughed as much or more than the effusion deserved  we accept drawings added another voice and if any one does anything extraordinarily good in that way or in writing it makes a little book  we have higher designs than that said gillian  we want to print the cream  for the benefit of the school board—no the board school  oh oh valetta cried the general voice  the thing is explained gillian that we must build a new school for the outliers of st kenelms or my lords will be down on us and we shall be swamped by board schools  aunt jane is frantic about it said dolores mohun  theres no escape from school board worries exclaimed anna  they helped to demolish uncle clement  there is to be a sale of work and a concert and all sorts of jolly larks added valetta  larks  oh val  larks arent slang  they are in the dictionary declared valetta  by the bye she has not heard the rules of the mice put in mysie  ill say them volunteered valetta the irrepressible  members of the mousetrap never utter slang expressions never wear live birds— i mean dead ones—in their hats  is an ostrich feather a live bird or a dead demanded anna  and said dolores what of the feather screens that the old miss smiths have been making all the winter—circles of pheasants feathers and peacocks eyes outside a border of drakes curls  oh like ostriches they dont count since peacocks dont die and drakes and pheasants must said gillian  we have been getting ready for this sale ever so long said mysie aunt jane has a working party every friday for it  the fit day said dolores for she is a perfect victim to other peoples bad work and spends the evening in stitching up and making presentable the wretched garments they turn out  the next rule— began valetta but gillian mercilessly cut her short  you know clever people anna  do you know how to manage about our mousetrap book  our bookseller here is a schoolboard man all on the wrong side and when i tried to feel our way he made out that the printing and getting it up would cost a great deal more than we could risk  it is a pity that uncle lance is gone home said anna  he could tell you all about it  could you not write to him  oh yes but i know he will want to see a specimen before he can make any estimate  it was agreed that the specimen should be forthcoming on the next occasion and miss mohun coming home and tea coming in the conference was ended  anna began to unravel the relationships  dolores mohun was a niece of lady merrifield  she had lost her own mother early and after living with the merrifields for a year had been taken by her father to new zealand where he had an appointment he was a man of science and she had been with him at rotaruna during the terrible volcanic eruption when there had been danger and terror enough to bring out her real character and at the same time to cause an amount of intimacy with a young lady visitor little older than herself which had suddenly developed into a second marriage of her father  in this state of things she had gladly availed herself of the home offered her at clipstone and had gone home under the escort of her aunt phyllis mrs harry may who was going with her husband to spend a year in england  dolores had greatly improved in all ways during her two years absence and had become an affectionate companionable and thoughtful member of the merrifield household though still taking a line of her own  the kalliope whom gillian had befriended to her own detriment was now the very beautiful mrs henderson wife to the managing partner in the marble works  she continued to take a great interest in the young women employed in designing and mosaics and had a class of them for reading and working  dolores had been asked to tell first aunt janes g f s girls friendly society girls and afterwards mrs hendersons about her new zealand experiences and the earthquake and this developed into regular weekly lectures on volcanoes and on colonies  she did these so well that she was begged to repeat them for the girls at the high school and she had begun to get them up very carefully studying the best scientific books she could get and thinking she saw her vocation  mrs henderson was quite a power in the place  her brother alexis was an undergraduate but had been promised a tutorship for the vacation  he seldom appeared at carrara shrinking from what recalled the pain and shame that he had suffered while petros worked under captain henderson and theodore was still in the choir at st matthews  maura had become the darling of mr white and was much beloved by mrs white though there had been a little alarm the previous year when lord rotherwood and his son came down to open a public park or garden on the top of the cliffs where lord rotherwoods accident had occurred  lord ivinghoe a young guardsman had shown himself enough disposed to flirt with the pretty little greek to make the prudent very glad that her home was on the italian mountains  gillian was always mrs hendersons friend but gillians mind was full of other things  for her father had reluctantly promised that if one of her little brothers got a scholarship at one of the public schools gillian might fulfil her ardent desire of going to a ladies college  wilfred was a hopeless subject  it might be doubted if he could have succeeded  he had apparently less brain power than some of the family and he certainly would not exert what he had  his mother had dragged him through holiday tasks but nobody else could attempt to make him work when at home and gillians offers had been received with mockery or violence  so all her hopes centred on fergus who thanks to aunt janes evening influence over his lessons stood foremost in mrs edgars school and was to go up to try for election at winchester college at the end of the term  were gillians hopes to be ruined by his devotion to the underground world     chapter vii  the hope of vanderkist    a breath of air a bullocks low a bunch of flowers hath power to call from everywhere the spirit of forgotten hours— hours when the heart was fresh and young when every string in freedom sung ere life had shed one leaf of green                          james russell lowell   there had been some curiosity as to who would be thought worthy to bring the precious little baronet to rockquay and there was some diversion as well as joy when it proved that no one was to be entrusted with him but his eldest aunt mrs harewood who was to bring him in whitsun week so that he might begin with a halfterm  the arrival was a pretty sight as the aunt rejoiced at seeing both her hosts at the front door to greet her and as anna held out her glad arms to the little brother who was the pride of the family  ha adrian boy said the vicar only greeting with the hand at sight of the impatient wriggle out of the embrace  it was an open sunburnt ruddy face and wide fearless grey eyes that looked up to him the bullet head in stiff curly flaxen hair held aloft with an air of i am monarch of all i survey and there was a tone of equality in the holloa uncle clement to the tall clergyman who towered so far above the sturdy little figure  presently on the family inquiries there broke—  i say annie wheres the school  at the foot of this hill  i want to see it imperiously  you must have some tea first  then you are glad to come adrian said mrs grinstead  yes aunt cherry  it is high time i was away from such a lot of womenfolk he replied with his hands in his pockets and his legs set like a little colossus  anna had no peace till after the boy had swallowed a tolerable amount of breadandbutter and cake she took him out and then mrs harewood had to explain his mothers urgent entreaties that the regime at vale leston should be followed up and the boy see only such habits as would be those of total abstainers  poor woman as her brother and sisters knew there was reason to believe that the vice which had been fatal to her happiness and her husbands life had descended to him from dutch forefathers and there was the less cause for wonder at the passionate desire to guard her son from it  almost all her family had been waterdrinkers from infancy and though major harewood called teetotalism a superstitious contempt of heavens good gifts and disapproved of supplementing the baptismal vow his brother the rector had found it expedient for the sake of the parish to embrace formally the temperance movement and thus there had been little difficulty in giving way to aldas desire that at the luncheontable adrian should never see wine or beer and she insisted that the same rule should prevail at rockquay  clement had taken the pledge when a lad of sixteen and there were those who thought that save for his persistence under warnings of failing strength much of his present illness might have been averted with all the consequent treatment  he believed in total abstinence as safer for his ward but he thought that the time had come for training in seeing without partaking  wilmet agreed and said she had tried to persuade her sister but she had only caused an hysterical agitation so that weakness as usual gained the victory and she had all but promised to bring the boy home again unless she could exact an engagement  to follow the vale leston practice at his early dinner said geraldine  that may be said clement but i do not engage not to have the matter out with him if i see that it is expedient  i am only doubtful how gerald will take it said his sister  gerald has always been used to it at vale leston said wilmet  true but there he is your guest  here he will regard himself as at home  however he is a good boy and will only grumble a little for appearance sake  i should hope so said wilmet severely  how is the penbeacon affair going on asked clement  oh clem i did not think you had heard of it  i had a letter in the middle of the mission but i could not answer it then and it seems to have been lost  geraldine pronounced it the straw that broke the camels back when she heard of the company that only waited to dig china clay out of penbeacon and wash it in the ewe till they could purchase a slice of the hill pertaining to the vale leston estate  major harewood had replied that his fellowtrustee was too ill to attend to business and that the matter had better be let alone till the heir attained his majority  shelved for the present said mrs grinstead  fancy ewe and leston contaminated  john talks to the young engineer mr bramshaw and thinks that may be prevented but that is not the worst said wilmet it would change the whole face of the parish and bring an influx of new people  break up penbeacon and cover it with horrible little new houses men like walsh never see a beautiful place but they begin to think how to destroy it  well cherry you have the most influence with gerald but he talks to the girls of our having no right to keep the treasures of the hills for our exclusive pleasure  it is not exclusive  half the country disports itself there  it is the great place for excursions  then he declares that it is a grave matter to hinder an industry that would put bread into so many mouths and that fresh outlets would be good for the place something too about being an obstruction and the rights of labour  oh i know what that means  it is only teasing the cousinhood when they fall on him openmouthed said geraldine with a laugh though with a qualm of misgiving at her heart while clement sat listening and thinking  mrs harewood farther explained that she hoped either that gerald would marry or that her sister would make a home for him at the priory  it then appeared that major harewood thought it would be wise to leave the young man to manage the property for himself without interference and that the uncle to whom the major had become heir was anxious to have the family at hand even offering to arrange a house for lady vanderkist  a year of changes sighed geraldine but this waiting time seems intended to let one gather ones breath  but wilmet looked careworn partly no doubt with the harass of continual attention to her sister alda who though subdued and improved in many important ways was unavoidably fretful from ill health and disposed to be very miserable over her straitened means and the future lot of her eight daughters especially as the two of the most favourable age seemed to resign their immediate chances of marrying  moreover though all began life as pretty little girls they had a propensity to turn into dutchwomen as they grew up and franceska the fifth in age was the only one who renewed the beauty of the twin sisters  alda was not however wilmets chief care though of that she did not speak  she was not happy at heart about her two boys  kester was a soldier in india not actually unsteady but not what her own brothers had been and edward was a midshipman too much of the careless wild sailor  easygoing john harewoods lax discipline had not been successful with them in early youth and still less had later severity and indignation been effectual  i am glad you kept anna said mrs harewood though alda is very much disappointed that she is not having a season in london  she will not take it said geraldine  she insists that she prefers uncle clem to all the fine folk she might meet and after all poor marildas acquaintance are not exactly the upper ten thousand  poor marilda  you know that she is greatly vexed that emilia is bent on being a hospital nurse or something like it and only half yields to go out with her this summer in very unwilling obedience  yes i know  she wants to come here and i mean to have her before the long vacation for a little while  we heard various outpourings and i cannot quite think miss emilia a grateful person though i can believe that she does not find it lively at home  she seems to be allowed plenty of slum work as it is the fashion to call it and no one can be more good and useful than fernan and marilda so that i call it sheer discontent and ingratitude not to put up with them  only modernishness my dear wilmet  it is the spirit of the times and the young things cant help it  you dont seem to suffer in that way—at least with anna  no anna is a dear good girl and uncle clem is her hero but i am very glad she has nice young companions in the merrifields and an excitement in prospect in this bazaar  i thought a bazaar quite out of your line  there seems to be no other chance of saving this place from board schools  two thousand pounds have to be raised and though lord rotherwood and mr white the chief owners of property have done and will do much there still remains greater need than a fleeting population like this can be expected to supply and clement thinks that a bazaar is quite justifiable in such a case  if there is nothing undesirable said mrs harewood in her original what it may lead to voice  trust lady merrifield and jane mohun for that  i am going to take you to call upon lilias merrifield  yea i shall wish to see the mother of bernards wife  clement who went with them explained to his somewhat wondering elder sister that he thought safeguards to christian education so needful that he was quite willing that even in this brief stay all the aid in their power should be given to the cause at rockquay nay as he afterwards added to wilmet he was very glad to see how much it interested geraldine and that the work for the church and the congenial friends were rousing her from her listless state of dejection  lady merrifield and mrs harewood were mutually charmed perhaps all the more because the former was not impassioned about the bazaar she said she had been importuned on such subjects wherever she had gone and had learnt to be passive but her sister jane was all eagerness and her younger young people as she called the present half of her family were in the greatest excitement over their first experience of the kind  well is it for all undertakings that there should always be somebody to whom all is new and who can be zealous and full of delight  by no means surtout point de zele returned geraldine  as well say no fermentation said lady merrifield  a dangerous thing said clement  but sourness comes without it or at least deadness returned his sister  wherewith they returned to talk of their common relations  it was like a joke to the brother and sisters that their bernard should be a responsible husband and father whereas lady merrifields notion of him was as a grave grandlooking man with a splendid beard  fergus merrifield was asked to become the protector of adrian whereat he looked sheepish but after the round of pets had been made he informed his two youngest sisters valetta and primrose that it was the cheekiest little fellow he had ever seen who would never know if he was bullied within an inch of his life not that he fergus should let the fellows do it  so though until monday morning anna was the slave of her brother doing her best to supply the place of the six devoted sisters at home the young gentleman ungratefully announced at breakfast—  i dont want gyarls after me with a peculiarly contemptuous twirl at the beginning of the word merrifield is to call for me  anna who had brought down her hat looked mortified  never mind annie said her uncle he will know better one of these days  no i shant said adrian turning round defiantly  if she comes bothering after me at dinnertime i shall throw my books at her— thats all  theres merrifield and he banged out of the room  never mind again said his uncle he has had a large dose of the feminine element and this is his swing out of it  hopes which anna thought cruel were entertained by her elders that the varlet would return somewhat crestfallen but there were no such symptoms the boy reappeared in high spirits having been placed well for his years but not too well for popularity and in the playground he had found himself in his natural element  the boys were mostly of his own size or a little bigger and bullying was not the fashion  he had heard enough school stories to be wary of boasting of his title and as long as he did not flaunt it before their eyes it was regarded as rather a credit to the school  merrifield was elated at the success of his protege and patronized him more than he knew accepting his devotion in a droll contemptuous manner so that the pair were never willingly apart as fergus slept at his aunts during the week the long summer evenings afforded splendid opportunities for what fergus called scientific researches in the quarries and cliffs  it was as well for lady vanderkists peace of mind that she did not realize them though fergus was certified by his family to be cautious and experienced enough to be a safe guide  perhaps people were less nervous about sixth sons than only ones  there was indeed a certain undeveloped idea held out that some of the duplicates of ferguss precious collection might be arranged as a sample of the specimens of minerals and fossils of rockquay at the longtalkedof sale of work     chapter viii  the mousetrap    if a talent be a claw look how he claws him with a talent                                             loves labours lost   the young ladies were truly in an intense state of excitement about the sale of work especially about the authorship and uncle lancelot having promised to send an estimate a meeting of the mousetrap was convened to consider of the materials and certainly the mass of manuscript contributed at different times to the mousetrap magazine was appalling to all but anna who knew what was the shrinkage in the press  she however held herself bound not to inflict on her busy uncle the reading of anything entirely impracticable so she sat with a stern and critical eye as the party mustered in miss mohuns drawingroom and gillian took the chair  the great design said she impressively is that the mousetrap should collect and print and publish a selection for the benefit of the school  the mice vehemently applauded only miss norton the oldest of the party asked humbly—  would any one think it worth buying  oh yes cried valetta  lots of translations  the erl king for instance put in dolores mohun  if anna would append the parody suggested gillian  oh parodies are—are horrid said mysie  many people feel them so said gillian but to others i think they are almost a proof of love that they can make sport with what they admire so much  then said mysie theres dolores eruption  what a nice subject laughed gillian  however it will do beautifully being the description of the pink terraces of that place with the tremendous name in new zealand  were you there cried anna  yes  i always wonder how she can look the same after such adventures said mysie  you know it is much the same as my fathers paper in the scientific world said dolores  nobody over reads that so it wont signify was the uncomplimentary verdict  and added mysie mr brownlow would do a history of rockquay and that would be worth having  oh yes the dear ghost and all cried valetta  the acclamation was general for the reverend armine brownlow was the cynosure curate of the lady churchhelpers and mysie produced as a precious loan to show what could be done the volume containing the choicest morceaux of the family magazine of his youth the travellers joy in white parchment binding adorned with clematis and emblazoned with the evelyn arms on one side the brownlow on the other and full of photographs and reproductions of drawings  much too costly said the prudent  it was not for sale said mysie obviously uneasy while it was being handed round  halfacrown should be our outside price said gillian  or a shilling without photographs halfacrown with was added  shall i ask uncle lance what can be done for how much asked anna and this was accepted with acclamation but as gillian observed they had yet got no further than dolores eruption and the unwritten history  there are lots of stories said kitty varley the one about bayard and all the knights in italy  the one said gillian where padua got into the kingdom of naples and the lady of the house lighted a lucifer match besides the horse who drained a goblet of red wine  you know that was only the pronouns suggested the author  then theres another added valetta called monrepos—such a beauty when the husband was wounded and died at his wifes feet just as the sun gilded the tops of the pines and she died when the moon set and the little daughter went in and was found dead at their feet  no no val said gillian  here is a story that bessie has sent us—really worth having  mesa  oh of course was the acclamation  and heres a little thing of mine gillian added modestly about the development of the brain  at this there was a shout  a little thing  isnt it on the differential calculus  really i dont see why rockquay should not have a little rational study  ah but the present question is what rockquay will buy to further future development it may be but i am afraid their brains are not yet developed enough said emma norton  well then here is the comparison between euripides and shakespeare  thats what you read papa and everybody to sleep with said valetta pertly  except aunt lily and she said she had read something very like it in schlegel added dolores  you must not be too deep for ordinary intellects gillian said emma norton goodnaturedly  surely there is that pretty history you made out of count baldwin the pretender  that  oh that is a childish concern  the better fitted for our understandings said emma disinterring it and handing it over to anna while mysie breathed out—  oh  i did like it  and gill where is phylliss account of the jubilee gaieties and procession last year  that would make the fortune of any paper said anna  yes if lady rotherwood will let it be used said gillian  it is really delightful and full of fun but i am quite sure that her name could not appear and i do not expect leave to use it  shall i write and ask said mysie  oh yes do if cousin rotherwood is always gracious it is specially to you  i wrote to my cousin gerald underwood said anna to ask if he had anything to spare us though i knew he would laugh at the whole concern and he has sent down this  i dont quite know whether he was in earnest or in mischief  and she read aloud—             dreaming of her laurels green            the learned girton girl is seen            or under the trapeze neat            figuring as an athlete             never at the kitchen door            will she scrub or polish more            no metaphoric dirt she eats            literal dirt may form her treats             mary never idle sits            home lessons cant be learnt by fits            hard she studies all the week            answers with undaunted cheek             when to exam mary goes            smartly dressed in stunning clothes            expert in algebraic rule            best pupilteacher of her school             oh how clever we are found            who live on englands happy ground            where rich and poor and wretched may            be drilled in whitehalls favoured way   there was a good deal of laughter at this parody of jane taylors village girl though mysie was inclined to be shocked as at something profane  then what will you think of this said anna beginning gravely to read aloud the inspectors tour  it was very clever so clever that valetta and kitty varley both listened as in sober earnest never discovering or only in flashes like mysie that it was really a satire on all the social state of the different european nations under the denomination of schools one being depicted as highly orthodox but much given to sentence insubordination to dark cold closets another as given to severe drill but neglecting manners a third as repudiating religious teaching and now and then preparing explosions for the masters—no teachers  the various conversations were exceedingly bright and comical and there were brilliant hits at existing circumstances all a little in a socialistic spirit which made anna pause as she read she really had not perceived till she heard it in her own voice and with other ears how audacious it was especially for a school bazaar  dolores applauded with her whole heart but owned that it might be too good for the mousetrap it would be too like catching a monkey gillian more doubtfully questioned whether it would quite do and mysie when she understood the allusions thought it would not  emma norton was more decided and it ended by deciding that the paper should be read to the elders at clipstone and their decision taken before sending it to uncle lance  the spirits of the muscipula party rose as they discussed the remaining mss but these were not of the highest order of merit and anna thought that the really good would be sufficient and all the underwood kith and kin had sufficient knowledge of the press through their connection with the pursuivant to be authorities on the subject  fergus has some splendid duplicate ammonites for me and bits of crystal said mysie  oh do let fergus alone entreated gillian  he is almost a petrifaction already and you know what depends on it  my sister is coming next week for a few days said anna  she is very clever and may help us  emilia was accordingly introduced to the mice but she was not very tolerant of them  essay societies she said were out of date and she thought the rockquay young ladies a very countrytown set  you dont know them emmie said anna  gillian and dolores are very remarkable girls only—  only they are kept down by their mothers i suppose  is that the reason they dont do anything but potter after essay societies and sundayschools like our little girls at vale leston  why i asked gillian as you call her what they were doing about the penitents home and she said her mother and aunt jane went to look after it but never talked about it  you know they are all very young  young indeed  how is one ever to be of any use if mothers and people are always fussing about ones being young  one wont always be so—  they would think so like the woman of a hundred years old who said on her daughters death at eighty ah poor girl i knew i never should rear her  how shall i get to see the infirmary here  miss mohun would take you  cant i go without a fidgety old maid after me  ill tell you what i wish you would do emmie  write an account of one of your hospital visits or of the matchgirls for the mouse trap  do  you know gerald has written something for it  he  why he has too much sense to write for your voluntary schools or it would be too clever and incisive for you  ah  i see it was so by your face  what did he send you  have you got it still  we have really a parody of his which is going inthe girton girl now emmie wont you  you have told me such funny things about your matchgirls  i do not mean to let them be turned into ridicule by your prim decorous swells  why i unfortunately told fernan brown one story— about their mocking old miss bruce with putting on imitation spectacles—and it has served him for a cheval de bataille ever since  oh my dear anna he gets more hateful than ever  i wish you would come back and divert his attention  thank you  dont you think we could change  you could go and let marilda fuss with you now that uncle clem and aunt cherry are so well and i could look after adrian and go to the infirmary and the penitents and all that these people neglect maybe i would write for the mouse trap if gerald does when he comes home  anna did not like the proposal but she pitied emilia and cared for her enough to carry the scheme to her aunt  but geraldine shook her head  the one thing she did not wish was to have emmie riding walking singing and expanding into philanthropy with gerald and besides she knew that emilia would never have patience to read to her uncle or help adrian in his preparation  do you really wish this my dear she asked  n—no not at all but emmie does  could you not try her  annie dear if you wish to have a fortnight or more in town—  oh no no auntie indeed  we could get on now without you  or we would keep emmie till the room is wanted but i had far rather be alone than have the responsibility of emmie  no no indeed i dont think adrian would be good long with her  i had much rather stay—only emmie did wish and she hates the—  oh my dear you need not tell me i only know that i cannot have her after next week the room will be wanted for gerald  she could sleep with me  no annie i must disappoint you  there is not room for her and her flights when gerald comes would never do for your uncle  you know it yourself  anna could not but own the wisdom of the decision and emmie after grumbling at aunt cherry took herself off  she had visited the infirmary and the convalescent home and even persuaded mrs hablot to show her the union workhouse but she never sent her contribution to the mousetrap     chapter ix  out beyond    do the work thats nearest though its dull at whiles helping when we meet them lame dogs over stiles see in every hedgerow marks of angels feet epics in each pebble underneath our feet—c kingsley   drawing  well done cherie  thats a jolly little beggar quite masterly as old renville would say exclaimed gerald underwood looking at a charming watercolour of a little fisherboy which mrs grinstead was just completing  the faithful henchman it ought to be called said anna  that little being has attached himself to fergus merrifield and follows him and adrian everywhere on what they are pleased to call their scientific expeditions  the science of larks  oh dear no  fergus is wild after fossils and has made adrian the same and he really knows an immense deal  they are always after fossils and stones when they are out of school  the precious darling  miss mohun says fergus is quite to be trusted not to take him into dangerous places  an unlookedfor blessing  ha as he turned over his aunts portfolio thats a stunner  you should work it up for the academy  this kind of thing is better for the purpose mrs grinstead said  throw away such work upon a twopenny halfpenny bazaar  heaven forefend  dont be tiresome gerald entreated anna  you are going to do all sorts of things for it and we shall have no end of fun  for the sake of stopping the course of the current returned gerald proceeding to demonstrate in true nineteenthcentury style the hopelessness of subjecting education to what he was pleased to call clericalism  youll never reach the masses while you insist on using an apostle spoon  masses are made up of atoms replied his aunt  and we shall be lost if you dont help added anna  i would help readily enough if it were free dinners or anything to equalize the existence of the classes instead of feeding the artificial wants of the one at the expense of the toil and wretchedness of the other  he proceeded to mention some of the miseries that he had learnt through the oxford house—dilating on them with much enthusiasm—till presently his uncle came in and ere long a parlourmaid announced luncheon just as there was a rush into the house  adrian was caught by his sister and submitted without more than a bother to be made respectable and only communicating in spasmodic gasps facts about merrifield and hockey  wheres marshall asked gerald at the first opportunity on the maid leaving the room  marshall could not stand it said his aunt  he cant exist without london and doing the honours of a studio  left you  most politely he informed me that this place does not agree with his health and there did not seem sufficient scope for his services since the reverend underwood had become so much more independent  so we were thankful to dispose of him to lord de vigny  he was a great plague interpolated adrian always jawing about the halldoor  are you really without a manservant demanded gerald  in the house  lomax comes up from the stables to take some of the work  some lemonade gerald  gerald gazed round in search of unutterable requirements but only met imploring eyes from aunt and sister and restraining ones from his uncle  he subsided and submitted to the lemonade while anna diverted attention by recurring rather nervously to the former subject  and i have got rid of porter she kept me in far too good order  as if sibby did not said clement  aye and you too  but that comes naturally and began in babyhood  what have you done with the house at brompton  martha is taking care of it—mrs lightfoot dont you know  one of our old interminable little lightfoots who went to be a printer in london married and lost his wife then in our breakup actually married martha to take care of his children  now he is dead and i am thankful to have her in the house  to frighten loafers with her awful squint  you forgive the rejection of the inspectors tour  indeed i think you expected it  i wanted to see whether the young ladies would find it out  no compliment to our genius said his aunt  i assure you like mrs bennet there is plenty of that sort of thing said anna  some of them were mystified but gillian and dolores mohun were in ecstasies  ecstasies from that cheerful name  she is the new zealand niece—mr maurice mohuns daughter  they carried it home to their seniors and of course the verdict was too strong for rockquay atmosphere said his aunt  so it did not even go to uncle lance said anna  shall you try the pursuivant  on the contrary i shall put in the pepper and salt i regretted and try the censor  indeed observed his uncle in a tone of surprise  oh said gerald coolly i have sent little things to the censor before which they seem to regard in the light of pickles and laver  the censor was an able paper on the side of philosophical politics and success in that quarter was a feather in the young mans cap though not quite the kind of feather his elders might have desired  journalism is a kind of native air to us said mrs grinstead but from pur  pur is the element of your dear old world cherie said gerald and here am i come to do your bidding in its precincts for a whole long vacation  he spoke lightly and with a pretty little graceful bow to his aunt but there was something in his eyes and smile that conveyed to her a dread that he meant that he only resigned himself for the time and looked beyond  uncle lance is coming volunteered adrian  yes said geraldine  chorister that he was and champion of church teaching that he is he makes the cause of christian education everywhere his own and is coming down to see what he can do inexpensively with native talent for concert or masque or something—robin hood perhaps  ending in character with a rush on the audience said gerald otherwise robin hood is stale  tennyson has spoilt that for public use said mrs grinstead  but was not something else in hand  only rehearsed  it never came off said gerald  the most awful rot said adrian  i would have nothing to do with it  in consequence it was a failure laughed gerald  it was the tempest wasnt it said anna  not really exclaimed mrs grinstead  about as like as a wren to an eagle said gerald  we had it at the festival last winter  the authors adapted the plot that was all  the authors being  the present company said gerald and uncle bill with uncle lance supplying or adapting music for we were not original i assure you  it was when uncle clem was ill put in anna and somehow i dont think we took in the accounts of it  no said gerald and nobody did it con amore though we could not put it off  i should like to see it better done  such rot exclaimed adrian  theres an old man he was uncle lance with the great white beard made out of kits white bears skin and he lived in a desert island where there was a shipwreck—very jolly if you could see it only you cant—and the savages—no the wreckers all came down  what in a desert island  it was not exactly desert  gerald i say do let there be savages it would be such a lark to have them all black and then id act  what an inducement  then somebody turned out to be somebodys enemy and the old chap frightened them all with squibs and crackers and foghorns till somebody turned out to be somebody elses son and married the daughter  if you trace the tempest through that version you are clever said gerald  i told you it was awful rot said adrian  theres merrifield  excuse me cherie  and off he went  the sentiments of the actors somewhat resembled adrians  it was too new and needed more learning and more pains so they beg to revert to robin hood  however i should like to see it well got up for once if only by amateurs  miranda has a capital song by uncle bill made for francies soprano  she cuts you all out anna  that she does in looks and voice but she could not act here in public  however we will lay it before the mousetrap  was it printed  lance had enough for the performers struck off  francie could send some up  after all said cherie the desert island full of savages and wreckers is not more remarkable than the stillvexd bermoothes getting between argiers and sicily  it really was one of the outer hebrides said gerald with the eagerness that belonged to authorship so that there could be any amount of scottish songs  prospero is an old highland chief who has been set adrift with his daughter—francie vanderkist to wit—and floated up there obtaining control over the local elves and brownies  little fely was a most dainty sprite  i am glad you did not make ariel an electric telegraph said his aunt  tempting but such profanity in the face of vale leston was forbidden and so was the comic element as bad for the teetotallers  but who were the wreckers asked anna  buccaneers my dear singing songs out of the pirate— schoolmaster organist and choir generally  they had captured prosperos supplanter he was a highland chief in league with the whigs by the leg while the exiled fellow was jacobite so as to have the songs dear to the feminine mind  they get wrecked on the island and are terrified by the elves into releasing alonso etc meantime ferdinand carries logs forgathers with miranda and prospero—and ends— he flourished his hands  and it wasnt acted  no we were getting it up before christmas said gerald and then—  he looked towards clement whose illness had then been at the crisis  very inconsiderate of me said clement smiling as the old woman said when her husband did not die before the funeral cakes were stale  but could it not come off at the festival  now said gerald that the boy is gone i may be allowed a glass of beer  is that absurdity to last on here  adrians mother would not let him come on any other terms said mrs grinstead  did she also stipulate that he was never to see a horse  quite as fatal to his father  you need not point the unreason but consider how she has suffered  you go the way to make him indulge on the sly  true perhaps said clement but i mean to take the matter up when i know the poor little fellow better  gerald gave a little shrug a relic of his foreign ancestry and anna proposed a ride to clipstone to tell gillian merrifield of the idea  eh the dogmatic damsel that came with you the year we had midsummer nights dream  yes sister to uncle bernards wife  do you know jasper merrifield clever man  always photographing  so off they went gerald apparently in a resigned state of mind and came upon dogs and girls in an old quarry where mysie had dragged them to look for pretty stones and young ferns to make little rockeries for the sale of work  the tempest was propounded and received with acclamation though the merrifields declared that they could not sing and their father would not allow them to do so in public if they could  dolores looked on in a sort of silent scorn at a young man who could talk so eagerly about a trumpery rareeshow especially for an object that she did not care about  none of them knew how far it was the pride of authorship and the desire of pastime  only jasper said when he heard their report—  underwood is a queer fellow  one never knows where to have him socialist one minute old tory the next  a dreamer asked dolores  if you like to call him so  i believe he will dawdle and dream all his life and never do any good  perhaps he is waiting  i dont believe in waiting said jasper wiping the dust off his photographic glasses  why he has a lovely moor of his own and does not know how to use it  conclusive said gillian     chapter x  noblesse oblige    the other wont agree thereto   so here they fall to strife with one another they did fight   about the childrens life                         babes in the wood   i say aunt cherry said adrian the fossil forest is to be uncovered tomorrow and merrifield is going to stay for it and im going down with him  fossil forest  what in the museum  no indeed  in anscombe cove they call it  theres a forest buried there and bits come up sometimes  tomorrow theres to be a tremendous low tide that will leave a lot of it uncovered and merrifield and i mean to dig it out and if there are some duplicate bits they may be had for the bazaar  yes they have been begging ferguss duplicates for a collection of fossils said anna  but can it be safe  a low tide means a high tide you know  bosh returned adrian  miss mohun is sure to know all about the tides i suppose said clement if her nephew goes with her consent i suppose it is safe  if— said mrs grinstead  adrian looked contemptuous and muttered something on which anna undertook to see miss mohun betimes and judge how the land or rather the sea lay and whether fergus was to be trusted  it would be a saturday a whole holiday on which he generally went home for sunday and adrian spent the day with him but the boys present scheme was to take their luncheon with them and spend the whole day in anscombe cove  this was on the further side of the bay from the marble works shut in by big cliffs which ran out into long chains of rocks on either side but retreated in the midst where a little stream from the village of anscombe or rather from the moorland beyond made its way to the sea  the almanacks avouched that on this saturday there would be an unusually low tide soon after twelve oclock and fergus had set his heart on investigating the buried forest that there was no doubt had been choked by the combined forces of river and sea  so anna found that notice had been sent to clipstone of his intention of devoting himself to the cove and not coming home till the evening and that his uncle and aunt did not think there was any danger especially as his constant henchman davie blake was going with him and all the fisherboys of the place were endowed with a certain instinct for their own tides  the only accident jane mohun had ever known was with a stranger  anna had no choice but to subside and the boys started as soon as the mornings tide would have gone down sufficiently carrying baskets for their treasures containing their luncheon and apparently expecting to find the forest growing upright under the mud like a wood full of bushes  the cove for which they were bound was on the further side of the chain of rocks nearly two miles from rockquay and one of the roads ran along the top of the red cliffs that shut it in with no opening except where the stream emerged and even that a very scanty bank of shingle  in spite of all assurances anna could not be easy about her darling and when afternoon came and the horses were brought to the door she coaxed gerald into riding along the cliffs in the anscombe direction where there was a good road from whence they could turn down a steep hill into the village and thence go up a wild moor beyond or else continue along the coast for a considerable distance  as they went out she could see nothing of the boys only rocks rising through an expanse of mud and the sea breaking beyond  she would have preferred continuing the cliff road but gerald had a turn for the moor and carried her off through the village of anscombe up and up till they had had a lively canter on the moor and looked far out at sea  when they turned back and had reached the cliff road what had been a sheet of mud before had been almost entirely covered with sparkling waves and there was white foam beating against some of the rocks  i hope adrian is gone home sighed anna  long ago depend on it returned gerald carelessly but the next moment his tone changed  by jove he exclaimed and pointed with his whip to a rock or island at the end of the range of rocks  he was much the more longsighted of the two and she could only first discern that there was something alive upon the rock  oh she cried is it the boys—i cant see  i cant tell  it is boys maybe fishers  i must get out to them he replied  now anna be quiet—use your senses  it is somebody anyway  i saw the opening of a path down the rock just now and he threw himself off his horse and threw her the bridle  you ride to the first house find where there is a coastguard station or any fisherman to put out a boat  no time to be lost  oh is it is it— cried the bewildered girl with no hand to feel for her eyeglass  where shall i go  i tell you i cant tell he shouted in answer to both questions half angrily already on his way  dont dawdle and he disappeared  poor anna she had no inclination to dawdle but the two horses were a sore impediment and she went on some way without seeing any houses  should she turn back to the little road leading down from anscombe but that was rough and difficult and could not be undertaken quickly with a led horse or should she make the best of her way to the nearest villas outskirts of rockquay  however after a moment the swish of bicycles was heard and up came two young men clerks apparently let loose by saturday  they halted and in answer to her agitated question where there was a house pointed to a path which they said led down to the preventive station and asked whether there had been an accident and whether they could be of use  they were more able to decide what was best to be done than she could be and they grew more keenly interested when they understood for whom she feared  petros white brother to mrs henderson and nephew to aunt adelines husband was one of them the other a youth also employed at the marble works  this latter took the horses off her hands while petros showed her the way to the coastguard station by a steep path leading to a sort of ledge in the side of the cliff scooped out partly by nature and partly by art where stood the little houses covered with slate  there the mistress was looking out anxiously with a glass while below the preventive man was unlocking the boathouse having already observed the peril of the boys but lamenting the absence of his mate  petros ran down at speed to offer his help and anna could only borrow the glass through which she plainly saw the three boys barelegged sitting huddled up on the top of the rock but with the waves still a good way from them and their faces all turned hopefully towards the promontory of rock along which she could see gerald picking his way but there was evidently a terrible and fast diminishing space between its final point and the rock of refuge  anna was about to rush down and give her help with an oar but the woman withheld her saying that she would only crowd the boat and retard the rescue for which the two were quite sufficient only the danger was that the current of the stream might make the tide rise rapidly in the bay  there were besides so many rocks and shoals that it was impossible to proceed straight across but it was needful absolutely to pass the rock and then turn back on it from the open sea  it was agonizing for the sister to watch the devious course and she turned the glass upon the poor boys plainly making out adrians scared restless look as he clung to the fisherlad and fergus nursing his bag of specimens with his knees drawn up  by and by gerald was wading and with difficulty preventing himself from being washed off the rocks  he paused saw her and waved encouragement  then he plunged along not off his feet and reached the island where the boys were holding out their arms to him  there ensued a few moments of apparently hot debate and she saw to her horror and amazement that he was thrusting back one boy who struggled and almost fell off the rock in his passion as gerald lifted down the little fisherboy  of course she could not hear the words come boy  no adrian  noblesse oblige  i will come back never fear  i can take but one dont i tell you  i will come back  those were geralds words while adrian threw himself on the rock sobbing and screaming while fergus sat still hugging his bag  anna could have screamed with her brother for the boat seemed to have overshot the mark and to be going quite aloof when all depended upon a few minutes  she could hardly hear the words of the preventive woman who had found a second glass never you fear miss the boat will be up in time  she could not speak  her heart was in wild rebellion as she thought of the comparative value of her widowed mothers only son with that of the fisherboy or even of fergus one of so large a family  she could not or would not look to see what gerald was doing with the wretched little coast boy but she heard her companion say that the gentleman had put the boy down to scramble among the rocks and he himself was going back to the pair on the rock quite swimming now  she durst look again and saw that he had scrambled up to the boys perch and had lifted adrian up but there was white spray dashing round now  she could not see the boat  they have to keep to the other side explained the woman  god keep them  it will be a near shave  the gentleman is taking off his coat  again there was a leap of foam—over over  then all was blotted out but the woman exclaimed—  there they are  oh where  one swimming  he is floating the other  anna could see no longer  she dashed aside the telescope then begged to be told then looked again  no prayer would come but save him save him  there was a call quite close  mr norris sir put off your boat  master fergus—oh is he off and drenched and breathless davy sank down on the ground at their feet quite spent unable at first to get out a word after those panting ones but in a minute he spoke in answer to the agonized which  who  master fergus is swimming  the young sir couldnt  anna recollected how her mothers fears and entreaties had prevented mr harewood from teaching adrian to swim  gent is floating him added the boy  he took me first because i could get over the rocks and get help soonest  he is a real gentleman he is  anna could not listen to anything but the boat is coming  oh but they dont see  they are going away from it  thats the current said mrs norris  my man knows what he is about and so does the gentleman never fear  there was another terrible interval and then boat and swimmers began to approach though in what condition could not be made out  a dark little head no doubt that of fergus was lifted in then another figure was raised and taken into the boat gerald swam with a hand on it for a short distance then was helped in and almost at once took an oar  thats right said mrs norris  it will keep out the cold  they are not coming here exclaimed anna  they are going round the point  all right was the answer  tis more direct you see no shoals and the young gentlemen will get to their own homes and beds all the quicker  now miss you will come in and take a cup of tea i am sure you want it and i had just made it when norris saw the little lads  oh thank you i must get back at once  my little brother—  yes yes miss but youll be able to ride the faster for a bit of bread and cup of tea  you are all of a tremble  it was true and to pacify her mrs norris sent a child up to bid petros have the horses ready and anna was persuaded to swallow a little too which happily had cooled enough for her haste but she hurried off leaving mrs norris to expend her hospitality on davy who endured his drenching like a fish and could hardly wait even to swallow thick breadandbutter till he could rush off to hear of his dear master fergus  the horses were ready  petros had been joined by other spectators and was able to entrust the bicycles to one of them while he himself undertook to lead mr underwoods horse to the stable  anna rode off at as much speed or more than was safe downhill among the stones she had to cross the broad parade above the quay and indeed she believed she had come faster than the boat which had to skirt round the side of the promontory between anscombe cove and rockquay  in fact when she came above the town she could see a crowd on the quay and pier all looking out to sea and she now beheld two boats making for the harbour  then she had to ride between walls and villas and lost sight of all till she emerged on the parade and thought she saw uncle clements hat above the crowd as she looked over their heads  she gave her horse to a bystander who evidently knew her for a murmur went through the crowd of little chaps sister and way was made for her to get forward while several rough voices said all right coastguard boat not this one  her uncle and miss mohun wore standing together  general mohun could be seen in the foremost boat and they could hear him call out with a wave of his arm—  all right  all safe  you hero  wheres gerald  miss mohun exclaimed as anna came up to her  there and she pointed to the coastguard boat  we saw the boys from anscombe cliff and he went out to them  gerald exclaimed his uncle with a ring of gladness in his voice all the more that it was plain that the rower was indeed gerald and he began to hail those on shore while ferguss head rose up from the bottom of the boat  in a few moments they were close to the quay and the little sodden mass that purported to be fergus was calling out—  aunt jane  oh ive lost such a bit of aralia  wheres davy  here take care  he is all right were geralds words  he meant adrian whom his cousin lifted out with eyes open and conscious but with limp hands and white exhausted looks to be carried to the fly that stood in waiting  is the other boy safe asked gerald anxiously  oh yes but how could you were the first words that came to anna but she felt rebuked by a strange look of utter surprise and instead of answering her he replied to general mohun—  thanks no ill walk up as a rough coat was thrown over his dripping and scanty garments  the wisest way said the general  can you fergus  yes quite well  oh my aralia  he has been half crying all the way home about his fossils said gerald  never mind fergus look out for the next springtide uncle clem you ought to drive up  clement submitted clearly unable to resist and sat down by anna who had her brother in her arms rubbing his hands and warming them caressing him and asking him how he felt to which the only answer she got was—  it was beastly  i have my mouth awfully full of water still  clement made a low murmur of thanksgiving and anna looking up was startled to see how white and helpless he was  the way was happily very short but he had so nearly fainted that gerald hurrying on faster uphill than the horse to reassure his aunt lifted him out not far from insensible and carried him with sibbys help to his bed in the room on the groundfloor where the remedies were close at hand geraldine and nurse anxiously administering them when the first sign of revival he gave was pointing to geralds dripping condition and signing to him to go and take care of himself  all right yes boys and all  all right cherie  and he went swallowing down the glass of stimulant which his aunt turned from her other patient for a moment to administer but she was much too anxious about clement to have thought for any one else for truly it did seem likely that he would be the chief sufferer from the catastrophe  little davys adventure as he had lost no clothes made no more impression on his parents than if he had been an amphibious animal or a water dog and when fergus came out of beechwood cottage after having changed the few clothes he had retained and had a good meal to be driven home with his uncle in the dogcart his constant henchman was found watching for news of him at the gate  please sir i think well find your aralia next springtide  whereupon general mohun told him he was a good little chap and presented him with a halfcrown the largest sum he had ever possessed in his life  fergus did not come off quite so well for when the story had been told though his mother had trembled and shed tears of thankfulness as she kissed him and his sisters sprang at him and devoured him while all the time he bemoaned his piece of the stump of an aralia and a bit of cone of a pinus and other treasures to which imaginative regret lent such an aid that no doubt he would believe the lost contents of his bag to have been the most precious articles that he had ever collected his father however took him into his study  fergus he said gravely this is the second time your ardour upon your pursuits has caused danger and inconvenience to other people this time to yourself too  fergus hung his head and faltered something about—never saw  no that is the point  now i say nothing about your pursuits  i am very glad you should have them and be an intelligent lad but they must not be taken up exclusively so as to drive out all heed to anything else  remember there is a great difference between courage and foolhardiness and that you are especially warned to be careful if your venturesomeness endangers other peoples lives  so fergus went off under a sense of his fathers displeasure while adrian lay in his bed kicking about admired and petted by his sister who thought every one very unkind and indifferent to him and when he went to sleep began a letter to her eldest sister describing the adventure and his heroism in naming terms such as on second thoughts she suppressed as likely to frighten her mother and lead to his immediate recall     chapter xi  heroes and heroworship    nothing of him that doth fade but doth suffer a seachange into something rich and strange—tempest   sunday morning found anna in a different frame of mind from that of the evening before  uncle clement had been very ill all night and the house was to be kept as quiet as possible  when anna came in from early celebration aunt cherry came out looking like a ghost and very anxious and gave a sigh of relief on adrian being reported still sound asleep  gerald presently came down pale and languid but calling himself all right and loitering over his breakfast till after the boy appeared so rosy and ravenous as to cause no apprehension except that he should devour too much apricot jam and use his new boots too noisily on the stairs  anna devised walking him to beechcroft to hear if there were any news of fergus and though he observed with a certain sound of contemptuous rivalship that there was no need for merrifield was as right as a trivet he was glad enough to get out of doors a little sooner and though he affected to be bored by the kind inquiries of the people they met he carried his head all the higher for them  nobody was at home except general mohun but he verified adrians impression of his nephews soundness whatever the mysterious comparison might mean and asked rather solicitously not only after mr underwood but after gerald who he said was a delicate subject to have made such exertions  it really was very gallant and very sensible behaviour he said as he took his hat to walk to st andrews with the brother and sister but anna was conscious of a little pouting in adrians expression and displeasure in his stumping steps  gerald came to church but went to sleep in the sermon and had altogether such a wornout look that no one could help remembering that he had never been very strong and had gone through much exertion the day before nor could he eat much of the midday meal mrs grinstead who was more at ease about her brother looked anxiously at him and with a kind of smile the word apres passed between them  the sunday custom was for clement to take adrian to say his catechism and have a little instruction before going out walking but as this could not be on this day anna and he were to go out for a longer walk than usual so as to remove disturbance from the household  gerald declined of course and was left extended on the sofa but just as anna and adrian had made a few steps along the street and the boy had prevailed not to walk to clipstone as she wished but to go to the cliffs that she might hear the adventure related in sight of the scene of action he discovered that he had left a glove  he was very particular about sunday walking in gloves in any public place and rushed back to find it leaving his sister waiting  presently he came tearing back and laughing  did you find it  oh yes it was in the drawingroom  and what else do you think i found  why cherie administering—and he pointed down his throat and made a gulp with a wild grimace of triumph  on the sly  ha ha  anna felt as if the ground had opened under her feet but she answered gravely—  poor gerald went through a great deal yesterday and is quite knocked up so no wonder he needs some strengthening medicine  strengthening grandmother  dont you think i know better than that he cried with a caper and a grin  of course you had to have some cordial when you were taken out of the water  and dont you know what it was  i know the fisherpeople carry stuff about with them in case of accidents  thats the way with girls—just to think one knows nothing at all  what do you know adrian  know  why i havent been about with kit and ted harewood for nothing  jolly good larks it is to see how all of you take for granted that a fellow never knew the taste of anything but tea and milkandwater  but what do you know the taste of she asked with an earnestness that provoked the boy to tease and put on a boasting manner so that she could not tell how much he was pretending for the sake of amazing and tormenting her in which he certainly succeeded  however his attention was diverted by coming round the corner to where there was a view of anscombe bay when he immediately began to fight his battles oer again and show where they had been groping in the mud and seaweed in pursuit of seaurchins and stranded star fish and crabs  and it wasnt a forest after all it was just a sell—nothing but mud and weed only fergus would go and poke in it and there were horrid great rough stones and rocks too and i tumbled over one  anna here became conscious that the whole place was the resort of the afternoon promenaders of rockquay great and small of all ranks and degrees belonging to the middle class or below it and that they might themselves become the object of attention and she begged her brother to turn back and wait till they could have the place to themselves  these are a disgusting lot of cads he agreed but there wont be such a jolly tide another time  i declare i see the very rock where i saw the seamouse—out there red and shiny at the top  here a welldressed man who had just come up the coastguard path put aside his pipe and taking off his hat deferentially asked—  have i the honour of addressing sir adrian vanderkist  adrian replied with a gracious nod and gesture towards his straw hat and in another moment anna found him answering questions and giving his own account of the adventure to the inquirer who she had little doubt was a reporter and carrying his head if possible higher in consequence as he told how fergus merrifield had lingered over his stones and all the rest after his own version  she did not hear the whole having had to answer the inquiries of one of the bicycle friends of the previous day but when her attention was free she heard—  and the young lady sir adrian  young lady  thank goodness we were not bothered with any of that sort  indeed sir adrian i understood that there was a young lady miss aurelia that master merrifield was lamenting as if she had met with a watery grave  ha ha  aralia was only the name of a bit of fossil kind of a stick that merrifield had us down there to find in the fossil forest  im sure i saw no forest only bits of mud and stuff  but he found a bit sure enough and was ready to break his heart when he had to leave his bag behind him on the rock  aralia a young lady  thats a good one  he forgathered with a schoolfellow on the way home and anna heard little more  the next day however there arrived the daily local paper addressed to sir adrian vanderkist bart and it was opened by him at breakfasttime  i say look here  dangerous accident in anscombe  a youthful baronet in peril  what asses people are he added with an odd access of the gratified shame of seeing himself for the first time in print  but he did not proceed to read aloud there evidently was something he did not like and he was very near pocketing it and rushing off headlong to school with it if his aunt and anna had not entreated or commanded for it when he threw it over with an uncomplimentary epithet  just what i was afraid of when i saw the man talking to him exclaimed anna oh listen  the young sir adrian vanderkist at present residing at st andrews rock with his aunt mrs grinstead and the rev e c underwood and who is a pupil at mrs edgars academy for young gentlemen was we are informed involved in the most imminent danger together with a son of general sir jasper merrifield kgc a young gentleman whose remarkable scientific talent and taste appear to have occasioned the peril of the youthful party from whence they were rescued by gerald f underwood esq of vale leston  whats all that said gerald f underwood esquire sauntering in and kissing his aunt  goodmorning  how is uncle clement this morning  much better i think he will be up by and by answered mrs grinstead  what bosh have you got there  the reporters seized on their prey eh  theres sir jasper exclaimed anna who could see through the blinds from where she sat  sir jasper had driven over with his little son and after leaving him at school had come to inquire for mr underwood and to obtain a fuller account of the accident having already picked up a paper and glanced at it  i am afraid my little scamp led them into the danger he said scientific taste forsooth  science is as good a reason as anything else for getting into scrapes  really said gerald i cant say i think your boy came out the worst in it though i must own the rockquay advertiser bestows most of the honours of the affair on the youthful baronet  you say he blew his own trumpet added gerald turning to anna  the reporter came and beset us said anna in a displeased voice i did not hear all that passed but of course adrian told him what he told me only those people make things sound ridiculous  to begin with said gerald i dont think fergus or at any rate davy blake was in fault  they tried to go home in good time having an instinct for tides but adrian was chasing a seamouse or some such game and could not be brought back and then he fell over a slippery rock and had to be dragged out of a hole and by that time the channel of the anscombe stream was too deep at least for him who has been only too carefully guarded from being amphibious  oh that did not transpire at home said sir jasper  boys are so reserved  mrs grinstead and anna looked rather surprised anna even ventured—  i thought fergus got too absorbed  so did i said his father dryly  and he did not justify himself  m—m—m went on gerald skimming the article  read it cried anna  you know none of us have seen it  gerald continued—  their perilous position having been observed from anscombe cliffs mr g f underwood of vale leston heroically ie humbugically made his way out to their assistance while a boat was put off by the coastguard and that of mr carter fisherman from rockquay was launched somewhat later  we could not see either of them you know my eye this is coming it strong  the young baronet generously insisted that the little fisherboy david blake who had accompanied them should first be placed in safety—  didnt he exclaimed anna  i saw and i wondered but i thought it was his doing  you saw  yes in the coastguards telescope  oh  that is a new feature in the case  then he did not insist said mrs grinstead  it was with the wrong side of his mouth  but why did you send the fisherboy first when after all his life was less important exclaimed anna breaking forth at last  first for the reason that i strove to impress on the youthful baronet noblesse oblige  secondly that davy knew how to make his way along the rocks and also knew where to find the preventive station  i could leave him to get on as i could not have done with the precious adrian and that gave a much better chance for us all it was swimming work by the time i got back and by that time i thought the best alternative for any of us was to keep hold as long as we could and then keep afloat as best we might till we were picked up  your boy was the hero of it all  adrian was so angry with me for my disrespect that i could hardly have got him to listen to me if fergus had not made him understand that to let himself be passive and be floated by me till the boats came up was the only thing to be done  there was one howl when he had to let go his beloved aralia but he showed his soldier blood and behaved most manfully  i am most thankful to hear it said his father and especially thankful to you  oh there was not much real danger said gerald lightly to any one who could swim  but adrian could not said anna  oh gerald what do we not owe to you  i must be off said sir jasper i must see about a new jacket for my boy  by the bye do you know how the little davy fared in the matter of clothes  better than any of us said gerald  he was far too sharp to go mudlarking in anything that would be damaged and had his boots safe laid up in a corner  i wish mine were equally safe  sir jaspers purchases were not confined to boots and jacket but as compensation for his hard words included a certain cabinet full of drawers that had long been ferguss cynosure  anna and her aunt were much concerned at what was said of adrian and still more at the boastful account that he seemed to have given but then something as mrs grinstead observed must be allowed for the reporters satisfaction in having interviewed a live baronet  each of the parties concerned had one hero and if the merrifields was fergus to their own great surprise and satisfaction aunt cherry was very happy over her own especial boy gerald and certainly it was an easier task than to accept the youthful baronet at his own valuation or that of the reporter  mrs grinstead considered whether to try to make him less conceited about it and show him his want of truth  she consulted his uncle about it showing the newspaper and telling and causing gerald to tell the history of the accident which clement had not been fit to hear all the day before  he was still in bed but quite ready to attend to anything and he laughed over the account which she illustrated by the discoveries she had made from the united witnesses  and is it not delightful to see for once what gerald really is she said  yes he seems to have behaved gallantly said his uncle and i wont say just what might have been expected  one does expect something of an underwood she said  little merrifield too who saw the danger coming deserves more honour than he seems to have taken to himself  yes he accepted severity from that stern father of his who seems very sorry for it now  it is curious how those boys blood comes out in the matter—chasser de race  you must allow something for breeding  fergus had not been the idol of a mother and sisters and gerald remembered his father in danger  oh i can never be glad enough that he has that remembrance of him how like him he grows  that unconscious imitation is so curious  yes the other day when i had been dozing i caught myself calling out that he was whistling johnny cope so loud that he would be heard in the shop  he seems to be settling down more happily here than i expected  i sometimes wonder if there is any attraction at clipstone  no harm if there were except—  except what  early marriage might be the very best thing  perhaps though sometimes i doubt whether it is well for a man to have gone through the chief hopes and crises of life so soon  he looks out for fresh excitement  there are so many stages in life said geraldine sighing  and with all his likenesses gerald is quite different from any of you  so i suppose each generation feels with those who succeed it  nor do i feel as if i understood the universities today as i did cambridge thought of old  we can do nothing but wait and pray and put out a hand where we see cause  where we see  it is the not seeing that is so trying  the being sure that there is more going on within than is allowed to meet ones eye and that one is only patronized as an old grandmother—quite out of it  i think the conditions of life and thought are less simple than in our day  and to come to the present  what is to be done about adrian—the one who was not a hero though he made himself out so  probably he really thought so  he is a mere child you know and it was his first adventure before he has outgrown the days of cowardice  he need not have told stories  depend upon it he hardly knew that he did so  he had the reporter to help him certainly and the rockquay advertiser may not keep to the stern veracity and simplicity of the pursuivant  and was proud to interview a live baronet  then what shall we do—anna and i i mean  write the simple facts to vale leston and then let it alone  to him  certainly  he would think your speaking mere nagging  preserve an ominous silence if he speaks  his schoolfellows will be his best cure  well he did seem ashamed  clement was right  the boys only mention of the paragraph was once as that beastly thing and anna discovered from valetta merrifield that whatever satisfaction he might have derived from it had been effectually driven out of him by the fellows at mrs edgars who had beset him with all their force of derision called him nothing but the youthful bart and made him ashamed as none of the opposite sex or of maturer years could ever have succeeded in doing valetta said fergus had tried to stop it but there had certainly been one effect namely that adrian was less disposed to be merrys shadow than heretofore and seemed inclined instead to take up with the other seniors  one thing however was certain  gerald enjoyed a good deal more consideration among the clipstone damsels than before  true as jasper said it was only what any one would have done but he had done it and proved himself by no means inferior to any one and fergus regarded him as a true hero which had a considerable effect on his sisters the more perhaps because jasper derided their admiration  they were doubly bent on securing him for a contributor to the mouse trap  they almost thought of inviting him to their browning afternoons but decided that he would not appreciate the feminine company though he did so often have a number of the censor to discuss it with dolores whenever they met him     chapter xii  the little butterfly    the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoralcomical historicalpastoral—hamlet   the matrons otherwise denominated lady patronesses met in committee miss mohun being of course the soul and spirit of all though mrs ellesmere as the wife of the rector of old rockstone church was the president lady flight one of the most interested was there also lady merrifield dragged in to secure that there was nothing decided on contrary to oldworld instincts mrs grinstead in right of the musical element that her brother promised the beautiful mrs henderson to represent the marble works mrs simmonds of the cliff hotel the mayoress and other notables  the time was fixed for the first week in august the only one when engagements would permit the rotherwood family to be present for the opening and when the regatta was apt to fill rockquay with visitors the place was to be the top of the cliffs of rockstone where the gardens of the cliff hotel of beechcroft cottage rocca marina and carrara belonging respectively to miss mohun mr white and captain henderson lay close together separated by low walls and each with a private door opening on a path along the top of the cliffs  they could easily be made to communicate together by planks laid over the boundaries and they had lawns adapted for tents etc and rocca marina rejoiced in a shrubbery and conservatories that were a show in themselves and would be kindly lent by mr and mrs white though health compelled them to be absent and to resort to gastein  the hotel likewise had a large wellkept garden where what mrs simmonds called a pavilion quite mediaeval was in course of erection and could be thrown open on the great day  it was rather teagardenish but it could be made available for the representation of the outlaws isle  lancelot made a hurried visit to study the place and review the forces and decided that it was practicable  there could be a gallery at one end for the spectators and the outer end toward the bay could be transformed into a stage with room for the orchestra and if the weather were favourable the real sea could be shown in the background  the scenes had been painted by the clever fingers at vale leston  it remained to cast the parts  lancelot himself would be prospero otherwise alaster maclan and likewise conductor bringing with him the schoolmaster of vale leston who could supply his part as conductor when he was on the stage  his little boy felix would be ariel the other elves could be selected from the schoolchildren and the local choral society would supply the wreckers and the wrecked  but the demur was over briggs a retired purser who had always had a monopoly of sea songs and who looked on the boatswain as his right and was likely to roar every one down  ferdinand would be gerald under the name of angus but the difficulty was his miranda—mona as she was called the vanderkists could not be asked to perform in public nor would sir jasper merrifield have consented to his daughters doing so even if they could have sung and it had been privately agreed that none of the other young ladies of rockquay could be brought forward especially as there was no other grownup female character  my wife might undertake it said lancelot but her voice is not her strong point and she would be rather substantial for a miranda  it would be rather like finding a mother instead of a wife—with all respect to my aunt daisy laughed gerald  by the bye im sure i once heard a voice somewhere down by the sea that would be perfect exclaimed lance  sweet and powerful fresh and young just what is essential  i heard it when i was in quest of crabs with my boy  i know exclaimed gerald the little butterfly as they call her  at a cigarshop said lance  mrs schnetterlings  not very respectable put in lady flight  decidedly attractive to the little boys though said gerald sweets fishingtackle foreign stamps cigars  i went in once to see whether adrian was up to mischief there and the mother butterfly looked at me as if i had seven heads but i just got a glimpse of the girl and as my uncle says she would make an ideal mona or miranda  lydia schnetterling exclaimed mr flight  she is a very pretty girl with a nice voice  you remember her miss mohun at our concerts  a lovely fairy  i remember her well  i thought she was foreign and a roman catholic  so her mother professes—a hungarian  the school officer sent her to school and she did very well there sundayschool and all and was a monitor  she was even confirmed  her name is really ludmilla and lida is the correct contraction  but when i wanted her to be apprenticed as a pupilteacher the mother suddenly objected that she is a roman catholic but i very much doubt the womans having any religion at all  i wrote to the priest about her but i believe he could make nothing of her  still lydia is a very nice girl—comes to church and has not given up the choral society  she is a remarkably nice good girl added mrs henderson  she came to me and entreated that i would speak for her to be taken on at the marble works  you have her there  yes but i am much afraid that her talents do not lie in the way of high promotion and i think if she does not get wages enough to satisfy her mother she is in dread of being made to sing at public houses and musichalls  that nice refined girl  yes i am sure the idea is dreadful to her  could you not put her in the way of getting trained asked gerald of his uncle  i must hear her first  i will bring her up to the choral society tonight said mr flight  what did you call her said geraldine  some german or foreign name schnetterling and the school calls her lydia  at that moment the council was invaded as it sat in miss mohuns drawingroom upon rugs and wicker chairs to be refreshed with tea in burst a whole army of merrifields headed by little primrose now a tall girl of twelve years old more the pet of the family than any of her elders had been allowed to be  her cry was—  oh mamma mamma heres the very one for the captain of the buccaneers  the startling announcement was followed by the appearance of a tall stalwart handsome young man of a certain naval aspect whom lady merrifield introduced as captain armytage  we must congratulate him gillian she said  i see you are gazetted as commander  primrose who had something of the licence of the youngest observed—  we have been telling him all about it  he used to be oliver cromwell in how do you like it and now he will be a buccaneer  oliver cromwell you silly child burst out gillian with a little shake while the rest fell into fits of laughing  i fear it was a less distinguished part said captain armytage  may i understand that you will help us said lancelot  i heard of you at devereux castle  i dont think you heard much of my capabilities especially musical ones  i was the stick of the party said captain armytage  it was explained that captain armytage had actually arrived that afternoon at the cliff hotel and had walked over to call at clipstone whence he found the young ladies setting out to walk to rockstone  he could not deny that he had acted and sung though as he said his performance in both cases was vile  little miss primrose had most comically taken upon her to patronize him and to offer him as buccaneer captain had been a freak of her own hardly to be accounted for except that purser briggss unsuitableness had been discussed in her presence  primrose is getting to be a horrid little forward thing observed gillian to her aunt  a child of the present said miss mohun  infant england  but her suggestion seems to be highly opportune  i dont believe he can sing growled gillian and it will be just an excuse for his hanging about here  there was something in gillians savagery which gave aunt jane a curious impression but she kept it to herself  late in the evening lance appeared in his sisters drawingroom with—  i have more hopes of it  i did not think it was feasible when anna wrote to me but i see my way better now  that parson flight has a good notion of drilling and that recruit of the little merrifield girl captain armytage is worth having  if he roared like a sucking dove we would have him only to silence that awful boatswain said gerald and as to the little cigaretta she is a born prima donna  your miranda  are you content with her said his aunt  she is to the manner born  lovely voice acts like a dragon and has an instinct how to stand and how to hold her hands  coming in drolly with her prim dress and bearing  though she was dreadfully frightened said lance  being halfforeign accounts for something i suppose but it is odd how she reminds me of some one no doubt it is of some singer at a concert  what did they say was her name  ludmilla schnetterling the little butterfly they call her  foreign on both sides apparently said gerald  those dainty ankles never were bred on english clods  i wonder what her mother is said mrs grinstead  by the bye i think it must have been her mother that i saw that morning when little felix dragged me to a cigarshop in quest of an ornamental crab—a handsome slatternly hag sort of woman who might have been on the stage said lance  sells fishingtackle twine all sorts came from adrian  have you been there asked his sister rather disturbed  of course  all the fellows go  it is the jolliest place for—he paused a moment—candies and gingerbeer  i should have thought there were nicer places sighed anna  you have yet to learn that there is a period of life when it is a joy to slip out of as much civilization as possible said lance putting his sentence in involved form so as to be the less understood by the boys  did you say that flight had got hold of them asked clement  hardly  they are rcs it seems and as to the mother butterfly i should think there was not much to get hold of in her but mrs henderson takes interest in her marbleworkers and the girl is the sort of refined impressible creature that one longs to save if possible  tomorrow i am going to put you all through your parts master gerald so dont you be out of the way  one submits to ones fate said gerald hoping that virtue may be its own reward as it is in the matter of the inspectors tour which the censor accepts really enthusiastically for a paper though the mousetrap would have found it—what shall i say—a weasel in their snare  does it indeed cried anna delighted  i saw there was a letter by this last post  aye—invites more from the same pen he replied lazily  too much of weasel for the pursuivant even said geraldine  yes said lance these young things are apt to tear our old traps and flags to pieces  by the bye who is this captain armytage who happily will limit purser briggs to we split we split we split or something analogous  i believe said gerald that he joined the willsofthewisp that company which was got up by sir lewis willingham and played at devereux castle a year or two ago  some one told me they were wonderfully effective for amateurs  that explains the acquaintance with lady merrifield said mrs grinstead  oh yes said anna  mysie told me all about it and how mr david merrifield married the nicest of them all and how much they liked this captain armytage  was not mysie there when he arrived  no she was gone to see the henderson children but gillian looked a whole sheaf of daggers at him  you know what black brows gillian has and she drew them down like thunder and anna imitated as well as her fair open brows would permit turning as red as fire all the time  that certainly means something said geraldine laughing  i should like to see gillian in love laughed anna and i really think she is afraid of it she looked so fierce  the next evening there was time for a grand review in the parish schoolroom of all possible performers on the spot  in the midst however a sudden fancy flashed across lancelot that there was something curiously similar between those two young people who occupied the stage or what was meant to be such  their gestures corresponded to one another their voices had the same ring and their eyes wore almost of the same dark colour  now geralds eyes had always been the only part of him that was not underwood and had never quite accorded with his fair complexion  hungarian i suppose said lance to himself but he was not quite satisfied  what struck him as strange was that though dreadfully shy and frightened when off the stage as soon as she appeared upon it though not yet in costume she seemed to lose all consciousness that she was not mona  perhaps mrs henderson could have told him  her husband being manager and partner at mr whites marble works she had always taken great interest in the young women employed had actually attended to their instruction assisted in judging of their designs and used these business relations to bring them into inner contact with her so that her influence had become very valuable  she was at the little room which she still kept at the office when there was a knock at the door and miss schnetterling begged to speak to her she felt particularly tender towards the girl who was evidently doing her best in a trying and dangerous position and after the first words it came out—  oh mrs henderson do you think i must be mona  have you any real objection lydia  mr flight and all of them seem to wish it  yes and i cant bear not to oblige mr flight who has been so good so good cried lydia with a foreign gesture clasping her hands  indeed perhaps my mother would not let me off  that is what frightens me  but if you or some real lady could put me aside they could not object  i do not understand you my dear  you would meet with no unpleasantness from any one concerned and you can be with the fairy children  are you shy  you were not so in the fairy scenes last winter—you acted very nicely  oh yes i liked it then  it carries me away but—oh i am afraid  please tell me my dear  lydia lowered her voice  i must tell you mrs henderson mother was a singer in public once and a dancer and oh they were so cruel to her beat her and starved her and illused her  she used to tell me about it when i was very little but now i have grown older and the people like my voice she is quite changed  she wants me to go and sing at the herringandahalf but i wont i wont—among all the tipsy men that was why she would not let me be a pupilteacher and why she will not see a priest  and now—now i am sure she has a plan in her head  if i do well at this operetta and people like me i am sure she will get the man at the circus to take me by force perhaps and then it would be all her life over again and i know that was terrible  poor ludmilla burst into tears  nay if she suffered so much she would not wish to expose you to the same  i dont know  she is in trouble about the shop—the cigars  oh i should not have told  you wont—you wont—mrs henderson  no you need not fear i have nothing to do with that  i dont think lydia whispered again that she cares for me as she used to do when i was a little thing  now that i care for my duty and all that you and mr flight have taught me she is angry and laughs at english notions  i was in hopes when i came to work here that my earnings would have satisfied her but they dont and i dont seem to get on  mrs henderson could not say that her success was great but she ventured as much as to tell her that captain henderson could prevent any attempt to send her away without her consent  oh but if my mother went too you could not hinder it  are you sixteen my dear  then you could not be taken against your will  not till december  and oh that gentleman the conductor he knew all about it i could see and by and by i saw him lingering about the shop as if he wanted to watch me  mr lancelot underwood  oh my dear you need not be afraid of him he is a brother of mrs grinsteads a connection of miss mohuns and though he is such a musician it is quite as an amateur  but lydia i do think that if you sing your best he may very likely be able to put you in a way to make your talent available so as to satisfy your mother without leading to anything so undesirable and dangerous as a circus  then you think i ought—  it is a dangerous thing to give advice but really my dear i do think more good is likely to come of this than harm     chapter xiii  two sides of a shield again    the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale                           midsummer nights dream   the earlier proofs of the mousetrap were brought by lance who had spent more time in getting them into shape than his wife approved and they were hailed with rapture by the young ladies on seeing themselves for the first time in print  as to gerald he had so long been bred—as it were—to journalism that young as he was he had caught the trick and the inspectors tour had not only been welcomed by the censor but portions had been copied into other papers and there was a proposal of publishing it in a separate brochure  it would have made the fortune of the mousetrap if it had not been so contrary to its principles and it had really been sent to them in mischief together with the girton girl of which some were proud though when she saw it in print with a lyre and wreath on the page sober mysie looked grave  do you think it profane to parody jane taylor said gerald  no but i thought it might hurt some peoples feelings and discourage them if we laugh at the high school  why dolores goes to give lectures there exclaimed valetta  nobody is discouraged by a little goodhumoured banter said gillian  nobody with any stuff in them  there must be some training in chaff though said gerald or they dont know how to take it  and in point of fact said dolores the upper tradesmens daughters come off with greater honours in the high school than do the young gentlewomen  very wholesome for the young philistines said gerald  the daughters of selfmade men may well surpass in energy those settled on their lees  gerald and dolores were standing with their backs to the wall of anscombe church which jasper merrifield and mysie were zealously photographing the others helping—or hindering  i thought upper tradesfolk were the essence of philistines returned dolores  the elder generation—especially if he is the son of the energetic man  the younger are more open to ideas  the stolid conservative is the one who has grown up while his father was making his fortune the third generation used to be the gentleman now he is the man who is tired of it  tired of it aye with a sigh  why you are a man with a pedigree she returned  pedigrees dont hinder—what shall i call it—the sense of being fettered  one lives in fetters she exclaimed  and the better one likes ones home the harder it is to shake them off  he turned and looked full at her then exclaimed exactly and paused adding i wonder what you want  has it a form  oh yes i mean to give lectures  i should like to see the world and study physical science in every place then tell the next about it  i read all i can and i think i shall get consent to give some elementary lectures at the high school though uncle jasper does not half like it but i must get some more training to do the thing rightly  i thought of university college  could you get me any information about it  easily but youll have to conquer the horror of the elders  i know  they think one must learn atheism and all sorts of things there  you might go in for physical science at oxford or cambridge  i expect that is all my father would allow  in spite of the colonies he has all the old notions about women and would do nothing aunt lily really protested against  you are lucky to have a definite plan and notion to work for  now fate was so unkind as to make me a country squire and not only that but one bound down like gulliver among the liliputians with all manner of cords by all the dear good excellent folks who look on that old mediaeval den with a kind of fetishworship sprung of their having been kept out of it so long and it would be an utter smash of all their hearts if i uttered a profane word against it  i would as soon be an ancient egyptian drowning a cat as move a stone of it  it is a lovely sort of ancient pompeii good to look at now and then but not to be bound down to  like beechcroft court a fossil  it is very well there are such places  yes but not to be the hope of them  it is my luck  if my eldest uncle who had toiled in a booksellers shop all his youth and reigned like a little king had not gone and got killed in a boating accident there he would be the ruling sir roger de coverley of the county a pillar of church and state and i should be a free man  wont they let you go about and see everything  oh yes i am welcome to do a little globetrotting  they are no fools if they were i should not care half so much but wherever i went there would be a series of jerks from my string and not having an integument of rhinoceros hide i could not disregard them without a sore more raw than i care to carry about  after all it is only a globe and one gets back to the same place again  men have so many openings  im not rich enough for parliament and if i were maybe it would be worse for their hearts he said with a sigh  theres journalism a great power  yes but to put my name to all i could—and long to say—would be an equal horror to the dear folks  yet you are helping on this concern  true but partly pour passer le temps partly because i really want to hear the outlaws isle performed and all under protest that the windmill will soon be swept away by the stream  indeed yes cried dolores  they hope to regulate the stream they might as well hope to regulate mississippi  wellchosen simile  the current is slow and sluggish but irresistible  better than stagnating or sticking fast in the mud  though the mud may be full of fair blossoms and sweet survivals said gerald sadly  oh yes people in the old grooves are delightful said dolores but one cant live like them with a heart in g f s like my aunt jane really the cleverest of any of us  or like mysie not stupid but wrapped up in her classes just scratching the surface now if i went in for good works i would go to the bottom—down to the slums  slums are ones chief interest said gerald but no doubt it will soon be the same story over and over and only make one wish—  what  that there could be a revolution before i am of age  whats that cried primrose coming up as he spoke  a revolution  yes guillotines and all to cut off your head in rotherwood park said gerald lightly  oh you dont really mean it  not that sort said dolores  only the coming of the coquecigrues  they are in the water babies said primrose mystified  each of those two liked to talk to the other as a sort of fellow captive solacing themselves with discussions over the censor and its fellows  love is not often the first thought even where it lurks in modern intellectual intercourse between man and maid and though kitty varley might giggle the others thought the idea only worthy of her  aunt jane however smelt out the notion and could not but communicate it to her sister though adding—  i dont believe in it dolores is in love with physiology and the boy with what jasper calls socialist maggots but not with each other unless they work round in some queer fashion  however lady merrifield feeling herself accountable for dolores was anxious to gather ideas about gerald from his aunt with whom she was becoming more and more intimate  she was more than twenty years the senior and the thread of connection was very slender but they suited one another so well that they had become lilias and geraldine to one another  lady merrifield had preserved her youthfulness chiefly from having had a happy home unbroken by family sorrows or carking cares and with a husband who had always taken his full share of responsibility  your nephews production has made a stir said she when they found themselves alone together  yes poor boy  then answering the tone rather than the words i suppose it is the lot of one generation to be startled by the next there is a good deal of change in the outlook  yes said lady merrifield  the young ones especially the youngest seem to have a set of notions of their own that i cannot always follow  exactly said geraldine eagerly  you feel the same  to begin with the laws of young ladyhood— maidenliness—are a good deal relaxed—  there i am not much of a judge  i never had any young ladyhood but i own that the few times i went out with anna i have been surprised and more surprised at what i heard from her sister emily  what we should have thought simply shocking being tolerated now  just so and we are viewed as old duennas for not liking it  i should say however that it is not or has not been a personal trouble with me  annas passion is for her uncle clement and she has given up the season on his account though lady travis underwood was most anxious to have her and as to emily though she is obliged to go out sometimes she hates it and has a soul set on slums and nursing  you mean that the style of gaieties revolts a niceminded girl  partly  perhaps such as the travis underwoods used to take part in rather against their own likings poor things are much less restrained for the young people than what would come in your daughters way  perhaps though lady rotherwood has once or twice in countryhouses had to protect her daughter to the great disgust of the other young people  that is one development that it is hard to meet for it is difficult to know where oldfashioned distaste is the motive and where the real principle of modesty  though to me the question is made easy for sir jasper would never hear of cricket for his daughters scarcely of hunting and we have taken away valetta and primrose from the dancingclasses since skirtdancing has come in but i fear val thinks it hard  such things puzzle my sisters at vale leston  they are part of the same spirit of independence that sends girls to hospitals or medical schools  or colleges or lecturing  dolores is wild to lecture and i see no harm in her trying her wings at the high school on some safe subject if her father in new zealand does not object though i am glad it has not occurred to any of my own girls  sir jasper would not like it  certainly not but if my brother consents he will not mind it for dolores  she is a good girl in the main but even mine have very different ideals from what we had  please tell me  i see it a little and i have been thinking about it  well perhaps you will laugh but my ideal work was sundayschools  are not they miss mohuns ideal still  oh yes infinitely developed and so they are my cousin florences— lady florence devereux but the young ones think them behind the times  i remember when every girl believed her children the prettiest and cleverest in nature showed off her sundayschool as her pride and treasure and composed small pink books about them where the catastrophe was either being killed by accident or going to live in the clergymans nursery  now those that teach do so simply as a duty and not a romance  and the difficulty is to find those who will teach said geraldine one thing is that the children really require better teaching  that is quite true  my girls show me their preparation work and i see much that i should not have thought of teaching the beechcroft children  but all the excitement of the matter has gone off  i know  the vale leston girls do it as their needful work not with their hearts and enthusiasm  i expect an enthusiasm cannot be expected to last above a generation and perhaps a half  very likely  a more indifferent thing you will laugh but my enthusiasm was for chivalry christian chivalry half symbolic history was delightful to me for the search for true knights  i had lists of them drawings if possible but i never could indoctrinate anybody with my affection  either history is only a lesson or they know a great deal too much and will prove to you that the cid was a ruffian and the black prince not much better  and are you allowed the idylls of the king  under protest now that the mousetrap has adopted browning for weekly reading and discussion  tennyson is almost put on the same shelf with scott whom i love better than ever  is it progress  well i suppose it is in a way  but is it the right way  thats what i want to see  now listen  when our young men my brothers—especially my very dear brother claude and his contemporaries rotherwood is the only one left—were at oxford they got raised into a higher atmosphere and came home with beautiful plans and hopes for the church and drew us up with them but now the university seems just an ordeal for faith to go through  i should think there was less of outward temptation but more of subtle trial  and then the whole system has altered since the times you are speaking of when the old rules prevailed and the great giants of church renewal were there said geraldine  you belong to the generation whom they trained and who are now passing away  my father was one who grew up then  we live on their spirit still  i hope so  i never knew much about cambridge till clement went there but it had the same influence on him  indeed all our home had that one thought ever since i can remember  clement and lance grew up in it  but you will forgive me  these younger men either go very very much further than we older ones dreamt of or they have flaws in their faith and sometimes—which is the strangest difficulty—the vehement observance and ritual with flaws beneath in their faith perhaps or their loyalty—socialist fancies  there is impatience said geraldine  the church progress has not conquered all the guilt and misery in the world  who said it would  none of us but these younger ones fancy it is the churchs fault instead of that of her members failures and so they try to walk in the light of the sparks that they have kindled  altruism as they call it—love of the neighbour without love of god  it may lead that way  does it  perhaps we are the impatient ones now said geraldine in disliking the young ones experiments and wanting to bind them to our own views  then you look on with toleration but with distrust  distrust of myself as well as of the young ones and trying not to forget that one good custom may corrupt the world so it may be as well that the pendulum should swing  the pendulum but not its axis—faith  no and of my boys mainspring of faith i do feel sure and of his real upright steadiness  lady merrifield asked no more but could wait  but is not each generation a terra incognita to the last  a question which those feel most decidedly who stand on the borderland of both with love and sympathy divided between the old and the new clinging to the one and fearing to alienate the other     chapter xiv  butterflys nectar    if you heed my warning it will save you much—a a proctor   clement underwood was so much better as to be arrived at taking solitary rides and walks these suiting him better than having companions as he liked to go his own pace and preferred silence his sister had become much engrossed with her painting and saw likewise that in this matter of exercise it was better to let him go his own way and he declared that this time of thought and reading was an immense help to him restoring that balance of life which he seemed to himself to have lost in the whirl of duties at st matthews after felixs death  the shore with the fresh monotonous plash of the waves when the tide served was his favourite resort  he could stand still and look out over the expanse of ripples or wander on as he pleased watching the seagulls float along—             as though lifes only call and care              were graceful motion   there had been a somewhat noisy luncheon for edward harewood a midshipman in the channel fleet which was hovering in the offing had come over on a days leave with horner a messmate whose parents lived in the town  he was a big lad a year older than gerald and as soon as a little awe of uncle clement and aunt cherry had worn off he showed himself of the original harewood type directing himself chiefly to what he meant to be teasing gerald about vale leston and penbeacon  all the grouse there were on the bit of moor are snapped up  very likely said gerald coolly  those precious surveyors and engineers that walsh brings down can give an account of them  as soon as you come of age youll have to double your staff of keepers i can tell you  guardians of ferae naturae said gerald  i thought your father did all that was required in that line said clement  not since duffers and landlubbers have been marauding over penbeacon—aye and elsewhere  what would you say to an engineer poaching away one of the august house of vanderkist  the awful cad  id soon show him what i thought of his cheek cried adrian with a flourish of his knife  ha ha  i bet that he will be shooting over ironbeam park long before you are of age  i shall shoot him then cried adrian  not improbably there will be nothing else to shoot by that time quietly said gerald  i shall have a keeper in every lodge and bring up four or five hundred pheasants every year boasted the little baronet quite alive to the pride of possession though he had never seen ironbeam in his life  edward laughed a dont you wish you may get it and the others who knew very well the futility of the poor boys expectations even if geralds augury were not fulfilled hastened to turn away the conversation to plans for the afternoon  anna asked the visitor if he would ride out with her and gerald to clipstone or to the moor and was relieved when he declined saying he had promised to meet horner  you will come in to tea at five said his aunt and bring him if you like  thanks awfully but we hardly can  we have to start from the quay at six sharp  all had gone their several ways and clement after the heat of the day was pacing towards a secluded cove out of an inner bay which lay nearer than anscombe cove but was not much frequented  however he smelt tobacco and heard sounds of boyish glee and presently saw adrian and fergus merrifield barelegged digging in the mud  ha youngsters  do you know the tide has turned  i thought you had had enough of that  i thought i might find my aralia sighed fergus  the tide was almost as low  just then there resounded from behind a projecting rock a peal of undesirable singing a shout of laughter and an oath with—  holloa those little beasts of teetotallers have hooked it  there were confused cries—haul em back  drench em  give em a roll in the mud and adrian shrank behind his uncle taking hold of his coat as there burst from behind the rock a party of boys headed by the two cadets all shouting loudly till brought to a sudden standstill by the sight of parson  by jove as the horner mid muttered taking out his pipe while edward harewood mumbled something about horners brothers tuckout  one or two other boys were picking up the remains of the feast which had been on lobsters jam tarts clotted cream and the like delicacies dear to the juvenile mind  the two biggest schoolboys came forward one voluble and thick of speech about horners tuckout and i assure you sir it is nothing—not a taste  never thought of such—  just then the other lad staggering about had almost lurched over into the deepening channel but clement caught him by the collar and held him fast demanding in a low voice very terrible to his hearers—  where does this poor boy live  it was adrian who answered  devereux buildings  you two adrian and fergus run to the quay and fetch a cab as near this place as it can come said clement  you little fellows you had better run home at once  i hope you will take warning by the shame and disgrace of this spectacle  the boys were glad enough to disperse being terrified by the condition of the prisoner as well as by the detection but the two who were encumbered with the baskets containing the bottles jam pots and tin of cream remained and so did the two young sailors horner saying civilly—  youll not be hard on the kids sir for just a spree carried a little too far  i certainly shall not be hard on the children whom you seem to have tempted was the answer as they moved along and as the younger horner turned towards a little shop near the end of the steps to restore the goods he asked—were you supplied from hence  yes said horner who was perhaps hardly sober enough for caution mother butterfly is a jolly old soul  looking up  clement saw no licence to sell spirituous liquors under the name of sarah schnetterling tobacconist  the window had the placard ici on parle francais and was adorned in a tasteful manner with ornamental pipes fishingrods and flies jars of sweets sheets of foreign stamps pictorial advertisements of innocuous beverages a woman with black grizzling hair fashionably dressed flashing dark eyes long gold earrings gold beads and gaudy attire came out to reclaim her property  a word or two passed about payment during which clement had a strange thrill of puzzled recollection  the bottles bore the labels of raspberry vinegar and lemonade but he had seen too much not to say—  you drive a dangerous trade  ah sir young people will be gourmands she said with a foreign accent  ah that poor young gentleman is very ill  will he not come in and lie down to recover  no thank you said clement  a carriage is coming to take him home  something about the fat in the fire was passing between the cadets and the younger of them began to repeat that he had come for his brothers birthday and that he feared they had brought the youngsters into a scrape by carrying the joke too far  i have nothing to say to you sir said the vicar of st matthews looking very majestic except that it is time you were returning to your ship  as to you turning to edward harewood i can only say that if you are aware of the peculiar circumstances of adrian vanderkist your conduct can only be called fiendish  fergus and adrian came running up with tidings that the cab was waiting  edward harewood stood sullen but the other lad said—  unlucky  we are sorry to have got the little fellows into trouble  he held out his hand and clement did not refuse it as he did that of his own nephew  still there was a certain satisfaction at his heart as he beheld the clear honest young faces of the other two boys and he bade adrian run home and wait for him saying to fergus—   you seem to have been a good friend to my little nephew  thank you  fergus coloured up speechless between pleasure at the warm tone of commendation and the obligations of schoolboy honour nor with young campbell on their hands was there space for questions  that youth subsided into a heavy doze in the cab and so continued till the arrival at no 7 devereux buildings where a capablelooking maidservant opened the door and he was deposited into her hands the vicar leaving his card with his present address but feeling equal to nothing more and hardly able to speak  he drove home finding his nephew in the doorway  signing to the maid to pay the driver and to the boy to follow him he reached his study and sank into his easychair adrian opening frightened eyes and saying—  ill call sibby  no—that bottle—drop to there signing to the mark on the glass with his nail  after a pause while he held fast the boy so to speak with his eyes he said—  thank you dear lad  uncle clement said adrian then we werent doing anything merrifield thought his old bit of auralia or whatever he calls it was there  i saw—i saw my boy  to find you—as you were made me most thankful  you must have resisted  tell me were you of this party or did you come on them by accident  horner asked me said adrian twisting from one leg to another  clement saw the crisis was come which he had long expected and rejoiced at the form it had taken though he knew he should suffer from pursuing the subject  adrian he said i am much pleased with you  i dont want to get you into a row but i should be much obliged if you would tell me how all this happened  it wouldnt returned adrian but for that ted and the other chap  do you mean that there would have been none of this—drinking—but for them  dont be afraid to tell me all  was the stuff all got from that mrs schnetter—  mother butterflys  oh yes  she keeps bottles of grog with those labels and it is such a lark for her to be even with the gangers that our fellows generally get some after cricket or for a tuck out  not fergus merrifield  oh no hes captain you know but he is two years younger than campbell and horner and they cant bear him and when he made a jaw about it—he can jaw awfully you know—and he is stuck up and horner major swore he would make him know his bearings—  i wonder he was there at all  well horner asked him and he cant get those fossils that were lost out of his head and he thought they might be washed up  he said too he knew they would be up to something if he wasnt there  oh said clement with an odd recollection but i suppose he did not know about these cadets  no the big horner sent up to mother butterflys for some more stuff not so mild and then ted set upon me and said it was all because of me that vale leston had to live like a boiling of teetotal frogs and toads just to please the little baronets lady mamma but i was a dutchman all the same and should sell them yet—i sucked it in so well and they talked of seeing how much i could stand something about my governor and here—that word in the catechism  ah gasped clement fairly clutching his arm and what spared you  horner came down and sweetie bob thats the errandboy and there was a bother about the money for bob wasnt to leave anything without being paid and while they were jawing about that merry laid hold of me and said come and look for the aralia  they got to shouting and singing and i dont think they saw what was doing they were nasty songs and merry touched me and said let us go after the aralia  we got away without their missing us at first but they ran after us when they found it out and if you had not been there uncle clem—  thank god i was  now adrian first tell me did you taste this stuff  you said you sucked it in  well i did a little  you know uncle one cannot always be made a baby  women dont understand you know and dont know what a fool it makes a man to have them always after him and have everything put out of his way like a precious infant and people drinking it on the sly like gerald or—  or me eh adrian  i can tell you that i never tasted it for thirty years and now only as a medicine  lance never  but they did not treat you like a baby and never let you see so much as a glass of beer  well i am going to treat you like a man but it is a sorrowful history that i have to tell you  you know that your mother and aunt wilmet are twin sisters   oh yes though aunt wilmet is stout and jolly and mother ever so much prettier and more delicate and nice  yes from illhealth  she is never free from suffering  i know  old dr may said there was no help for it  do you know what caused that illhealth  my boy they spoke of your father today—brutes that they were he could not help muttering  yes he died when i was a week old  he had ruined himself when quite a young man body soul and estate—and you too beforehand in estate and broken your mothers heart and health by being given up to that miserable habit from which we want to save you  i thought it was only poor men that got drunk and beat their wives more knowledge by the bye than he was supposed to possess  he did not beat her  oh no no said clement but he as surely destroyed all her happiness and made you and your sisters very poor for your station in life so that it is really hard to educate you and you will have to work for yourself and them  and at only thirtysix years old his life was cut off  was that what d t meant  i heard ted whisper something about that  it was well thought clement that he had grace enough to whisper yes my poor boy it is only too true  i was sent for to find your father dying of delirium tremens—you just born your mother nearly dead the desolation of your sisters unspeakable  he was only thirtysix and that vice together with racing had devoured him and all the property that should have come to his children  i think he tried to repent at the very last but there was little time little power only he put you and your sisters in my charge and begged me to save you from being like him  did they mean that i was sure to be like that  like a pointer puppy pointing  they meant it  and adrian it is so far true that there is an inheritance—with some more with some less—of our forefathers nature  some have tendencies harder to repress than others  but my dear boy you know that we all have had a force given us wherewith to repress and conquer those tendencies and that we can  when we were baptized god the holy spirit said adrian under his breath  you know it you can believe now  your uncle lance and i prayed that the old nature might be put down the new raised up  we pray your mother and sisters have prayed ever since that so it may be that you may conquer any evil tendencies that may be in you but adrian no one can save you from the outside if you do not strive yourself  now you see why your poor mother has been so anxious to keep all temptation out of your reach  but im growing a man now  i cant always go on so  no you cant  you shall be treated as a man while you are with me but i do very seriously advise you—nay i entreat of you not to begin taking any kind of liquor for it would incite the taste to grow upon you till it might become uncontrollable and be your tyrant  if you have reason to think the pledge would be a protection to you come to me or to uncle bill  he was interrupted by sibby coming in with his cup of tea and—  now mr clement whatever have you been after now  up to your antics the minute miss cherry is out of the way  aye ye neednt go to palavering me  i hear it in your breath and she darted at the stimulant  ive had some sibby since i came in  more reason you should have it now  get off with you sir adrian dont be worriting him  now drink that sir and dont speak another word  he was glad to obey  he wanted to think in much thankfulness for the present and in faith and love which brought hope for the future     chapter xv  a poor foreign widow    art thou a magistrate  then be severe—george herbert   early in the day general mohun received a note from clement underwood begging him to look in at st andrews rock as soon as might be convenient  ah said his sister i strongly suspect something wrong about the boys  fergus was very odd and silent last night when i asked him about jem horners picnic and he said something about that harewood cousin being an unmitigated brute  i hope fergus was not in a scrape  oh no it is not his way  his geology is a great safeguard  if it had been wilfred i might have been afraid  his head is full—at least as much room as the lost aralia leaves— of the examination for the winchester college election  yes you know jasper has actually promised gillian that if either of her brothers gets a scholarship she may be allowed a year at lady margaret hall  yes it incited her to worry wilfred beyond sufferance in his holidays  i know if you or lily had been always at me i should have kicked as hard as he does  lily herself can hardly cram him with his holiday task but fergus is a good little fellow  you have kept him at it in a more judgmatical way  but wont armytage come in between the damsel and her college  poor mr armytage—captain i believe for he has got his commandership  gill snubs him desperately  i believe she is afraid of herself and her heart  i hope she wont be a goose  jasper told me that he is an excellent fellow and it will be an absolute misfortune if the girl is besotted enough to refuse him  girls have set up a foolish prejudice against matrimony  well i am off  clement underwood is a reasonable man and would not send for me without cause  general mohun came to that opinion when he heard of the scene on the beach and of the absolute certainty that the contraband goods had been procured at mrs schnetterlings  before his visit was over a note came down on goldedged cyphered pink paper informing the reverend e c underwood that mrs campbell was much obliged to him for his attention to her son who was very unwell entirely from the effects of clotted cream  and while they were still laughing over the scored words anna knocked at the door with a message from her aunt to ask whether they could come and speak to poor mrs edgar who was in a dreadful state  it is not about adrian i hope said she  oh no no my dear adrian is all right thanks to fergus again said her uncle  he is the boys great protector i only wish they could be always together  poor mrs edgar  rumours had not been slow in reaching her of the condition in which her scholars had been found very odd rumours too one that james campbell had been brought home insensible and the two sailors carried on board in the like state and an opposite report that the poor dear boys had only made themselves sick with dainties out of mrs schnetterlings and it was all a cruel notion of that teetotal ritualist clergyman  some boys would not speak others were vague and contradictory and many knew nothing horner and campbell were absent  clement much relieved her by giving an account of the matter and declaring that he feared his own elder nephew was the cause of all the scandal though he believed that some of her bigger pupils were guilty of obtaining a smaller quantity knowingly of the schnetterlings illicit wares chiefly so far for the fun of doing something forbidden—stolen waters are sweet  a wicked woman  surely she should not be allowed to go on  i am going on the spot to see what can be done said general mohun but indeed i should have thought young campbell rather too old for your precincts  ah yes  he is troublesome but he is so backward and is so delicate that his mother has implored me to keep him on that he may have seabathing  but this shall be the final stroke  it will be the ruin of your school otherwise said the general  ah it might  and yet mrs campbell will never be persuaded of the fact  and she is a person of much influence  however i cannot have my poor dear little fellows led astray  then with some decided praises of dear little sir adrian and regrets at losing fergus merrifield whom she declared on the authority of her gentleman assistant to be certain of success she departed and clement resumed his task of writing letters which he believed to be useless but which he felt to be rightone a grave warning to edward harewood and one to his father whose indulgence he could not but hold accountable  reginald mohun meanwhile went his way to the officer of inland revenue who already had his suspicions as to mrs schnetterling and was glad of positive evidence  he returned with the general to hear from mr underwood the condition in which he had found the boys and the cause he had for attributing it to the supplies from mother butterfly and this was thought sufficient evidence to authorize the sending a constable with a searchwarrant to the shop  the two gentlemen were glad that the detection should be possible without either sending a spy or forcing evidence from the boys who had much better be kept out of the matter altogether  no lack of illicit stores was found when the policemen made their descent and a summons was accordingly served on its mistress to appear at the next petty sessions  reginald mohun used to the justice of county magistrates and the unflinching dealings of courtsmartial was determined to see the affair through so he went to the magistrates meeting and returned with the tidings that the possession of smuggled tobacco ready for sale had been proved against mrs schnetterling and she had been fined twentyfive pounds to be paid at the next petty sessions otherwise goods would be seized to that value or she would have a short term of imprisonment  there was no doubt that contraband spirits were also found but it was not thought expedient to press this charge  he said the poor woman had been in a great passion of despair wringing her hands and weeping demonstratively  quite theatrical he said  i am sure she has been an actress  it did not prejudice your hardheaded towncouncillors in her favour said gerald  far from it  in fact old simmonds observed that she was a painted foreign jezebel  not to her face said gerald  we are not quite brutes whatever you may think us my boy said the general goodhumouredly  well said gerald in the same tone how could i tell how it might be when the philistines conspired to hunt down a poor foreign widow trying to pick up a scanty livelihood   if the poor foreign widow had been content without corrupting the boys said clement she would have been let alone  it was not for corrupting the boys  that was done—or not done—by my amiable cousin ted  what harm did her baccy do to living soul  it is a risky thing to say the least of it for a living soul to defraud the revenue said clement  of which probably she never heard  she must have seen the terms of her licence said the general  aye a way of increasing the revenue by burthens on the chief solace of poverty said gerald hotly  youll come to your senses by and by young man imperturbably answered the general  is she likely to be able to pay asked gerald in return  oh yes the policeman said she drove a very thriving trade both with the boys and with the sailors and that there was no doubt that she could pay  clement was very glad to hear it for it not only obviated any sense of harshness in his mind but he thought gerald in his present mood of compassionor opposition whichever it was—capable of offering to undertake to pay the fine for her  poor little ludmilla was found the next day by mrs henderson crying softly over her work at the mosaic department—work which was only the mechanical arrangement from patterns provided for she had no originality and would never attain to any promotion in the profession  mrs henderson took the poor girl to her own little office to try to comfort her and bring her into condition for the rehearsal of the scene with ferdinand which she was to go through in mr flights parlour chaperoned by his mother  she was so choked with sobs that it did not seem probable that she would have any voice for she had been struggling with her tears all day and now in the presence of her friend she gave them a free course  she thought it so cruel—so very cruel of the gentlemen how could they do such a thing to a poor helpless stranger  and that tall one—to be a clergyman—how could he  mrs henderson tried to represent that having accepted the licence on certain terms it was wrong to break them and that the gentlemen must be right to hinder harm to their nephews  it seemed all past the poor girls understanding since the nephews had taken no harm and indeed the other boys had only touched the spirits by way of joke and doing something forbidden it had all come of those horrid young midshipmen who had come down and worried and bothered her mother into giving them the bottles of spirits which had not been mixed  it was very hard  ah lydia one sin leads no one knows where  those little boys think of their first learning the taste for alcohol in secret  lydia did see this but after all she said it was not the spirits but the tobacco which the dutch and american sailors were glad enough to exchange for her mothers commodities  she had never perceived any harm in the arrangement and hardly comprehended when the saying custom to whom custom was pointed out to her  kalliope asked whether the fine would fall heavily on her mother  oh that is worst of all  mother is gone to avoncester to raise the money  she wont tell me how  and i do believe olearys circus is there  then came another sobbing fit  but how—what do you mean my dear  oleary was our clown when my father—my dear father—was alive he was a coarse horrid man as cruel to the poor dear horses as he dared  and now he has set up for himself and has been going about all over the county  mother has been quite different ever since she met him one day in avoncester and i fear—oh i fear he will advance her this money and make her give me up to him and my dear father made her promise that i would never be on the boards  this was in an agony of crying and it appeared that schnetterling had really been a very decent amiable person who had been passionately fond of his little daughter  her recollection dated from the time when the family had come from america and he had become partner in a circus intending to collect means enough to retire to a home in germany but he had died five years ago at avoncester of fever and his wife had used his savings to set up this little shop at rockquay choosing that place because it was the resort of foreign tradingvessels with whom her knowledge of languages would be available  she had suffered from the same illness and her voice had been affected at the time and she was altogether subdued and altered and had allowed her daughter to receive a good national school training but with the recovery of health activity and voice a new temper or rather the old one renewed had seized her and since she had met her former companion ludmilla foreboded that the impulse of wandering had come upon her and that if the interference of the authorities pressed upon her and endangered her traffic she would throw it up altogether and drag her daughter into the profession so dreadful to all the poor childs feelings  no wonder that the girl cried till she had no voice and took but partial comfort from repeated assurances that her friends would do their utmost on her behalf  mrs henderson tried to compose and cheer her walking with her herself to st kenelms parsonage and trying to keep up her earnest desire to please mr flight the special object of her veneration  but wishes were ineffectual to prevent her from breaking down in the first line of her first song and when mr flight blamed and lady flight turned round on the musicstool to say severely—command yourself lydia she became almost hysterical  wait a minute said gerald  give her a glass of wine and she will be better  oh no no please im temp— and a sob  the five oclock tea was still standing on a little table and gerald poured out a cup and took it to her then set her down in an arm chair and said—  ill go through angus part and she will be better and as she tried to say thank you and so kind he held up his hand and told her to be silent  in fact his encouragement and the little delay he had made enabled her to recover herself enough to get through her part though nothing like as well as would have been expected of her  never mind said gerald she will be all right when my uncle comes  wont you mona  i should have expected— began lady flight  gerald held up his hand in entreaty  peoples voices cant be always the same he said cheerily  i know our mona will do us credit yet  wont you mona  you know how to pity me with my logs  you had better go and have some tea in the kitchen lydia said lady flight repressively and ludmilla curtsied herself off with a look of gratitude out of her swollen eyelids at gerald  poor little mortal he said as she went  i am afraid that in her case summum jus was summa injuria  it was quite right to prosecute that mischievous woman said mr flight  maybe said gerald but wheat will grow alongside of tares  i hope the girl is wheat half ironically and severely said the lady  gerald shrugged his shoulders and took his leave     chapter xvi  see the conquering hero comes    and with trumpets and with banners as becomes gintale good manners—thackeray   a telegram from sir jasper brought the good news that ferguss name was high on the winchester roll and that he was sure of entering college after the holidays  gillian alone was allowed to go up to the station with her uncle reginald to meet the travellers lest the whole family should be too demonstrative in their welcome  and at the same time there emerged from the train not only captain armytage but also lancelot underwood and his little boy  all the rest of his family were gone to stoneborough to delight the hearts of dr may and his daughter ethel  gillian was in such training that she durst not embrace her brother when he tumbled out of the carriage though she could hardly keep her feet from dancing but she only demurely said—  mamma and all of them are at aunt janes  come then said sir jasper to captain armytage for which gillian was not grateful or thought herself not for she made a wry face  there was a good deal of luggage—theatrical appliances to be sent to the pavilion  this may as well go too said captain armytage  oh oh  it is the buccaneers sword cried little felix  how lovely  last time we only had uncle jacks and this is ever so much longer  do let me draw it cried fergus  not here my boy or they would think a conspiracy was breaking out ha as a sudden blare of trumpets broke out as they reached the station gate  oh is it for him cried felix who had been instructed in ferguss triumph            see the conquering hero comes           sound the trumpets beat the drums   said the general  fergus actually coloured crimson but the colour was deepened as he muttered bosh while two piebald ponies drawing the drummers and trumpeters in fantastic raiment preceded an elephant shrouded in scarlet and gold trappings with two or three figures making contortions on his back and followed by a crowned and sceptred dame in blue white and gold perched aloft on a car drawn by four steeds in glittering caparisons  will you mount it fergus asked his uncle  you did not expect such a demonstration  fergus bit his lip  it was hard to be teased instead of exalted but fely and he were absorbed in the pink broadsides that the lady in the car was scattering               circus—this night—rotherwood park                     the sepoys revenge                    thrilling incidents                     sagacious elephant                   dance of arab coursers                  acrobatic feats c c   oh daddy daddy do take me to see it  father i should like to see it very much indeed were the exclamations of the two little boys  you know i have never seen any acrobatic feats  a long word enough to please you said uncle reginald  he deserves something  ill take you master  i should think this was not of the first quality said sir jasper  never mind  novelty is the charm that one can have only once in ones life said the general  some of those van fellows are very decent folk said lancelot  i have seen a great deal of them at bexley fair times  you would be astonished to know how grateful they are for a little treatment as if they were not out of humanitys reach  gillian was trying to make fergus tell her what his questions had been and how he had answered them  i declare gill you are as bad as some of the boys horrid governors  there was one whose father walked him up and down and wouldnt let him play cricket and went over all the old questions with him  i should never have got in if papa hadnt had more sense than to badger me out of my life  at the gate between the copper beeches the underwoods and merrifields parted with an engagement to meet at the circus on the part of the boys and their conductors  fergus was greeted with openmouthed openarmed delight by all the assembled multitude very little checked by the presence of captain armytage  only lady merrifield did not say much but there was a dew in her eyes as she held fast the little active fingers and whispered—  my good industrious boy  sir jasper in his grand and gracious manner turned to his sister inlaw saying—  we could not but come first to you jane for it is to you that he is indebted as we all are primarily for his success  that is the greatest compliment i ever had jasper she answered smiling but almost tearful and laughing it off  i feel ready to mount yonder elephant ladys triumphal car  the general refrained from any more teasing of fergus on his first impression and at seven that evening the younger merrifield boys with their uncle and the two from st andrews rock with lance set off in high spirits  they reappeared much sooner than they were expected at beechcroft cottage where the underwoods were spending the long twilight evening  a low concern was the generals verdict  we fled simultaneously from the concluding ballet said lance there had been quite as much as we could bear for ingenuous youth  we stood the sepoys death song said the general but the poster of the bleeding bride was enough for us  they had only one elephant cried adrian  a regular swindle said wilfred  no lions added fely nothing to see but that poor old elephant i wish he would have turned round and spouted water at them as that one did to the tailor  water would be uncommonly good for them said the general laughing they are not much acquainted therewith  and such an atmosphere said lance  i see it on your forehead poor boy said geraldine  i should like to set on the society against cruelty to animals said the general i saw galls on the horses necks and they were all half starved  then to see the poor old elephant pretend to be drunk added fergus stagger about and led off by the policeman drunk and disorderly  was that being drunk asked adrian with wideopen eyes  it was like campbell that day  everybody laughed  wilfred did so now  you green kid you  happy verdure said the general to be unaware that some people can laugh when they ought to weep  weep exclaimed wilfred every time one sees a fellow screwy in the street  perhaps the angels do murmured clement  come master wilfred you have expressed your opinions sufficiently tonight said the general  suppose you and fergus walk home together  a nasty low place as ever i saw  i have a mind to tell the mayor about it  gerald said—  is not that making yourself very unpopular  that is no great matter said the general rather surprised  i should have thought it better to refine the peoples tastes than to thwart their present ones  the improper must be stopped before the taste for the proper can be promoted said clement  with all the opposition and illblood that you cause said gerald why if i were an errandboy the suppression would send me direct to the circus  would it not do the same by you uncle lance  discouragement might prohibition would prevent wholly and i should be thankful said lance  ah you are of the old loyal nature said gerald  you of the old school can never see things by modern lights  i am thankful to say—not responded reginald mohun in a tone that made some laugh and gerald sigh in annas ear—  happy those who see only one side of a question  there was another great day for the boys namely the speech or closing day at the school when fergus was the undoubted hero and was so exalted that his parents thought it would be very bad for him and were chiefly consoled by his strong and genuine dislike to having to declaim with clement varley the quarrel of brutus and cassius  he insisted on always calling the former old brute and all the efforts of mother and aunt never got him beyond the dogged repetition of a lesson learnt by heart whereas little varley threw himself into the part with spirit that gained all the applause  fergus carried off a pile of prizes too but despised them  stupid old poetry said he what should i do with that  do let me change it father for the handbook of paleontology or something worth having  adrian had three prizes too filling anna with infinite delight  he was not to go home immediately on the breakup of the school but was to wait for his sisters who were coming in a few days more with lady travis underwood to the bazaar and masque so that he would go home with them  neither the prospect nor the company of little fely greatly reconciled him to the delay but his mother could not believe that her darling could travel alone and his only satisfaction was in helping fergus to arrange his spare specimens for sale     chapter xvii  excluded    but i neednt tell you what to do only do it out of hand and charge whatever you like to charge my lady wont make a stand                                                      —t hood   the ladies committee could not but meet over and over again wandering about the gardens which were now trimmed into order to place the stalls and decide on what should and should not be  there was to be an art stall over which mrs henderson was to preside  here were to be the very graceful and beautiful articles of sculpture and italian bijouterie that the whites had sent home and that were spared from the marble works also mrs grinsteads drawings captain hendersons those of others screens and scrap books and photographs  jasper and a coadjutor or two undertook to photograph any one who wished it and there too were displayed the mousetraps  mrs henderson sure to look beautiful quite madonna like in her costume would have the charge of the stall with gillian and two other girls in italian peasantdresses sent home by aunt ada  gillian was resolved on standing by her  kalliope wants some one to give her courage she said  besides i am the mother of the mouse trap and i must see how it goes off  lady flight and a bevy of young ladies of her selection were to preside over the flowers mrs yarley undertook the refreshments lady merrifield the more ordinary bazaar stall  her name was prized and anna was glad to shelter herself under her wing  the care of valetta and primrose to say nothing of dolores was enough inducement to overcome any reluctance and she was glad to be on the committee when vexed questions came on such as miss pettifers offer of a skirtdance which could not be so summarily dismissed as it had been at beechcroft for lady flight and mrs varley wished for it and even mrs harper was ready to endure anything to raise the much needed money and almost thought lady merrifield too particular when she discontinued the dancingclass for valetta and primrose  that speaks for itself said mrs grinstead  i can fancy seeing no harm in it for little girls said lady merrifield but i dont like giving them a talent the use of which seems to be to enable them to show off  and i know that lady rotherwood would not approve said miss mohun aware that this settled the matter  and heres another outsider miss penfeather who offers to interpret handwriting at twoand sixpence a head  by all means was the cry  we will build her a bower somewhere near the photography  i am only afraid added jane of her offering to do palmistry do you know i dabbled a little in that once and i came to the conclusion that it was not a safe study for oneself or any one else  quite right said geraldine  do you believe in it then  not so as to practise it or accept it so far as the future is concerned and to play at it as a parody of fortunetelling seems to me utterly inadmissible  and to be squashed with lord rotherwoods mighty name said her sister laughing  lady rotherwood would do so effectively  wherewith came on the question of raffles an inexhaustible one since some maintained that they were contrary to english law and were absolutely immoral while others held that it was the only way of disposing of really expensive articles  these were two statues sent by mrs white and an exquisite little picture by mrs grinstead worth more than any one could be expected to give  it was one that she had nearly finished at the time of mr grinsteads illness—john inglesant arriving in his armour of light on his wedding morning—and the associations were so painful that she said she never wished to see it again  there were likewise a good many charming sketches of figures and scenery over which gerald and anna grieved though she had let them keep all they could show cause for but drawing had become as much her resource as in the good old days  she was always throwing off little outlines and she had even begun a grand study which she called safe home a vessel showing signs of storm and struggle just at the verge of a harbour lost in golden light  and the helmsmans face  clement and lance neither of them said in words whose it was as they both stood looking at it and owned to themselves the steadfast face of their eldest brother but clement said with a sigh—  ah we are a long way as yet from that  im very glad to hear you say so exclaimed lance then laughing at himself you are ever so much better  oh yes i suppose i am to start again going softly all my days perhaps and it is well for i dont think the young generation can spare me yet  nor cherry  how thankful i am to have cherry restored to me i cannot say and i do not feel convinced that there may not be care at hand with gerald the boy is in a reserved mood very civil and amiable but clearly holding back from confidence  does she see it  yes but she fancies he bestows his confidence on dolores mohun the girl from new zealand and resigns herself to be set aside  it is pretty well time that we went to meet her  for there was to be a dress rehearsal in the pavilion to which certain spectators were to be admitted chiefly as critics  do you walk up the hill clem  yes as long as i dont go too fast  go on if you are wanted and i will follow  cherry has sent the carriage for an invalid who cannot venture to be there all the day  let them wait  a walk with you is not to be wasted  run on fely tell them we are coming he added to his little ariel who had got lost in jungle beasts  as they went up the hill together clement not sorry to lean on his brothers arm a dark woman of striking figure and countenance though far from young came up with them accompanied by a stout overdressed man  thats the cigarshop woman said lance the mother of our pretty little miranda  i wonder she chooses to show herself after her conviction said clement  and if i am not much mistaken that is the villain of the sepoys revenge said lance  poor little butterfly it is a bad omen for her future fate  as they reached the doors of the great hotel they found the pair in altercation with the porter before the iron gate that gave admittance to the gardens  mother butterfly was pleading that she was the mother of miss schnetterling who was singing and the porter replying that his orders were strict  no not on any consideration he repeated as the man was evidently showing him the glance of silver and a policeman who was marching about showed signs of meaning to interfere  at the same moment geralds quick steps came up from the inside  thats right lance every one is crying out for you  vicar cherie is keeping a capital place for you  the gate opened to admit them and therewith mrs schnetterling trying to push in made a vehement appeal—  mr underwood sir surely the prima donnas own mother should not be excluded  her mother said gerald  well perhaps so but hardly this— person as his native fastidiousness rose at the sight  no sir said the porter captain henderson and mr simmonds they have specially cautioned me who i lets in  the man grumbled something about swells and insolence and lance with his usual instinct of courtesy lingered to say—  this is quite a private rehearsal—only the persons concerned  and if im come on business said the man confidentially  you are something in our line  scarcely said lance rather amused  at any rate i dont make the regulations  he sped away at the summons of his impatient son and gerald  they met captain henderson on the way and after a hasty greeting he said—  so you have let in the schnetterling woman  one could not well keep out the mother returned lance  well no but did she bring a man with her  my wife says the poor little mona is in mortal terror lest he is come to inspect her for a circus company  quite according to his looks said lance  poor child it may be her fate but she ought to be in safe hands but i suppose the woman wants to sacrifice her to present gain  they went on their way and lance and gerald were soon absorbed in their cares of arrangement while clement was conducted to the seat reserved for him between his sister and lady merrifield  the pavilion had been fitted with stages of seats on the inner side but the back—behind the stage—was so contrived that in case of favourable weather the real seaview could be let in upon occasion though the curtain and adjuncts which had been painted by some of the deft fingers at vale leston represented the cavern also there was a first scene with a real sail and mast  it was a kind of semidress rehearsal beginning with pirate songs by the schoolmaster and choir who had little difficulty in arranging themselves as buccaneers  the sail was agitated then reefed stormy songs were heard where captain armytage did his part fairly well the boatswain was gratified by roaring out his part character istically and the curtain fell on we split we split we split  then came a song of prospero not much disguised by a plaid and highland bonnet interrupted by the pretty graceful miranda very shy and illassured at first but gathering strength from his gentle encouraging ways while he told what was needful in the recitative that he alone could undertake  then the elves and fairies led by little felix in a charming cap like puck danced on and sang making the prettiest of tableaux lulling miranda to sleep and then ariel conversing in a most dainty manner with prospero  next ferdinand and miranda had their scene almost all songs and duets  both sang very sweetly and she had evidently gained in courage and threw herself into her part  the shipwrecked party then came on the scene performed their songs and were led about puckfashion by the fairies and put to sleep by the lament over ferdinand  the buccaneers in like manner were deluded by more mischievous songs and antics till bogged and crying out behind the scenes  their intended victims were then awakened to find themselves in the presence of prospero sing themselves into the reconciliation then mourn for ferdinand until the disclosure of the two lovers and the final release of ariel and the sprites all singing jacobite songs  to those who were not au fait with the tempest and felt no indignation or jealousy at the travesty it was charming and though the audience at the rehearsal numbered few of these the refined sweetness and power of the performers made it delightful and memorable  every one was in raptures with the fairies who had been beautifully drilled and above all with their graceful little leader with his twinkling feet and arch lively manner especially in the parts with his father  ferdinand and miranda—or rather angus and mona—were quite ideal in looks voices and gestures  almost dangerously so said jane mohun and the odd thing is that they are just alike enough for first cousins as they are here though shakespeare was not guilty of making them such  the odd thing is said geraldine as she drove home with clement that this brought me back so strangely to that wonderful concert at home with all of you standing up in a row and the choir from minsterham and poor edgars star  an evil star sighed clement     chapter xviii  the evil star                             lancelot said that were against me what i can i will and there that day remained—tennyson   it was on the night before the final bustle and fury so to speak of preparation were to set in when arrivals were expected and the sellers were in commotion and he had been all day putting the singers one by one through their parts that as he went to his room at night there was a knock at lancelots door and gerald came in looking deadly white  he had been silent and effaced all the evening and his aunt had thought him tired but he had rather petulantly eluded inquiry and now he came in with—  lance i must have it out with some one  an oxford scrape said lance  oh no i wish it was only that  then a silence while lance looked at him thinking what trouble could it be  he had been very kind and gentle with the little miranda but the manner had not struck lance as loverlike  there was a gasp again—  that person that woman at the gate do you remember  therewith a flash came over lance  my poor boy  you dont mean to say  neither could bring himself to say the word so sacred to lancelot and which might have been so sacred to his nephew  how did you guess said gerald lifting up the face that he had hidden on the table  i saw the likeness between you and the girl  she reminded me of some one i had once seen  had you seen her  once at a concert twenty odd years ago  your aunt too was strangely carried back to that scene by the girls voice i suppose  poor child said gerald still laying down his head and seeming terribly oppressed as lance felt he well might be  it is a sad business for you said the uncle with a kind hand on his shoulder  how was it she did not claim you before—not that she has any real claim  she did not know my real name  my father called himself wood  i never knew the rest of it till after i came home  that fellow bribed the gardener got in over the wall or somehow and when she saw you and heard you and me and all three of us it gave her the clue  well gerald i do not think she can dare to  oh interrupted gerald theres worse to come  what said lance aghast  she says and a sort of dry sob cut him short she says she had a husband when she married my father and down went his head again  impossible was lances first cry your fathers first care was to tell travis all was right with you  travis has the certificates  oh yes it was no fault of my father—my father my dear father—no but she deceived him and i am an impostor—nobody  gently gently gerald  we have no certainty that this is true your father had known her for years  tell me how did it come out— what evidence did she adduce  gerald nerved himself to sit up and speak collectedly  i believe it is half that circus fellows doing  i think she is going to marry him if she hasnt already  she followed me and just at the turn down this road as i was bidding the mona girl goodnight she came up with me and said i little thought that the child was my sister and how delightful it was to see us acting together  well then i cant say but a horror came over me  i couldnt for the life of me do anything but draw back there was something so intolerable in the look of her eyes and her caressing manner and he shuddered glad of his uncles kind hand on his shoulder  somehow i let her get me out upon the high ground and there she said so you are too great a swell to have word or look for your mother  no wonder you always were un vilain petit miserable but i wont trouble you—i wouldnt be bound to live your dull ennuyant ladies life for millions  ill bargain to keep out of your way but oleary and i want a couple of hundred pounds and youll not grudge it to us i had no notion of being blackmailed besides i havent got it and i told her she might know that i am not of age and had no such sum ready to hand  she was urgent and i began to think whether i could do anything to save that poor little sister when she evidently got some fresh impulse from the man and began to ask me how i should like to have it all disclosed to my nobs of friends  well i wasnt going to be bullied and i answered that my friends knew already and she might do her worst  oh may i she said you wouldnt like my fine young squire to have it come out that i never was your fathers wife at all and that you are no more than that gutter child  i could not understand her at first and said i would not be threatened but that made her worse and that rascal oleary came to her help  they raised their demands somehow to five hundred and declared if they had not it paid down they should tell the whole story and turn me out  of course i said they were welcome  either i am my fathers lawful son or i am not and if not the sooner it is all up with me the better for whatever i am i am no thief and robber  so i set off and came down the hill but the brute kept pace with me to this very door trying to wheedle me i believe  and now whats to be done  i would go off at once and let uncle clem come into his rights only i dont want to be the death of him and cherie  no said lance my dear fellow  you have stood it wisely and bravely so far go on to do so  i dont feel the least certain that this is not mere bullying  she did not tell you any particulars  no certainly not  not the name of this supposed predecessor of edgars  where she may have been married or how  how she parted from him or how she knows he was alive  it sounds to me a bogus notion got up to put the screw on you by surprise  ill tell you what ill do  ill go down to the shop tomorrow morning see the woman and extract the truth if possible and i fully expect that the story will shrink up to nothing  tis not the estate i care for said gerald looking somewhat cheered  it is my fathers honour and name  if that can be cleared—  do not i care said lance  my dear brother edgar my model of all that was noble and brilliant—whom felix loved above all  nay and you gerald our hope  i would give anything and everything to free you from this stain though i trust it will prove only mud that will not stick  anyway you have shown your true faithful underwood blood  now go to bed and sleep if you can  dont say a word nor look more like a ghost than you can help—or we shall have to rouge ourselves for our parts  my boy my boy  you are edgars boy anyway  and lancelot kissed the young pale cheek as he had done when the little wounded orphan clung to him fourteen years ago or as he kissed his own felix  whatever the night was to gerald long was the night and long the light hours of the morning to the ever sleepless lance before he could rise and make his way to the shop with any hope of gaining admission and many were the sighs and prayers that this tale might be confuted and that the matter might be to the blessing of the youth to whom he felt more warmly now than since those winning baby days had given place to more ordinary boyhood  he had a long time to pace up and down watching the sparkling water and feeling the fresh wind on the brow which was as capable as ever of aching over trouble and perplexity and dreading above all the effect on the sister whose consolation and darling gerald had always been  how little he had thought when he had stood staunch against his brother edgars persuasions that zoraya was to be the bane of that life which had begun so gaily  when at last the door was unfastened and as before by ludmilla he greeted her kindly and as she evidently expected some fresh idea about the masque he gave her his card and asked her to beg her mother to come and speak to him  she started at the name and said—  oh sir you will do nothing to hurt him—mr underwood  it is the last thing i wish he said earnestly and ludmilla showed him into a little parlour full of the fumes of tobacco and sped away but he had a long time to wait for probably mother butterflys entire toilette had to be taken in hand  before she appeared lancelot heard a mans voice somewhere in the entry saying—  oh the young ass has been fool enough to let it out has he  i suppose this is the chap that will profit  youll have your wits about you  lance was still his old self enough to receive the lady with—  i beg to observe that i am not the chap who will profit if this miserable allegation holds water  i am come to understand the truth  the woman looked frightened and the man came to her rescue having evidently heard and this lance preferred for he always liked to deal with mankind rather than womankind  having gone so far there was not room for reticence and the man took up the word  madame cannot be expected to disclose anything to the prejudice of her son and herself unless it was made worth her while  perhaps not said lance as he looked her over in irony and drew the conclusion that the marriage was a fact accomplished but she has demanded two hundred pounds from her son on peril of exposure and if the facts are not substantiated there is such a thing as an action for conspiracy and obtaining money on false pretences  nothing has been obtained said the woman beginning to cry  he was very hard on his poor mother  who forsook him as an infant cast off his father and only claims him in order to keep a disgraceful ruinous secret hanging over his life for ever in order to extort money  come now this is tall talk sir said oleary the long and short of it is what will the cove yourself or whoever it is that you speak for come down for one way or another  nothing responded lance  neither of the estimable couple spoke or moved under an announcement so incredible to them and he went on—  gerald underwood would rather lose everything than give hushmoney to enable him to be a robber and my elder brother would certainly give no reward for what would be the greatest grief in his life  oleary grinned as if he wanted to say have you asked him  the priest she muttered  ay the meddling parson who has done for you  he would have to come down pretty handsomely  lancelot went on as if he had not heard these asides  i am a magistrate i can give you in charge at once to the police and have you brought before the mayor for conspiracy when you will have to prove your words or confess them to be a lie  he was not in the least certain that where there was no threatening letter this could succeed but he knew that the preliminaries would be alarming enough to elicit something and accordingly mrs oleary began to sob out—  it was when i was a mere child a bambina and he used me so cruelly  there was the first thread and on the whole the couple were angry enough with gerald his refined appearance and air of careless prosperity to be willing that he should have a fall and lance thus extracted that the he who had been cruel was a neapolitan impresario in a small way who had detected that zoraya when a very little child had a charming voice of which indeed she still spoke with pride saying lida would never equal it  her parents were semi gipsies hungarian and had wandered all over the austrian empire acting singing and bringing up their children to the like  they had actually sold her to the impresario who had sealed the compact and hoped to secure the valuable commodity by making her his wife in his security he had trained her in the severest mode and visited the smallest want of success with violence and harshness so that her life was utterly miserable and on meeting her brother who had become a member of a german band she had contrived to make her escape with him and having really considerable proficiency the brother and sister had prospered and through sundry vicissitudes had arrived at being stars in allens troupe where edgar underwood or as he was there known tom wood had unfortunately joined them and the sequel was known to lancelot but he could not but listen and gather up the details disgusted as he was—how the prima donna had accepted his attention as her right till her jealousy was excited by his evident attraction to the little english doll for whom he killed his man how she resolved to win him and how scandalous reports at last had brought him to offer marriage unknowing it was plain of her past  it was not possible to guess how much she was still keeping back speaking under terror and compulsion as she did but she declared that he had never loved her and was always wanting her to be like ces anglaises fades and as to her child he so tormented her about it and the ways of his absurd mother and sisters and so expected her to sacrifice her art and her prospects to the little wretch that she was ready to strangle it  maternal love bah she was not going to be like a bird or a beast she said with a strange wild glance in her eyes that made lance shudder and think how much more he respected the bird or beast  then at chicago when woods own folly and imprudence had brought on an illness that destroyed his voice and she knew there would be only starvation or she should have to toil for the whole of them schnetterling manager of a circus fell in love with her and made her good offers to sing in canada and chicago was a place where few questions were asked so she freed herself  she had made her rounds with schnetterling a prudent german and in process of time had come to england where at avoncester both had been attacked by influenza he died and she only recovered with a total loss of voice but he had been prudent and frugal enough to save a sufficient sum to set her up at rockquay with the tobacco shop  she had chosen that place on account of american trading vessels putting in there as well as those of various foreign nations with whom her knowledge of languages was available and no doubt there were some opportunities of dealing in smuggled goods just however as the smuggling was beginning to be suspected the circus of oleary came in her way and the old instincts were renewed  then came the detection and prosecution and the need of raising the fine  she had recourse to oleary who had before been schnetterlings underling and now was a partner in jellicoes circus who knew her capabilities as a manager and actress and perceived the probabilities of poor little lidas powers  the discovery that the deserted baby that she had left at chicago was a young handsome squire well connected and in her eyes of unlimited means had of course incited both to make the utmost profit of him that he should not wish to hush the suspicion up but should go straight to his uncles was to them a quite unexpected contingency  all this was not exactly told to lancelot but he extracted it or gathered it before he was able to arrive at what was really important the name of zorayas first husband where she was married and by whom and where she had parted from him  she was so unwilling to give particulars that he began almost to hope to make her confess that the whole was a myth but at last she owned that the mans name was giovanni benista and that the marriage had taken place at messina she knew not in what church nor in what year only it was before the end of the old regime for she recollected the uniforms of the bomba soldiers though she could not remember the name of the priest  benista was old very old—the tyrant and assassin that he was no doubt he was dead  she often thought he would have killed her—and the history of his illtreatment had to be gone through before it appeared that she had fled from him at trieste with her brother in an english tradingvessel where their dexterity and brilliancy gained them concealment and a passage  this was certainly in the summer of 1865  of benista she knew nothing since but she believed him to have come from piedmont  lance found gerald walking up and down anxiously watching for him and receiving him with a well that had in it volumes of suspense  well gerald i do not think there can be any blame attached to your father whatever comes of it  he was deceived as much as any one else and his attachment to you seems to have been his great offence  thank heaven  then he was deceived  i am afraid there was some previous ceremony  but stay gerald there is no certainty that it was valid in the first place and in the next nothing is known of benista since 1865 when he was an old man so that there is a full chance that he was dead before—  before april 1868  i say uncle lance they want to make no end of a bearfight for my coming of age  i must be out of the way first  dont cry out too soon  even if the worst came to the worst as the property was left to you by will individually i doubt whether this discovery if real would make any difference in law  i do not know  but would i take it on those terms  it would be simply defrauding clement and all of you—  perhaps long before we may be satisfied said lance  for the present i think nothing can be done but endeavour to ascertain the facts  one comfort is said gerald i have gained a sister  i have walked with her to the corner of her place—the marble works you know—and she really is a jolly little thing quite innocent of all her mothers tricks thinking mrs henderson the first of human beings except perhaps flight the aesthetic parson  i should not have selected him you know but between them they have kept her quite a white sheet—a miranda any ferdinand might be glad to find and dreading nothing so much as falling into the hands of that awful brute  caliban himself couldnt have been worse  i have promised her to do what i can to save her—buy her off—anything  poor child said lance  but gerald nothing of this must be said these next few days  we cant put ourselves out of condition for this same rareeshow  im sure its a mere abomination to me said gerald disconsolately i cant think why we should be dragged into all this nuisance for what is not even our own concern  im sure i thought you the rope that dragged me  at any rate much higher up on it  well i never thought you would respond—you who have enough on your hands at bexley  one stroke even on the outskirts is a stroke for all the cause  the cause  i dont believe in the cause whatever it is  what a concatenation now that you and i should make fools of ourselves in order to stave off the establishment of national education as if we could or as if it was worth doing  then why did you undertake it  oh ah  why one wants something to do down here and the merrifield lot are gone upon it and i did want to go through the thing again but now it seems all rot  nevertheless having pledged ourselves to the performance we cannot cry off and the present duty is to pack dull care away put all this out of our heads and regard it as a mere mares nest as long as possible and above all not upset cherry  remember let this turn out as it will you are yourself still and her own boy beloved for your fathers sake the joy of our dear brother and her great comforter  a wretched mistake can never change that  lances voice was quivering and geralds face worked  lance gave his hand a squeeze and found voice to say—  hold thee still in the lord and abide patiently upon him  and meantime be a man over it  it can be done  i have often had to forget     chapter xix  shopdressing    but i cant conceive in this very hot weather how im ever to bring all these people together                                             t hood   it was not a day when any one could afford to be upset  it was chiefly spent in welcoming arrivals or in rushing about on the part of lance and gerald in freshly rehearsing each performer in superintending their stage arrangements reviewing the dresses and preparing for one grand final rehearsal and in the multifarious occupations and anxieties and above all in the music gerald did really forget or only now and then recollect that a nightmare was hanging on him and that his little mona need not shrink from him in maidenly shyness but that he might well return her pretty appealing look of confidence  the only quiet place in the town apparently was clement underwoods room for even cherry had been whirled off at first to arrange her own pictures and drawings and then her wonderful touch made such a difference in the whole appearance of the stall and her dainty devices were so graceful and effective that gillian and mysie implored her to come and tell them what to do with theirs where they were struggling with cushions shawls and bags with the somewhat futile assistance of mr armine brownlow and captain armytage whenever the latter could be spared from the theatrical arrangements where as he said it was a case of parmi les borgnes—for his small experience with the willsofthewisp made him valuable  the stalls were each in what was supposed to represent by turns a highland bothie or a cave  the art stall was a cave that the back really a toolhouse might serve the photographers and the front was decorated with handsome bits of rock and spar even ammonites poor fergus could not recover his horror and contempt when his collection of specimens named and arranged was very nearly seized upon to fill up interstices and he was infinitely indebted to mrs grinstead for finding a place where their scientific merits could be appreciated without letting his dirty stones as valetta called them disturb the general effect  and my ferngardens  oh mrs grinstead cried mysie please dont send them away to the flower place which miss simmonds and the gardeners are making like a nursery garden  theyll snub my poor dear pterises  certainly well make the most of your pterises  look here  theres an elegant doll let her lead the family party to survey them thats right  oh no not that giantess  theres a dainty little dutch lady  charming  oh and heres her boy in a sailors dress  he is big enough to be her husband my dear  you had better observe proportions and put that family nearer the eye  those dolls cried valetta they were our despair  make them tell a story dont you see  wheres that fat red cushion  oh that cushion  i put it out of sight because it is such a monster  yes it is just like brickdust enlivened by halfboiled cauliflowers  never mind it will be all the better background now i saw a majestic lady reposing somewhere  there let her sit against it  oh she mustnt flop over  here that matchbox is it i pity the person deluded enough to use it  prop her up with it now then let us have a presentation of ladies—shes a governors wife in the colonies you see  never mind costumes they may be queer  all that will stand or kneel—thats right  those that can only sit must hide behind like poor marie antoinettes ladies on the giggling occasion  so she went on full of fun which made the work doubly delightful to the girls who darted about while she put the finishing touches transforming the draperies from the aspect of a ragandbone shop as jasper had called it to a wonderful quaint and pretty fairy bower backed by the indian scenes sent by mr and mrs bernard underwood and that other lovely one of primroses pasture  there the merry musical laugh of her youth was to be heard as general mohun came out with lancelot to make a raid order the whole party to come and eat luncheon at beechcroft cottage and not let mrs grinstead come out again  oh but i must finish up bernards clay costume figures  look at the expression of that delightful dollie  im sure he is watching the khitmutgars             above on tallest trees remote              green ayahs perched alone            and all night long the mussah moaned              in melancholy tone   oh dont you know lears poem  cant we illustrate it  cherry cherry youll be half dead tomorrow  well if i am this is the real fun  i shant see the destruction  lance had her arm in his grip to take her over the bridge over the wall when up rushed kitty varley  oh if mrs grinstead would come and look at our stall and set it right  miss vanderkist gave us hopes  perhaps—  now cherry dont you know that you are not to be knocked up there are the travises going to bring unlimited vanderkists  oh yes i know but theres renovation in breaths from vale leston and i really am of some use here  her voice really had a gay ring in it  it is such fun too  wheres gerald  having a smoke with the buccaneer captain  oh miss mohun heres my sister so enamoured of the bazaar i could hardly get her in  and oh she is so clever and delightful  she has made our stall the most enchanting place cried primrose dancing round  mamma you must come and have it all explained to you  the very sight is supposed to be worth a shilling extra said general mohun while lady merrifield and miss mohun taking possession of her hoped she was not tired and gillian who had been wont to consider her as her private property began to reprove her sisters for having engrossed her while she herself was occupied in helping the hendersons with their art stall  the truth is said lance that this is my sisters first bazaar and so dear is the work to the female mind that she cant help being sucked into the vortex  is it really demanded mysie in a voice that made mrs grinstead laugh and say—  such is my woeful lack of experience  we have fallen on a bazaar wherever we went said lady merrifield  but this is our first grownup one mamma said valetta  there was only a sale of work before  they all laughed and lance said—  to stoneborough they seem like revenues—at least sales of work for i cant say i understand the distinction  recurring brigandages said general mohun  ah  uncle reggie has never forgotten his getting a noahs ark in a raffle said mysie  so went the merry talk while one and another came in at miss mohuns verandah windows to be sustained with food and rest and then darted forth again to renew their labours until the evening miss mohun flying about everywhere on all sorts of needs and her brother the general waiting by the diningroom to do the duties of hospitality to the strays of the families who dropped in chattering and laughing and exhausted  lady merrifield was authorized to detain mrs grinstead to the last moment possible to either and they fell into a talk on the morality of bazaars which as lady merrifield said had been a worry to her everywhere while geraldine had been out of their reach since the underwoods had done everything without begging and clement disapproved of them without the most urgent need but as lance had said his wife had grown up to them and had gone through all the stages from delighting acquiescing and being bored and they had so advanced since their early days from being simply sales to the grand period of ornaments costumes and anything to attract  clement consents said geraldine as first it is not a church and then though it does seem absurd to think that singing through the murdered tempest should be aiding the cause of the church yet anything to keep our children to learning faith and truth is worthy work  alas it is working against the stream  how things are changed when school was our romance and our domain  yes you should hear lance tell the story of his sisterinlaw ethel how she began at cocksmoor with seven children and fifteen shillings and thought her fortune made when she got ten pounds a year for the schoolmistress and now it is all mrs rivers can do to keep out the schoolboard because they had not a separate room for the hatpegs  we never had those struggles  we had enough to do to live at all in our dear old home days except that my brother always taught sunday classes  but anyway this is very amusing  those young peoples characters come out so much  ah gerald what is it  for gerald was coming up to the verandah with a very pretty dark eyed modestlooking girl in a sailor hat who shrank back as he said—  i am come to ask for some luncheon for my—my mona  she has had nothing to eat all day and we still have the grand recognition scene to come  at which the girl blushed so furiously that the notion crossed geraldine that he must have been flirting with the poor little tobacconists daughter but lady merrifield was exclaiming that he too had had nothing to eat and general mohun came forth to draw them into the diningroom where he helped ludmilla to cold lamb salad etc and she sat down at geralds signal very timidly so that she gave the idea of only partaking because she was afraid to refuse  gerald ate hurriedly and nervously and drank claret cup  he said they were getting on famously his uncles chief strength being expended in drawing out the voice of the buccaneer captain and mitigating the boatswain  where were the little boys  happily disposed of  little felix had gone through his part and then fergus had carried him and adrian off together to clipstone to see his animals antediluvian and otherwise  then in rushed gillian followed by dolores  oh mother cried gillian theres a fresh instalment of pots and pans come in such horrid things some of them  theres a statue in terracotta half as large as life of the dirty boy  geraldine do pray come and see what can be done with him  kalliope is in utter despair for they come from craydons and to offend them would be fatal  kalliope and the dirty boy said mrs grinstead laughing a dreadful conjunction i must go and see if it is possible to establish the line between the sublime and the ridiculous  shall i ask your nephews leave to let you go said lady merrifield after all the orders i have received  oh no— she began but gerald had jumped up  ill steer you over the drawbridge cherie if go you must  yes— to the young ladies—i appreciate your needs  nobody has the same faculty in her fingers as this aunt of mine  come along mona it is mrs hendersons stall you know  ludmilla came chiefly because she was afraid to be left and lady merrifield could not but come too meeting on the way anna come to implore help in arranging the dirty boy before captain henderson knocked his head off as he was much disposed to do  gillian had bounded on before with a handful of sandwiches but dolores tarried behind having let the general help her to the leg of a chicken which she seemed in no haste to dissect  her uncle went off on some other call before she had finished eating and drinking with the bitter sauce of reflection on the fleeting nature of young mens attentions and even confidences and how easily everything was overthrown at sight of a pretty face especially in the halfandhalf class  she had only just come out into the verandah wearily to return to the preparations which had lost whatever taste they had for her when she saw gerald underwood springing over the partition wall  her impulse was to escape him but it was too late he came eagerly up to her saying—  she is safe with mrs henderson  i am to go back for her when our duet comes on  dolores did not want to lower herself by showing jealousy or offence but she could not help turning decidedly away saying—  i am wanted  are you  i wanted to tell you why i am so interested in her dolores can you hear me now—she is my sister  your sister in utter amaze  every one says they see it in the colour of our eyes  every one—she seemed able to do nothing but repeat his words  well my uncle lancelot and—and my mother  no one else knows yet they want to spare my aunt till this concern is over  but how can it be  it is a horrid business altogether he said taking her down to the unfrequented parts of the lower end of the garden where they could walk up and down hidden by the bushes and shrubs  you knew that my father was an artist and musician who fled from over patronage  i think i have heard so  he married a singingwoman and she grew tired of him and of me deserted and divorced him in chicago when i was ten months old  he was the dearest most devoted of fathers till he and i were devoured by the indians  if they had completed their operations on my scalp it would have been all the better for me  instead of which travis picked me up brought me home and they made me as much of an heir of all the traditions as nature would permit all ignoring that not only was my father bohemian ingrain but that my mother was—in short—one of the gipsies of civilization  they never expected to hear of her again but behold the rapturous discovery has taken place  she recognised lance the only one of the family she had ever seen before and then the voice of blood—more truly the voice of £ s d —exerted itself  how was it she did not find you out before  my father seems to have concealed his full name i remember his being called tom wood  she married in her own line after casting him off and this pretty little thing is her child—the only tolerable part of it  but she cannot have any claim on you said dolores with a more shocked look and tone than the words conveyed  not she—in reason but the worst of it is dolores that the wretched woman avers that she deceived my father and had an old rascally tyrant of an italian husband who might have been alive when she married  gerald  dolores stood still and looked at him with her eyes opened in horror  yes you may well say gerald  tis the only name i have a right to if this is true  but you are still yourself and she held out her hand  he did not take it however only saying—  you know what this means  of course i do but that does not alter you—yourself in yourself  if you say that dolores it will only alter me to make me—more— more myself  she held out her hand again and this time he did take it and press it but he started dropped it and said—  it is not fair  oh yes it is  i know what it means she repeated and it makes no difference and this time it was she who took his hand  it means that unless this marriage is disproved or the mans death proved i am an outcast dependent on myself instead of the curled darling the grinsteads—blessings on them—have brought me up  i dont know whether i dont like you better so exclaimed she looking into his clear eyes and fine open face full of resolution not of shame  while you say so— he broke off  yes thus i can bear it better the estate is almost an oppression to me  the bohemian nature is in me i suppose  i had rather carve out life for myself than have the landlord business loaded on my shoulders  clement and lance will make the model parson and squire far better than i  the inspectors tour was a success—between that and the underwood music theres no fear but i shall get an independent career  oh that is noble  you will be much more than your old self—as you said  the breaking of cheries heart is all that i care about said he to her i was comfort almost compensation for those brothers  i dont know how— he paused  well let her alone till all this is over so dolores not one word to any one  no no no she exclaimed i will—i will be true to you through everything gerald i will wait till you have seen your way and be proud of you through all  then i can bear it—i have my incentive he said  first you see i must try to rescue my sister  i do not think it will be hard for the maternal heart seems to be denied to that woman  then proofs must be sought and according as they are found or not—  loud calls of gerald and mr underwood began to resound  he finished—  must be the future  our future repeated dolores     chapter xx  french leave    she came she is gone we have met and meet perhaps never again—cowper   the evening of that day was a scene of welcomes dinners and confusion  the rotherwoods had arrived that evening at the cliff hotel just in time for dinner of which they considerately partook where they were to save jane mohun trouble but all four of the party came the instant it was over to hear and see all that was going on and were fervently received by gillian and mysie who were sleeping at their aunts to be ready for the morrow and in spite of all fatigue had legs wherewith to walk lord ivinghoe and lady phyllis round the stalls now closed up by canvas and guarded by police  phyllis was only mournful not to have assisted in the preparations and heard all the fun that mrs grinstead had made but over the wall of carrara a sight was seen for which no one was prepared—no other than maura whites pretty classical face  yes she said how could i be away from such an occasion  i made uncle white bring me to london—he had business there you know—and then i descended on kalliope and wasnt she surprised  but i have a lovely italian dress  kalliope henderson looked more alarmed than gratified on the whole she knew that there had been no idea of mauras coming till after it had been known that the rotherwoods were to open the bazaar and made uncle white was so unlike their former relations that all were startled gillian asking in a tone of reproof how aunt adeline spared maura  oh we shall be back at gastein in less than a week  i could not miss such an occasion  i only had her telegram halfanhour ago said kalliope in an apologetic tone and lord ivinghoe was to be dimly seen handing maura over the fence  moonlight gardens and moonlight sea  what was to be done  and ivinghoe who had begun life by being as exclusive as the marchioness herself  people take the bit between their teeth nowadays as jane observed to lady rotherwood when the news reached her and neither said though each felt that adeline would not have promoted this expedition even for the child whom she and mr white had conspired to spoil  each was secretly afraid of the attraction for ivinghoe  at st andrews rock there was a glad meeting with the travis underwoods who had disposed of themselves at the marine hotel while they came up with a select party of three vanderkists to spend the evening with clement geraldine and lancelot not to mention adrian who had been allowed to sit up to dinner to see his sisters and was almost devoured by them  his growth and the improved looks of both his uncle and aunt so delighted marilda that lancelot declared the rockquay people would do well to have them photographed then and now as an advertisement of the place  but he was not without dread of the effect of the disclosure that had yet to be made though gerald had apparently forgotten all about it as he sat chaffing emilia vanderkist about the hospital whither she was really going for a year sophy about the engineer who had surveyed the penbeacon intended works and francie about her mirandamona in strange hands  the vanderkists all began life as very pretty little girls but showed more or less of the hollander ancestry as they grow up  only franceska content with her dutch name had shot up into a beautiful figure together with the fine features and complexion of the underwood twins and the profuse golden flax hair of her aunt angela so that she took them all by surprise in the pretty dress presented by cousin marilda and chosen by emilia  sophy was round and short as nearly plain as one with the family likeness could be but bright and joyous and very proud of her young sister  it was a merry evening  in fact lance himself was so much carried away by the spirit of the thing and so anxious about the performance that he made all the rest including clement join in singing autolycuss song which was to precede the procession to a new setting of his own before they dispersed  but lance was beginning to dress in the morning when a knock came to his door  a note from mr flight please sir  the note was—circus and schnetterlings gone off in the night  shop closed  must performance be given up  the town was all over red and blue posters  but lance felt a wild hope for the future and a not illfounded one for the present  he rushed into his clothes first pencilling a note—                   never say die  l 0 u  then he hurried off and sent up a message to miss franceska vanderkist to come and speak to him and he walked up and down the sittingroom where breakfast was being spread like a panther humming prosperos songs or murmuring vituperations till franceska appeared a perfect picture of loveliness in her morning youthful freshness  francie theres no help for it  you must take mona  she has absconded  uncle lance  yes gone off in the night left us lamenting  the horrible girl  probably not her fault poor thing  but thats neither here nor there  i wish it was  but i thought—  it is past thinking now my dear  here we are pledged  cant draw back and you are the only being who can save us  you know the part  yes in a way  you did it with me at home  oh yes but uncle lance it would be too dreadful before all these people  never mind the people  be mona and only think of alaster and angus  but what would mamma say or aunt wilmet  and uncle clem each in a more awestricken voice  ill tackle them  i know i shall be frightened and fail and that will be worse  no it wont and you wont  look here francie this is not a selfwilled freak for our own amusement  the keeping up the church schools here depends upon what we can raise  i hate bazaars  i hate to have to obtain help for the church through these peoples idle amusement but you and i have not two or three thousands to give away to a strange place in a lump but we have our voices  such as i have give i thee and this ridiculous entertainment may bring in fifty or maybe a hundred  i dont feel it right to let it collapse for the sake of our own dislikes  very well uncle lance ill do as you tell me  thats the way to do it my dear  at least when you make ready recollect not that you are facing a multitude but that you are saving a childs christian faith when you prepare that you have to do with nobody but gerald and me when it comes to one two three and away mind nothing but your music and your cue  but the dress uncle  the dress is all safe at the pavilion  you must come up and rehearse as soon as you have eaten your breakfast  oh you dont know where  well one of us will come and fetch you  good girl francie  keep up your heart  by the bye which is fernans dressingroom  i must prepare him  that question was answered for sir ferdinands door into the corridor was opened  lance  i thought i heard your voice  yes heres a pretty kettle of fish  our miranda has absconded poor child  happy thing you brought down francie nobody else could take the part at such short notice  you must pacify marilda silence scruples say it is her duty to church country and family  cant stop  lance explain—do  musicmad as usual cried sir ferdinand pursuing him downstairs in despair  i must be musicmad the only chance of keeping sane just now theres an awful predicament  cant go into it now but you shall hear all when this is over  wherewith lance was lost to view and presently burst into st kenelms vicarage to the relief of poor mr flight who had tried to solace himself with those three words as best he might  all right  my niece franceska vanderkist who took the part before and who has a very good soprano will do it better as to voice if not so well as to acting as the little butterfly  is she here  yes by good luck  i shall have her up to the pavilion to rehearse her for the afternoon  mr underwood no words can say what we owe you  you are the saving of our church education  lance laughed at the magniloquent thanks and asked how the intimation had been received  it appeared that on the previous evening oleary had come to him and in swaggering fashion had demanded twenty pounds as payment for his stepdaughters performance at the masque  mr flight had replied that she had freely promised her services gratuitously for the benefit of the object in view  at this the man had scoffed talked big about her value and the meanness of parsons and threatened to withdraw her  rather weakly the clergyman had said the question should be considered but that he could do nothing without the committee and oleary had departed uttering abuse  this morning sweetie bob the errandboy had arrived crying with tidings that the shop and house were shut up nobody answered his knock mother butterfly had cut in the night gone off he believed with the circus and miss lydia too and there was twoand ninepence owing to him besides his—his—his character  he knew that mother butterfly had gone to the magistrates meeting the day before and paid her fine of twentyfive pounds and he also believed that she had paid up her rent and sold her shop to a neighbouring pastrycook but he had never expected her to depart in this sudden way and then he began to shed fresh tears over his two andninepence and his character  mr flight began to reassure him with promises to speak for him as an honest lad while lance bethought himself of the old organists description of that wandering star without home without country without morals without religion without anything and recollected with a shudder that turningpoint in his life when edgar had made him show off his musical talent and when felix had been sharp with him and the office of the pursuivant looked shabby dull and dreary  nothing more could be done except to make bold assurances to mr flight that monas place should be supplied and then to hurry home meeting on his way a policeman who told him that the circus was certainly gone away and promised to let him know whither  he was glad to find that gerald had not come downstairs having overslept himself in the morning after a wakeful night  he was dressing when his uncle knocked at his door  here is a shock gerald  i hope it is chiefly to our masque these people have absconded and carried off our poor little mona  what  absconded  my sister  i must be after them instantly cried gerald wildly snatching at his coat  what good would that do you cant carry her off vi et armis  send the police  no possibility  the fine is paid the rent and all  they have gone it seems with the circus  ah  depend upon it that fellow has paid the fine and bought the poor child into slavery with it  carried her off in spite of our demurring and the vicars prosecution  i must save her  ill go after and outbid  no hurry gerald  a circus is not such a microscopical object but that it can be easily traced  a policeman has promised to find out where and meanwhile we must attend to our present undertaking  gerald strode up and down the room in a fiery fit of impatience and indignation muttering furious things quite transformed from the listless ironical youth hitherto known to his family  come lancelot said our first duty is to do justice to our part francie vanderkist will take mona  hang mona you care for nothing on earth but your fiddling and songs  i do not see that being frantic will make any difference to the situation  all in our power is being done  meanwhile we must attend to what we have undertaken  gerald rushed about a little more but finally listened to his uncles representation that the engrossing employment was good to prevent the peril of disturbing the two whom they were so anxious to spare  fely came running up with a message that aunt cherie and anna had been sent for to see about the decorations of the art stall and that they would have to eat their breakfast without them  appetite for breakfast was lacking but lance forced himself to swallow as one aware of the consequences of fasting for agitations sake and he nearly crammed gerald so that adrian and fely laughed and he excused himself by declaring that he wanted his turkeycock to gobble and not pipe  for which bit of pleasantry he encountered a glare from geralds hungarian eyes  he was afraid on one side to lose sight of his nephew on the other he did not feel equal to encounter a scolding from marilda so he sent adrian and fely down to the marine hotel to fetch franceska while he stole a moment or two for greeting clement who was much better and only wanted more conversation than he durst give him     chapter xxi  the masque    your honours players hearing your amendment are come to play a pleasant comedy                              taming of the shrew    poor franceska  first she encountered cousin marildas wonder and displeasure and the declaration that uncle lance went absolutely crazy over his musical mania  she had seen it before in poor edgar and knew what it came to  she wanted to telegraph at once to alda to ask her consent or refusal to franceskas appearance but sir ferdinand stopped this on the ground that the circumstances could not be explained and told her to content herself with clements opinion  this she sent sophy and emilia to ascertain before she would let them and the boys escort francie to her destination  clement not yet up had to hold a lit de justice and pronounce that uncle lance was to be fully trusted to ask nothing unbecoming or unnecessary and that francie would have nothing to do with any one except him and gerald  besides said emilia as they walked up nobody will find it out the posters are all over the town mona miss ludmilla schnetterling  so the sisters were received with a murmur on their delay  the pretty dress prepared for mona was found to be too small for the tall shapely franceska and sophy undertook to alter it while poor francies troubles began  whether it was that uncle lance and gerald were in a secret state of turmoil or that their requirements were a good deal higher than for the vale leston audience or perhaps that she had no inheritance of actress traditions they certainly were a great deal sharper with her than they had been ever before or with ludmilla  gerald derided her efforts sarcastically and uncle lance found fault goodhumouredly but seriously and she was nearly in tears by eleven oclock when the procession was to take place  she was quite surprised when lance turned to her and said—  thank you my dear you are doing capitally  i shall be proud of my daughter mona  quite in spirits again she was sewn by sophy into her still unfinished dress her beautiful light golden flax tresses were snooded her highland scarf pinned on her shoulder and she hurried to her uncle now berobed and bewigged with gerald in full highland garb looking very much disgusted especially when her uncle said—  well done francie  youll cut that poor little thing out in looks and voice if not in acting  oh uncle i sang so horridly  you can do better if you try i wish there was time to train you well do the logs duet once more after this tomfoolery  ha captain armytage  you are an awful pirate and no mistake  where did you get that splendid horsepistol  from my native home as well as my sword but i wrote to willingham for the rest  this will be an uncommonly pretty marchpast  the girls look so well and all out of doors too  this was decidedly a great advantage the trees grass and blue sky lending a great grace to the scene  the procession started from the garden entrance of the hotel headed by the town band in uniform and the fire brigade likewise very proud of themselves especially the little terrier whom nothing would detach from one of the firemen then came the four seasons belonging to the flower stall appropriately decked with flowers the italian peasants with flat veils bright aprons and white sleeves maura whites beauty conspicuous in the midst but with unnecessary nods and becks  then came the mediaeval damsels in ruffs and high hats the highland maidens with valetta and primrose giggling unmanageably and aunt janes troop of the various costumes of charity children from the green frocks long mittens and tall white caps and the jemima placid flat hats and long waists down to the red cloaks poke straw bonnets and blue frocks of the lady bountiful age  these were followed by the merry fairies and elves then by the buccaneers and the captive prisoners and the rear was brought up by macprospero as lord rotherwood called him with his niece on his arm and his nephew by his side  when the central stall or bothie in the carrara grounds was reached after passing in full state and order over two of the bridges the procession halted before a group of the rotherwood family sir jasper and lady merrifield lady flight and other local grandees with the clergy who had declined to walk in procession there the performers spread themselves out singing autolycuss song led of course by macprospero lady rotherwood with as much dignity as the occasion permitted declared the bazaar open and the marquis hoped every one was going to ruin themselves in the cause of christian education  the first idea of every one was luncheon except that lance laid hands on his unfortunate angus and mona for their duet in the midst of which lord rotherwood made a raid on them  there  im sure prospero never was so cruel as to starve whats hisname  come in and have some food—it is just by  they found themselves in a diningroom in the presence of lady rotherwood her son and daughter and a sprinkling of merrifields and actors in full swing of joyous chatter mysie and lady phyllis telling all that was specially to be admired and lord rotherwood teasing them about the prices and their wicked extortions in the name of goodness gillian snubbing poor captain armytage in his splendid buccaneer dress ivinghoe making himself agreeable to franceska whose heightened carnation tints made her doubly lovely through her shyness  gerald and dolores in the less lively vicinity of the marchioness carrying on a lowtoned conversation which however enabled gerald to sustain nature with food better than he had done at breakfast  it did not last long  the sellers had to rush off to relieve those who had begun the sale and the performance was to commence at three oclock so that the final preparations had to be hurried through  geraldine had made the tour of the stalls on the arm of anna to admire them in their first freshness and put finishing touches wherever solicited  the rocca marina conservatories were in rare glory orchids in weird beauty lovely lilies of all hues fabulously exquisite ipomoeas all that heart could wish  before them a fountain played in the midst of blue pink and white lotus lilies and in a flowerdecked house the seasons dispensed potflowers bouquets and buttonholes the miss simmondses and their friends with simpering graces that made geraldine glad to escape and leave them to the young men who were strolling up  at carrara was the stall in which she was chiefly interested and which had been arranged with a certain likeness to italian gardens the statues and other devices disposed among flowers the dirty boy judiciously veiled by the puzzle monkey and the front of the summerhouse prolonged by pillars sham but artistic  jasper was zealously photographing group after group handing his performances over to his assistant for printing off  kalliope looked in her costume most beautiful and dignified  her sister grown to almost equal beauty was hurrying off to see the masque flushed and eager while gillian and one or two others were assisting in sales that would be rather slack till after the performance  here geraldine purchased only a couple of mousetraps leaving further choice to be made after the stranger purchasers  here sir jasper and general mohun came up and gave her a good deal of curious information about bernards bevy of figures in indian costumes and having the offer of such a strong arm as the generals she dispensed with anna who was really wanted to help with the very popular photographs  they passed the refreshments at present chiefly haunted by mrs edgars boys ready to eat at any time of day they looked civilly at the varley elizabethans and found lady merrifield in the midst o£ her bothie made charming with fresh green branches and purple heather imported by the vanderkists  thats penbeacon ling  i know that red tint in the mauve said geraldine ill give you halfacrown if your decorations can spare that spiring spray  and she put it in her bosom after touching it with her lips  you have a bower for the lady of the lake she added  im afraid im only roderick dhus mother laughed lady merrifield but i shall have more ladies when the masque is done  now i have only mysie  and oh cried mysie please set up the nurse in the nursery gardens right  wilfred knocked her over and she wont stand right for me  perverse woman  there  no i shall not buy anything now i shall wait for primrose and the refuse   how pretty it does all look  ah mr brownlow as she shook hands with the curate  i left my brother john at your house he said i persuaded him to run down this morning with my mother and see our doings and he was glad of the opportunity of looking in upon the vicar  how very kind of him  we were wishing to know what he thought  no doubt he will be here presently  my mother is at the masque there was not a seat for us so i took him down to st andrews rock  not a seat  the fiveshilling seats  not the fraction of one  numbers standing outside  pity there cant be a second performance  four hundred seats  thats a hundred pounds  we shall beat the schoolboard yet  so with the general politely expressing that there was no saying what rockquay owed to the hearty cooperation of such birds of passage as herself and her brothers she travelled on to the charity stall which miss mohun had quaintly dressed in the likeness of an oldfashioned school with big alphabet and samplers flourished copies and a stuffed figure of a contrarey naughty boy with a magnificent fools cap  she herself sat behind it the very image of the shenstone schoolmistress with wide white cap black poke bonnet crossed kerchief red cloak and formidable rod and her myrmidons were in costume to match  it was very attractive and took every one by surprise but geraldine had had enough by this time and listened to miss mohuns invitation and entreaty that she would preside over teacups for the weary in the drawingroom  the privacy of the houses had been secured by ropes extending from the stalls to the rails of the garden and geraldine was conducted by her two generals to the verandah where they installed her and lingered as was usual with her squires always won by her spirited talk till messages came to each of them from below that some grandee was come who must be talked to and entertained  already however armine brownlow had brought up his brother the doctor—john or jock an old friend—over first clements district and then his bed  well mrs grinstead i can compliment you much on your brother he is very materially better and his heart is recovering tone  i am very glad and thankful  i only wish you had seen him last week  he was better then but he had a worry about our little nephew which threw him back  so he told me  the more quiescent and amused you can keep him the more chance of a fair recovery there will be  i am glad he thinks of dining with the party tonight  i am glad he still thinks  i had to come away early when he had still left it doubtful  i encouraged the idea with all my might  do you think he will be able to go back to his parish  most assuredly not while every worry tells on him in this manner you must if possible take him abroad for the winter before he begins to think about it  he has leave of absence for a year  dating from easter i think  keep him in warm climates as long as you can  find some country to interest him without overfatigue and you will i hope be able to bring him home fit to consider the matter  that is all you promise  all i dare—not even to promise—but to let you hope for  an interruption came one of the young ladies had had her skirt trodden on and wanted it to be stitched up  then came jane mohun to deposit a handkerchief which some one had dropped  i can stay a moment she said no one will come to buy till the masque is ended oh this red cloak will be the death of me  you look highly respectable without it  i shall only put it on for the coup doeil at first  oh geraldine what is to be done with that horrid little maura  the pretty little greek girl—mrs hendersons sister  oh it is not mrs hendersons fault nor my sister adas either except that the little wretch must have come round her  i know ada meant to stay away on that very account  what account  ivinghoes to be sure  oh  i forgot  you are so much one of us that i did not remember that you did not know how the foolish boy was attracted—no thats too strong a word—but she thought he was when they were here to open rotherwood park  he did flirt and victoria— his mother i mean—did not like it at all  she would never have come this time but that i assured her that maura was safe at gastein  is it so very undesirable  my dear  their father was old whites brother a stonemason  he was raised from the ranks but his wife was a greek peasant—and if you had seen her when the merrifield children called her the queen of the white ants  ivinghoe is naturally as stiff and formal as his mother i am not much afraid for him except that no one knows what that fever will make of a young man and i dont want him to get his father into a scrape  there i have exhaled it to you and there is a crowd as if the masque was done with  it was and the four hundred auditors were beginning to throng about the stalls strays coming up from time to time and reporting with absolute enthusiasm on the music and acting  marilda was one of these  well cherry i saw no great harm in it after all and francie looked sweetly pretty just as poor alda did when she first came to us  lance must make his own excuses to alda   but gerald looked horridly ill  he sang very well but he had such red spots on his cheeks  id get clements doctor to sound him  lord rotherwood was quite complimentary  now i must go and buy something—i hear there is the dirty boy—i think i shall get it for fernans new baths and washhouses  then isnt there something of yours cherry  not to compete with the dirty boy  ah now you are laughing at me cherry  quite right i am glad to hear you do it again  the next visitor was lance  oh cherry how cool you look  give me a cup of tea—not refreshmentstall tea  thats right  little francie is a perfect gem—looks and voice—not acting—no time for that  heighho  wheres gerald  somewhere about after that merrifield niece with the doleful name i fancy  he did very well when it came to the scratch  have you seen dr brownlow  he has been to see clement  thats firstrate  where shall i find him  somewhere about according to your lucid direction i suppose  what does he think of old tina  geraldine told him and was rather surprised when he whistled as though perplexed and as fergus rushed in glorious with the news that sir ferdinand had bought his collection of specimens for the bexley museum he rose up looking perturbed to find dr brownlow  next came gillian with news that the dirty boy was sold to lady travis underwood  and maynt i stay a moment or two said she  now the masque is over that captain armytage is besetting me again  poor captain armytage  why do you pity him  he is going to join his ship the sparrow hawk next week and that ought to content him  ships do not always fill a mans heart  then they ought  i dont like it she added in a petulant tone i have so much to learn and to do i dont want to be tormented about a tiresome man  well he will be out of your way tomorrow  geraldine that is a horrid tone  if you choose to put meaning in it i cannot help it  and that horrid little maura  she is in the most awful flutter standing on tiptoe and craning out her foolish little neck  i know it is all after ivinghoe and he never has come to our counter kalliope has been trying to keep her in order but im sure the queen of the white ants must have been just like that when she got poor captain white to marry her  kalliope is so much vexed i can see she never meant to have her here  and aunt ada stayed away on purpose  has she seen much of him  hardly anything but he did admire her and she never was like kalliope  but what would aunt ada do  oh dear theres that man he has no business at aunt janes charity stall  i shall go and tell him so  geraldine had her little private laugh before adrian came up to her with a great ship in his arms—  take care of this aunt cherry  she is going to sail on the ewe i bought her with the sovereign uncle fernan gave me  geraldine gave the ship her due admiration and asked after the masque  oh that went off pretty well  i wouldnt have been fely  all the ladies went and said pretty dear when he sang his song about the bats back  disgusting  but then he has not been a fellow at school so he made his bow and looked as if he didnt mind it  and francie  francie looked perfectly stunning  everybody said so and she sang —well she sang better than she did at home but she was in an awful funk though i kept on looking at her and shouting bravo to encourage her and she must have heard my voice for i was just in front  i hope she was encouraged  but she is very stupid  i wanted to take her round to all the stalls and show her what to buy with the five jubilee sovereigns uncle fernan gave her for you know she has never been anywhere or seen anything  i thought she would like it and besides all our fellows say they never saw such an awfully pretty girl and they cant believe all that hair is her own—she had it all down her back you know—so i told them i would let them have a pull to try  poor francie  she declined i suppose  well there was that ridiculous swell ferguss cousin ivinghoe and he has taken her off to see the stupid flowers in the conservatory  i told sophy i wondered she permitted such flirting but of course francie knew no better  oh and you couldnt stop it  not i though i called her over and over again to look at things but lord ivinghoe always hung about and gave one no peace  so i just told sophy to look after her and came off to tell you  oh my here is old miss mohun coming up  i shall be off  i want some chocolate creams  mrs simmonds has got some splendid ones  miss mohun was coming in fact  well geraldine the masque was a great success  people beg to have it repeated so many could not get in  and it is worth at least a hundred pounds to us  people whose opinion is worth having were quite struck  they say your brother really ought to have been a great composer and singer  i think he might have been if he had not given up his real passion to come to the help of my dear eldest brother  and he is really happier as he is  i knew there was conquest in his face  and that dear little elf of a boy—what a voice  so bright and so arch too  then the miranda— she took all by surprise  i believe half the spectators took her for the little butterfly  ah the poor little butterfly is flown  there was nothing for it but to make francie act as she had taken the part once before  her acting was no great things they say—ladylike but frightened her voice is lovely and as to her looks—people rave about them tell me she is not lady travis underwoods daughter  oh no she is annas sister adrians sister  so i told lady rotherwood i was sure it was so  the travis underwoods have no children but they adopted emilia when i took anna and they have brought three vanderkists to this affair francie has never been from home before it is all quite new to her then recollecting what adrian had repeated she thought it fair to add my sister was left very badly off and all these eight girls will have nothing of their own  well i dont suppose anything will come of it  i hope it will put no folly into her head but at any rate it effaces that poor silly little maura  i hope too as you say your niece is so innocent it will do her no harm  i dont suppose any possibilities have occurred to the child  lord rotherwood here came on the scene  jenny theres an offer for your boy in the fools cap and mysie doubts if she ought to let him go  well mrs grinstead i think you have the best of it  lookers on etc  looking on has always been my trade  you heard the rehearsal of the masque i believe but you did not hear that charming mona  no she had to take the part suddenly  her uncle had to tyrannize over her to save the whole thing  we are much indebted to him and to her said lord rotherwood courteously  she looked as if she hated it all in the first scene though she warmed up afterwards  i must say i liked her the better for her shyness  her little brother thinks she recovered in consequence of his applause said geraldine smiling  ah i saw him  and heard  a little square fellow—very sturdy  yes the dutchman comes out in him and he has droll similitudes very curious in one who never saw his father nor any but his underwood relations  so much the better for him perhaps i have and ought to have great faith in uncles breeding  i am glad to meet sir ferdinand travis underwood  i have often come across him about london good works  yes he is an excellent man  not wholly english is he judging by the depth of colour in those eyes  no his mother was a mexican partly indian  we used to call him the cacique and geraldine had the pleasure of telling his story to an earnest listener but interruption came in the shape of sir ferdinand himself who announced that he had hired a steamyacht wherein to view the regatta and begged lord rotherwood to join the party  this was impossible as the marquis was due at an agricultural dinner at clarebridge but in return in the openness of his heart he invited the travis underwoods to their dinner that evening at the hotel where the merrifields and the underwoods were already engaged little boys and all  thank you my lord but we are too large a party  we have three vanderkist girls with us and anna and her brother are to join them to be with their sister  never mind never mind  the great hall will have room for all  still fernan demurred knowing that marilda had ordered dinner at the quay hotel and that even liberal payment would not atone for missing the feasting of the millionaires so the matter was compounded by his promise to bring all his party who were not ready for bed up to spend the evening  and geraldine perceived from lady rotherwoods ceremonious politeness that she did not like it at all though she never said so even to lady merrifield  however it was a very bright evening  gerald had sung himself into spirits and then found dolores and retreated into the depths of the garden with her explaining to her all about his sister and declaring that his first object must be to rescue her and then unless his name was cleared and he had to resume all his obligations the new life would be open to him and he had no fear of not succeeding as a journalist or if not a musical career was possible to him as dolores had now the opportunity of fully perceiving  his sweet voice had indeed filled her with double enthusiasm  she had her plan for lecturing and that very morning she had received from her father permission to enter a ladies college and the wherewithal  she would qualify herself for lecturing by the time he had fixed his career and they built their airy castles not on earth but on railroads and cycles and revelled on them as happily as is common to lovers whether in castle or in cottage  certainly if the prospect held out to her had been vale leston priory it would not have had the same zest and when in the evening they joined the dinnerparty there was a wonderful look of purpose and of brightness on both their faces  and emilia who had been looking for him all the afternoon to tell him gerald i am really going to be a nurse only got for answer an absent indeed  yes at st roques  i hope i shall never be a patient there he said in his half mocking tone  youll look jolly in the cap and apron  im to be there all the time they are in america and—  well i wonder you dont go and study the institutions  but gerald  his eye was wandering and he sprang forward to give dolores a flower that she had dropped  lancelot knowing what was before gerald and having always regarded vale leston with something of the honours of paradise could not understand that joyous look of life so unlike geralds usual weary passive expression  he himself felt something of the depression that was apt to follow on musical enjoyment he saw all the failures decidedly enough not to be gratified with the compliments he met on all sides and he bitterly thought on the morrow when he saw how clement was getting animated over a discussion on church matters and how geraldine was enjoying herself  and as to that pretty franceska who had blossomed into the flower of the flock he foresaw heart break for her when he watched the marchionesss countenance on hearing that her son had accepted sir ferdinands invitation to cruise tomorrow in the yacht  vainly was ivinghoe reminded of the agricultural dinner  he was only too glad to escape it and besides he thought he could be there in time  nevertheless the present was delightful and after dinner the young people all went off to the great assemblyroom whence anna came back to coax uncle lance to play for them  all the elders jumped up from their several discussions  even lady rotherwood moved on looking as benign as her feelings would permit  jane squeezed geraldines arm exceedingly amused  lance struck up by request an oldfashioned country dance lord rotherwood insisted that lily should dance with him as the remnant of forty good years ago or more and with sir roger de coverley the day ended  poor little maura making an excuse to wander about the gardens in the moonlight saw the golden locks shining through the open windows and lord ivinghoe standing over them went home and cried herself to sleep over the fickleness of the nobility when she had better have cried over her own unjustified romance excited by a few kindly speeches and a cup of tea  and emilia  what was geralds one laughing turn with her compared with his long talk with dolores in the moonlight     chapter xxii  the regatta    she saw a forgetmenot in the grass gillyflower gentle rosemary ah why did the lady that little flower pass while the dews fell over the mulberrytree                                        kenealy   such of the party as were not wanted for the second day of the bazaar and were not afraid of mal de mer had accepted the yachting invitation except the three elders at st andrews rock  even adrian and felix were suffered to go under sophys charge on the promise to go nowhere without express permission and not to be troublesome to any one  sophy can say now boys as effectively as wilmet said geraldine when she met lance who had been to the quay to see them off  she did not say so to much advantage with her own boys said clement  we werent harewoods returned lance and john never could bear to see a tight hand over them but theres good in them that will come out some day  clement gave an emphatic humph as he sat down to the second breakfast after anna had gone to the cliff to resume her toils  who are gone asked geraldine  poor marilda smilingly declaring she shall be in misery in the cabin all the time fernan and four vanderkists general mohun sir jasper and some of his progeny but others stay to help miss mohun finish up the sales  does lord ivinghoe go  oh yes he came rushing down just in time  francie was looking like a morning rose off the cloister at vale leston  i am sorry they have another day of it  i dont see how it can come to good said geraldine  perhaps her roses may fade at sea said clement and disenchantment may ensue  at least i hope alda may not hear of it or she will be in an agony of expectation as long as hope lasts  gerald is gone of course  oh yes said lance who had had a farewell from him with the words get it over while i am out of the way and tell them i dont mind  cursory and incomprehensible but conclusive and lance who minded enough to have lost sleep and gained a headache marvelled over young mens lightness and buoyancy  he had seen dr brownlow and arranged that there should be a call as a friend in due time after the communication in case it should hurt clement and when geraldine observed merrily that now they were quit of all the young ones they could feel like old times he was quite grieved to disturb her pleasure  clement however began by taking out a letter and saying—  here is a remarkable missive left for me yesterday—if the rev underwood wishes to hear of something to his advantage he should communicate with mr ol care of mr john bast van proprietor whitechapel  an impostor said he  i am afraid not said lance  clement i fear there is no doubt that she is that singing hungarian woman who was the ruin of edgars life  geralds mother exclaimed geraldine  even so  but she is gone  she gave up all rights  she cant claim anything has she worried him  yes poor boy  she has declared that she had actually a living husband at the time she married our poor edgar  of course both broke out into exclamations that it was impossible and lance had to tell them of his interview with the woman at geralds entreaty  they were neither of them so overcome by the disclosure as he had feared during his long delay  i believe it is only an attempt at extortion said clement  very cruel said geraldine  how—how did my poor boy bear it all this time  he was very much knocked down at first quite overwhelmed but less by the loss than by the shame and the imputation on his father  it was no fault of dear edgars  no indeed  i am glad fernan is here to go over again what edgar told him  we may be quite satisfied so far  and is it needful to take it up asked geraldine wistfully  if we dont believe it the horrid story would get quashed  no cherry said clement  if you think it over you will see that we must investigate  i should be relieved indeed to let it alone but it would not be fair towards lance there and his boys  lance made a strange noise of horror and deprecation then added—  i dont believe gerald would consent to let it alone  no now he knows of course  he is a rightminded generous boy said geraldine  i was wrong  did you say he was very much upset  just at first when he came to me at night  i was obliged to dragoon him and myself too to throw it off enough to be able to get through our performance yesterday  how thankful i am to the regatta that it is not our duty to the country to go through it again today however he seems to have rebounded a good deal  he was about all the latter part of the day with miss mohun  i saw him dancing and laughing with some of them  and he parted from me very cheerfully telling me to assure you he did not mind whatever that may mean  he knows that nothing can disturb our love for him edgars little comfort passed on to bear us up said cherry tearfully  oh yes i know what he meant—felixs delight my darling always  it strikes me said lance that if he can save his sister—  geraldine started  oh the cigargirl  only by that mothers side  that is true but she is his halfsister and he is evidently much drawn towards her  she is a nice little thing and i believe he made much of her on the rehearsal day  i saw they got on much better together and i think she was aware of the relationship  yes it is quite right of him said geraldine but she will be a drag on him all his life  now what ought we to do  shall you answer this letter to the care of the vanman clem  i shall think and wait till i have seen gerald and travis  this letter is evidently written simply in the hope of raising money from me not in any friendly spirit  certainly not said lance  having failed to blackmail gerald and discovered that you are the heir they begin on you but not from any gratitude to you  sweetie bob as they call the exerrandboy gives a fine account of their denunciations of the tall parson who brought the bobbies down on them  lance felt much reassured by clements tone and all the more when he had seen dr brownlow who made a thorough examination and came to the conclusion that clement had recovered tone so that the shock whatever it was that his brother dreaded had done no present damage but that he was by no means fit for any strain of work or exertion should be kept from anxiety as much as possible and had better spend the winter in a warm climate  it was not likely—jock brownlow said it with grief and pain—that he would ever be able to return to the charge of st matthews but as he had a years holiday there was no need to enter on that subject yet and in a quiet country place with a curate he might live to the age of man in tolerable health if he took care of himself or his sister took care of him for some time to come  so much relieved was lance that he recollected that he had laid in no stock of presents for those at home and went up to profit by the second days reductions when he secured geraldines portrait of davy blake for his wife and a statuette of st cecilia for dr may some charming watercolours for robina and ethel besides various lesser delights for the small fry his own and the flock at vale leston besides a cushion for aldas sofa  john inglesant had been bought by a connoisseur by special commission  he heard at every stall triumphant accounts of the grand outlay of the travis underwoods and rotherwoods and just the contrary of mrs pettifer whom he encountered going about in search of bargains and heard haggling for a handsome tablecover because it was quite aesthetic and would not do except in a large house so of course it had not sold  the mousetraps had been a great success and there were very few left of them  they really owed as much to lance as did the play for he had not only printed them at as small a cost as possible but had edited pruned and got them into shape more than any of the young lady authors suspected  the interpretation of handwriting had likewise succeeded in obtaining many clients and a large pile of silver coins  anna who was hovering near was delighted to show him that her sister sophys writing had been declared to indicate homely tastes an affectionate disposition great perspicuity of perception much force of character and franceskas scarcely yet formed showed that she was affectionate romantic and of all things in the world fond of horses and of boating  emilias was held as a great blunder for she was said to have an eye devoted to temporal advantages also volatile yet of great determination triumphing over every obstacle and in much danger of selfdeception  the triumph at least is true said anna now she has her way about the nursing  has she  i did not know it  yes she is to try it for a year while cousins fernan and marilda go out to their farm in the rocky mountains  just then there was a little commotion and a report came up that a boat had been run down and some one drowned  somebody said one of those acting last night—a buccaneer  somebody else a naval man then it was the buccaneer captain and mrs pettifer was exclaiming poor captain armytage  he was in our theatricals i remember but they thought him rather high  but he was a fine young man  poor captain armytage  lance had sufficient interests in those at sea to be anxious and turned his steps to the gates to ascertain the facts when he was overtaken by gillian with a hat hastily thrown over her snooded hair and highland garb hurrying along and looking very white  mr underwood  oh did you hear who it was  no certainty  i was going down to find out  you as he saw her purpose had better not come  there will be a great crowd  i will come back and tell you  oh no i must  this is the short way  her hands trembled so that she could hardly undo the private fastening of miss mohuns garden and she began to dash down the cliff steps  just at the turn where the stairway was narrowest lance heard her exclaim and saw that she had met face to face no other than captain armytage himself  oh is it and she so tottered on the rocky step that the hand he had put out in greeting became a support and a tender one as lance said perhaps with a little malice—  we heard that the buccaneer captain had come to grief  i he laughed and gillian shook herself up asking—  werent you run down seeing even as she spoke that not a drop of wet was traceable  me  what did you think i was going to peril my life in a long shore concern like this said he with a merry laugh betraying infinite pleasure  but did nothing happen  nobody drowned she asked half disappointed  not a mouse  a little chap one of the fairies yesterday tumbled off the seawall where he had no business to be but he swam like a cork  we threw him a rope and hauled him up  wherewith he gave his arm to gillian who was still trembling and clasped it so warmly that lance thought it expedient to pass them as soon as possible and continue his journey on the staircase giving a low whistle of amusement and pausing to look out on the beautiful blue bay crowded with the white sails of yachts and pleasureboats with brilliant festoons of little flags and here and there the feather of steam from a launch  he could look for he was feeling lighter of heart now that the communication was over  perhaps lance would have been edified could he have heard the colloquy—  gillian you do care for me after all  gillian tried to take her arm away and to say common humanity but she did not get the words out  no no he said  confess that if it had been that fisherboy you would not be here now and he kept tight the arm that she was going to take away  her face was in a flame  well well and if—if it wasnt you need not make such a fuss about it  not when it is the first ray of hope you have afforded me for the only joy of my life  i never meant to afford—  but you could not help  oh dont  i never meant it  oh dear  i never meant to be worried about troublesome things like this till i had got older and learnt a great deal more and now you want to upset it all  it is very—very disagreeable  but you need not be upset poor ernley armytage pleaded remember i am going away for three years  may i not take hope with me  gillian paused  well again she said i do like you—i mean i dont mind you as much as most people you have done something and you have some sense  his look of rapture at these very moderate words quite overpowered her and the tears welled up into her eyes while she made a sudden change of tone  there there—of course it is all right  im a nasty creature and if you like me it is more than i deserve only whatever you do dont make me cry  ive got all the horrid dolls and penwipers and bags and rags to get rid of  may i talk to your mother  oh yes if you can catch her  she will be ever so much more good to you than i and i only hope she will warn you what a tartar i am  wherewith gillian threw off her hat swung open the gate and dashed like a hunted hare up to her mothers stall where in truth she had been wanted since only two helpers had remained to assist in the cheapening and final disposal of the remnants  lady merrifield read something in those wild eyes and cheeks burning but the exigencies of the moment obliged her to hold her peace and apply herself to estimating the halfprice of the cushions and tablecloths she rejoiced to see departing as well as to preserve wits enough not to let gillian sell the indian screen for two shillings and sixpence under the impression that this was the half of five pounds  mysie was the only one who kept her senses fairly undisturbed and could balance between her duty to the schools and her desire to gratify a child happy in that she never saw more than one thing at a time valetta and primrose were yachting so that the distraction was less and captain armytage lingered round taking messages and looking in wistful earnestness for some one to be disengaged  yet there was something in his eyes that spoke of the calmness of an attained object and miss mohun who had sold off all her remaining frocks and pinafores at a valuation to marilda for some institution and was free to help her sister saw in a moment that his mind was settled  yet speech was scarcely possible till the clearance was finally effected by a dutch auction when captain armytage distinguished himself unexpectedly as auctioneer and made an end even of the last sachet though it smelt so strongly of lipsalve that he declared that a bearer must be paid to take it away  but the purchaser was a big sailor who evidently thought it an elegant gift for his sweetheart  by the time it was gone the yachters had come home  captain armytage seized on sir jasper who already know his purpose and wished him success though withheld from saying a word to urge the suit by lady merrifields assurances that to hurry gillians decision would be fatal to success and that a reproof for petulance would be worse she did not know whether to wish for the engagement or not gillian was her very dear and sufficient companion more completely so than mysie who was far less clever and she had sometimes doubted whether common domestic life beginning early was for the girls happiness and full development but she knew that her husband would scout these doubts as nonsense and both really liked ernley armytage and had heard nothing but what was to his advantage in every way when they had been in his own county and had seen his neighbours and his family  however she could only keep quiet and let her heart rise in a continual aspiration at every silent moment for her childs guidance  before she had had her moment of speech with either she heard her husband calling gillian and she knew that he was the one person with whom his daughter never hid her true self in petulance or sarcasm so gillian met him in the generals sittingroom gasping as she turned the handle of the door  he set a chair for her and spoke gravely  my dear he said i find you have gained the heart of a good man  i am sure i never meant it half whispered gillian  what is that—you never meant it  i never supposed you capable of such an unladylike design  you mean that you were taken by surprise  no i did see what he was at and she hung her head  you guessed his intentions  yes papa but i didnt want—  try to explain yourself said sir jasper as she broke off  ii did wish to go on improving myself and being useful  surely it was not wrong papa  dont you see i did not want to let myself be worried into letting myself go out and spoiling all my happiness and improvement and work and getting to care for somebody else  but you have consented  well when i was frightened for him i found i did care and he got hold of me and made me allow that i did and now i suppose nobody will give me any peace  stay gillian—keep yourself from this impatient mood  i think i understand your unwillingness to overthrow old associations and admit a new overmastering feeling  thats just it papa said gillian looking up  i cant bear that overmastering feeling nor the being told every one must come to it it seems such folly  folly that eve was given to be a helpmeet and as the bride the church to her bridegroom  look high enough gillian and the popular chatter will not confuse your mind  you own that you really love him  oh papa not half so much as mamma or mysie or jasper but—but i think i might  is that all gillian  no one would coerce you  shall i send him away and tell him not to think of it  remember it is a serious thing—nay an unworthy thing to trifle with a rightminded man  gillian sat clasping the elbow of her chair her dark eyes fixed at last she said—  papa i do feel a sort of trust in him a sort of feeling as if my life and all goodness and all that would be safe with him and i couldnt bear him to go quite away and hear no more of him only i do wish it wouldnt happen now and if there is a fuss about it i shall get cross and savage and be as nasty as possible i know i shall  you cant exercise enough selfcommand to remember what is due—i would say kind and considerate—to a man who has loved you through all your petulance and discouragement and now is going to a life not without peril for three years  suppose a mishap gillian—how would you feel as to your treatment of him on this last evening  oh papa if you talk in that way i must i must and she burst into tears  sir jasper bent over her and gave her a kiss—a kiss that from him was something to remember  it was late and summonses to a hurried meal were ringing through beechcroft cottage where the clipstone party waited to see the illuminations  talk was eager between the sellers and the sailors as valetta described the two parties the fate of the indian screen and the misconduct of cockneys in their launches were discussed by many a voice but gillian was unwontedly silent  her mother had no time for more than a kiss before the shouts of wilfred fergus and primrose warned them that the illuminations were beginning  she could only catch mysie and beg her to keep the younger ones away from gillian and the captain  mysie opened her brown eyes wide and said—  oh  then is it really  really my dear and remember that it is his last evening  oh said mysie again  i never thought it of gill  may i tell valetta  better not my dear if it can be helped  a screaming for gill was heard and mysie hastened to answer it lady merrifield was too much tired to do anything but sit in the garden with miss mohun and look out at the ships glittering with festoons of coloured lamps reflected in the sea but the young people went further afield out on the cliff path to rotherwood park the populace were mainly collected on the quay and this formed a more select promenade though by no means absolute solitude  sir jasper really did keep guard over the path along which gillian allowed her captain to conduct her not exactly knowing which way they were going and quite away from the bay and all its attractions  she heard him out without any of the sharp impatient answers in which her maiden coyness was wont to disguise itself as he told her of his hopes and plans for the time when his three years of the mediterranean should be over  and you see you can go on studying all the time if you must be so clever  i think one ought to make the most of oneself just as you want to rise in your profession  no indeed i could not bear you if you wanted me to sit down and idle or to dawdle yourself  dont grow too clever for me  mother always says that a real man has stuff in him that is quite different from cleverness and yet i could not bear to give that up i am so glad you dont mind  mind  i mind nothing but to know you are caring for me  and you will write to me  i shant know what to say  you will tell of volcanoes and athens and constantinople and egypt and the holy land and i shall have nothing to say but who lectures in college  little you know what that will be to me  it was a curious sensation all the time to gillian with a dawning sense that was hardly yet love—she was afraid of that—but of something good and brave and worthy that had become hers  she had felt something analogous when the big deerhound at stokesley came and put his head upon her lap  but the hound showed himself grateful for caresses and so did her present giant when the road grew rough and she let him draw her arm into his and talk to her  it was the parting for he had to go to london and to his own family the next day early  gillian spoke not a word all through the dark drive to clipstone but when the party emerged into the light her eyes were full of tears  lady merrifield followed her to her room and her words half choked were—  mamma i never knew what a great solemn holy thing it is  will you look me out a prayer to help me to get worthy     chapter xxiii  illuminations    twas in the summertime so sweet    when hearts and flowers are both in season  that who of all the world should meet    in twilight eve but love and reason                                     t moore   that moon and sparkling lights did not shine alone for gerald and dolores  there were multitudes on the cliffs and the beach and sir ferdinand and lady travis underwood with their party had come to an irregular sort of dinnersupper at st andrews rock  with them or rather before them came mr bramshaw the engineer who sent in his card to mr clement underwood and entered with a leathern bag betraying the designs on penbeacon  not that these were more than an introduction  indeed under the present circumstances a definite answer was impossible but there was another question namely that which regarded sophia vanderkist she had indeed long been of age but of course her suitor could not but look to her former guardian for consent and influence  he was a very bearded man pleasantspoken and gentlemanlike and lancelot had prepared his brother by saying that he knew all about the family and they were highly respectable solicitors at minsterham one son a master in the school at stoneborough  so clement listened favourably liked the young man and though his fortunes at present depended on his work and lady vanderkist was no friend to his suit gave him fair encouragement and invited him to join the meal though the party was already likely to be too numerous for the diningroom  that mattered the less when all the young and noisy ones could be placed to their great delight under the verandah outside where they could talk and laugh to their utmost content without incommoding uncle clement or being awed by cousin fernans black beard and caciquelike gravity  how they discussed and made fun over the humours of the bazaar nor was geralds wit the slackest nor his mirth the most lagging  he was very far from depressed now that the first shock was over  he knew himself to be as much loved or better than ever by those whose affection he valued and he was sure of dolores heart as he had never yet been  the latent bohemianism in his nature woke with the prospect of having his own way to make and being free from the responsibilities of an estate and his chivalry was excited by the pleasure of protecting his little halfsister in pursuit of whom he intended to go  so lighthearted enough to amaze the elders who knew the secret he jumped up to go with the rest of the party to the cliff walk where the brilliant ships could best be seen  lance though his headache was as geraldine said visible on his brow declared that night air and seabreeze were the best remedy and went in charge of the two boys lest his dainty ariel should make an excursion over the rocks and the four young ladies were escorted by gerald and the engineer  the elders were much too tired for further adventures and geraldine and marilda were too intimate to feel bound to talk  only a few words dropped now and then about emilia and her hospital where she was to be left for a year while fernan with marilda visited his american establishments and on their return would decide whether she would return or whether they would take franceska or a younger one in her stead  the desertion put marilda out of heart and she sighed what a pity it was that the girl would not listen to young brown  meanwhile clement was making ferdinand go over with him edgars words about his marriage  they had all been written down immediately after his death and had been given to felix with the certificates of the marriage and birth and of the divorce and they were now no doubt with other documents and deeds in the strongbox at vale leston priory  fernan could only repeat the words which had been burnt in on his memory and promise to hunt up the evidence of the form and manner of the dissolution of the marriage at chicago  like clement himself he very much doubted whether the allegation would not break down in some important point but he wished gerald to be assured that if the worst came to the worst he would never be left destitute since that first meeting—the baptism and the receiving him from the dying father—amounted to an adoption sacred in his eyes  then seeing how wornout clement looked he abetted sibby and geraldine in shutting their patient safe up in his bedroom not to be mislested any more that night said sibby  so he missed the rush of the return  first came the two sober sisters anna and emilia only sorry that aunt cherry had not seen the lovely sea the exquisite twinkle of silvered waves as the moon rose and then the outburst of coloured lights taking many forms and the brilliant fireworks darting to and fro describing curves bursting and scattering their sparks  emilia had however begun by the anxious question—  nan what is it with gerald  i dont quite know  i suspect dolores has somehow teased him though it is not like her  then there is something in it  i cant help believing so but i dont believe it has come to anything  and is she not a most disagreeable girl  those black eyebrows do look so sullen and thunderous  oh no emmie i thought so at first but she cant help her eyebrows and when you come to know her there is a vast deal in her— thought and originality and purpose  i am sure it has been good for gerald  he has seemed more definite and in earnest lately less as if he were playing with everything with all views all round  but his spirits are so odd—so merry and then so grave  that is only during these last few days and i fancy there must be some hitch—perhaps about dolores father and we are all in such haste  emilia did not pursue the subject  she had never indulged in the folly of expecting any signs of actual love from her cousin  she had always known that the family regarded any closer bond as impossible but she had been always used to be his chief confidante and she missed his attention but she would not own this even to herself go she talked of her hospital schemes with much zest and how she should spend her outings at a favourite sisterhood  for said she i am tired of luxury  it had been a delightful walk to anna with her companion sister discussing adrian or emilys plans or sophys prospects  they had come home the sooner for emily had to pack as she was to spend a little while with her mother at vale leston  where was franceska they were somewhat dismayed not to find her but it was one of the nights when everybody loses everybody and no doubt she was with uncle lance or with sophy or gerald  no such thing  here was uncle lance with his two boys in varying kinds of delight adrian pronouncing that it was very jolly the most ripping sight he ever saw then eating voraciously with his eyes half shut and tumbling off to bed like a veritable dutchman said lance who had his own son in a very different mood with glowing cheeks sparkling eyes appetite gone for very excitement as he sprang about and waved his hands to describe the beautiful course of the rockets and the fall of the stars from the roman candles  oh such as i never—never saw  how shall i get pearl and audrey to get even a notion of it  grandpapa will guess in a moment  oh and the sea all shine with a path of—of glory  oh daddy there are things more beautiful than anybody could ever dream of  go and dream then my sprite  try to be as still as you can even if you do go on feeling the yacht and seeing the sparks when you shut your eyes  for you see my head is bad and i do want a chance of sleep  poor daddy  ill try even if the music goes on in my head  good night  that will keep him quieter than anything said lance but i would not give much for the chance of his not seeing the dawn  or you either i fear said geraldine  have you slept since the discovery  i shall make my sleep up at home now i have had the whole out  who comes now  it was sophy with her look of             gentle wishes long subdued            subdued and cherished long   mr bramshaw had brought her to the door and no doubt she and he had had a quiet restful time of patient planning but the not finding francie soon filled her with great alarm and selfreproach for having let herself be drawn away from the party when all had stood together on miss mohuns lawn  she wanted to start off at once in search of her sister and was hardly pacified by finding that gerald was still to come  then however gerald did come and alone  he said he had just seen the clipstone party off  no he had not seen francie there but he added rather as if recovering from a bewilderment as sophy was asking him to come out with her again oh never fear lord ivinghoe was there somewhere  i thought he was gone  no he said the yacht got in too late for the train  never mind sophy depend upon it she is all right  none of the ladies present felt equally pleased but in a minute or two more in came a creature bright lovely and flushed with two starry eyes gleaming like the blue lights on the ships  oh cousin marilda have i kept you waiting  i am so sorry  where have you been  only on the cliff walk  lord ivinghoe took me to see the place where his father had the accident and we watched the fireworks from there  oh it was so nice and still more beautiful when the strange lights were out and the people gone and only the lovely quiet moon shining on the sea and a path of light from venus  i should think so muttered gerald and marilda began—  pretty well miss  i am very sorry to bo so late began francie and geraldine caught an opportunity while shawling marilda to say—  dear good marilda i implore you to say nothing to put it into her head or aldas  i dont think any harm is done yet but it cant be anything  it cant come to good and it would only be unhappiness to them all  oh ah well ill try  but what a chance it would be and how happy it would make poor alda  it cant be  the boys mother would never let him look at her dont dont dont  well ill try not  she kissed her fondly  geralds walk had been with dolores of course a quiet grave earnest talk and walk making them feel how much they belonged to one another and building schemes in which they were to learn the nature of the poor and hardworked by veritably belonging to them and being thus able to be of real benefit  in truth neither of them in their brave youthfulness really regretted vale leston and the responsibilities and as gerald declared he would give it up tomorrow gladly if he could save his name and his fathers from shame but alas the things went together  dolores wished to write fully to her father and that gerald should do the same but she did not wish to have the matter discussed in the family at once before his answer came and gerald had agreed to silence as indeed they would not call themselves engaged till that time  indeed dolores said there was so much excitement about captain armytage that no one was thinking of her     chapter xxiv  counsels of patience    he either fears his fate too much   or his deserts are small who fears to put it to the touch   to win or lose it all   if sibby hoped to keep her long boy from being mislested she was mistaken  he knew too well what was to come and when she knocked at his door with his cup of tea he came to it half dressed to her extreme indignation calling for his shaving water  now master clem if you would only be insinsed enough to keep to your bed you might have miss sophy to speak to you there if nothing else will serve you  is she there  in coorse and miss francie too  what should they do else after colloguing with their young men all night  ah tis a proud woman poor miss alda would be if she could have seen the young lord  and the real beauty is miss francie such as my own babbies were before her bless them  stop cried clement in consternation  it is only a bit of passing admiration  dont say a word about it to the others  as if i would demane myself to the like of them  me that has been fortyseven years with you and yours and had every one of you in my arms the first thing except the blessed eldest that is gone to a better place  would that he were here now sighed clement almost as he had sighed that first morning of his loss  where are those girls  rampaging over the house with sir adrian and his packing of all his rubbish enough to break the heart of a coalheaver  id not let them in to bother their aunt and mr gerald is asleep like a blessed baby  and lance  oh it is down to the sea he is with that child that looks as if he was made of air and lived on live larks  and master lance hes no better—eats like a sparrow and sits up half the night writing for his paper  clement got rid of sibby at last but he was hardly out of his room before sophy descended on him anxious and blushing though he could give her much sympathy and kindly hope of his influence only he had to preach patience  it had been no hasty fancy but there had long been growing esteem and affection and he could assure her of all the aid the family could give with her mother though penbeacon works would be a very insecure foundation for hope  i think gerald would consent said sophy and he will soon be of age  clement could only say humph  one thing i hope is not wrong said sophy but i do trust that no one will tell mother about lord ivinghoe  it is not jealousy i hope but i cannot see that there is anything in it only the very sound would set mother more against philip than ever  you do not suppose that francie is—is touched  no said sophy gravely as an elder she is such a child  she was very much pleased and entertained and went on chattering till i begged her to let us say our prayers in peace  we never talk after that and she went to sleep directly and was smiling when she woke but i do not fancy she will dwell on it or fancy there is more to come unless some one puts it into her head  it was sagely said and clement knew pretty well who was the one person from whom sophy had fears  poor alda improved and altered as she was if such a hope occurred to her would she be able to help imparting it to her daughter and looking out for the fulfilment  loud calls for sophy rang through the house and clement had only time to add—  patience dear child and submission  they not only win the day but are the best preparation for it when it is won  that family of girls had grown up to be a care to one who had trusted that his calling would be a shield from worldly concerns but he accepted it as providential and as a trust imposed on him as certainly as felix had felt the headship of the orphaned house  he was rejoiced to find on coming downstairs that lance had decided on giving another day to family counsels sending off little felix with his cousins who would drop him at the junction to stoneborough whence he would be proud to travel alone  clement took another resolution in virtue of which he knocked at his sisters door before she went down  cherry said he would it be inconvenient to keep francie here just for the present  not at all it would be only too pleasant for anna now that she loses her brother  but why  i want to hinder her from hearing the conclusions that her mother may draw from the diversions of yesterday  i see  it might soon be             he cometh not she said   and sophy will keep her counsel as to those moonlight wanderings when were they to go  by the 1130 train  marilda is coming up first  so the plan was propounded  franceska was only too much charmed to stay in what had indeed been an enchanted coast to her and sophy was sure that mamma would not mind so the matter was settled and the explanatory notes written  the party set off with each little boy hugging a ship in full sail and the two young sisters were disposed of by a walk to clipstone to talk over their adventures  mrs grinstead felt certain of the good manners and reticence prevailing there to prevent any banter about lord ivinghoe and she secured the matter further by a hint to anna  however miss mohun was announced almost as they left the house  she too was full of the bazaar which seemed so long ago to her hearers but with the result of which she was exceedingly delighted  the voluntary schools were secured for the present and the gratitude of the church folk was unbounded especially to the vale leston family who had contributed so greatly to the success of the whole  jane too had watched the evening manoeuvres and perceived with her sharp eyes all that was avowed and not avowed under that rising moon  the pair of whom she had first to speak were ivanhoe and rowena as she called them and she was glad to find that the fair saxon had grown up at vale leston educated by her aunt and sister and imbibing no outside habits or impressions  poor child said jane she looks like a flower one is sorry it should be meddled with  so did my sister stella and there contrary to all our fears the course of true love did run smooth  if it depended entirely on rotherwood himself i think it would said jane but—  she paused and went on ivinghoe is i fear really volage and he is the mark of a good many london mammas  is it true about mrs hendersons sister  theres nothing in it  i believe he danced with her a few times and the silly little thing put her own construction on it but her sister made her confess that he had never said a word to her nor made love in any sense  indeed my sister adeline would never have consented to her coming here if she had believed in it but maura has a greek nature and turns the whites round her fingers  well i hope all will go well with your pretty franceska  i should not like her lovely bloom to be faded by ivinghoe  he is rotherwoods own boy though rather a prig and a man in london  oh you know what that means  we have done notre possible to keep our interpretation from the poor child or any hint of it from reaching her mother  thats right  poor rowena i hope the spark will be blown out or remain only a pleasant recollection  as to little maura she had her lesson when she was reduced to hanging on captain hendersons other arm  she is off today to meet mr white in london  that purpose has been served  and have you not a nearer interest  oh gillian  well captain armytage did get hold of her in what we must now call the lovers walk  yes she has yielded to her fathers great satisfaction and perhaps to her mothers for she will be more comfortable in looking forward to a commonplace life for her than in the dread of modern aberrations  but gillian is very funny very much ashamed of having given in and perfectly determined to go to her college and finish her education which she may as well do while the sparrow hawk is at sea  he is off today and she says she is very glad to be rid of him  she sat down at once to her dynamite as primrose calls it having bound over mysie and valetta never to mention the subject  i tell them that to obey in silence is the way to serve the poor man best  miss mohun was interrupted by the announcement of lady flight and mr flight who came equally eager with delight and gratitude to thank the house of underwood for the triumph  the rest of the clergy of rockquay and half the ladies might be expected and in despair at last of a lucid interval geraldine ordered the carriage for a long drive into the country so as to escape all visitors  even then they could not got up the hill without being stopped four or five times to receive the thanks and compliments which nearly drove gerald crazy so much did he want to hear what his family had to say to his plans that he had actually consented to partake of a dowagerdrive in a landau  he and his uncle had discovered from the police in the course of the morning that ludmilla and her mother had not gone with the circus but had been seen embarking in the alice jane a vessel bound for london  his idea had been to hurry thither and endeavour to search out his halfsister and rescue her but lance had assured him not only that it would probably be a vain quest but that there would be full time to meet the alice jane by land before she could get there by sea  to this he had yielded but not so readily to the representation that the wisest way would be to keep out of sight but to let lance as a less interested party go and interview the van proprietor whose direction had been sent to clement try to see oleary and do his best to bargain for ludmillas release a matter on which all were decided whatever might be the upshot of the question respecting gerald  to leave a poor girl to circus training even if there were no interest in her would have been shocking to rightminded people but when it was such a circus as olearys and the maiden was so good sweet and modest as lida the thought would have been intolerable even without the connection with gerald who had been much taken with all he had seen of her  that is fixed even if we have to bid high for our mona said lance  by all means said geraldine  it will be another question what will be good for her when we have got her  i will take care of that said gerald  next lance went on we must see what proofs or if there be any of this persons story  i expect one of you will have to pay well for them but i had better take a lawyer with me  clement named the solicitor who had the charge of the vanderkist affairs  better than staples or bramshaw  anderson  yes it would be best to have no previous knowledge of the family and no neighbourly acquaintance  moreover i am not exactly an interested party so i may be better attended to  still i very much doubt even if you do get any statement from the woman whether it can be depended upon without verification said clement  from the registers if there are any at these places  exactly and there must be personal inquiry  the first husband gian benista will have to be hunted down dead or alive  yes and another thing said lance if the italian marriage were before the revolution in sicily i expect the ecclesiastical ceremony would be valid but after that the civil marriage would be required  oh groaned gerald if you would let me throw it all up without these wretched quibbles  not your fathers honour said his aunt  nor our honesty said clement  it is galling enough to have your whole position in life depend on the word of a worthless woman but there are things that must be taken patiently as the will of one who knows  it is so hard to accept it as gods will when it comes of human sin said geraldine  human thoughtlessness said clement but as long as it is not by our own fault we can take it as providential and above all guard against impatience the real ruin and destruction  yes said lance sit on a horses head when he is down to keep him from kicking  so you all are sitting on my head said gerald i shall get out and walk—a good rush on the moors  wait at least to allow your head to take in my scheme said clement  provided it is not sitting still said gerald  far from it  only it partly depends on my lady and mistress here—  i guess said geraldine  you know i am disposed that way by dr brownlows verdict  and that way is that we go ourselves to try to trace out this strange allegation—you coming too gerald so that we shall not quite be sitting on your head  but my sister  we will see when we have recovered her said mrs grinstead  i would begin with a visit to stella and her husband said clement charlie could put us in the way of dealing with consuls and vice consuls  excellent cried his sister anna goes of course and i should like to take francie  it would be such an education for her  well why not  and what is to become of adrian  well we should not have been here more than six months of course  i could take him said lance unless alda holds poor old froggatt  underwood beneath his dignity  that can be considered said clement it approves itself best to me except that he is getting on so well here that i dont like to disturb him  and when can you come up to town with me demanded gerald tomorrow  tomorrow being saturday it would be of little use to go  no if you will not kick master i must go home tomorrow and look up poor pur also the organ on sunday  come with me and renew your acquaintance  we will make an appointment with your attorney clem and run up on monday evening see him on tuesday  gerald sighed submitting perforce and they let him out to exhale as much impatience as he could in a tramp over the hills while they sat and pitied him from their very hearts     chapter xxv  desdichado    perish wealth and power and pride    mortal boons by mortals given  but let constancy abide—    constancys the gift of heaven—scott   lancelot and gerald did not obtain much by their journey to london gerald wanted to begin with mr bast van proprietor but lance insisted on having the lawyers counsel first and the advice amounted to exhortations not to commit themselves or to make offers such as to excite cupidity especially in the matter of ludmilla but to dwell on the fact of her being so close to the age of emancipation and the illegality of tyrannical training  this however proved to be wasted advice  mr bast was impervious he undertook to forward a letter to mr oleary but would not tell where nor whether wife and daughter were with him  the letter was written and in due time was answered but with an intimation that the information desired could only be given upon the terms already mentioned and refusing all transactions respecting the young lady mentioned who was with her natural guardians and in no need of intervention  they were baffled at all points and the lawyer did not encourage any idea of holding out a lure for information which might easily be trumped up  since lancelot had discovered so much as that the first marriage had taken place at messina and the desertion at trieste as well as that the husband was said to have been a native of piedmont he much recommended personal investigation at all these points especially as mr underwood could obtain the assistance and interest of consuls  it was likely that if neither uncle nor nephew made further demonstration the olearys would attempt further communication which he and lance could follow up  this might be a clue to finding the young lady—to him a secondary matter to gerald a vital one but for the present nothing could be done for her poor child  so they could only return to rockquay to make immediate preparations for the journey  matters were simplified by miss mohun who hearing that clements doctors ordered him abroad for the winter came to the rescue saying that she should miss fergus and his lessons greatly and she thought it would be a pity for mrs edgar to lose their little baronet just after having given offence to certain inhabitants by a modified expulsion of campbell and horner and therefore volunteering to take adrian for a few terms look after his health his morals and his lessons and treat him in fact like a nephew to keep her hand in she said till the infants began to appear from india  this was gratefully accepted and alda liked the plan better than placing him at bexley which she continued to regard as an unwholesome place  the proposal to take franceska was likewise welcome and the damsel herself was in transports of delight various arrangements had to be made and it was far on in august that the farewells were exchanged with clipstone and beechcroft cottage where each member of the party felt that a real friend had been acquired  the elders ladies who had grown up in an enthusiastic age were even more devoted to one another than were anna and mysie gillian stood a little aloof resolved against foolish confidences and devoting herself to studies for college life in which she tried to swallow up all the feelings excited by those ship letters  dolores had her secret which was to be no longer a secret when she had heard from her father and in the meantime with geralds full concurrence she was about to work hard to qualify herself for lecturing or giving lessons on physical science  she could not enter the college that she wished for till the winter term and meant to spend the autumn in severe study  we will work was the substance of those last words between them and their parting tokens were characteristic each giving the other a little case of mathematical instruments we will work and we will hope  and what for said dolores  i should say for toil if it could be with untarnished name said gerald  name and fame are our own to make said dolores with sparkling eyes  this was their parting  indeed they expected to meet at christmas or before it so soon as mr maurice mohun should have written  gerald was by the unanimous wish of his uncles to finish his terms at oxford  whatever might be his fate a degree would help him in life  he had accepted the decision though he had rather have employed the time in a restless search for his mother and sister but after vainly pursuing two or three entertainments at fairs he became amenable to the conviction that they were more likely to hear something if they gave up the search and kept quiet and both dolores and mrs henderson promised to be on the watch  the state of suspense proved an admirable tonic to the whole being of the young man  his listlessness had departed and he did everything with an energy he had never shown before  only nothing would induce him to go near vale leston and he made it understood that his twentyfirst birthday was to be unnoticed  not a word passed between gerald and his aunt as to the cause of the journey and the doubt that hung over him but nothing could be more assiduous and tender than his whole conduct to her and his uncle throughout the journey as though he had no object in life but to save them trouble and make them comfortable  the party started in august travelled very slowly and he was the kindest squire to the two girls taking them to see everything and being altogether as geraldine said the most admirable courier in the world with a wonderful intuition as to what she individually would like to see and how she could see it without fatigue moreover on the sunday that occurred at a little german town it was the greatest joy to her that he sought no outside gaiety but rather seemed to cling to his uncles home ministrations and even to her readings of hymns  they had a quiet walk together and it was a day of peace when his gentle kindness put her in mind of his father yet with a regretful depth she had always missed in edgar  nor was there any of that old dreary halfcontemptuous tone and manner which had often made her think he was only conforming to please her and shrinking from coming to close quarters where he might confess opinions that would grieve her  he was manifestly in earnest listening and joining in the services as if they had a new force to him  perhaps they had the more from the very absence of the ordinary externals and with nothing to disturb the individual personality of clements low earnest and reverent tones  there were tears on his eyelashes as he rose up bent over and kissed his cherie  and that evening while clement and the two nieces walked farther and listened to the benediction in the little austrian church gerald sat under a lindentree with his aunt and in the fullness of his heart told her how things stood between him and dolores  geraldine had never been as much attracted by dolores as by gillian and mysie but she was greatly touched by hearing that the meeting and opening of affection had been on the discovery that gerald was probably nameless and landless and that the maiden was bent on casting in her lot with him whatever his fate might be  he murmured to himself the old lines with a slight alteration—             i could not love thee dear so much              loved i not justice more   yes indeed cherie our affection is a very different and better thing than it would be if i were only the rich young squire sure of my position  i am sure it is my dear  i honour and love her for being my boys brave comforter—comforter in the true sense  i see now what has helped you to be so brave and cheery  but what will her father say  he will probably be startled and—and will object but it would be a matter of waiting anyway the patience that the vicar preaches and we have made up our minds  ill fight my own way she to prepare by her cambridge course to come and work with me as we can do so much better among the people—among them in reality and by no pretence  ah dont speak as if you gave up your cause  well i wont if you dont like to hear it cherie he said smiling but anyway you will be good to dolores  indeed i will do my best my dear  i am sure you and she whatever happens have the earnest purpose and soul to do all the good you can whether from above or on the same level and that makes the oneness of love  thank you cherie carissima  you see the secret of our true bond  one bond to make it deeper must be there  the love of god beneath the love of man     chapter xxvi  the silent star    then the traveller in the dark thanks you for your tiny spark he would not know which way to go if you did not twinkle so—jane taylor   and so they came to buda where charles audley represented english diplomatic interests on the banks of the danube  when the quaint old semiorientallooking city came in sight and the train stopped the neat englishlooking carriage with gay hungarian postillions could be seen drawn up to meet them outside the station  charles and his father now sir robert were receiving them with outstretched hands and joyous words and in a few seconds more they were with their little stella  yes their little stella still as clement and cherry had time to see when gerald and the two girls had insisted on walking however far it might be with the two audleys though charlie told them that no one ever walked in hungary who could help it and that he should be stared at for bringing such strange animals  geraldine had stayed with stella once before and clement had made one hurried and distressful rush in the trouble about angela but that was at munich and nearly nine years ago before the many changes and chances of life had come to them  to stella those years had brought two little boys whose appearance in the world had been delayed till the audley family had begun to get anxious for an heir but while the underwoods thought it was well that their parents especially their father should have time to grow a little older  and stella looked as daintily delicately pretty as ever at first sight like a china shepherdess to be put under a glass shade but on a second view with a thoughtful sweetness and depth in her face that made her not merely pretty but lovely  how happy she was gazing at her brother and sister and now and then putting a question to bring out the overflow of home news so dear to her  for she was still their silent star making very few words evince her intense interest and sympathy  even when they were at home in the house that looked outside like a castle in a romance but which was so truly english within and the two little fellows of four and three came toddling to meet her shrinking into her skirts at sight of the new uncle and aunt there was a quiet gentle firmness—all the old stella—in her dealings with them as she drew them to kiss and greet the strangers  robbie and theodore were sturdy rosy beings full of life but perfectly amenable to that sweet low voice  their father and grandfather might romp with them to screaming pitch and idolize them almost to spoiling yet they too were under that gentle check which the young wife exercised on all around  she was only thirtyone and so small so fair and young in looks that to her elder sister her pretty matronly rule would at first seem like the management of a dolls house even though her servants english german or magyar obeyed her implicitly and for that matter as charlie and sir robert freely and merrily avowed so did they  the young secretary was her bounden slave and held her as the ideal woman though there came to be a little swerving of his allegiance towards the tall and beautiful franceska who had insensibly improved greatly in grace and readiness on her travels and quite dazzled the hungarians while anna was immensely exultant and used to come to her aunts room every night to talk of her lovely francie as a safetyvalve from discussing the matter with francie herself who remained perfectly simple and unconscious of her own charms  geraldine could not think them quite equal to the more exquisite and delicatelyfinished as well as more matured beauty of little stella but that was a matter of taste  the household was more english than hungarian or even german and there were curious similitudes to the vale leston priory arrangements which kept stellas underwood heart in mind  there had to be receptions and it was plain that when she put fernans diamonds on mrs audley was quite at home and at perfect ease in german and hungarian society speaking the languages without hesitation when she did speak while in her quiet way keeping every one entertained showing the art de tenir un salon and moreover preserving francie from obtrusive admiration in a way perhaps learnt by experience on that more perilous subject angela who had invited what francie shrank from  the two girls were supremely happy and francie seemed to have a fountain of joy that diffused a rose coloured spray over everything  one of the famous concerts of hungarian gipsies was given and in that clement and geraldine were alike startled by tones recalling those of the memorable concert at bexley all the more because they seemed to have a curious fascination for gerald  moreover those peculiar eyes and eyelashes the first link observed between him and the little butterfly were so often repeated in the gipsy band that it was plain whence they were derived  charles audley thought it worth while to find means of inquiry among the gipsies as to whether anything was known of zoraya prebel or her brother sebastian but after some delay and various excitements nothing was discovered but that there had been a family who were esteemed recreants to their race and had sold their children to the managers of german or italian bands of musicians  one brother had come back a broken man who had learnt vices and ruined himself though he talked largely of his wonderful success in company with his sister who had made grand marriages  what had become of her he did not know and when gerald went with mr audley to a little mountain valley to visit him he had been dead for a week or more  all this had made some delay and it was almost the end of the long vacation  charles audley undertook to go to trieste with the travellers and make inquiries about zoraya and her first husband sir robert the skipper as the family still termed him had written for his yacht to meet him there and be ready for him to convey the party to sicily  he professed that he could not lose sight of franceska with whom he declared himself nearly as much smitten as ever he had been with his daughterinlaw  they left that pretty creature in her happy home and arrived at trieste where charles audley set various agencies to work and arrived at a remembrance of giovanni benista an impresario having been in a state of great fury at his wife his most able performer having fled from him just as he had been at the expense of training and making her valuable  he tried to have her pursued but there was reason to think that she had been smuggled away in an english or american ship and nothing could be done  thus much of the story then was confirmed and gerald had little or no doubt of the rest of it but he was obliged to leave the pursuit of the quest to his uncle and aunt being somewhat consoled for having to return to england by the expectation of hearing from mr maurice mohun  twice he returned for his aunts last kiss nay even a third time and then with the halfchoked words my true my dearest mother  and he absolutely bent his knee as he asked for his uncle clements blessing     chapter xxvii  the red mantle    and deemed themselves a shameful part of pageant which they cursed in heart—scott   dolores was waiting till the christmas term to go to her college the fame of her volcanic lectures had reached avoncester and she was entreated to repeat them at the high school there  the mousetrap had naturally been sent to miss vincent the former governess who had become headmistress of the high school at silverton and she wrote an urgent request that her pupils might have the advantage of the lectures  would dolores come and give her course there and stay a few days with her reviving old times  dolores consented being always glad of an opportunity of trying her wings though she had not the pleasantest recollections connected with silverton but she would be really glad to see miss vincent who had been always kind to her  so she travelled up to silverton and found the headmistress living in cheerful rooms with another of the teachers in the same house all boarding together but with separate sittingrooms  dolores first walk was to see miss hackett  it was quite startling to find the good old lady looking exactly the same as when she had come to luncheon at silverfold and arranged for g f s and weakly stood up for her sister nine years previously those years which seemed ages long ago to the maiden who had made the round of the world since while the lady had only lived in her casement cottage and done almost the same things day by day  there was one exception however constance had married a union doctor in the neighbourhood  she came into silverton to see her old acquaintance and looked older and more commonplace than dolores could have thought possible and her talk was no longer of books and romances but of smoking chimneys cross landlords and troublesome cooks and the wicked neglects of her vicars and her squires wife as dolores walked back to silverton she heard drums and trumpets and was nearly swept away by a rushing stream of little boys and girls  then came before her an elephant with ornamental housing and howdah and a train of cars meant to be very fine but wayworn and battered with white and piebald steeds and gaudy tinselly drivers and dames in scarlet and blue much needing a washing distributing coloured sheets about the grand performance to take place that night at eight oclock of the sepoys death song and the bleeding bride  miss vincent had asked miss hackett to supper and prepared herself and her fellowteacher miss calton for a pleasant evening of talk but to her great surprise dolores expressed her intention of going to the performance at the circus  my dear said miss vincent this is a very low affair—not sangers nor anything so respectable  they have been here before and the lodginghouse people went and were quite shocked  yes said dolores but that is all the more reason i want to go there is a girl with them in whom we are very much interested  she was kidnapped from rockquay at the time this circus was there  at least i am almost sure it is the same and i must see if she is there  but if she is you cannot do anything  yes i can i can let her brother know  it must be done miss vincent  i have promised and it is of fearful consequence  should you know her  oh yes  i have often talked to her in mrs hendersons class i could not mistake her  miss hackett was so much horrified at the notion of a g f s business girl being in bondage to a circus that she gallantly volunteered to go with miss mohun and miss vincent could only consent  the place of the circus was an open piece of ground lying between silverton and silverfold and thither they betook themselves—miss hackett in an old bonnet and waterproof that might have belonged to any woman and dolores wearing a certain crimson ulster which she had bought in auckland for her homeward voyage and which her cousins had chosen to dub as the maori  after a good deal of jostling and much scent of beer and bad tobacco they achieved an entrance and sat upon a hard bench half stifled with the odours to which were added those of human and equine nature and of paraffin  as to the performance dolores was too much absorbed in looking out for ludmilla together with the fear that miss hackett might either faint or grow desperate and come away to attend much to it and she only was aware that there was a general scurrying in which the horses and the elephant took their part and that men and scantily dressed females put themselves in unnatural positions that there was a firing of pistols and singing of vulgar songs and finally the hero and heroine made their bows on the elephants back  miss hackett wanted to depart before the bleeding bride came on but dolores entreated her to stay and she heroically endured a little longer  this seemed consciously or not to be a parody of the ballad of lord thomas and fair annet but of course it began with an abduction on horseback and a wild chase in which even the elephant did his part and plenty more firing  then the future bride came on supposed to be hawking during which pastime she sang a song standing upright on horseback and the faithless lord thomas appeared and courted her with the most remarkable antics of himself and his piebald steed  the forsaken annet consoled herself with careering about taking a last leave of her beloved steed—a mangylooking pony—and performing various freaks with it then singing a truculent song of revenge in pursuance of which she hid herself to await the bridal procession and as the bride came on among her attendants dolores detected unmistakably those eyes of geralds  she squeezed miss hacketts hand and saw little more of the final catastrophe  somehow the bride was stabbed and fell screaming while the fair annet executed a war dance but what became of her was uncertain  all dolores knew was that ludmilla was there  she had recognized not only the eyes but the air and figure  when they got free of the crowd which was a great distress to poor miss hackett dolores said—  yes it is that poor girl  she must be saved  how  what can you do  i shall telegraph to her brother  you will help me miss hackett  but—what—who is her brother said miss hackett expecting to hear he was a carpenter perhaps or at least a clerk  mr underwood of vale leston—gerald underwood answered dolores his father made an unfortunate marriage with a singer  she really is his halfsister and i promised to do all i could to help him to find her and save her  he is at oxford  i shall telegraph to him the first thing tomorrow  there was nothing in this to object to and miss hackett would not be persuaded not to see her to the door of miss vincents lodgings though lengthening her own walk—alone a thing more terrible to her oldfashioned mind than to that of her companion  dolores wrote her telegram—  dolores mohun valentia silverton to gerald underwood trinity college oxford  ludmilla here  circus  come  she sent it with the more confidence that she had received a letter from her father with a sort of conditional consent to her engagement to gerald so that she could if needful avow herself betrothed to him though her usual reticence made her unwilling to put the matter forward in the present condition of affairs  she went out to the postoffice at the first moment when she could hope to find the telegraph office at work and just as she had turned from it she met a girl in a dark long illfitting jacket and black hat with a basket in her hand  lydia exclaimed dolores using the old rockquay name  miss dolores she cried  yes yes  you are here  i saw you last night  me  me  oh i am ashamed that you did  dont tell mr flight  there were tears starting to her eyes  can i do anything for you  no—no  oh if you could  but they have apprenticed me  who have  my mother and mr oleary  are they here  yes  they wanted money—apprenticed me to this jellicoe  i must make haste  they sent me out to take something to the wash and buy some fresh butter  they must not guess that i have met any one  i will walk with you  i have been telegraphing to your brother that i have found you  oh he was so good to me  and mr flight i was so grieved to fail him  they made me get up and dress in the night and before i knew what i was about i was on the quay—carried out to the ship  i had no paper—no means of writing i was watched  and now it is too dreadful  oh miss dolores if mrs henderson could see the cruel positions they try to force on me the ways they handle me—they hurt so and what is worse no modest girl could bear the way they go on and want me to do the same  i could when i was little but i am stiffer now and oh ashamed  if i cant—they starve me—yes and beat me and hurt me with their things  it is bondage like the israelites and i dont want to get to like it as they say i shall for then—then there are those terrible songs to be sung and that shocking dress to be shown off in  my mother will not help  she says it is what she went through and all have to do and that i shall soon leave off minding but oh i often think i had rather die than grow like—like miss bellamour  i hope i shall they often frighten me with that horse only somehow i cant wish to be killed at the moment and try to save myself  and once i thought i would let myself fall rather than go on with it but i thought it would be wicked and i couldnt  but i have prayed to god to help me and spare me and now he has heard  and will my brother be able—or will he choose to help me  i am sure of it my poor dear girl  he wishes nothing more  please turn this way  they must not see me speak to any one  one word more  how long is the circus to be here  we never know it depends on the receipts—may go tomorrow  oh there—  she hurried on without another word and dolores slowly returned to miss vincents lodgings  her lecture was to be given at three oclock but she knew that she should have to be shown the school and classrooms in the forenoon  gerald as she calculated the trains might arrive either by halfpast twelve or a quarter past four  nervously she endured her survey of the school replying to the comments as if in a dream and hurrying it over so as must have vexed those who expected her to be interested  she dashed off to the station and reached it just in time to see the train come in  was it—yes it was gerald who sprang out and came towards her  dolores  my gallant dolores  you have found her  yes but in cruel slavery—apprenticed  that can be upset  her mother—is she here  yes and oleary  they sold her apprenticed her and these people use her brutally  she told me this morning  no i dont think you can get at her now  i will see her mother at any rate  i may be able to buy her off where shall i find you  dolores told him but advised him to meet her at miss hacketts whom she thought more able to help and more willing than miss vincent in case he was able to bring ludmilla away with him  have you heard from my father  yes—what i expected  but it will make no difference in the long run  dearest do i not trust your brave words  from trieste i hear that the endeavour of benista to recover his wife is proved  theres one step of the chain  is it dragging us down or setting us free  free—free from the perplexities of property cried dolores  free to carve out a life  certainly i have wished i was a younger son  only if it could have come in some other way  dolores had to go to luncheon at miss vincents and then to deliver her lecture  it was well that she had given it so often as almost to know it by heart for the volcano of anxiety was surging high within her  as she went out she saw gerald waiting for her and his whole mien spoke of failure  failed  yes he said  the poor child is regularly bound to that jellicoe the master of the concern for twentyfive pounds the fine that my uncle brought on the mother as oleary said with a grin and she is still under sixteen  is there no hope till then  he and oleary declare there would be breach of contract if she left them even then  i dont know whether they are right but any amount of mischief might be done before her birthday  they talk of sending her to belgium to be trained and that is fatal  cant she be bought off  of course i tried but i cant raise more than seventy pounds at the utmost just now  i could help  i have twentythree pounds  i could give up my term  no use  they know that i shall not be of age till january besides the other matter  i assured them that however that might end my uncles would honour any order i might give for the sake of rescuing her but they laughed the idea to scorn  oleary had the impudence to intimate however that if i chose to accept the terms expressed his wife might be amenable  they are  five hundred for evidence on the previous marriage in my favour but i am past believing a word that she says at least under olearys dictation  she might produce a forgery  so i told him that my uncle was investigating the matter with the consul in sicily and the intolerable brutes sneered more than over at the idea of the question being in the hands of the interested party when they could upset that meddling parson in a moment  can nothing be done  i thought of asking one of your old ladies whether there is a lawyer or prevention of cruelty man who could tell me whether the agreement holds but i am afraid she is too old  you saw no mark of ill usage  oh no  they would be too cunning  if we could help her to escape what a lark it would be  i do believe we could cried dolores  if i could only get a note to her  and this red ulster  i wonder if miss hackett would help  dolores waited for miss hackett who had lingered behind and told her as much of the facts as was expedient  there was a spice of romance in the hackett soul and the idea of a poor girl a g f s maiden in the hands of these cruel and unscrupulous people was so dreadful that she was actually persuaded to bethink herself of means of assistance  where did you meet the girl she said  dolores told her the street  ah depend upon it the things were with mrs crachett who i know has done washing for people about on fairdays when they cant do it themselves  she has a daughter in my g f s class i wonder if we could get any help from her  it was a very odd device for a respectable associate and member of g f s to undertake but if ever the end might justify the means it was on the present occasion  fortune favoured them for melinda crachett was alone in the house ironing out some pale pink garments  are you washing for those people on the common melinda asked miss hackett  yes miss hackett  they want them by seven oclock tonight very particular and they promised me a seat to see the performance miss if i brought them in good time and i wondered miss if you would object  only tell me melinda whom you saw  i saw the lady herself maam the old lady when i took the things  no young person  yes maam  it was a very nice young lady indeed that brought me down this pink tunic because it got stained last night and she said her orders was to promise me a ticket if it came in time but oh my maam she looked as if she wanted to tell me not to come  poor girl  she is a g f s member melinda and i do believe you would be doing a very good deed if you could help us to get her away from those people  melindas eyes grew round with eagerness  she had no doubts respecting what miss hackett advised her to do and there was nothing for it but to take the risk  then and there dolores sat down and pencilled a note directing ludmilla to put on the red ulster after her performance if possible when people were going away and slip out among them joining melinda who would convey her to miss hacketts  this was safer than for gerald to be nearer since he was liable to be recognized  still it was a desperate risk and dolores had great doubts whether she should ever see her red maori again  so in intense anxiety the two waited in miss hacketts parlour where the good lady left them as she said to attend to her accounts but really with an inkling or more of the state of affairs between them each had heard from new zealand and knew that maurice mohun was suspending his consent till he had heard farther from home both as to geralds character and prospects and there was no such absolute refusal even in view of his overthrow of the young mans position as to make it incumbent on them to break off intercourse  colonial habits modified opinion and to know that the loss was neither the youths own fault nor that of his father would make the acceptance a question of only prudence provided his personal character were satisfactory  thus they felt free to hold themselves engaged though gerald had further to tell that his letters from messina purported that an old priest had been traced out who had married the impresario giovanni benista a native of piedmont to zoraya prebel hungarian in the year 1859 when ecclesiastical marriages were still valid without the civil ceremony  another step in my descent said gerald  still it does not prove whether this first husband was alive  no and piedmont though a small country is a wide field in which to seek one who may have cut all connection with it  however these undaunted people of mine are resolved to pursue their quest and as perhaps you have heard are invited to stay at rocca marina for the purpose  i should think that was a good measure mr white gets quarrymen from all the country round and would be able to find out about the villages  but how unlikely it is that one of these wanderers would have kept up intercourse with his family  they may do their best to satisfy the general conscience but i see no end to it  and a more immediate question—what are we to do with your sister if she escapes tonight  shall i take her to mrs henderson  she would not be safe there  no i must carry her straight to america the only way to choke off pursuit  you  your term  never mind that  i shall write to the warden pleading urgent private business  i have enough in hand for our passage and the censor will take my articles and give me an introduction  i shall be able to keep myself and her  i have a real longing to see fiddlers ranch  but can you rough it asked dolores anxiously looking at his delicate girlish complexion and slight figure  oh yes  i was born to it  i know what it was when fiddlers ranch was far from the civilization of violinia as they call it now  i dont mean to make a secret of it and grieve your heart or cheries she has had enough of that but i must make the plunge to save my sister and if things come round it will be all the better to have some practical knowledge of the masses and the social problems by living among them  oh that i could make the experiment with you  you will be my inspiration and encouragement and come to me in due time  he came round to her and she let him give her his first kiss  god will help us she said reverently it is the cause of uprightness and deliverance from cruel bondage  the plans had been settled gerald had arranged with a cab which was to take him and his sister to a house five miles out in the country of which miss hackett had given the name so that they might seem to have been spending the evening with her  thence it was but a step to the station of a different railway from that which went through silverton and they would go by the mail train to london where ludmilla could be deposited at mrs grinsteads house at brompton where martha could provide her with an outfit while gerald saw the editor of the censor got some money from the bank telegraphed to oxford for his baggage and made ready to start the next morning for liverpool whither he had telegraphed to secure a secondclass passage to new york for g f wood and lydia wood the names which he meant to be called by  the first name i knew he said the name of tom wood is far more real to me or my father than edgar underwood ever could be  he promised that dolores should have a telegram at clipstone by the time she reached it for she had to give her second lecture the next day and was to return afterwards  all this had been discussed over and over again and there had been many quakings and declarations that the scheme had failed and that neither girl could have had courage nor perhaps adroitness and that the poor prisoner had been recaptured  gerald had made more than one expedition into the little garden to listen and had filled the house with cold air before he returned sat down in a resigned fashion and declared—  it is all up  that comes of trusting to fools of girls  hark  he sprang up and out into the vestibule  miss hackett opened the door into the back passage  there stood the red mantle and melinda crachett  gerald took the trembling figure in his arms with a brotherly kiss  my little sister he said look to me then gave her to dolores who led her into the drawingroom and put her into an armchair  she could hardly stand but tried to jump up as miss hackett entered  no no my poor child she said sit still  rest  were you followed  no i dont think they had missed me  she was so breathless that miss hackett would have given her a glass of wine but she shook her head  oh no thank you  ive kept the pledge  the teathings were there waiting for her arrival  dolores would have helped her take off the red garment but she shrank from it she had only her gaudy theatrical dress beneath  how was she to go to london in it  however miss hackett devised that she should borrow the little maidservants clothes and gerald undertook to send them back when martha should have fitted her out at brompton the theatrical costume miss hackett would return by a messenger without implicating melinda crachett  they took the girl upstairs to effect the change and restore her as much as they could and she came down with her rouge washed off and very pale but looking like herself as poor thing she always did look more or less frightened and now with tears about her eyelids tears that broke forth as gerald went up to her took her by the hand and said—  brighten up little sister you have given yourself to me and i must take care of you now  ah i do beg your pardon but my poor mother—i didnt know—  you dont want to go back  oh no no and she shuddered again but i am sorry for her  she has such a hard master and she used to be good to me  miss hackett had come opportunely to make her drink some tea and then made both take food enough to sustain them through the night journey  then and afterwards they gathered what had been ludmillas sad little story  her father in spite of his marriage which was according to the lax notions of german protestants had been a fairly respectable man very fond of his little daughter and exceedingly careful of her though even as a tiny child he had made her useful trained her to singing and dancing and brought her forward as a charming little fairy when it was all play to her  oh we were so happy in those days she said tearfully  when he died it was with an injunction to his wife not to bring up ludmilla to the stage now that he was not there to take care of her with the means he had left she had set up her shop at rockquay and though she had never been an affectionate mother ludmilla had been fairly happy and had been a favourite with mr flight and the school authorities and had been thoroughly imbued with their spirit  a change had however come over her mother ever since an expedition to avoncester when she had met oleary  she had probably always contrived a certain amount of illicit trade in tobacco and spirits by means of the sailors in the foreign traders who put into the little harbour of rockquay but her daughter was scarcely cognizant of this and would not have understood the evil if she had done so nor did it affect her life  oleary had however been the clown in mr schnetterlings troupe and had become partner with jellicoe  the sight of him revived all zorayas bohemian inclinations and on his side he knew her to have still great capabilities and recollected enough of her little daughter to be sure that she would be a valuable possession  moreover mrs schnetterling had carried her contraband traffic a little too far especially where the boys of the preparatory school were concerned  she began to fear the gauger and the policeman and she had consented to marry oleary at the avoncester register office meaning to keep the matter a secret until she could wind up her affairs at rockquay  even her daughter was kept in ignorance  two occurrences had however precipitated matters  one was the stir that clement had made about the schoolboys festival ending in the fine being imposed the other the discovery that the graceful well endowed young esquire was the child who had been left to probable beggary with a dying father twenty years previously  jellicoe the principal owner of the circus advanced the money for the fine on condition of the girl and her mother becoming attached to the circus and the object of oleary was to make as much profit as possible out of the mystery that hung over the young heir of vale leston  his refusal to attend to the claim on him together with spite at his uncle as having brought about the prosecution and to mr flight for hesitating to remunerate the girl for the performance that was to have been free perhaps too certain debts and difficulties all conspired to occasion the midnight flitting in such a manner as to prevent the circus from being pursued  thenceforth poor lidas life had been hopeless misery with all her womanly and religious instincts outraged and the probability of worse in future  jellicoe his wife and oleary had no pity and her mother very little and no principle and she had no hope except that release might come by some crippling accident  workhouse or hospital would be deliverance since thence she could write to mrs henderson  she shook and trembled still lest she should be pursued though miss hackett assured her that this was the last place to be suspected and it was not easy to make her eat  presently gerald stood ready to take her to the cab  dolores came to the gate with them  there was only space for a fervent embrace and god bless you and then she stood watching as they went away into the night     chapter xxviii  rocca marina    there was of course in adeline   a calm patrician polish in the address which neer can pass the equinoctial line   of anything which nature could express—byron   it was a late autumn or winter day according to the calendar when the morning star steamed up to the quay of rocca marina but it was hard to believe it for all the slope of one of the maritime alps lay stretched out basking in the noonday sunshine green and lovely wherever not broken by the houses below or the rocks quarried out on the mountain side  some snow lay on the further heights enough to mark their forms and contrast with the soft sweetness of the lap of the hills and the glorious mediterranean blue  anna and franceska stood watching and exclaiming in a trance of delight as one beauty after another revealed itself—the castellated remnant of the old tower the gabled house with stone balconies and terraces with parapets and vases below the little white spire of the church tower of the english colony looking out of the chestnut and olive groves above and the three noble stone pines that sheltered the approach  mr white in his launch came out with exulting and hearty welcome to bring them ashore through the crowd of feluccas fishingvessels and one or two steamers that filled the tiny bay and on landing the party found an english wagonette drawn by four stout mules waiting to receive them—mules as being better for the heights than horses  anna and franceska insisted on walking with mr white and sir robert and they fairly frisked in the delicious air of sea and mountain after being so long cramped on board ship stopping continually with screams of delight over violets or anemones or the views that unfolded themselves as they went higher and higher  the path mr white chose was a good deal steeper than the winding carriage road cut out of the mountain side and they arrived before the mules with mrs grinstead and her brother at the italian garden with a succession of broad terraces protected and adorned with open balustrades with vases of late blooming flowers at intervals and broad stone steps guarded by carved figures leading from one to another  it is like beautys palace sighed out in delight francie to her sister  theres beauty laughed anna as at the open window upon the highest verandahshaded balcony appeared the darkly handsome maura and mrs white her small features as pretty as ever but her figure a good deal more embonpoint than in rockquay times  hers was a very warm welcome to the two sisters and their friend and to the others who reached the front door a few minutes later  such an arrival was very pleasant to her for it must be confessed that save for the english visitors who were always gladly received the life at rocca marina was a dull one in spite of its being near enough to san remo by the railway for expeditions for a day  within the dwelling was a combination of the old italian palace with english comforts  mr white in his joy at possessing his graceful lady wife had spared no expense in making it a meet bower for her and geraldine was as much amused as fascinated by the exquisiteness of all around her as she sat in a most luxurious chair looking out through the open window at the blue sea yet with a lively wood fire burning under a beauteous mantelpiece statues pictures all that was recherche around while they drank their english tea out of almost transparently delicate cups filled by maura out of a beautifully chased service of plate on a marble mosaic table  and now you must let me show you your rooms said mrs white i thought you would like to have them en suite for i am such a poor creature that i cannot breakfast downstairs and mr white is obliged to be out early  so she led the way through a marble hall pillared in different colours rich and rare with portraits of ancient contes and contessas on the walls up a magnificent stone stair with a carved balustrade to a suite indeed where at the entrance sibby was found very happy at her welcome from mrs mount who was equally glad to receive a countrywoman  there was a sittingroom with a balcony looking out on the bay a study and bedroom beyond for clement on one side and on the other charmingly fitted rooms for geraldine for her nieces and her maid and mrs white left them telling them the dinner hour and begging them to call freely and without scruple for all and everything they could wish for  nothing would be any trouble  we have even an english doctor below there she said pointing to the roofs of the village  there are so many accidents that mr white thought it better to be provided so we have a little hospital with a trained nurse  it was all very good very kind yet the very family likeness to lilias merrifield and jane mohun made geraldine think how much more simple in manner one of them would have been without that nouveau riche tone of exultation  here is a whole packet of letters ended mrs white that came for you these last two or three days  she pointed to a writingtable and went away while the first letters so amazed geraldine that she could think of nothing else and hastened to summon clement  it was from gerald posted by the pilot from on board the steamer very short and only saying—   dearest cherie  i know you will forgive me or rather see that i do not need pardon for rescuing my sister  anywhere in england she would be in danger of being reclaimed to worse than death  dolores will tell you all the situation and i will send a letter as soon as we arrive at new york  no time for more except that i am as much as ever                                      your own my cheries own                                                          gerald  there followed directions how to send letters to him through the office of the censor  then she opened written on the same day a letter from dolores mohun sent in obedience to his telegram when he found that time for details failed him  it began—   dear mrs grinstead  i know you will be shocked and grieved at the step that your nephew has taken but when you understand the circumstances i think you will see that it was unavoidable for one of so generous and self sacrificing a nature  i may add that my aunt lily is much touched and thoroughly approves and my uncle jasper says imprudence is better than selfishness   after this little preamble ensued a full and sensible account of ludmillas situation and sufferings at the circus and the history of her escape demonstrating to the writers own satisfaction that there was no other means of securing the poor child  of course the blow to geraldine was a terrible one  we have lost him she said  that does not follow said clement  it is quite plain that he does not mean to cut himself off from us and america is not out of reach  it is just the restless impatience that you warned him against as if he could not have taken her to the hendersons  she would not have been safe there unless acts of cruelty could have been proved  or to us out here  my dear cherry imagine his sudden arrival with such an appendage i really think the boy has acted for the best  giving up oxford too  that can be resumed  and most likely that wretched little girl will run off in a months time  it is in the blood  come come cherry  i cant have you in this uncharitable mood  then i mustnt say what i think of that dolores abetting him  no i like her letter  it fell hard upon geraldine to keep all to herself while entertained in full state by her hosts  perhaps adeline would have liked something on a smaller scale for she knew what was ostentatious but though mr white had once lived in a corner of the castle almost like an artisan since he had married it had become his pride to treat his guests on the grandest london scale and the presence of sir robert audley for one night evoked all his splendours  he made excuses for having no one to meet the party but the chaplain and his wife and the young doctor who he patronizingly assured them was quite the gentleman and theodore white— just to fill up a corner and amuse the young ladies  theodore had been lately sent out now a clerk soon to be a partner but he was very shy and did not amuse the young ladies at all  indeed he was soon so smitten with admiration for franceska that he could do nothing but sit rapt looking at her under his eyelids  the chaplain had received an offer of preferment in england and was anxious to go home as soon as possible  clement was now so well that after assisting the next day in the weeks duties among the people and at the pretty little church that mr white had built he ventured to accept the proposal of becoming a substitute until the decision was made or another chaplain found  he was very happy to be employed once more in his vocation  the climate suited him exactly and the loan of the chaplains house would relieve him and geraldine from the rather oppressive hospitality of the castle  the search for benistas antecedents would of course go on with the assistance of mr white and his italian foreman but both assured him that the inquiry might be protracted as winter was likely to cut off the communications with many parts of the interior and many of the men would be at their distant homes till the spring advanced  meantime geraldine and her nieces had a home life reading studying italian drawing with endless pleasure and the young ones walking about the chestnutcovered slopes  she sat in the gardens or drove with mrs white in her donkeychaise and would have been full of enjoyment but for the abiding anxiety about gerald  it was rather a relief not to be living in the same house with the whites whose hospitality and magnificence were rather oppressive  mr white wanted to have everything admired and its cost appreciated and adeline though clever enough had provoking similarities and dissimilarities to her sisters  the same might be said of maura to whom francie at first took a great fancy but anna who had seen more of the world had a sense of distrust  theres something fawning about her ways said she and i dont know whether she is quite sincere  perhaps it is only being half greek said geraldine  however the two families met every day and mrs white called their intercourse such a boon such a charming friendship all unaware that there was no real confidence or affection  they had not long been seated when the little italian messenger boy brought them a budget of letters  of course the first that geraldine opened was in her nephews writing  it had been written at intervals throughout the voyage and finished on landing at new york  passing over the expressions of unabated affection and explanation of the need of removing ludmilla out of reach of her natural guardians with the date on the second day of the voyage the diary continued   whom as the fates would have it should i have encountered but the cacique  yes old fernan and marilda have the stateliest of state rooms in this same liner and he was as much taken aback as i was when we ran against one another over a destitute and disconsolate irish family in the steerage  marilda is as yet invisible as is my poor little lida  it is unlucky for the good man is profuse in his offers of patronage and i dont mean to be patronized   then after some clever descriptions of the fellow secondclass passengers in his own lively vein perhaps a little forced so as not to betray more than he intended that he felt them uncongenial there came—   lida is up again she is a sweet little patient person and i cannot withstand fernans wish to present her to his wife who remains prostrate at present and will till we get out of the present stiff breeze and its influences  12th—the presentation is over and it has ended in lida devoting herself to the succour of marilda and likewise of her maid who is a good deal worse than herself                                                           16th—these amiable folks want to take lida off with them not to say myself to their underwood in the rockies but i dont intend her to be semiladysmaid semicompanion as she is becoming but to let her stand on her own legs or mine and put her to a good school at new york  i have finished an article on transatlantic travellers for the censor also some reviews and another paper that may pave my way to work in new york or elsewhere  my craving is for the work of hard hands but i look at mine and fear i run more to the brain than the hands  my father must have been of finer physique than the sioux bullet left to me but i have no fears  no indeed sighed geraldine he has not the fine athletic strength of his dear father but still—still i think there is that in him which edgar had not  force of character said clement even if he is wrongheaded here is fernans letter—   imagine my amazement at finding gerald on board with us  he tells me that you are aware of his escapade so i need not explain it  he is not very gracious to either of us and absolutely refuses all offers of assistance either for himself or his sister  however i hope to be able to keep a certain watch over him without offending him and to obviate some of the difficulties in his way perhaps unknown to him  marilda has as usual suffered greatly on the voyage but the little lida as he calls her has been most attentive and useful both to her and her maid who was quite helpless and much the worst of the two  my wife was much prejudiced against lida at first but has become very fond of her and is sure that she is a thoroughly good girl—worth the sacrifice gerald has made for her in his independent mood he will not hear of our offering a home to the poor child but if as i hope your researches turn out in his favour he may consent to let us find suitable education for her  at any rate i promise geraldine not to leave these two young things to their fate though i may have to act secretly  i can never forget how i took him from his fathers side and the baptism almost in blood  we go to new orleans first and after the cold weather home but letters to the bank will find us   good dear old fernan and marilda cried geraldine i can see their kindness and how with all their goodness it must jar on geralds nerves  i hope he wont be an ass returned clement  such patient goodness ought not to be snubbed by— he caught his sisters eye and made his last words youthful theorists  mrs henderson too forwarded a letter from lida being sure that it would be a great pleasure to mrs grinstead  it went into many more particulars about the miseries of the circus training than had been known before and the fears and hints which made it plain that it had been quite right to avail herself of the means of escape after which was added—   i never thought to be so happy as i am here  my brother is the noblest most generous most kind of creatures and that he should do all this for me after all the harm he has suffered from my poor mother  it quite overpowers me when i think of it  i see a tear has dropped but it is such a happy one  please tell mr flight what peace and joy this is to me after all my prayers and trying to mind what he said  there are such a gentleman and lady here cousins to my brother sir ferdinand and lady travis underwood  she has been more or less ill all through the voyage and her maid worse and she has let me do what i could for her and has been kindness itself they were at the bazaar  did you see sir ferdinand  he is the very grandest and handsomest man i ever did see and so good to all the poor emigrants in the steerage  he is very kind to me but i see that my brother will not have me presume  they have bidden me write to them in any need  i never thought there could be so many good people out of rockquay  please give my duty to mr flight and lady flight good miss mohun and dear miss dolores  i wear her ulster and bless the thought of her     chapter xxix  rowena and her rival    and yet if each the others name   in some unguarded moment heard the heart that once you thought so tame   would flutter like a wounded bird—anon   letters continued to come with fair regularity and it was understood that gerald with lida had taken up his quarters in an inexpensive boardinghouse at new york where he had sent lida to a highly recommended dayschool and he was looking out for employment  his articles had been accepted he said but the accounts of his adventures and of his fellowinmates gave the sense that there was more humour in the retrospect than in the society and that they were better to write about than to live with  he never confessed it but to his aunt who understood him it was plain that he found it a different thing to talk philanthropic socialism or even to work among the poor and to live in the society of the unrefined equals  then he wrote that lida had come one day and told him that one of the girls with whom she had made friends had a bad attack of cough and bronchitis and could not fulfil an engagement that she had made to come and sing for a person who was giving lectures upon national music  i looked at some of her songs little lida said in her humble way and i know them  dont you think brother i might take her part  well not to put too fine a point upon it it was not an unwelcome notion for my articles though accepted dont bring in the speedy remuneration with which fiction beguiles the aspirant only one of them which i send you has seen the light and the censor is slow though sure so dollars for immediate expenses run short  i called on the fellow mr gracchus b van tromp to see whether he were fit company for my sister and i found him much superior to his name—gentlemanlike and intelligent not illread and pretty safe like most yankees to know how to behave to a young girl  when he found i could accompany my sister on piano or violin he was transported  moreover he could endure to be enlightened by a britisher on such little facts as the true history of auld robin gray and the wacht am rhein  the lecture was a marked success  we have another tonight 16th  it has resulted in a proposal to these two interesting performers to accompany the great gracchus on a tour through the leading cities lecturing by turns with him and assisting  he has hitherto picked up as he could local talent but is glad of less uncertain help and so far as appears he is superior to jealousy though he sees that im better read and of the cut that takes the ladies  it is no harm for lida she was not learning much and i can cultivate her better when i have her to myself and get her not to regard me so much like a lion to be honoured with distant respect and obedience  we shall get dollars enough to keep us going till my talents break upon the world and obtain stunning experiences for the censor  my fathers dear old violin is coming to the front  our first start will be at boston but continue to write to gerald f wood care of editor of coles weekly  how like his father was the natural exclamation but the details that followed in another week were fairly satisfactory and the spirit of independence was a sound one which had stood harder proofs than perhaps his home was allowed to know though these were early days  february was beginning to open the buds and to fill the slopes with delicate anemones as well as to bring back mr whites workmen among whom clement could make inquiries  one young man knew the name of benista as belonging to a family in a valley beyond his own but it was not an easily accessible one and a fresh fall of snow had choked the ravine and would do so for weeks to come  yet all was lovely on the coast and mr white having occasion to go to san remo offered to take the three girls with him  young ladies always have a turn for shops said he  i want to see the coast said franceska with a little dignity  but i do want some gloves—and some blue embroidery silk thank you mr white said anna more courteously  and i want some handkerchiefs if mr white will take me too returned uncle clement in the same tone  i know so well what you mean dear observed maura sotto voce to francie  it is so trying to be supposed mere commonplace when ones thoughts are on the beautiful and romantic  it was just one of the sayings that had begun to go against francies taste and she answered—  mr white is very goodnatured  ah yes but so—so—you know  francie was called and left mr whites description to be unutterable  the two elder ladies spent the day together and mrs grinstead then heard that jane mohun had written that both lord ivinghoe and lady phyllis devereux were recovering from the influenza and that lord rotherwood had had a slight touch of the complaint  it is a very serious thing in our family said adeline with all the satisfaction of having a family especially with a complaint and she began to enumerate the victims of the devereux house and her own only breaking off to exclaim i really shall write at once to beg them all to come here for the rest of the winter march winds and all  my cousin rotherwood has never been here and they might be quite quiet among relations  so unlike a common health resort  mrs whites hospitable anticipations were forestalled  the party came home from san remo in high spirits  they had met lord rotherwood and his son in the street they had been greeted most warmly and brought to luncheon at the villa where they found not only lady rotherwood and phyllis but mysie merrifield  it was explained that their london doctor had strongly advised immediate transplantation before there was time to catch fresh colds and a friend of the marchioness who permanently possessed a charming house at san remo had offered it just as it was for the spring  the journey had been made at once with one deviation on lord rotherwoods part to beg for mysie as an essential requisite to his flys perfect recovery  a visit had been due before only deferred by the general illness and no difficulty was made in letting it be paid in these new and delightful scenes  phyllis had been there before  she was weak and languid and would much rather have stayed at home except for seeing mysies delight in the mountains and the blue mediterranean which she dimly remembered from her infancy at malta  only she made it a point of honour not to allow that the sea was bluer than the bay of rockquay  ivinghoe was looking ill and disgusted but brightened up at the sight of the visitors and his mother who thought monte carlo too near though she had kept as far from it as possible accepted the more willingly mr whites cordial invitation to come and spend a day or two at rocca marina  trifles were so much out of the good ladys focus of vision that the possible dangers in that quarter never occurred to her though maura was demurely bridling and francie all unawakened but prettier than ever was actually wearing a scarlet anemone that ivinghoe had given to her  in the intervening days rocca marina was in a wonderful state of preparation  the master of it was genuinely and honestly kindly and simplehearted and had entertained noble travellers before who had been attracted by his extensive and artistic works but no words can describe the satisfaction of his wife  in part there was the heartfelt pleasure of receiving the cousin who had been like one of her brothers in the home of her childhood but to this was added the glory of knowing that this same cousin was a marquis and that the society of san remo nay of all the riviera and the italian papers to boot would know that she was a good deal more than the quarry owners wife  moreover like all her family there was a sense of lady rotherwoods coming from a different sphere and treating them with condescension  jane and lily might laugh but to adeline it was matter of a sort of aggressive awe half as asserting herself as victorias equal and relation half as protecting her from inferior people  geraldine perceived and was secretly amused  of course all the party dined at the castle on saturday night and heard some lamentations that there was no one else to meet the distinguished guests for the young doctor was not thought worthy  but i knew you would like a family party best and the underwoods are—almost connections though—  in that though was conveyed their vast inferiority to the house of mohun  i always understood that it was a very good old family said lady rotherwood  clement underwood is one of the most valuable clergy in london said her lord i am glad he is recovering  i shall be delighted to hear him again  maura was standing under the pergola with lord ivinghoe  and is not it sad for poor franceska vanderkist —oh you know about poor mr gerald underwood said maura blushing a little at the awkward subject  of course said ivinghoe impatiently  he is in america is he not  but what has she to do with it  oh you know after being his mona and all  it cant go any further till it is cleared up  phyllis and mysie came up asking maura to tell them the name of a mountain peak with a white cap  the party came up to dinner which was as genial and easy as the host and lord rotherwood could make it and as stiff and grand as the hostess could accomplish aided by the deftness and grace of her italian servants  in the evening theodore came up to assist in the singing of glees and clements voice was a delightful and welcome sound in his sisters ears  ivinghoe stood among the circle at the piano and enjoyed  he and his sister were not particularly musical but enough to enjoy those remarkable underwood voices  after that maura never promoted musical evenings  an odd little sundayschool for the children of the english workmen had been instituted at rocca marina where maura had always assisted the chaplains wife and anna and francie shared the work  mysie heard of it with enthusiasm for as ivinghoe told her she was pining for a breath of the atmosphere but she came down to enjoy the delights thereof alone taking mauras small class  maura was supposed to be doing the polite to lady phyllis but in point of fact phyllis was lying down in the balcony of her mothers dressingroom and maura was gracefully fanning herself under a great cork tree while lord ivinghoe was lying on the grass  francie looked languid and said it was getting dreadfully hot but mrs grinstead took no notice trusting that the cessation of attentions would hinder any feeling from going deeper so that—as she could not help saying to herself—she might not have brought the poor child out of the fryingpan into the fire—not an elegant proverb but expressing her feeling  more especially did it do so when she found that lord rotherwood was so much delighted with the beauty and variety of the marbles of rocca marina as to order a font to be made of them for the church that was being restored at clarebridge and he and still more his son found constant diversion in running over by train from san remo to superintend the design and to select the different colours and patterns of the stones as they were quarried out and bits polished so as to show their beauty  their ladies often accompanied them and these expeditions generally involved luncheon at the castle and often tea at the parsonage but it might be gradually observed as time went on that there was a shade of annoyance on the part of the great house at the preference sometimes unconsciously shown for the society of the smaller one  mysie openly claimed anna as her own friend of some standing and both she and phyllis had books to discuss botanical or geological discoveries to communicate or puzzle out with mrs grinstead or her nieces  lord rotherwood had many more interests in common with clement underwood than with mr white and even the marchioness though more impartial and on her guard was sensible to mrs grinsteads charm of manner and depth of comprehension  she patronized adeline but respected mrs grinstead as incapable of and insensible to patronage  that her gentlemen should have found such safe and absorbing occupation in the opposite direction to monte carlo was an abiding satisfaction to her and she did not analyze the charms of the place as regarded her son  she had seen him amused by other young ladies as he certainly was now by that miss white who was very handsome and very obliging  she knew and he knew all the antecedents too well for alarm till one day she saw mauras face as she made him pull down a spray of banksia from the side of a stone wall and watched the air of gallant courtesy with which he presented it  francie watched it too as she had watched the like before and said nothing but there was an odd dull sense of disappointment and the glory had faded away from sea and sky spring though it was  yet there were pressures of the hand in greeting and parting and kind wistful looks as if of sympathy little services and little attentions that set her foolish little heart bounding in a way she was much ashamed to feel and would have been more utterly ashamed to speak of or to suppose observed  she only avowed to anna that it was very warm weary weather and that she was tired of absence and felt homesick but aunt cherry was so kind that she must not be told  lady rotherwood proposed moving away but her husband and son would not hear of it till their font was finished  it was not unwelcome to any one of the elder ladies that the young officers leave would be over in another week  geraldine was glad that francie should be freed from the trial of seeing attention absorbed by maura and herself so often left in the lurch so far as that young lady could contrive it for though not a word was said the brightened eye and glowing cheek whenever lord ivinghoe brought her forward or paid her any deference or civility were dangerous symptoms  peace of mind in so modest and innocent a maiden would probably come back when the excitement was once over  as to adeline there was nothing she dreaded so much as the commotion that would be excited if ivinghoes flirtation came to any crisis his mother would never forgive her his father would hardly do so she would feel like a traitor to the whole family and all her attempts to put a check on endeavours on mauras part to draw him on —an endeavour that began to be visible to her—were met by apparent unconsciousness or by tears  and when she ventured a word to her husband he gruffly answered that his nieces father had been an officer in the army and he could make it worth any ones while to take her  young lords were glad enough in these days to have something to put into their pockets     chapter xxx  dreams and nightingales    then in that time and place i spoke to her—tennyson                           office of lacustrian intelligencer                                        jonesville ohio                                             march 20 dearest cherie  i told you in my last that the chief boss in the office at new york had written to me that he had been asked to send an intelligent young man to subedit the lacustrian intelligencer at jonesville a rising city on lake erie  i thought it would be worth while to look at it especially as we were booked to give a lecture at sandusky and moreover our relations to gracchus have been growing rather strained and i do not think this wandering life good for lida in the long run nor are my articles paid enough for to be a dependence  so after holding forth at sandusky we took our passage in a little steamer which crosses the little bay in the lake to jonesville—one of those steamers just like a noahs ark  presently lida came up and touched me saying in her little awe struck whisper which has never been conquered brother i am sure i saw one of mothers cigarettes  i said bosh thinking it an utter delusion but she was so decided and so frightened that i told her to go into the saloon and went forward  a woman was going about the deck offering the passengers a basket of candies lights cigarettes and cigars  saving for lidas words i never should have recognized her she was thin to the last degree haggard yellow excessively shabby and forlornlooking and with a hollow cough but as her eyes met mine those eyes that you say are our watermark both of us made a sort of leap as if to go overboard and i went up to her at once and would have spoken but she cried out what have you done with lida  i answered that she was safe and demanded in my turn where were oleary and jellicoe  drowned drowned she said in the wreck of the sirius  theyll never trouble you more but lida  i thought that it was safe to take her into the saloon to see lida when they fell into each others arms and afforded the spectators a romantic spectacle  dont think i am making a joke of it for it was tragic enough in the result of the agitation  blood was choking the poor woman  we could only lay her down on the couch and happily there were lemons on board  there was a goodnatured irishman who gave me all the help he could even to the carrying her to his house where his wife was equally kind  he fetched the priest a french canadian and the doctor and lida has been watching over her most tenderly poor things—they seem really to have cared for one another and lida will be the happier for having done these last duties   21st  she is a little better  so far as we have gathered from one who must not talk nor be agitated the circus had got into difficulties and debt to bast the van proprietor  i believe lidas voice was their last hope and they had some ghastly scheme of disposing of her in belgium  when they lost her their chances were over and with the proceeds of their last exhibition jellicoe and the oleary pair left the elephant etc to take care of themselves and make their excuses to mr bast and started for liverpool and the u s in the sirius  storms overtook them the women were put into the first boat those which followed were swamped  poor fellows i own i cant sing a pious dirge for them  there were three days of hunger and exposure before the boat was picked up and she was finally landed at quebec where she was laid up with pleurisy in the hospital  and there was a subscription for the wrecked when she came out which enabled her to set up this reminiscence of her old trade drifting from one pier or boat to another till she came to this one but all the time with this awful cough  the doctor thinks it her knell her lungs are far gone but she may probably rally in some degree for the summer though hardly so as to be moved  that being the case i have been to the lacustrian office and engaged myself to be its hack since i must have some fixed pay while she lives  perhaps i shall be able to do a little extra writing and lecturing especially if she gets better enough to spare lida to help me  her voice really is a lovely soprano and draws wonderfully but i dont want it to be strained too early  our good irishwoman mrs macbride is willing to let us have her two rooms left empty by her sons going west and her daughter marrying on fair terms lida promising to be a sort of help and to teach the children we shall eat with them  i shall be at the office all day and half the night so i dont need a sittingroom  dont be anxious dear old cherie  we shall do very well and it is only for a time  lida is like a little angel and as thankful for a smile from her mother as if she had been the reprobate runaway                                             your everloving                                                    gerald   this was the letter that came to mrs grinstead and one with similar information went to dolores mohun at her college at cambridge dolores who had found mysie much more sympathetic than gillian could not but write the intelligence to her and mysie was so much struck with the beauty of the muchinjured brother and sister devoting themselves to their mother that she could not help telling the family party at breakfast  thats right said lord rotherwood  the mother can clear up the doubt if any one can  is there nothing about it  no replied mysie i should think the poor woman was too ill to be asked  they must not let her slip through their fingers without telling added ivinghoe  i have a mind to run over to rocca marina and see what more they have heard there said lord rotherwood  i suppose your letter is from one of the girls there  oh no it is from dolores  dolores  she is at cambridge  then this news must have been round by clipstone  they must have known it for days past at rocca exclaimed lord rotherwood  no said mysie this came direct to dolores from gerald underwood himself —oh didnt you know  i forgot nobody was to know till uncle maurice gave his consent  consent to what exclaimed ivinghoe  to dolores and gerald  oh dear mamma said so much to me about not telling but i did think cousin rotherwood knew everything please—  whatever she was going to ask was cut short by ivinghoes suddenly striking on the table so as to make all the cups and saucers ring as he exclaimed—  if ever there lived a treacherous greek minx  then i beg your pardon mother  he was off they saw him dash out of the house  there was a train due nearly at this time as all recollected  papa had not you better go with him said lady rotherwood  he will get on much better by himself my dear and lord rotherwood threw himself back in his chair and laughed heartily and merrily to the amazement and mystification of the two girls  you will have a beauty on your hands my lady  well as long as it is not that horrid white girl— said her ladyship breaking off there  a very sorry rebecca said her lord laughing the more  but the marchioness rose up and the two cousins had to accept the signal  the train after the leisurely fashion of continental railways kept ivinghoe fuming at the station and rattled along so as to give travellers a full view of the coast more delightful to them than to the youth who had rushed off with intentions he scarce knew what of setting right the consequences of mauras—was it deception or only a thought of which the wish was father  he reached the station that led to the works at rocca marina  the sun was high the heat of the day coming on and as he strode along the workmen were leaving off to take their siesta at noontide  on he went across the private walks in the terraced garden not up the broad stone steps that led to the house but to a little group of olive trees which cut off the chaplains house from the castle gardens and where stood a great cork tree to whose branches a hammock had been fastened and seats placed under it  as he opened the gate a little dogs bark was heard and he was aware of a broad hat under the tree  simultaneously a small maltese dog sprang forward and francies head rose from leaning over the little table with a start her cheeks deeper rose than usual having evidently gone to sleep over the thin book and big dictionary that lay before her  oh she said it is you  was i dreaming  i am afraid i startled you  no—only—she still seemed only half awake—it seemed to come out of my dream  then you were dreaming of me  oh no  at least i dont know she said the colour flushing into her face as she sat upright now quite awake and alive to the question between truthfulness and maidenly modesty  you were—you were you dont deny it  and as she hung her head and grew more distressfully redder and redder you know what that means  indeed—indeed—i couldnt help—i never meant  oh—  it was an exclamation indeed for uncle clements head appeared above the hammock where he too had been dozing over his book with the words—  halloo young people im here  franceska would have fled but ivinghoe held her hand so tight that she could not wrench it away  he held it while clement struggled to the ground and then said—  sir there is no reason you or all the world should not know how i love this dearest loveliest one  i came here this morning hoping that she may grant me leave to try to win her to be my own  he looked at francie  her head drooped but she had not taken her hand away and the look on her face was not all embarrassment but there was a rosy sunrise dawning on it  all clement could say was something of your father  he knows he understands i saw it in his eyes said ivinghoe  to clement the surprise was far greater than it would have been to his sister and the experience was almost new to him but he could read francies face well enough to say—  my dear i think we had better let you run in and compose yourself or go to your aunt while i talk to lord ivinghoe  trembling frightened francie was really glad to be released as her lover with one pressure said—  i shall see you again sweetest  she darted away and clement signed to ivinghoe to sit down with him on the bench under the tree  i should like this better if you had brought your fathers full assent he said  there was no time  i only read his face he will come tomorrow  no time  yes to catch the train  i hurried away the moment i learnt that— that her affections were not otherwise engaged  i never saw any one like her  she has haunted me ever since those days at rockquay but —but i was told that she cared for your nephew and i could not take advantage of him in his absence  and now i have but three days more  whoever told you was under a great error said clement gravely and you have shown very generous selfcommand but the advantages of this affair are so much the greatest on one side that you cannot wonder if there is hesitation on our part till we explicitly know that our poor little girl would not be unwelcome to your parents  i know that no one can compare with her for—for everything and anything stammered ivinghoe breaking from his mothers language into his fathers and my father admires her as much as i do— almost  but what will he and your mother say to her being absolutely penniless  pish  and worse—child to a spendthrift a man of no connection except on his mothers side  she is your niece your family have bred her up made her so much more than exquisitely lovely  she is a good little girl said clement but what are we  no ivinghoe i do not blame you for speaking out and she will be the happier for the knowledge of your affection but it will not be right of us to give free consent without being fully assured of that of lord and lady rotherwood  ivinghoe could only protest but clement rose to walk to the house where his sister was sitting under the pergola in the agitation of answering geralds letter and had only seen francie flit by calling to her sister in a voice that now struck her as having been strange and suppressed  clement trusted a good deal to his sisters quicker perceptions and habit of observation to guide his opinion in the affair that had burst on him and was relieved that when ivinghoe like the wellbred young man that he was went up to her and taking her hand said i have been venturing to put my fate into the hands of your niece she did not seem astonished or overwhelmed but said—  she is a dear good girl i do hope it will be for her happiness—for both  thank you he said fervently  it will be the most earnest desire of my life  geraldine thought it best to go in quest of francie whom she found with anna incoherent and happy in the glory of the certainty that she was loved after the long trial of suppressed unacknowledged suspense  no fears of parents no thought of inequalities had occurred to trouble her—everything was absorbed in the one thought— he really did love her  how should she thank god enough or pray enough to be worthy of such joy  there was no room for vexation or wonder at the delay nor the attentions paid to maura  she hushed anna who was inclined to be indignant and who was obliged afterwards to pour out to her aunt all her wonder though she allowed that on his side there was nothing to be really called flirtation it was all maura—she was sure maura was at the bottom of it  my dear dont let us be uncharitable there is no need to think about it  let us try to be like francie and swallow all up in gladness  your mother—  oh i cant think what she will do for joy  it will almost make her well again  but remember we dont know what his parents will say  and with that sobering thought they had to go down to luncheon where francie sat blushing and entranced too happy to speak and ivinghoe apparently contented to look at her  afterwards he was allowed to take possession of her for the afternoon so as to be able to tease her about what she was dreaming about him  after all it had probably been evoked by the dogs bark and his step for she had thought a wolf was pursuing her and that he had come to save her  it was quite enough to be food for a lover  clement would have wished to keep all to themselves at least till the paternal visit was over but ivinghoes days were few and he made sure of bringing his parents on the morrow  an expedition had been arranged to the valley where some of the benista family were reported to live since the snows had departed enough for safety but this must needs be deferred and there was no doubt that the reason why would be sought out  indeed so close was the great house and so minute a watch was kept that the fact of lord ivinghoes spending the whole day at the parsonage was known and conclusions were arrived at  maura stole down in the late evening among the olive trees ostensibly to ask anna and francie to come and listen to the nightingales  but thereby she was witness to a scene that showed that there was another nightingale for franceska than the one who was singing with such energy among the olive boughs  in fact she saw the evening farewell and had not the discretion like anna to withdraw herself and her eyes but beheld what had ever been sacred to both those young things the first kiss  poor maura she had none of the reticent pride and shame of an english gentlewoman  she believed herself cruelly treated and rushing away fell on anna who was hovering near watching to prevent any arrival such as was always probable  it would not be well to relate the angry foolish words that anna had to hear nor how maura betrayed herself and her own manoeuvre  it is enough to say that she went home weeping demonstratively perhaps uncontrollably and that anna after her trying scene was able to exalt more than ever ivinghoes generosity towards the absent gerald and forbearance towards franceska  if he had ever passed the line it was more mauras doing than his own     chapter xxxi  the cold shoulder    loath to depose the child your brothers son—shakespeare   a telegram early the next day announced that the rotherwood family were on their way and they came in due time the kind embrace that francie received from each in turn being such as to set doubts at rest  in fact the dread first of monte carlo and secondly of maura white had done much to prepare the way with lady rotherwood  if she had first heard of her sons attachment to the pretty child who acted mona daughter to the upstart vanderkists and with a ruined father of no good repute she would have held it a foolish delusion to be crushed without delay but when this same attachment had lasted eight or nine months and had only found avowal on the removal of a supposed rival when moreover her darling had been ill had revived at the aspect of the young lady and had conducted himself in a place of temptation so as to calm an anxious mothers heart she could see with his eyes not only that franceska was really beautiful graceful and a true lady but likely to develop still more under favourable circumstances that she had improved in looks air and manner on her travels also that she had never been injured by any contact with undesirable persons but had been trained by the excellent underwoods whose gentle blood and breeding were undeniable  nor would the daughter of the late sir adrian vanderkist baronet of ironbeam park sound much amiss  he was so late that his racing doings might be forgotten  indeed as the marchioness looked up to the castle she felt that she could forgive a good deal to the damsel who had saved the family from the sorry rebecca who had cried all night and was still crying whenever any more tears would come and not getting much pity from any of her relatives  mr white told her that she was a little fool to have expected anything from a young swell her brother said she might have known that it was absurd to expect that any one could look at her when miss franceska was by and mrs white observed that it was wonderful to her to see so little respect shown for maiden dignity as to endure to manifest disappointment  adeline might speak from ample experience and certainly her words had a salutary effect  however the whites en famille were not quite the same externally when lord rotherwood after luncheon went to see old white at the works and look after his font he met with a reception as stiff and cold as could well be paid to a distinguished customer who was not at all in fault and for the first time mr white was too busy to walk back with him to the castle to see adeline whom he found as usual on a couch on the terrace in the shade of the house a pretty picture among the flowers and vines  she was much more open with him as became one who understood more of his point of view  well rotherwood i suppose i am to congratulate you though it is scarcely a fair match in a worldly point of view  for which i care not a rap  she is a good simple girl and a perfect lady  and victoria  may i ask does not she think it a misalliance considering what these vanderkists are—and the underwoods  theres no one i respect more than lancelot underwood  as to victoria she is thankful that it is no worse  ah  i know what you mean but you cant wonder that my husband should feel it hard that there should have been some kind of flirtation  he is fond of maura you know and he does feel that there must have been some slyness in some one to cause this affair to have been so suddenly sprung on us  slyness—aye i believe there was  tell me ada had you any notion that that lad gerald underwood was engaged to dolores mohun  no who told you  mysie let it out  she had been warned not to mention it till his position was ascertained maurices consent and all  i must say mysie should have spoken  it was not fair towards me to keep it back  still less fair of maura if thats her name to hint at attachment between franceska and the boy  that was the embargo upon my poor fellow  he rushed off to have it out the moment he saw how matters stood  well it was a great shame but girls are girls especially with those antecedents and maura did not know to the contrary  you will believe me rotherwood i never had any desire that she should succeed  i would have sent her away if i could but you cant wonder that mr white is vexed and feels as if there had been underhand dealing  i see he is  but you will not let him make it unpleasant for the underwoods  oh no no  they have not much longer to stay  they are in correspondence about a rheumatic clergyman  mrs white however determined not to expose maura to her husband though she reproached her and was rather shocked by the young ladys selfdefence  it was a natural idea and no one had ever told her to the contrary  it was all spite in mysie merrifield to proclaim it after having kept it back so long  she really was in such a state of mind that mrs white was rather relieved that the rotherwoods had taken franceska to san remo to stay till ivinghoe had to depart  anna was left to send off the little felicitous note that she had written to her mother  each and all were writing letters that would be received with rapture almost incredulous for no one but sophia could have had any preparation  it is pleasant to think of poor aldas delight said geraldine over her writingcase  after all her troubles to have her utmost ambition fulfilled at last and yet—and yet it does seem turning that pretty creature over to a life of temptation  in good hands said clement  the youth himself is a nice honest fellow a mere boy as yet but it is something to have no harm in him at twoandtwenty and in the guards and his parents are evidently ready to watch over and guide them  if her head does not get turned sighed geraldine  just as likely in any other station replied clement  the protection must come from within not from the externals and i do think that she—yes and he too—have that guard within them  i think the sooner we are away from this place the better said geraldine  there are such things as cold shoulders and perhaps displeasure is in human nature though it is not our fault  which is the worse for us laughed her brother since we cant beg pardon  the cold shoulder was manifested by a note of apology the next morning from mr white  he was too busy to go with mr underwood to santa carmela on this day but had sent the young quarryman to act as guide and his foreman as interpreter  so clement had his long ride on muleback mostly in silence though this he scarcely lamented for he could better enjoy the mountain peaks and the valleys bright with rich grass with anemones of all colours hyacinths strange primulas and gentians without having to make talk to mr white  but his journey was without result  he did find an exceedingly old woman keeping sheep and spinning wool with a distaff who owned to the name of cecca benista  she once had a brother yes gian was his name but he went away as they all did  he had a voice bellissima si bellissima and some one told her long long ago that he had made his fortune and formed a company but he had never come home—no no and was probably dead though she had never heard and he had sent nothing—no no  then clement tried the priest of the curious little church on the hillside a memory of elijah and the convents on mount carmel  the parrocco was a courteous man quite a peasant and too young to know much about the past generation  he gave clement a refection of white bread goats milk cheese and coffee and held up his hands on the declining of his thin wine  there was a kind of register of baptisms and giovanni batista benista was hunted out and it was found that if alive he would be over seventy years old  but no more was known and there was no proof that he was dead twentytwo years before  that long day had convinced geraldine that the pleasantness of intercourse with the whites was over and she was not sorry that a letter was waiting for clement to say that the rheumatic clergyman would arrive if desired in another week  this was gladly accepted and the question remained whither should they go  clements year of absence would be over in june and he was anxious to get home besides that it was desirable to take francie to her mother as soon as possible  the only cause for delay was the possibility of geralds extracting something further from his mother which might lead to further researches on the continent but as most places were readily accessible from london this was decided against and it was determined to go back to brompton at the same time as the rotherwoods returned from san remo  on the last sunday mr white showed himself much more cordial than he had been since the crisis  he waited in the porch to say—  well sir you have given us some very excellent sermons and i am sure we are much obliged to you  if i can help you any more in investigating that unlucky affair of your nephew do not hesitate to write to me  i shall be delighted to assist you in coming to your rights  thank you though i sincerely hope they are not my rights  ah well  you are not so advanced in life but that if you came into anything good you might marry and start on a new lease  you are pounds better than when you came here  which last clause was so true that clement could only own it with thanks to his goodhumoured host who lingered a little still to say—  i am sorry any vexation arose about those foolish young people but you see young women will wish to do the best they can for themselves and will make mischief too if one listens to them  a sensible man wont  thats what i say  clement quite agreed though he was not sensible of having listened to any of the mischiefmaking but he heartily shook hands with mr white and went away glad to be at peace     chapter xxxii  the test of daydreams    faiths meanest deed more favour bears   where hearts and wills are weighed than brightest transports choicest prayers   that bloom their hour and fade—j h newman   that return to brompton was the signal for the numerous worries awaiting clement  first the doctors thought him much improved but declared that a return to full work at st matthews would overthrow all the benefit of his long rest and would not hear of his going back even with another curate for an experiment  then all went down to vale leston together  mr eddard was welcomed with rapture by his old flock  alda had been almost ill with excitement and delight and had not words enough to show her ecstasy over her beautiful daughter nor her gratitude to geraldine to whose management she insisted on attributing the glorious result  in vain did geraldine disclaim all diplomacy lady vanderkist was sure that all came of her savoir faire  at any rate it was really comfortable to be better beloved by alda than ever in the course of her life alda even intimated that she should be well enough to come to brompton to assist in the choice of the trousseau and the first annoyance was with clement for not allotting a disproportioned sum for the purpose  he declared that francie ought not to have more spent on her than was reserved for her sisters especially as it would be easy for her to supply all deficiencies while alda could not endure that the future lady ivinghoe should have an outfit unworthy of her rank even though both wilmet and geraldine undertook to assist  there were other difficulties for which the sojourn at vale leston was to be dreaded  gerald had been of age for two months and there were leases to be signed and arrangements made most difficult to determine in the present state of things  major and mrs harewood wanted to wind up their residence in the priory and to be able to move as soon as the wedding was over since franceska begged that it might be at the only home she remembered and her elders put aside their painful recollections to gratify her so that it was fixed for early august just a year since her unprepared appearance as mona  after all alda was really too ill to go to london and franceska had to be sent in charge of her aunt cherry and of her sister mary  lady rotherwood would be in town and might be trusted to have no unreasonable expectations  poor sophy  penbeacons destiny was one of the affairs that could not be settled and therewith her own though her mother could not succeed in penetrating any of the family with the horror of giving lord ivinghoe such a brotherinlaw  in the midst of the preparations came a letter from gerald  he did indeed write every sunday but of late his had been hurried letters he was so fully occupied and had so much writing on hand that he could not indulge in more length   you have been urging me he said to find out what my mother knows  i have not liked to press the subject while she was so ill as she always met every hint of it with tears and agitation however at last lida brought her to it and we really believe she knows no more than we do what became of her first husband  she never heard of him after she fled from him  she was almost a child and he had been very cruel to her  but she did tell us where we may be nearly certain of finding out namely from signor menotti via san giacomo genoa or his successors a man who trained singers and performers and moreover took charge of benistas money and she thinks he had considerable savings  poor woman i believe she had no idea of the harm she might be doing me though it was scarcely in human nature to see prosperity look so aggressive without trying to profit thereby and when she had put herself into olearys power the notion was to make an income out of me by private threats and holding their tongues  that i should have any objection to such an arrangement except on economical principles never entered their heads and they tried to make as much as possible out of either me or clement by withholding all the information possible till it was paid for and our simultaneous refusal to be blackmailed entirely disconcerted them and made them furious  lida said the man was violent with her mother for letting out even what she did to trousseau and the first annoyance was with clement for not allotting a disproportioned sum for the purpose  he declared that francie ought not to have more spent on her than was reserved for her

simultaneous refusal to be blackmailed entirely disconcerted them and made them furious  lida said the man was violent with her mother for letting out even what she did to lance and he meant to put a heavy price even on the final disclosure in the trust which i share that it may prove the key to the mystery she had no notion that the doubt was upsetting my position  poor thing she never had a chance in her life—gipsy breeding at first then benistas tender mercies and the wandering life  she could not fail to love my father till his requirements piqued her and it was a quarrel exasperated perhaps by the commencement of his illness over her neglect of my unlucky self and her acceptance of schnetterlings attentions that led to her abandoning him  i really do not think she ever realized that it was a sin  that good pere duchamps is the first priest of any kind she ever listened to and he has had a great effect upon her  he would like to extend it to lida and me but lida is staunch to her wellbeloved mr flight as well as to me and there is a church on the other side the bay to which i take her when our patient is well enough to spare her to walk or we can afford the crossing  easter was a comfort there  the warm weather has revived the patient and she may live some months longer though she is a mere skeleton  lida tends her in the most affectionate manner and is really a little angel in her way she has got some private pupils in music and is delighted to bring in grist to the mill which grinds hard enough to make me realize the old days you are so fond of recollecting  dont ask me to send you the lacustrian  i am ashamed of it and of my own articles  nothing will go down here but the most highly spiced and it is matter of life and death to us as long as my mother lives to keep on the swaying top of the poplar tree of popularity  you would despise the need and talk of felix but it is daily bread and i cannot let my mother and sister starve for opinions of mine  one comfort for you is that if i ever do come home again to reign at vale leston i shall have seen the outcome of various theories of last year and proved what is the effect of having no class to raise a standard or to look up to  i dont think i shall be quite so bumptious and i am quite sure i shall value my cheries tenderness much better than i have ever done more shame for me  love to the bride and all at vale leston  there is an old age of novelty about these eastern states quite disgusting in comparison with the reverend dignity of such a place as vale leston  you never thought that i appreciated it  you will find no fault with me on that score now  the lake is beautiful enough but i begin to hate the sight of it especially when a yankee insists on my telling him whether we have in all europe anything better than a duckpond in comparison  little lida is my drop of comfort since she has ceased to be mortally afraid of brother  love to all and sundry again                                            your loving g   there was a consultation over this letter which ended in john harewoods volunteering to go to genoa and find out this menotti or his representative returning in time for the wedding and hoping that the uncertainty would thus be over in time for the enjoyment of a truly prosperous event  a letter that came before his departure rendered geraldine doubly anxious for the decision  mrs henderson sent it to her to read saying that it was by lady merrifields advice since she thought that it should be known how it was with gerald for even to dolores he had not told half what ludmilla related   my dearest mrs henderson  it is a long time since i received your dearest kindest of letters and if i did not answer it sooner it was not from want of gratitude but attendance on my poor dear mother and assistance to our landlady occupies me at every minute that i can spare from giving music lessons to some private families and an evening class  i am very thankful to be able to earn something so as to take off something of the burthen on my dear brothers shoulders  for alas the care and support of my mother and me weigh very heavily upon him  the proprietor of the lacustrian has parted with his other clerk and my brother has the entire business of not only writing extracting for and editing the paper but of correcting the press and he dares not remonstrate or demand better payment as we live from week to week and he could not afford to be dismissed  he is at the office all day beginning at six in the morning to meet the central intelligence he only rushes home for his meals and goes back to work till twelve or one oclock at night  even then he cannot sleep i hear him tossing about with the pain in his back that sitting at his desk brings on and his hands are so tired by writing and with the heat which has been dreadful for the last few weeks and has taken away all the appetite he ever had  you would be shocked to see him he is so thin and altered i cannot think how he is to continue this but he will not hear of my writing to lady travis underwood he is never angry except when i try to persuade him and you never saw anything like his patience and gentleness to my poor mother  she never did either she cannot understand it at all  at first she thought he wanted to coax the confession out of her and when she found that it made no difference she could not recover from her wonderhe whom she had deserted in his babyhood and so cruelly injured in his manhood to devote himself to toiling for her sake and never to speak harshly to her for one moment  she knew i loved her and she had always been good to me except when oleary forced her to be otherwise but his behaviour has done more to touch her heart than anything and i am sure she is as pere duchamps says a sincere penitent  she is revived by the summer heat and can sit under the stoop and enjoy the sweet air of the lake but she is very weak and coughs dreadfully in the morning just when it is cooler and my brother might get some sleep  she tries to be good and patient with us both and it really does soothe her when my brother can sit by her and talk in his cheerful droll way but he can stay but a very short time  he has to rush back to his horrid stuffy office and then she frets after him and says but what right have i to such a son and she begins to cry and cough   ah said clement as geraldine unable to speak for tears gave him the letter  this is a furnace of real heroism  christian heroism i am sure said geraldine  oh my boy i am proud of him  he will be all the better for his brave experiment  yes he had an instinct that it would be wholesome besides the impelling cause  real hardship is sound training  if it is not too hard said she  let not their precious balms break my head said clement  i do not like that pain in the back  remember how he dragged his limbs when first we had him at home and how delicate he was up to thirteen—only eight years ago  probably it will not last long enough to do him much harm  and how nobly uncomplaining he is  this has brought out all the good we always trusted was in reserve  better than emilias experiment sighed geraldine  for emilia vanderkist before her year was over was at home having broken down and having spent most of her holidays with mrs peter brown the wife of sir ferdinands partner  she had come back not looking much the worse for her hospital experience but with an immense deal to say of the tyranny of the matron the rudeness of the nurses to probationers the hardness and tedium of the work to which she had been put and the hatefulness of patients and of doctors  anna sympathized with all the vehemence of her sisterly affection and could hardly believe her aunts who told her that things must have changed in a wonderful manner since the time of angelas experiences for she had been very happy in the same place and made no complaints  emilia had written to her cousin marilda to express her willingness to return so soon as the travis underwoods should come home and in the meantime she remained at vale leston not showing quite as much tolerance as might be expected of the somewhat narrow way of life of her sisters  she did not like being a lodger as it were in sophys bedroom she found fault with the parlourmaids waiting complained of the noise of the practising of the three little sisters and altogether reminded geraldine of alda in penance at home  major harewood was detained longer than he expected for on arriving at genoa he found that menotti had migrated and had to follow him to his villa on the apennines where in the first place he had to overcome the old mans suspicions that he was come to recover benistas means on behalf of his family and then at last was assured that the man had been dead long before 1870  still john harewood thought it well to obtain positive evidence and pursued the quest to innspruck where menotti averred that the man had been left by his companions dying in the care of some sisters of charity  so it proved  at innspruck the record of the burial of giovanni benista a native of piedmont was at length produced dated the 12th of february 1868 happily and incontestably before zorayas marriage to edgar underwood  john harewood made haste to telegraph the tidings to vale leston and to jonesville and came home exultant having dispelled the cloud that had brooded over the family for nearly a year and given them freely to enjoy the wedding  would they do so the more or the less for emilias announcement that she had a letter from mr ferdinand brown eldest son of sir ferdinands partner offering her marriage and that she had accepted him  he was of course a rich man but oh how emily annie and gerald had been wont to make fun of him and his parents  but my dear nan said she i shall be able to do much more good in that way  oh  and really i cannot go back to those intolerable backgammon evenings at kensington palace gardens     chapter xxxiii  a missionary wedding    till the smooth temper of my age might be like the high leaves upon the holly tree—southey   the neighbourhood said that nothing was ever done at vale leston according to the conventionalities and the devereux wedding was an instance  lancelot had brought word that bishop norman may had actually arrived from new zealand for a halfyears visit bringing with him the younger missionary leonard ward and that dr mays happiness was unspeakable  a renewed youth if he needed to have it renewed  clement and william harewood went over to see them and returned greatly impressed and resolved on convoking the neighbourhood to be stirred in the cause of the pacific islands  at the same time one of the many letters from lady rotherwood about arrangements ended with—my husband hopes you will be able to arrange for us to be introduced to your connections of the may family the bishop mr ward and the good old doctor of whom we have heard so much  we must invite them all to the wedding said mrs harewood who as still inhabiting the priory would be the hostess  certainly returned william harewood but i dont think mr ward would come  he looks like an ancient hermit  the best way said mrs grinstead would be to finish up the weddingday with a missionary gardenparty  geraldine said lady vanderkist from her sofa in feeble accents of dismay but mrs william harewood hardly heard and did not notice  it would be the most admirable plan  it would give people something to do and make a reason for having ever so many more  baits cleverly disposed said william  the spg to attract ward ward to attract the marquis and the marquis to attract the herd  everybody throngs to the extremest outskirts of a wedding said geraldine  they may have the presents on view in the long room said wilmet  provided they dont have the list of them printed said geraldine lance wont put them into the pursuivant it is disgusting  so i have always thought said robina but you hardly make allowances for the old ladies who love to spell them out  the marquis of rotherwood—a goldtopped dressingcase miss keren happuch tripp—a pincushion said geraldine  it is the idlest gossip and should not be encouraged  and added robina as we go out through the cloister there will happily be no rice  will has stopped it in the churchyard  and fortunately we have no schoolboys to reckon with except adrian and fely who will be quite amenable  for kester harewood was in india and edward on the mediterranean adrian was at home doing credit to miss mohun and so vehemently collecting stamps that he was said to wish to banish all his friends to the most remote corners of the earth to send them home  francies elder sisters declined being bridesmaids so that phyllis and mysie were the chief and the three young sisters wilmet alda and joan with two little underwoods and two small harewoods all in white frocks and sashes were to attend and make a halfcircle round the bride  all took effect as had been purposed each party being equally desirous that it should be truly a christian wedding such as might be a fit emblem of the great marriage feast and bring a blessing— joyous and happy yet avoiding the empty pomp and foolish mirth that might destroy the higher thoughts  how beautiful vale leston church looked decked with white roses lilies and myrtle  the bride tall and stately in her flowing veil and glistening satin train had her own sweet individuality not too closely recalling the former little bride  she came on her uncle clements arm as most nearly representing a father to her and the marriage blessing was given by the majesticlooking bishop with the two chief local clergy mr william harewood and mr charles audley taking part of the service  it was a beautiful and impressive scene and there was a great peace on all  it was good to see the intense bliss on ivinghoes face as he led his bride down the aisle and along the cloister and as they came into the drawingroom after she had received an earnest kiss and my pretty one from his father it was to dr may that he first led her  dr may his figure still erect his face bright and cheery his brow entirely bare and his soft white locks flowing over his collar  he held out his hands ah young things  you are come for the old mans blessing  truly you have it my lady fair  you are fair indeed as fair within as without  you have a great deal in the power of those little hands and you—oh yes both of you believe that a true faithful loving elevating wife is the blessing of all ones days whether it be only for a few years or as i trust and pray it may be with you for a long—long good and prosperous life together  the two young things bent their heads and he blessed them with his blessing of eighty years  lord rotherwoods eyes were full of tears as he said in a choked voice—  thank you sir while franceska murmured to mysie—  i do like that he should have been the first to call me my lady  the luncheon included only the two families and the actual assistants at the wedding and it was really very merry  lady rotherwood did inspire a little awe but then alda sitting near knew exactly how to talk to her and alda who like geraldine had dressed herself in soft greys and whites with her delicate cheeks flushed with pleasure and triumph looked as beautiful as ever and far outshone her twin whose complexion and figure both had become those of the portly housewife  meta otherwise mrs norman may had eyes as bright and lively as ever though face and form had both grown smaller and she was more like a fairy godmother than the titania she had been in times of old she had got into the middle of all the varieties of children dragged thither by gertrudes pearl and audrey and was making them happy  ethel and geraldine never could come to the end of what they had to say to one another except that ethel could but be delighted to make her friend know the brother of her early youth and show her the grave earnestlooking man who had suffered so much and whose hair was as white as the doctors his face showing the sunburn of the tropics and the crowsfeet round his eyes the sailors habit of searching gaze  he did not speak much but watched the merry young groups as if they were a sort of comedy in his eyes  they were very merry especially when the doctor had proposed the health of the bride and her brother sir adrian was called on to return thanks for her  gentlemen and ladies he said no i mean ladies and gentlemen i am very much obliged to you all for the honour you have done my sister  i can tell lord ivinghoe she is a very good girl and very nice and all that when she is not cocky and doesnt try to keep one in order  the speech was drowned in laughter and calls to ivinghoe to mind what he was about and beware of the new woman  so the young couple were seen off to spend their honeymoon in scotland and the rest of the party could pair off to enjoy their respective friends except that mary and sophy had to exhibit the wedding presents to all and sundry of the visitors of all degrees who began to flock in  seats were ranged on the lawn and when every one had had time to wonder at everything from lady rotherwoods set of emeralds down to the choirboys carved bracket the housebell was rung and all had to take their places on the lawn fairly shaded by house cloister and cedar tree and facing the conservatory whose steps with the terrace formed a kind of platform  it is not needful to go through all or how john harewood as host explained that they had thought that it would be well to allow their guests to have the advantage of hearing their distinguished visitors tell of their experiences  and so they did the bishop pleading the cause of missions with his wonderful native eloquence as he stood by the chair where his father sat listening to him as to a strain of sweet music long out of reach  then leonard ward simply and bluntly told facts about the pacific islands and islanders that set hearts throbbing and impelled more than one young heart to long to tread in the like course  then lord rotherwood thanked and bungled as usual so that gustave tanneguy would have a hard matter to reduce what he called the aristocratic tongue to plain english or rather reporters english the listeners were refreshed with tea coffee and lemonade and there was a final service in the church which many gladly attended and thus ended what had been a true holiday     chapter xxxiv  righted    perhaps the cup was broken here that heavens new wine might show more clear                                  e b browning                                no 14 huron st jonesville ohio                                               july 19  my dear madam  you were so kind as to tell me to write to your ladyship if we were in any difficulty or distress and i have often longed to do so but my brother always said that we had no right to trespass on your goodness  now however things are at such a pass that i think you will hear of us with true compassion  i do not know whether he told you that we met my poor mother on board a steamer upon this lake her husband had been drowned in a wreck while crossing and she was reduced to great poverty and had also from exposure contracted disease of the lungs which the doctor said must terminate fatally in a few months  my brother took charge of her and has supported us ever since now four months by working at the editorship of the lacustrian intelligencer with such small assistance as i could give by music lessons it involved severe labour at desk work and late hours and his health has latterly given way his back and lower limbs being gradually affected and last monday even his hands proved helpless  my poor mother broke another bloodvessel on sunday and died ten minutes later  my brother desired me to sell his dear violin and his watch to pay the funeral expenses but after that i know not what we can do as he is quite helpless and can hardly be left even for the sake of my small earnings  dear lady travis underwood pray help us as i know you and sir ferdinand love my poor dear generous brother and will not think him ungrateful for having declined your kindness while he could support himself and us  no doubt we shall get help from england but not for some time so i dare to ask you                                    i remain your humble servant                                                        ludmilla  ps—everybody knows him as jerry wood  we are at mr macmahons 14 huron street   this sad letter in lidas neat pupilteachers hand came enclosed within a longer letter from marilda                                     grand national hotel jonesville                                             july 23rd  my dear geraldine  you will believe that this letter from poor lydia made fernan telegraph at once to her and hurry off as soon as we could reach the train  we found things quite as bad or worse than we expected  the poor children were living in two rooms in a wretched little house of an irish collier who with his wife happily has been very kind to them and says that nothing could surpass their goodness to that poor mother of theirs who she tells me made a real christian end at last  i am sure she had need to do so  the burial was happily over conducted by the french priest as the woman was a roman catholic to the last  gerald was sitting up by the window so changed that we should not have known him except for the wonderful likeness to felix that has come upon him  it seems that he had not only all the writing of that horrid paper to do but all the compositors work or whatever you call it  the people put upon him when they saw how well he could do it and he could not refuse because his mother needed comforts and he durst not get thrown out of employment  he went on first with aching back then his legs got stiff and staggering but still he went on and now it has gone into his hands he cannot hold a pen and can hardly lift a teacup  but he is so cheerful almost merry  the doctor says it is a paralytic affection and that overwork has developed the former disease from the old injury to the spine which seemed to have passed off and there is intermittent fever about him too a not uncommon thing in these lowlying lake districts  we have moved him to this grand national hotel a big halfinhabited place but better than the macmahons house though the good woman cried over him and lydia at their farewells and said she never should see such a young gentleman and lady again with hearts so like ould ireland  she would hardly take the money that fernan offered her she said they had brought a blessing on her house with their tender loving ways  fernan is gone to milwaukee to get further advice and more comforts for gerald and we mean as soon as he can be moved to take him home with us since the air of the rockies will revive him if anything will  this place is fearfully hot and oppressive the bay seems to shut out air from lake erie and i cannot bear to think what that poor boy must have gone through in that close little den with the printingpress humming and stamping away close to him but he says it is his native element and that when he is better he must go to fiddlers ranch  he sends his love and fears that you have missed his letters but he could hardly write them and thought lydia might alarm you  he is a very dear boy and i do hope we make him comfortable he is so thankful for the little we can do for him and so patient  he tells me to give special love to francie and say he is glad that monas game of chess was played out with a good substitute for ferdinand  these are his words which no doubt she will understand  we think of moving next week but much depends on the doctors verdict  my love too to the dear francie she will be a great lady quite beyond our sphere  perhaps she may be able to give emily some amusements though i fear they will only make her more discontented with our humdrum ways  i never thought hospital work would suit her  gerald says there is nothing like trying ones theories and that having to exaggerate his own has made him sick of a good deal of them though not of all  poor dear boy i hope he will live to show the benefits he says he has derived from this sad time  it shall not be for want of anything we can do  he is as near our hearts as ever his dear father was and lydia is a dear little girl                                      your ever affectionate cousin                                       mary alda travis underwood   it was a great shock though mitigated by hearing that gerald was in such hands as those of his first friend and kind marilda but there was great surprise at no notice being taken of the tidings that secured geralds position  john harewood had telegraphed them but it only now fully broke on him that he ought to have sent them to jerry wood instead of gerald underwood so that italian telegrams were not to blame  on one thing clement ventured being nearly certain that the reaction of geralds mind would not include the preventing of all penbeacon works  he encouraged young bramshaw to set about the plans so as to make the washings as innocuous as possible being persuaded that this was the only way to prevent more obnoxious erections on ground just beyond  moreover this gave the lovers hope and alda had under clements persuasion and rebukes withdrawn her opposition to the engagement so that sophy was free to wander about penbeacon with her philip and help to set up his theodolite and hold the end of his measuringtape  her mother could not well stand out on the score of unequal birth when mr ferdinand brown whose father had swept out the office came down and was accepted with calm civility it could not be called delight even by emilia  but he was a worthy young man and well educated and it was for his sake that clement and geraldine had stayed on at the priory giving the harewoods and their curates holidays in turn though even this amount of work was enough to leave with clement a dread conviction that his full share of st matthews would be fatal to him insomuch that he had written to the patron the bishop of albertstown seriously to propose resignation  fresh letters arrived from america the first slightly more cheery but the next was dated from violinia to the general surprise and it was very short from sir ferdinand   dear clement  we have the telegram a relief to the poor lads mind but he has not spoken much since  it came just as we were starting in an invalid pullman fitted with every comfort but the jars of these lines are unavoidable and unspeakable and he suffered so terribly as well as so patiently that we had to give up our intention of taking him to underwood  the one thing he begged for was that we would take him to fiddlers ranch  you know there is a mission station here so we have him in the clergymans house and the place is so advanced that he has every comfort  but i doubt whether the dear boy will ever move again  he is perfectly helpless but his brain quite clear and his spirits good                                         ever yours                                           f a travis underwood   there followed a long letter dictated by gerald himself and partly written by lida partly by marilda at several different times   dearest most dearest cherie and all—  i should like to be able to sign my name to my thanks to all if only to feel that i have a name and one so honoured but these fingers of mine will not obey me so you must take the will for the deed and believe that you have made me very happy and completed all i could wish  i fear you never will believe how jolly it is to lie here the pain all gone since having done with that terrific train and the three tenderest most watchful of slaves always round me while my cherie is spared the sight of the wreck—l  you know that good old fernan established a missionary station here building a church and getting the ground consecrated where my father lies  i can just see the top of the cross and there he promises that i shall lie  you will be able to put my name in the cloister under my fathers as no impostor  dont grieve my cherie it is best as it is my brains were full of more notions than you ever quite guessed and of which i have seen the seamy side out here though there is much that i should feel bound to work out and that might have grieved you  i was not tough enough for the discipline that was needed to strike the balance  he is thinking aloud dear fellow—m a  i am afraid i have often vexed you in my crudeness and conceit but i know you forgive  i am very thankful for this year and for the way in which my poor mother was given into my hands at last  fernan has helped me to make a short will to save confusion and difficulty  i have left everything to clement knowing that you and he will provide for all  fernan and marilda will care for lida  that we will—m a  i cannot leave her to be a tax on vale leston  give my books and mss to dolores and please be kind to her  my violin which fernan redeemed for me the eponym how do you spell it—m a by the way of this place my fathers own fiddle give to lance for his pretty ariel anna my good sister should have my music which will be a memory of happy evenings  emmie may like the portfolio of drawings that i made for the missionhouse dear old sibby the photograph in my room of the ecce homo  i have it in my eye now—m a  everything is such a comfort fernan and marilda are the best of nurses and helpers and i mourn for the folly that chaffed about them and boredom  tell emmie so  fernan has made this place a little oasis round my fathers grave and his parson who has a mission among the remains of the sioux is with me every other day and does all that clement could desire for me  so do—do believe that it is all for the best dear people—l  one thing good is that i shall not bring any bad blood into the underwood inheritance  by the bye tell them—continued by marilda mr gracchus van — suddenly arrived here greatly shocked at geralds state and actually wanting to marry lydia on the spot— which of course she declined  but fernan was pleased with him and he told him he had never met any one to hold a candle to jerry wood so smart and chipper as he saw at first and then cheerful goodhumoured and kindly whatever happened  none of your britishers airs but ready to make the best of any fixings  i dont think dear gerald meant me to tell all this but think of the difference from the fastidious fine gentleman he used to be  he is dozing now i fear he is getting weaker but he is ever so sweet and good and i quite long to beg his pardon for having called him your spoilt boy  mr fraser the clergyman here is very much struck with him and fernan remembers the time when he baptized him as he lay unconscious  dear cherry it will grieve you but i think there will be comfort in the grief                                       your affectionate cousin                                                        m a t u   there were long letters to dolores dictated to lida—all in the same spirit  one of them said go bravely on my dolores though we do not live together in our bicycleroving castles  you will do good work if you uphold the glory of god and the improvement of man all through creation and science  i should like to talk it over with you  things are plainer to me than in the days of my inexperience and cocksureness  short as the time was in months it showed me much more especially my own inefficiency to deal with the great problems of these times perhaps of all times  remember this but go on—if we do but put grains of sand into the great edifice  more was written but these were the most memorable extracts before the letter that told that something like a fresh stroke had come and taken away the power of distinct speech then that the throat had failed and there was only one foreboding more to be told and soon realized  the young ardent spirit trained by so short a discipline had passed away in peace  and they laid him beside his father whose better spirit he had unconsciously evoked and whom he had loved so deeply  the doctors said that the real cause of his death had been the indian bullet inflicting injury on the spine which the elasticity of youth had for the time overcome but which manifested itself again under overstrain  ferdinand when he awoke the child back to life had given him years not spent in vain for himself or for others   it would have been utter desolation to the little sister save for the motherly tenderness of marilda who took her to the home in the rocky mountains and would fain have adopted her but that lida acting perhaps on advice from her brother only begged to be so educated as to fit her to be independent and to be given a start in life  it would be shown in a year or two whether her vocation should be musical or scholastic  gerald had his meed of tears at home but not bitter ones  nay those that had the most quality of bitterness were emilias shed in secret lest interpretations should be put on those that had the quality of remorse as she recollected the high aspirations that had ended so differently in the two cousins  dolores dried hers to feel a consecration on her studies and her labours as she grew forward to the fulfilment of her purpose of being a leading woman in the instruction and formation of young minds working all the better for the inspiriting words and example and the more gently and sympathizingly for the love that was laid up in her heart  she and his cherie came to have a great affection and understanding of each other and discussed what dolores called ethics with warm interest the elder lady bringing the old and sacred lights to bear on the newer theories  clement was the undoubted owner of vale leston and the john harewoods had decided on leaving the priory  just at the same time when the acceptance of clements resignation of st matthews had arrived william harewood was offered a canonry at minsterham with the headship of the theological college  the canonry had been the summit of his ambition when a boy and there was no one fitter than he for the care of a theological college  he was preeminently a scholar and his fifteen years of parish experience made good preparation for training young clergy  so clement could decide on presenting himself to the living of vale leston with a staff of curates and geraldine to be his home sister making the priory a restingplace for overworked people whether clergy governesses or poor or missionfolk at home  it was a trust to be kept for lancelot and his boy who would make the summer home of the family there to dr mays great content  it was a peaceful home and to every ones surprise alda decided to remain at hand chiefly to keep her boy under his uncles influence which thus far was keeping him well in hand and as he would go to a public school with little felix might be prolonged  it was a comfort and encouragement to feel that hereditary dangers and temperament could be subdued and conquered in gerald and if the sins of parents had their consequence in the children the scourge might become a palm  when the commemorative brass in the cloister was to be put up geraldine said—  i should like to put rejoice with me for i have found the piece that was lost  he never was lost  oh no no my dear boy  but his work was so like the finding the stained tarnished piece of silver cast aside defaced dustmarked and by simple duty and affection bringing her back  i see  let us have the inscription in greek  then none can apply it to himself  it was a wonderful work and it is strange that having fulfilled it he who brought the child from his fathers arms should lay him to his rest beside his father   the end
