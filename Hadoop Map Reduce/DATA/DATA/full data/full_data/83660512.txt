83660512	the letters of robert louis stevenson volume ii     chapter viii  life at bournemouth continued january 1886july 1887      letter  to mrs de mattos    skerryvore bournemouth january 1st 1886  dearest katharine  here on a very little book and accompanied  with lame verses i have put your name  our kindness is now  getting well on in years it must be nearly of age and it gets  more valuable to me with every time i see you  it is not possible  to express any sentiment and it is not necessary to try at least  between us  you know very well that i love you dearly and that i  always will  i only wish the verses were better but at least you  like the story and it is sent to you by the one that loves you   jekyll and not hyde  r l s  ave  bells upon the city are ringing in the night high above the gardens are the houses full of light on the heathy pentlands is the curlew flying free and the broom is blowing bonnie in the north countrie  we cannae break the bonds that god decreed to bind still well be the children of the heather and the wind far away from home o its still for you and me that the broom is blowing bonnie in the north countrie  r l s    letter  to alison cunningham    skerryvore bournemouth 1st 1886  my dear kinnicum  i am a very bad dog but not for the first  time  your book which is very interesting came duly and i  immediately got a very bad cold indeed and have been fit for  nothing whatever  i am a bit better now and aye on the mend so i  write to tell you i thought of you on new years day though i  own it would have been more decent if i had thought in time for  you to get my letter then  well what cant be cured must be  endured mr lawrie and you must be content with what i give  if  i wrote all the letters i ought to write and at the proper time i  should be very good and very happy but i doubt if i should do  anything else  i suppose you will be in town for the new year and i hope your  health is pretty good  what you want is diet but it is as much  use to tell you that as it is to tell my father  and i quite admit  a diet is a beastly thing  i doubt however if it be as bad as  not being allowed to speak which i have tried fully and do not  like  when at the same time i was not allowed to read it passed  a joke  but these are troubles of the past and on this day at  least it is proper to suppose they wont return  but we are not  put here to enjoy ourselves  it was not gods purpose and i am  prepared to argue it is not our sincere wish  as for our deserts  the less said of them the better for somebody might hear and  nobody cares to be laughed at  a good man is a very noble thing to  see but not to himself what he seems to god is fortunately not  our business that is the domain of faith and whether on the first  of january or the thirtyfirst of december faith is a good word to  end on  my dear cummy many happy returns to you and my best love  the  worst correspondent in the world  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mr and mrs thomas stevenson    skerryvore bournemouth january 1st 1886  my dear people  many happy returns of the day to you all i am  fairly well and in good spirits and much and hopefully occupied  with dear jenkins life  the inquiry in every detail every letter  that i read makes me think of him more nobly  i cannot imagine  how i got his friendship i did not deserve it  i believe the  notice will be interesting and useful  my fathers last letter owing to the use of a quill pen and the  neglect of blottingpaper was hopelessly illegible  every one  tried and every one failed to decipher an important word on which  the interest of one whole clause and the letter consisted of two  depended  i find i can make little more of this but ill spare the blots   dear people ever your loving son  r l s  i will try again being a giant refreshed by the house being empty   the presence of people is the great obstacle to letterwriting  i  deny that letters should contain news i mean mine those of other  people should  but mine should contain appropriate sentiments and  humorous nonsense or nonsense without the humour  when the house  is empty the mind is seized with a desire  no that is too strong   a willingness to pour forth unmitigated rot which constitutes  in me the true spirit of correspondence  when i have no remarks  to offer and nobody to offer them to my pen flies and you see  the remarkable consequence of a page literally covered with words  and genuinely devoid of sense  i can always do that if quite  alone and i like doing it but i have yet to learn that it is  beloved by correspondents  the deuce of it is that there is no  end possible but the end of the paper and as there is very little  left of that  if i cannot stop writing  suppose you give up  reading  it would all come to the same thing and i think we  should all be happier    letter  to w h low    skerryvore bournemouth jan 2nd 1886  my dear low  lamia has come and i do not know how to thank you  not only for the beautiful art of the designs but for the handsome  and apt words of the dedication  my favourite is bathes unseen  which is a masterpiece and the next into the green recessed  woods is perhaps more remarkable though it does not take my  fancy so imperiously  the night scene at corinth pleases me also   the second part offers fewer opportunities  i own i should like to  see both isabella and the eve thus illustrated and then theres  hyperion  o yes and endymion  i should like to see the lot   beautiful pictures dance before me by hundreds  i believe endymion  would suit you best  it also is in faeryland and i see a hundred  opportunities cloudy and flowery glories things as delicate as  the cobweb in the bush actions not in themselves of any mighty  purport but made for the pencil  the feast of pan peonas isle  the slabbed margin of a well the chase of the butterfly the  nymph glaucus cybele sleep on his couch a farrago of  unconnected beauties  but i divagate and all this sits in the  bosom of the publisher  what is more important i accept the terms of the dedication with a  frank heart and the terms of your latin legend fairly  the sight  of your pictures has once more awakened me to my right mind  something may come of it yet one more bold push to get free of  this prisonyard of the abominably ugly where i take my daily  exercise with my contemporaries  i do not know i have a feeling  in my bones a sentiment which may take on the forms of  imagination or may not  if it does i shall owe it to you and  the thing will thus descend from keats even if on the wrong side of  the blanket  if it can be done in prose  that is the puzzle  i  divagate again  thank you again  you can draw and yet you do not  love the ugly  what are you doing in this age  flee while it is  yet time they will have your four limbs pinned upon a stable door  to scare witches  the ugly my unhappy friend is de rigueur  it  is the only wear  what a chance you threw away with the serpent   why had apollonius no pimples  heavens my dear low you do not  know your business  i send you herewith a gothic gnome for your greek nymph but the  gnome is interesting i think and he came out of a deep mine  where he guards the fountain of tears  it is not always the time  to rejoice  yours ever  r l s  the gnomes name is jekyll  hyde i believe you will find he is  likewise quite willing to answer to the name of low or stevenson  same day  i have copied out on the other sheet some bad verses  which somehow your picture suggested as a kind of image of things  that i pursue and cannot reach and that you seem  no not to have  reached  but to have come a thought nearer to than i  this is the  life we have chosen  well the choice was mad but i should make  it again  what occurs to me is this  perhaps they might be printed in say  the century for the sake of my name and if that were possible  they might advertise your book  it might be headed as sent in  acknowledgment of your lamia  or perhaps it might be introduced by  the phrases i have marked above  i dare say they would stick it  in  i want no payment being well paid by lamia  if they are not  keep them to yourself   to will h low   damned bad lines in return for a beautiful book  youth now flees on feathered foot faint and fainter sounds the flute rarer songs of gods and still somewhere on the sunny hill or along the winding stream through the willows flits a dream flits but shows a smiling face flees but with so quaint a grace none can choose to stay at home all must follow  all must roam this is unborn beauty  she now in air floats high and free takes the sun and breaks the blue  late with stooping pinion flew raking hedgerow trees and wet her wing in silver streams and set shining foot on temple roof now again she flies aloof coasting mountain clouds and kissed by the evenings amethyst in wet wood and miry lane still we pound and pant in vain still with earthy foot we chase waning pinion fainting face still with grey hair we stumble on till  behold  the vision gone where has fleeting beauty led to the doorway of the dead qy omit life is gone but life was gay we have come the primrose way  r l s    letter  to edmund gosse    skerryvore bournemouth jan 2nd 1886  my dear gosse  thank you for your letter so interesting to my  vanity  there is a review in the st jamess which as it seems  to hold somewhat of your opinions and is besides written with a  pen and not a poker we think may possibly be yours  the prince  has done fairly well in spite of the reviews which have been bad   he was as you doubtless saw well slated in the saturday one  paper received it as a childs story another picture my agony  described it as a gilbert comedy  it was amusing to see the race  between me and justin mcarthy  the milesian has won by a length  that is the hard part of literature  you aim high and you take  longer over your work and it will not be so successful as if you  had aimed low and rushed it  what the public likes is work of any  kind a little loosely executed so long as it is a little wordy a  little slack a little dim and knotless the dear public likes it  it should if possible be a little dull into the bargain  i know  that good work sometimes hits but with my hand on my heart i  think it is by an accident  and i know also that good work must  succeed at last but that is not the doing of the public they are  only shamed into silence or affectation  i do not write for the  public i do write for money a nobler deity and most of all for  myself not perhaps any more noble but both more intelligent and  nearer home  let us tell each other sad stories of the bestiality of the beast  whom we feed  what he likes is the newspaper and to me the press  is the mouth of a sewer where lying is professed as from an  university chair and everything prurient and ignoble and  essentially dull finds its abode and pulpit  i do not like  mankind but men and not all of these  and fewer women  as for  respecting the race and above all that fatuous rabble of  burgesses called the public god save me from such irreligion   that way lies disgrace and dishonour  there must be something  wrong in me or i would not be popular  this is perhaps a trifle stronger than my sedate and permanent  opinion  not much i think  as for the art that we practise i  have never been able to see why its professors should be respected   they chose the primrose path when they found it was not all  primroses but some of it brambly and much of it uphill they  began to think and to speak of themselves as holy martyrs  but a  man is never martyred in any honest sense in the pursuit of his  pleasure and delirium tremens has more of the honour of the cross   we were full of the pride of life and chose like prostitutes to  live by a pleasure  we should be paid if we give the pleasure we  pretend to give but why should we be honoured  i hope some day you and mrs gosse will come for a sunday but we  must wait till i am able to see people  i am very full of jenkins  life it is painful yet very pleasant to dig into the past of a  dead friend and find him at every spadeful shine brighter  i  own as i read i wonder more and more why he should have taken me  to be a friend  he had many and obvious faults upon the face of  him the heart was pure gold  i feel it little pain to have lost  him for it is a loss in which i cannot believe i take it against  reason for an absence if not today then tomorrow i still  fancy i shall see him in the door and then now when i know him  better how glad a meeting  yes if i could believe in the  immortality business the world would indeed be too good to be  true but we were put here to do what service we can for honour  and not for hire  the sods cover us and the worm that never dies  the conscience sleeps well at last these are the wages besides  what we receive so lavishly day by day and they are enough for a  man who knows his own frailty and sees all things in the proportion  of reality  the soul of piety was killed long ago by that idea of  reward  nor is happiness whether eternal or temporal the reward  that mankind seeks  happinesses are but his wayside campings his  soul is in the journey he was born for the struggle and only  tastes his life in effort and on the condition that he is opposed   how then is such a creature so fiery so pugnacious so made up  of discontent and aspiration and such noble and uneasy passions   how can he be rewarded but by rest  i would not say it aloud for  mans cherished belief is that he loves that happiness which he  continually spurns and passes by and this belief in some ulterior  happiness exactly fits him  he does not require to stop and taste  it he can be about the rugged and bitter business where his heart  lies and yet he can tell himself this fairy tale of an eternal  teaparty and enjoy the notion that he is both himself and  something else and that his friends will yet meet him all ironed  out and emasculate and still be lovable  as if love did not live  in the faults of the beloved only and draw its breath in an  unbroken round of forgiveness  but the truth is we must fight  until we die and when we die there can be no quiet for mankind but  complete resumption into  what  god let us say  when all these  desperate tricks will lie spellbound at last  here came my dinner and cut this sermon short  excusez  r l s    letter  to james payn    skerryvore bournemouth jan 2nd 1886  dear james payn  your very kind letter came very welcome and  still more welcome the news that you see s tale  i will now tell  you and it was very good and very wise of me not to tell it  before that he is one of the most unlucky men i know having put  all his money into a pharmacy at hyeres when the cholera  certainly not his fault swept away his customers in a body  thus  you can imagine the pleasure i have to announce to him a spark of  hope for he sits today in his pharmacy doing nothing and taking  nothing and watching his debts inexorably mount up  to pass to other matters  your hand you are perhaps aware is not  one of those that can be read running and the name of your  daughter remains for me undecipherable  i call her then your  daughter  and a very good name too  and i beg to explain how it  came about that i took her house  the hospital was a point in my  tale but there is a house on each side  now the true house is the  one before the hospital  is that no 11  if not what do you  complain of  if it is how can i help what is true  everything in  the dynamiter is not true but the story of the brown box is in  almost every particular i lay my hand on my heart and swear to it   it took place in that house in 1884 and if your daughter was in  that house at the time all i can say is she must have kept very  bad society  but i see you coming  perhaps your daughters house has not a  balcony at the back  i cannot answer for that i only know that  side of queen square from the pavement and the back windows of  brunswick row  thence i saw plenty of balconies terraces rather  and if there is none to the particular house in question it must  have been so arranged to spite me  i now come to the conclusion of this matter  i address three  questions to your daughter  1st has her house the proper terrace  2nd  is it on the proper side of the hospital  3rd  was she there in the summer of 1884  you see i begin to fear that mrs desborough may have deceived me  on some trifling points for she is not a lady of peddling  exactitude  if this should prove to be so i will give your  daughter a proper certificate and her house property will return  to its original value  can man say more  yours very truly  robert louis stevenson  i saw the other day that the eternal had plagiarised from lost sir  massingberd  good again sir  i wish he would plagiarise the  death of zero    letter  to w h low    skerryvore bournemouth jan somethingorotherth 1886  my dear low  i send you two photographs  they are both done by  sir percy shelley the poets son which may interest  the sitting  down one is i think the best but if they choose that see that  the little reflected light on the nose does not give me a turnup  that would be tragic  dont forget baronet to sir percys name  we all think a heap of your book and i am well pleased with my  dedication  yours ever  r l stevenson  ps  apropos of the odd controversy about shelleys nose  i have  before me four photographs of myself done by shelleys son  my  nose is hooked not like the eagle indeed but like the  accipitrine family in man  well out of these four only one marks  the bend one makes it straight and one suggests a turnup  this  throws a flood of light on calumnious man  and the scandal mongering sun  for personally i cling to my curve  to continue  the shelley controversy  i have a look of him all his sisters had  noses like mine sir percy has a marked hook all the family had  high cheekbones like mine what doubt then but that this turnup  of which jeaffreson accuses the poet along with much other  fatras is the result of some accident similar to what has happened  in my photographs by his son  r l s    letter  to thomas stevenson    skerryvore bournemouth january 25 1886  my dear father  many thanks for a letter quite like yourself  i  quite agree with you and had already planned a scene of religion  in balfour the society for the propagation of christian knowledge  furnishes me with a catechist whom i shall try to make the man  i  have another catechist the blind pistolcarrying highway robber  whom i have transferred from the long island to mull  i find it a  most picturesque period and wonder scott let it escape  the  covenant is lost on one of the tarrans and david is cast on  earraid where being from inland he is nearly starved before he  finds out the island is tidal then he crosses mull to toronsay  meeting the blind catechist by the way then crosses morven from  kinlochaline to kingairloch where he stays the night with the good  catechist that is where i am next day he is to be put ashore in  appin and be present at colin campbells death  today i rest  being a little run down  strange how liable we are to brain fag in  this scooty family  but as far as i have got all but the last  chapter i think david is on his feet and to my mind a far  better story and far sounder at heart than treasure island  i have no earthly news living entirely in my story and only  coming out of it to play patience  the shelleys are gone the  taylors kinder than can be imagined  the other day lady taylor  drove over and called on me she is a delightful old lady and  great fun  i mentioned a story about the duchess of wellington  which i had heard sir henry tell and though he was very tired he  looked it up and copied it out for me in his own hand  your most  affectionate son  robert louis stevenson    letter  to c w stoddard    skerryvore bournemouth feb 13th 1886  my dear stoddard  i am a dreadful character but you see i have  at last taken pen in hand how long i may hold it god knows  this  is already my sixth letter today and i have many more waiting  and my wrist gives me a jog on the subject of scriveners cramp  which is not encouraging  i gather you were a little down in the jaw when you wrote your  last  i am as usual pretty cheerful but not very strong  i stay  in the house all winter which is base but as you continue to  see the pen goes from time to time though neither fast enough nor  constantly enough to please me  my wife is at bath with my father and mother and the interval of  widowery explains my writing  another person writing for you when  you have done work is a great enemy to correspondence  today i  feel out of health and shant work and hence this so much overdue  reply  i was rereading some of your south sea idyls the other day  some  of the chapters are very good indeed some pages as good as they  can be  how does your class get along  if you like to touch on otto any  day in a byhour you may tell them  as the authors last dying  confession  that it is a strange example of the difficulty of  being ideal in an age of realism that the unpleasant giddy mindedness which spoils the book and often gives it a wanton air  of unreality and juggling with airbells comes from unsteadiness  of key from the too great realism of some chapters and passages   some of which i have now spotted others i dare say i shall never  spot  which disprepares the imagination for the cast of the  remainder  any story can be made true in its own key any story can be made  false by the choice of a wrong key of detail or style  otto is  made to reel like a drunken  i was going to say man but let us  substitute cipher  by the variations of the key  have you  observed that the famous problem of realism and idealism is one  purely of detail  have you seen my note on realism in cassells  magazine of art and elements of style in the contemporary and  romance and humble apology in longmans  they are all in your  line of business let me know what you have not seen and ill send  em  i am glad i brought the old house up to you  it was a pleasant old  spot and i remember you there though still more dearly in your  own strange den upon a hill in san francisco and one of the most  san franciscoy parts of san francisco  goodbye my dear fellow and believe me your friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to j a symonds    skerryvore bournemouth spring 1886  my dear symonds  if we have lost touch it is i think only in a  material sense a question of letters not hearts  you will find a  warm welcome at skerryvore from both the lightkeepers and indeed  we never tell ourselves one of our financial fairy tales but a run  to davos is a prime feature  i am not changeable in friendship  and i think i can promise you you have a pair of trusty well wishers and friends in bournemouth  whether they write or not is  but a small thing the flag may not be waved but it is there  jekyll is a dreadful thing i own but the only thing i feel  dreadful about is that damned old business of the war in the  members  this time it came out i hope it will stay in in future  raskolnikoff is easily the greatest book i have read in ten years  i am glad you took to it  many find it dull  henry james could  not finish it  all i can say is it nearly finished me  it was  like having an illness  james did not care for it because the  character of raskolnikoff was not objective and at that i divined  a great gulf between us and on further reflection the existence  of a certain impotence in many minds of today which prevents them  from living in a book or a character and keeps them standing afar  off spectators of a puppet show  to such i suppose the book may  seem empty in the centre to the others it is a room a house of  life into which they themselves enter and are tortured and  purified  the juge dinstruction i thought a wonderful weird  touching ingenious creation  the drunken father and sonia and  the student friend and the uncircumscribed protaplasmic humanity  of raskolnikoff all upon a level that filled me with wonder  the  execution also superb in places  another has been translated   humilies et offenses  it is even more incoherent than le crime et  le chatiment but breathes much of the same lovely goodness and  has passages of power  dostoieffsky is a devil of a swell to be  sure  have you heard that he became a stout imperialist  conservative  it is interesting to know  to something of that  side the balance leans with me also in view of the incoherency and  incapacity of all  the old boyish idea of the march on paradise  being now out of season and all plans and ideas that i hear  debated being built on a superb indifference to the first  principles of human character a helpless desire to acquiesce in  anything of which i know the worst assails me  fundamental errors  in human nature of two sorts stand on the skyline of all this modem  world of aspirations  first that it is happiness that men want  and second that happiness consists of anything but an internal  harmony  men do not want and i do not think they would accept  happiness what they live for is rivalry effort success  the  elements our friends wish to eliminate  and on the other hand  happiness is a question of morality  or of immorality there is no  difference  and conviction  gordon was happy in khartoum in his  worst hours of danger and fatigue marat was happy i suppose in  his ugliest frenzy marcus aurelius was happy in the detested camp  pepys was pretty happy and i am pretty happy on the whole because  we both somewhat crowingly accepted a via media both liked to  attend to our affairs and both had some success in managing the  same  it is quite an open question whether pepys and i ought to be  happy on the other hand there is no doubt that marat had better  be unhappy  he was right if he said it that he was la misere  humaine cureless misery  unless perhaps by the gallows  death is  a great and gentle solvent it has never had justice done it no  not by whitman  as for those crockery chimneypiece ornaments the  bourgeois quorum pars and their cowardly dislike of dying and  killing it is merely one symptom of a thousand how utterly they  have got out of touch of life  their dislike of capital punishment  and their treatment of their domestic servants are for me the two  flaunting emblems of their hollowness  god knows where i am driving to  but here comes my lunch  which interruption happily for you seems to have stayed the  issue  i have now nothing to say that had formerly such a  pressure of twaddle  pray dont fail to come this summer  it will  be a great disappointment now it has been spoken of if you do   yours ever  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w h low    skerryvore bournemouth march 1886  my dear low  this is the most enchanting picture  now understand  my state  i am really an invalid but of a mysterious order  i  might be a malade imaginaire but for one too tangible symptom my  tendency to bleed from the lungs  if we could go 1st  we must  have money enough to travel with leisure and comfort  especially  the first  2nd  you must be prepared for a comrade who would go  to bed some part of every day and often stay silent 3rd  you  would have to play the part of a thoughtful courier sparing me  fatigue looking out that my bed was warmed etc 4th  if you are  very nervous you must recollect a bad haemorrhage is always on the  cards with its concomitants of anxiety and horror for those who  are beside me  do you blench  if so let us say no more about it  if you are still unafraid and the money were forthcoming i  believe the trip might do me good and i feel sure that working  together we might produce a fine book  the rhone is the river of  angels  i adore it  have adored it since i was twelve and first  saw it from the train  lastly it would depend on how i keep from now on  i have stood  the winter hitherto with some credit but the dreadful weather  still continues and i cannot holloa till i am through the wood  subject to these numerous and gloomy provisos i embrace the  prospect with glorious feelings  i write this from bed snow pouring without and no circumstance of  pleasure except your letter  that however counts for much  i am  glad you liked the doggerel  i have already had a liberal cheque  over which i licked my fingers with a sound conscience  i had not  meant to make money by these stumbling feet but if it comes it is  only too welcome in my handsome but impecunious house  let me know soon what is to be expected  as far as it does not  hang by that inconstant quantity my want of health  remember me  to madam with the best thanks and wishes and believe me your  friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs fleeming jenkin    skerryvore bournemouth april 1886  my dear mrs jenkin  i try to tell myself it is good nature but  i know it is vanity that makes me write  i have drafted the first part of chapter vi fleeming and his  friends his influence on me his views on religion and literature  his part at the savile it should boil down to about ten pages and  i really do think it admirably good  it has so much evoked  fleeming for myself that i found my conscience stirred just as it  used to be after a serious talk with him  surely that means it is  good  i had to write and tell you being alone  i have excellent news of fanny who is much better for the change   my father is still very yellow and very old and very weak but  yesterday he seemed happier and smiled and followed what was  said even laughed i think  when he came away he said to me  take care of yourself my dearie which had a strange sound of  childish days and will not leave my mind  you must get litolfs gavottes celebres  i have made another  trover there  a musette of lullys  the second part of it i have  not yet got the hang of but the first  only a few bars  the  gavotte is beautiful and pretty hard i think and very much of the  period and at the end of it this musette enters with the most  really thrilling effect of simple beauty  o  its firstrate  i  am quite mad over it  if you find other books containing lully  rameau martini please let me know also you might tell me you  who know bach where the easiest is to be found  i write all  morning come down and never leave the piano till about five  write letters dine get down again about eight and never leave  the piano till i go to bed  this is a fine life  yours most  sincerely  r l s  if you get the musette lullys please tell me if i am right and  it was probably written for strings  anyway it is as neat as  as  neat as bach  on the piano or seems so to my ignorance  i play much of the rigadoon but it is strange it dont come off  quite so well with me  musical score which cannot be reproduced  there is the first part of the musette copied from memory so i  hope theres nothing wrong  is it not angelic  but it ought of  course to have the gavotte before  the gavotte is in g and ends  on the keynote thus if i remember  musical score which cannot be reproduced  staccato i think  then you sail into the musette  nb  where i have put an a is that a dominant eleventh or  what or just a seventh on the d and if the latter is that  allowed  it sounds very funny  never mind all my questions if i  begin about music which is my leading ignorance and curiosity i  have always to babble questions  all my friends know me now and  take no notice whatever  the whole piece is marked allegro but  surely could easily be played too fast  the dignity must not be  lost the periwig feeling    letter  to thomas stevenson    skerryvore bournemouth march 1886  my dear father  the david problem has today been decided  i am  to leave the door open for a sequel if the public take to it and  this will save me from butchering a lot of good material to no  purpose  your letter from carlisle was pretty like yourself sir  as i was pleased to see the hand of jekyll not the hand of hyde   i am for action quite unfit and even a letter is beyond me so  pray take these scraps at a vast deal more than their intrinsic  worth  i am in great spirits about david colvin agreeing with  henley fanny and myself in thinking it far the most human of my  labours hitherto  as to whether the longeared british public may  take to it all think it more than doubtful i wish they would for  i could do a second volume with ease and pleasure and colvin  thinks it sin and folly to throw away david and alan breck upon so  small a field as this one  ever your affectionate son  r l s    letter  to mrs fleeming jenkin    skerryvore bournemouth april 15 or 16 the hour not being  known 1886  my dear mrs jenkin  it is i know not what hour of the night but  i cannot sleep have lit the gas and here goes  first all your packet arrived  i have dipped into the schumann  already with great pleasure  surely in what concerns us there is  a sweet little chirrup the good words arrived in the morning just  when i needed it and the famous notes that i had lost were  recovered also in the nick of time  and now i am going to bother you with my affairs  premising  first that this is private second that whatever i do the life  shall be done first and i am getting on with it well and third  that i do not quite know why i consult you but something tells me  you will hear with fairness  here is my problem  the curtin women are still miserable  prisoners no one dare buy their farm of them all the manhood of  england and the world stands aghast before a threat of murder  1  now my work can be done anywhere hence i can take up without loss  a backgoing irish farm and live on though not as i had  originally written in it  first reason  2 if i should be  killed there are a good many who would feel it  writers are so  much in the public eye that a writer being murdered would attract  attention throw a bullseye light upon this cowardly business   second reason  3 i am not unknown in the states from which the  funds come that pay for these brutalities  to some faint extent  my death if i should be killed would tell there  third reason   4 nobody else is taking up this obvious and crying duly  fourth  reason  5 i have a crazy health and may die at any moment my  life is of no purchase in an insurance office it is the less  account to husband it and the business of husbanding a life is  dreary and demoralising  fifth reason  i state these in no order but as they occur to me  and i shall do  the like with the objections  first objection  it will do no good you have seen gordon die and  nobody minded nobody will mind if you die  this is plainly of the  devil  second objection  you will not even be murdered the  climate will miserably kill you you will strangle out in a rotten  damp heat in congestion etc  well what then  it changes  nothing  the purpose is to brave crime let me brave it for such  time and to such an extent as god allows  third objection  the  curtin women are probably highly uninteresting females  i havent  a doubt of it  but the government cannot men will not protect  them  if i am the only one to see this public duty it is to the  public and the right i should perform it  not to mesdames curtin   fourth objection  i am married  i have married a wife  i seem  to have heard it before  it smells ancient what was the context   fifth objection  my wife has had a mean life 1 loves me 2  could not bear to lose me 3  1 i admit  i am sorry  2 but  what does she love me for and 3 she must lose me soon or late   and after all because we run this risk it does not follow we  should fail  sixth objection  my wife wouldnt like it  no she  wouldnt  who would  but the curtins dont like it  and all  those who are to suffer if this goes on wont like it  and if  there is a great wrong somebody must suffer  seventh objection   i wont like it  no i will not i have thought it through and i  will not  but what of that  and both she and i may like it more  than we suppose  we shall lose friends all comforts all society   so has everybody who has ever done anything but we shall have some  excitement and thats a fine thing and we shall be trying to do  the right and thats not to be despised  eighth objection  i am  an author with my work before me  see second reason  ninth  objection  but am i not taken with the hope of excitement  i was  at first  i am not much now  i see what a dreary friendless  miserable godforgotten business it will be  and anyway is not  excitement the proper reward of doing anything both right and a  little dangerous  tenth objection  but am i not taken with a  notion of glory  i dare say i am  yet i see quite clearly how all  points to nothing coming to a quite inglorious death by disease  and from the lack of attendance or even if i should be knocked on  the head as these poor irish promise how little any one will  care  it will be a smile at a thousand breakfasttables  i am  nearly forty now i have not many illusions  and if i had  i do  not love this healthtending housekeeping life of mine  i have a  taste for danger which is human like the fear of it  here is a  fair cause a just cause no knight ever set lance in rest for a  juster  yet it needs not the strength i have not only the passive  courage that i hope i could muster and the watchfulness that i am  sure i could learn  here is a long midnight dissertation with myself with you   please let me hear  but i charge you this  if you see in this  idea of mine the finger of duty do not dissuade me  i am nearing  forty i begin to love my ease and my home and my habits i never  knew how much till this arose do not falsely counsel me to put my  head under the bedclothes  and i will say this to you  my wife  who hates the idea does not refuse  it is nonsense says she  but if you go i will go  poor girl and her home and her garden  that she was so proud of  i feel her garden most of all because  it is a pleasure i suppose that i do not feel myself to share  1 here is a great wrong 2  growing wrong 3  wrong founded on crime 4  crime that the government cannot prevent 5  crime that it occurs to no man to defy 6 but it has occurred to me 7 being a known person some will notice my defiance 8 being a writer i can make people notice it 9 and i think make people imitate me 10 which would destroy in time this whole scaffolding of  oppression 11 and if i fail however ignominiously that is not my concern   it is with an odd mixture of reverence and humorous remembrances  of dickens be it said  it is anothers  and here at i cannot think what hour of the morning i shall dry  up and remain  yours really in want of a little help  r l s  sleepless at midnights dewy hour                       witching                        maudlin                        etc  next morning  eleventh objection  i have a father and mother   and who has not  macduffs was a rare case if we must wait for a  macduff  besides my father will not perhaps be long here   twelfth objection  the cause of england in ireland is not worth  supporting  a qui le ditesvous  and i am not supporting that   home rule if you like  cause of decency the idea that  populations should not be taught to gain public ends by private  crime the idea that for all men to bow before a threat of crime is  to loosen and degrade beyond redemption the whole fabric of mans  decency    letter  to mrs fleeming jenkin    skerryvore bournemouth april 1886  my dear mrs jenkin  the book  it is all drafted  i hope soon  to send you for comments chapters iii iv and v  chapter vii  is roughly but satisfactorily drafted  a very little work should  put that to rights  but chapter vi is no joke it is a mare  magnum  i swim and drown and come up again and it is all broken  ends and mystification  moreover i perceive i am in want of more  matter  i must have first of all a little letter from mr ewing  about the phonograph work  if you think he would understand it is  quite a matter of chance whether i use a word or a fact out of it   if you think he would not  i will go without  also could i have  a look at ewings precis  and lastly i perceive i must interview  you again about a few points they are very few and might come to  little and i propose to go on getting things as well together as i  can in the meanwhile and rather have a final time when all is  ready and only to be criticised  i do still think it will be good   i wonder if trelat would let me cut  but no i think i wouldnt  after all tis so quaint and pretty and clever and simple and  french and gives such a good sight of fleeming  the plum of the  book i think  you misunderstood me in one point  i always hoped to found such a  society that was the outside of my dream and would mean entire  success  but  i cannot play peter the hermit  in these days of  the fleet street journalist i cannot send out better men than  myself with wives or mothers just as good as mine and sisters i  may at least say better to a danger and a longdrawn dreariness  that i do not share  my wife says its cowardice what brave men  are the leaderwriters  call it cowardice it is mine  mind you  i may end by trying to do it by the pen only  i shall not love  myself if i do and is it ever a good thing to do a thing for which  you despise yourself  even in the doing  and if the thing you do  is to call upon others to do the thing you neglect  i have never  dared to say what i feel about mens lives because my own was in  the wrong  shall i dare to send them to death  the physician must  heal himself he must honestly try the path he recommends  if he  does not even try should he not be silent  i thank you very heartily for your letter and for the seriousness  you brought to it  you know i think when a serious thing is your  own you keep a saner man by laughing at it and yourself as you go   so i do not write possibly with all the really somewhat sickened  gravity i feel  and indeed what with the book and this business  to which i referred and ireland i am scarcely in an enviable  state  well i ought to be glad after ten years of the worst  training on earth  valetudinarianism  that i can still be  troubled by a duty  you shall hear more in time so far i am at  least decided  i will go and see balfour when i get to london  we have all had a great pleasure  a mrs rawlinson came and  brought with her a nineteenyearold daughter simple human as  beautiful as  herself i never admired a girl before you know it  was my weakness  we are all three dead in love with her  how nice  to be able to do so much good to harassed people by  yourself   ever yours  r l s    letter  to miss rawlinson    skerryvore bournemouth april 1886  of the many flowers you brought me only some were meant to stay and the flower i thought the sweetest was the flower that went away  of the many flowers you brought me all were fair and fresh and gay but the flower i thought the sweetest was the blossom of the may  robert louis stevenson    letter  to miss monroe    skerryvore bournemouth may 25th 1886  dear miss monroe  i hope i have this rightly i must lose no  time in thanking you for a letter singularly pleasant to receive   it may interest you to know that i read to the signature without  suspecting my correspondent was a woman though in one point a  reference to the countess i might have found a hint of the truth   you are not pleased with otto since i judge you do not like  weakness and no more do i  and yet i have more than tolerance for  otto whose faults are the faults of weakness but never of ignoble  weakness and who seeks before all to be both kind and just   seeks not succeeds  but what is man  so much of cynicism to  recognise that nobody does right is the best equipment for those  who do not wish to be cynics in good earnest  think better of  otto if my plea can influence you and this i mean for your own  sake  not his poor fellow as he will never learn your opinion  but for yours because as men go in this world and women too  you will not go far wrong if you light upon so fine a fellow and  to light upon one and not perceive his merits is a calamity  in  the flesh of course i mean in the book the fault of course is  with my stumbling pen  seraphina made a mistake about her otto it  begins to swim before me dimly that you may have some traits of  seraphina  with true ingratitude you see me pitch upon your exception but it  is easier to defend oneself gracefully than to acknowledge praise   i am truly glad that you should like my books for i think i see  from what you write that you are a reader worth convincing  your  name if i have properly deciphered it suggests that you may be  also something of my countrywoman for it is hard to see where  monroe came from if not from scotland  i seem to have here a  double claim on your good nature  being myself pure scotch and  having appreciated your letter make up two undeniable merits  which perhaps if it should be quite without trouble you might  reward with your photograph  yours truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to miss monroe    skerryvore bournemouth june 1886  my dear miss monroe  i am ill in bed and stupid incoherently  stupid yet i have to answer your letter and if the answer is  incomprehensible you must forgive me  you say my letter caused you  pleasure i am sure as it fell out not near so much as yours has  brought to me  the interest taken in an author is fragile  his  next book or your next year of culture might see the interest  frosted or outgrown and himself in spite of all you might  probably find the most distasteful person upon earth  my case is  different  i have bad health am often condemned to silence for  days together  was so once for six weeks so that my voice was  awful to hear when i first used it like the whisper of a shadow   have outlived all my chief pleasures which were active and  adventurous and ran in the open air  and being a person who  prefers life to art and who knows it is a far finer thing to be in  love or to risk a danger than to paint the finest picture or  write the noblest book i begin to regard what remains to me of my  life as very shadowy  from a variety of reasons i am ashamed to  confess i was much in this humour when your letter came  i had a  good many troubles was regretting a high average of sins had been  recently reminded that i had outlived some friends and wondering  if i had not outlived some friendships and had just while  boasting of better health been struck down again by my haunting  enemy an enemy who was exciting at first but has now by the  iteration of his strokes become merely annoying and inexpressibly  irksome  can you fancy that to a person drawing towards the  elderly this sort of conjunction of circumstances brings a rather  aching sense of the past and the future  well it was just then  that your letter and your photograph were brought to me in bed and  there came to me at once the most agreeable sense of triumph  my  books were still young my words had their good health and could go  about the world and make themselves welcome and even in a shadowy  and distant sense make something in the nature of friends for the  sheer hulk that stays at home and bites his pen over the  manuscripts  it amused me very much to remember that i had been in  chicago not so many years ago in my proper person where i had  failed to awaken much remark except from the ticket collector and  to think how much more gallant and persuasive were the fellows that  i now send instead of me and how these are welcome in that quarter  to the sitter of herr platz while their author was not very  welcome even in the villainous restaurant where he tried to eat a  meal and rather failed  and this leads me directly to a confession  the photograph which  shall accompany this is not chosen as the most like but the best looking  put yourself in my place and you will call this  pardonable  even as it is even putting forth a flattered  presentment i am a little pained and very glad it is a photograph  and not myself that has to go for in this case if it please you  you can tell yourself it is my image  and if it displeased you  you can lay the blame on the photographer but in that there were  no help and the poor author might belie his labours  kidnapped should soon appear i am afraid you may not like it as  it is very unlike prince otto in every way but i am myself a great  admirer of the two chief characters alan and david  virginibus  puerisque has never been issued in the states  i do not think it  is a book that has much charm for publishers in any land but i am  to bring out a new edition in england shortly a copy of which i  must try to remember to send you  i say try to remember because i  have some superficial acquaintance with myself  and i have  determined after a galling discipline to promise nothing more  until the day of my death  at least in this way i shall no more  break my word and i must now try being churlish instead of being  false  i do not believe you to be the least like seraphina  your  photograph has no trace of her which somewhat relieves me as i am  a good deal afraid of seraphinas  they do not always go into the  woods and see the sunrise and some are so wellmailed that even  that experience would leave them unaffected and unsoftened  the  hair and eyes of several complexions was a trait taken from  myself and i do not bind myself to the opinions of sir john  in  this case perhaps  but no if the peculiarity is shared by two  such pleasant persons as you and i as you and me  the grammatical  nut is hard it must be a very good thing indeed and sir john  must be an ass  the book reader notice was a strange jumble of fact and fancy  i  wish you could have seen my fathers old assistant and present  partner when he heard my father described as an inspector of  lighthouses for we are all very proud of the family achievements  and the name of my house here in bournemouth is stolen from one of  the seatowers of the hebrides which are our pyramids and  monuments  i was never at cambridge again but neglected a  considerable succession of classes at edinburgh  but to correct  that friendly blunderer were to write an autobiography  and so  now with many thanks believe me yours sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to r a m stevenson    skerryvore bournemouth july 1886  sir  your foolish letter was unduly received  there may be  hidden fifths and if there are it shows how dam spontaneous the  thing was  i could tinker and tictactoe on a piece of paper but  scorned the act with a threnody which was poured forth like blood  and water on the groaning organ  if your heart which was what i  addressed remained unmoved let us refer to the affair no more   crystallised emotion the statement and the reconciliation of the  sorrows of the race and the individual is obviously no more to you  than supping sawdust  well well  if ever i write another  threnody  my next op will probably be a passepied and fugue in g  or d  the mind is in my case shrunk to the size and sp gr of an aged  spanish filbert  o i am so jolly silly  i now pickle with some  freedom 1 the refrain of martinis moutons 2 sul margine dun  rio arranged for the infant school by the aged statesman 3 the  first phrase of bachs musette sweet englishwoman no 3 the  rest of the musette being one prolonged cropper which i take daily  for the benefit of my health  all my other works of which there  are many are either arranged by r l stevenson for the manly  and melodious forefinger or else prolonged and melancholy  croppers    i find one can get a notion of music very nicely   i have been pickling deeply in the magic flute and have arranged  la dove prende almost to the end for two melodious forefingers   i am next going to score the really nobler colomba o tortorella for  the same instruments  this day is published the works of ludwig van beethoven arranged and wiederdurchgearbeiteted for two melodious forefingers by sir  your obedient servant  pimperly stipple  thats a good idea  theres a person called lenz who actually does  it  beware his den i lost eighteenpennies on him and found the  bleeding corpses of pieces of music divorced from their keys  despoiled of their graces and even changed in time i do not wish  to regard music nor to be regarded through that bony lenz  you  say you are a spumfed idiot but how about lenz  and how about  me sir me  i yesterday sent lloyd by parcel post at great expense an empty  matchbox and empty cigarettepaper book a bell from a cats  collar an iron kitchen spoon and a piece of coal more than half  the superficies of this sheet of paper  they are now  appropriately enough speeding towards the silly isles i hope he  will find them useful  by that and my telegram with prepaid  answer to yourself you may judge of my spiritual state  the  finances have much brightened and if kidnapped keeps on as it has  begun i may be solvent  yours  threnodiae avctor  the authour

than before but  i think not so abjectly idiotic  the musical terms seem to be as  good as in beethoven and that after all is the great affair   bar the dam bareness of the base it looks like a piece of real  music from a distance  i am proud to say it was not made one hand  at a time the base was of synchronous birth with the treble they  are of the same age sir and may god have mercy on their souls   yours  the maestro    letter  to mr and mrs thomas stevenson    skerryvore bournemouth july 7th 1886  my dear people  it is probably my fault and not yours that i  did not understand  i think it would be well worth trying the  winter in bournemouth but i would only take the house by the month   this after mature discussion  my leakage still pursues its  course if i were only well i have a notion to go north and get in  if i could at the inn at kirkmichael which has always smiled  upon me much  if i did well there we might then meet and do what  should most smile at the time  meanwhile of course i must not move and am in a rancid box here  feeling the heat a great deal and pretty tired of things   alexander did a good thing of me at last it looks like a mixture  of an aztec idol a lion an indian rajah and a woman and  certainly represents a mighty comic figure  f and lloyd both  think it is the best thing that has been done of me up to now  you should hear lloyd on the penny whistle and me on the piano   dear powers what a concerto  i now live entirely for the piano  he for the whistle the neighbours in a radius of a furlong and a  half are packing up in quest of brighter climes  ever yours  r l s  ps  please say if you can afford to let us have money for this  trip and if so how much  i can see the year through without  help i believe and supposing my health to keep up but can scarce  make this change on my own metal  r l s    letter  to charles baxter    skerryvore bournemouth july 1886  dear charles  doubtless if all goes well towards the 1st of  august we

to thomas stevenson    skerryvore bournemouth july 28 1886  my dear father  we have decided not to come to scotland but just  to do as dobell wished and take an outing  i believe this is  wiser in all ways but i own it is a disappointment  i am weary of  england like alan i weary for the heather if not for the deer   lloyd has gone to scilly with katharine and c where and with whom  he should have a good time  david seems really to be going to  succeed which is a pleasant prospect on all sides  i am i  believe floated financially a book that sells will be a pleasant  novelty  i enclose another review mighty complimentary and  calculated to sell the book too  coolins tombstone has been got out honest man and it is to be  polished for it has got scratched and have a touch of gilding in  the letters and be sunk in the front of the house  worthy man  he too will maybe weary for the heather and the bents of  gullane where as i dare say you remember he gaed clean gyte and  jumped on to his crown from a gig in hot and hopeless chase of  many thousand rabbits  i can still hear the little cries of the  honest fellow as he disappeared and my mother will correct me but  i believe it was two days before he turned up again at north  berwick  to judge by his belly he had caught not one out of these  thousands but he had had some exercise  i keep well  ever your affectionate son  r l s    letter  to mrs thomas stevenson    british museum august 10th 1886  my dear mother  we are having a capital holiday and i am much  better and enjoying myself to the nines  richmond is painting my  portrait  today i lunch with him and meet burnejones tonight  browning dines with us  that sounds rather lofty work does it  not  his path was paved with celebrities  tomorrow we leave for  paris and next week i suppose or the week after come home   address here as we may not reach paris  i am really very well   ever your affectionate son  r l s    letter  to t wattsdunton    skerryvore bournemouth september 1886  dear mr watts the sight of the last athenaeum reminds me of you  and of my debt now too long due  i wish to thank you for your  notice of kidnapped and that not because it was kind though for  that also i valued it but in the same sense as i have thanked you  before now for a hundred articles on a hundred different writers   a critic like you is one who fights the good fight contending with  stupidity and i would fain hope not all in vain in my own case  for instance surely not in vain  what you say of the two parts in kidnapped was felt by no one more  painfully than by myself  i began it partly as a lark partly as a  potboiler and suddenly it moved david and alan stepped out from  the canvas and i found i was in another world  but there was the  cursed beginning and a cursed end must be appended and our old  friend byles the butcher was plainly audible tapping at the back  door  so it had to go into the world one part as it does seem to  me alive one part merely galvanised  no work only an essay   for a man of tentative method and weak health and a scarcity of  private means and not too much of that frugality which is the  artists proper virtue the days of sinecures and patrons look very  golden  the days of professional literature very hard  yet i do  not so far deceive myself as to think i should change my character  by changing my epoch the sum of virtue in our books is in a  relation of equality to the sum of virtues in ourselves and my  kidnapped was doomed while still in the womb and while i was yet  in the cradle to be the thing it is  and now to the more genial business of defence  you attack my  fight on board the covenant  i think it literal  david and alan  had every advantage on their side  position arms training a  good conscience a handful of merchant sailors not well led in the  first attack not led at all in the second could only by an  accident have taken the roundhouse by attack and since the  defenders had firearms and food it is even doubtful if they could  have been starved out  the only doubtful point with me is whether  the seamen would have ever ventured on the second onslaught i half  believe they would not still the illusion of numbers and the  authority of hoseason would perhaps stretch far enough to justify  the extremity  i am dear mr watts your very sincere admirer  robert louis stevenson    letter  to frederick lockerlampson    skerryvore september 4 1886  not roses to the rose i trow the thistle sends nor to the bee do wasps bring honey  wherefore now should locker ask a verse from me  martial perchance  but he is dead and herrick now must rhyme no more still burning with the muse they tread and arm in arm the shadowy shore  they if they lived with dainty hand to music as of mountain brooks might bring you worthy words to stand unshamed dear locker in your books  but tho these fathers of your race be gone before yourself a sire today you see before your face your stalwart youngsters touch the lyre   on these  on lang or dobson  call long leaders of the songful feast they lend a verse your laughing fall  a verse they owe you at the least    letter  to frederick lockerlampson    skerryvore bournemouth september 1886  dear locker  you take my verses too kindly but you will admit  for such a bluebottle of a versifier to enter the house of  gertrude where her necklace hangs was not a little brave  your  kind invitation i fear must remain unaccented and yet  if i am  very well  perhaps next spring  for i mean to be very well  my  wife might  but all that is in the clouds with my better  health  and now look here  you are a rich man and know many  people therefore perhaps some of the governors of christs  hospital  if you do i know a most deserving case in which i  would if i could do anything  to approach you in this way is  not decent and you may therefore judge by my doing it how near  this matter lies to my heart  i enclose you a list of the  governors which i beg you to return whether or not you shall be  able to do anything to help me  the boys name is  he and his mother are very poor  it may  interest you in her cause if i tell you this  that when i was  dangerously ill at hyeres this brave lady who had then a sick  husband of her own since dead and a house to keep and a family of  four to cook for all with her own hands for they could afford no  servant yet took watchabout with my wife and contributed not  only to my comfort but to my recovery in a degree that i am not  able to limit  you can conceive how much i suffer from my  impotence to help her and indeed i have already shown myself a  thankless friend  let not my cry go up before you in vain  yours  in hope  robert louis stevenson    letter  to frederick lockerlampson    skerryvore bournemouth september 1886  my dear locker  that i should call myself a man of letters and  land myself in such unfathomable ambiguities  no my dear locker  i did not want a cheque and in my ignorance of business which is  greater even than my ignorance of literature i have taken the  liberty of drawing a pen through the document and returning it  should this be against the laws of god or man forgive me  all  that i meant by my excessively disgusting reference to your  material wellbeing was the vague notion that a man who is well off  was sure to know a governor of christs hospital though how i  quite arrived at this conclusion i do not see  a man with a cold  in the head does not necessarily know a ratcatcher and the  connection is equally close  as it now appears to my awakened and  somewhat humbled spirit  for all that let me thank you in the  warmest manner for your friendly readiness to contribute  you say  you have hopes of becoming a miser  i wish i had but indeed i  believe you deceive yourself and are as far from it as ever  i  wish i had any excuse to keep your cheque for it is much more  elegant to receive than to return but i have my way of making it  up to you and i do sincerely beg you to write to the two  governors  this extraordinary outpouring of correspondence would  if you knew my habits convince you of my great eagerness in this  matter  i would promise gratitude but i have made a promise to  myself to make no more promises to anybody else having broken such  a host already and come near breaking my heart in consequence and  as for gratitude i am by nature a thankless dog and was spoiled  from a child up  but if you can help this lady in the matter of  the hospital you will have helped the worthy  let me continue to  hope that i shall make out my visit in the spring and believe me  yours very truly  robert louis stevenson  it may amuse you to know that a very long while ago i broke my  heart to try to imitate your verses and failed hopelessly  i saw  some of the evidences the other day among my papers and blushed to  the heels  r l s  i give up finding out your name in the meantime and keep to that  by which you will be known  frederick locker    letter  to frederick lockerlampson    skerryvore bournemouth 24th september 1886  my dear locker  you are simply an angel of light and your two  letters have gone to the post i trust they will reach the hearts  of the recipients  at least that could not be more handsomely  expressed  about the cheque  well now i am going to keep it but  i assure you mrs  has never asked me for money and i would not  dare to offer any till she did  for all that i shall stick to the  cheque now and act to that amount as your almoner  in this way i  reward myself for the ambiguity of my epistolary style  i suppose if you please you may say your verses are thin would  you so describe an arrow by the way and one that struck the gold   it scarce strikes me as exhaustively descriptive and thin or  not they are and i have found them inimitably elegant  i thank  you again very sincerely for the generous trouble you have taken in  this matter which was so near my heart and you may be very certain  it will be the fault of my health and not my inclination if i do  not see you before very long for all that has past has made me in  more than the official sense sincerely yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    skerryvore dec 14 1886  my dear colvin  this is firstrate of you the lord love you for  it  i am truly much obliged  he  my father  is very changeable  at times he seems only a slow quiet edition of himself again he  will be very heavy and blank but never so violent as last spring  and therefore to my mind better on the whole  fanny is pretty peepy i am splendid  i have been writing much  verse  quite the bard in fact and also a dam tale to order  which will be what it will be  i dont love it but some of it is  passable in its mouldy way the misadventures of john nicholson   all my bardly exercises are in scotch i have struck my somewhat  ponderous guitar in that tongue to no small extent  with what  success i know not but i think its better than my english verse  more marrow and fatness and more ruggedness  how goes keats  pray remark if he keats hung back from shelley  it was not to be wondered at when so many of his friends were  shelleys pensioners  i forget if you have made this point it has  been borne in upon me reading dowden and the shelley papers and it  will do no harm if you have made it  i finished a poem today and  writ 3000 words of a story tant bien que mal and have a right to  be sleepy and what is far nobler and rarer am so  my dear  colvin ever yours  the real mackay    letter  to frederick lockerlampson    skerryvore bournemouth february 5th 1887  my dear locker  here i am in my bed as usual and it is indeed a  long while since i went out to dinner  you do not know what a  crazy fellow this is  my winter has not so far been luckily  passed and all hope of paying visits at easter has vanished for  twelve calendar months  but because i am a beastly and indurated  invalid i am not dead to human feelings and i neither have  forgotten you nor will forget you  some day the wind may round to  the right quarter and we may meet till then i am still truly  yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to henry james    skerryvore bournemouth february 1887  my dear james  my health has played me it in once more in the  absurdest fashion and the creature who now addresses you is but a  stringy and whitefaced bouilli out of the pot of fever with the  devil to pay in every corner of his economy  i suppose to judge  by your letter i need not send you these sheets which came during  my collapse by the rush  i am on the start with three volumes  that one of tales a second one of essays and one of  ahem   verse  this is a great order is it not  after that i shall have  empty lockers  all new work stands still i was getting on well  with jenkin when this blessed malady unhorsed me and sent me back  to the dungcollecting trade of the republisher  i shall reissue  virg puer as vol i of essays and the new vol as vol ii of  ditto to be sold however separately  this is but a dry  maundering however i am quite unfit  i am for action quite  unfit either of exercise or wit  my father is in a variable  state many sorrows and perplexities environ the house of  stevenson my mother shoots north at this hour on business of a  distinctly rancid character my father under my wifes tutorage  proceeds tomorrow to salisbury i remain here in my bed and  whistle in no quarter of heaven is anything encouraging apparent  except that the good colvin comes to the hotel here on a visit   this dreary view of life is somewhat blackened by the fact that my  head aches which i always regard as a liberty on the part of the  powers that be  this is also my first letter since my recovery   god speed your laudatory pen  my wife joins in all warm messages  yours  r l s    letter  to w h low    april 1887  my dear low  the fares to london may be found in any continental  bradshaw or sich from london to bournemouth impoverished parties  who can stoop to the third class get their ticket for the matter of  10s or as my wife loves to phrase it a half a pound  you  will also be involved in a 3s fare to get to skerryvore but this  i dare say friends could help you in on your arrival so that you  may reserve your energies for the two tickets  costing the matter  of a pound  and the usual gratuities to porters  this does not  seem to me much  considering the intellectual pleasures that await  you here i call it dirt cheap  i believe the third class from  paris to london via dover is about forty francs but i cannot  swear  suppose it to be fifty  50x2100  the expense of spirit or spontaneous lapse of coin on the journey  at 5 frcs a head 5x210  victuals on ditto at 5 frcs a head 5x2  10  gratuity to stewardess in case of severe prostration at 3 francs  one night in london on a modest footing say 20  two tickets to bournemouth at 1250 1250x225  porters and general devilment say 5  cabs in london say 2 shillings and in bournemouth 3 shillings5  shillings 6 frcs 25  total frcs 17925  or the same in pounds 7 pounds 3s 6 and a half d   or the same in dollars 3545  if there be any arithmetical virtue in me  i have left out dinner  in london in case you want to blow out which would come extry and  with the aid of vangs fangs might easily double the whole amount   above all if you have a few friends to meet you  in making this valuable project or budget i discovered for the  first time a reason frequently overlooked for the singular  costliness of travelling with your wife  anybody would count the  tickets double but how few would have remembered  or indeed has  any one ever remembered  to count the spontaneous lapse of coin  double also  yet there are two of you each must do his daily  leakage and it must be done out of your travelling fund  you will  tell me perhaps that you carry the coin yourself  my dear sir  do you think you can fool your maker  your wife has to lose her  quota and by god she will  if you kept the coin in a belt  one  thing i have omitted  you will lose a certain amount on the  exchange but this even i cannot foresee as it is one of the few  things that vary with the way a man has  i am dear sir yours  financially  samuel budgett    letter  to alison cunningham    skerryvore april 16th 1887  my dearest cummy  as usual i have been a dreary bad fellow and  not written for ages but you must just try to forgive me to  believe what is the truth that the number of my letters is no  measure of the number of times i think of you and to remember how  much writing i have to do  the weather is bright but still cold  and my father im afraid feels it sharply  he has had  still  has rather  a most obstinate jaundice which has reduced him  cruelly in strength and really upset him altogether  i hope or  think he is perhaps a little better but he suffers much cannot  sleep at night and gives john and my mother a severe life of it to  wait upon him  my wife is i think a little better but no great  shakes  i keep mightily respectable myself  coolins tombstone is now built into the front wall of skerryvore  and poor bogies with a latin inscription also is set just above  it  poor unhappy wee man he died as you must have heard in  fight which was what he would have chosen for military glory was  more in his line than the domestic virtues  i believe this is  about all my news except that as i write there is a blackbird  singing in our garden trees as it were at swanston  i would like  fine to go up the burnside a bit and sit by the pool and be young  again  or no be what i am still only there instead of here for  just a little  did you see that i had written about john todd  in  this months longman it was if you have not seen it i will try  and send it you  some day climb as high as halkerside for me i am  never likely to do it for myself and sprinkle some of the well  water on the turf  i am afraid it is a pagan rite but quite  harmless and ye can sain it wi a bit prayer  tell the peewies  that i mind their forbears well  my heart is sometimes heavy and  sometimes glad to mind it all  but for what we have received the  lord make us truly thankful  dont forget to sprinkle the water  and do it in my name i feel a childish eagerness in this  remember me most kindly to james and with all sorts of love to  yourself believe me your laddie  robert louis stevenson  ps  i suppose mrs todd ought to see the paper about her man  judge of that and if you think she would not dislike it buy her  one from me and let me know  the article is called pastoral in  longmans magazine for april  i will send you the money i would  today but its the sabbie day and i cannae  r l s  remembrances from all here    letter  to sidney colvin     edinburgh june 1887  my dear s c  at last i can write a word to you  your little  note in the p m g was charming  i have written four pages in  the contemporary which bunting found room for  they are not very  good but i shall do more for his memory in time  about the death i have long hesitated i was long before i could  tell my mind and now i know it and can but say that i am glad   if we could have had my father that would have been a different  thing  but to keep that changeling  suffering changeling  any  longer could better none and nothing  now he rests it is more  significant it is more like himself  he will begin to return to  us in the course of time as he was and as we loved him  my favourite words in literature my favourite scene  o let him  pass kent and lear  was played for me here in the first moment  of my return  i believe shakespeare saw it with his own father  i  had no words but it was shocking to see  he died on his feet you  know was on his feet the last day knowing nobody  still he would  be up  this was his constant wish also that he might smoke a pipe  on his last day  the funeral would have pleased him it was the  largest private funeral in mans memory here  we have no plans and it is possible we may go home without going  through town  i do not know i have no views yet whatever nor can  have any at this stage of my cold and my business  ever yours  r l s     chapter ix  the united states again  winter in the adirondacks  august 1887october 1888     letter

off havre de grace this 22nd day of august 1887  sir  the weather has been hitherto inimitable  inimitable is the  only word that i can apply to our fellowvoyagers whom a  categorist possibly premature has been already led to divide into  two classes  the better sort consisting of the baser kind of  bagman and the worser of undisguised beasts of the field  the  berths are excellent the pasture swallowable the champagne of h  james to recur to my favourite adjective inimitable  as for the  commodore he slept awhile in the evening tossed off a cup of  henry james with his plain meal walked the deck till eight among  sands and floating lights and buoys and wrecked brigantines came  down to his regret a minute too soon to see margate lit up  turned in about nine slept with some interruptions but on the  whole sweetly until six and has already walked a mile or so of  deck among a fleet of other steamers waiting for the tide within  view of havre and pleasantly entertained by passing fishingboats  hovering seagulls and vulgarians pairing on deck with endearments  of primitive simplicity  there sir can be viewed the sham  quarrel the sham desire for information and every device of these  two poor ancient sexes who might you might think have learned in  the course of the ages something new down to the exchange of head gear  i am sir yours  bold bob boltsprit  b b b alias the commodore will now turn to his proofs  havre  de grace is a city of some show  it is fortified and so far as  i can see is a place of some trade  it is situated in france a  country of europe  you always complain there are no facts in my  letters  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    newport r i usa september 1887  my dear colvin  so long it went excellent well and i had a time  i am glad to have had really enjoying my life  there is nothing  like being at sea after all  and o why have i allowed myself to  rot so long on land  but on the banks i caught a cold and i have  not yet got over it  my reception here was idiotic to the last  degree  it is very silly and not pleasant except where humour  enters and i confess the poor interviewer lads pleased me  they  are too good for their trade avoided anything i asked them to  avoid and were no more vulgar in their reports than they could  help  i liked the lads  o it was lovely on our stableship chock full of stallions  she  rolled heartily rolled some of the fittings out of our stateroom  and i think a more dangerous cruise except that it was summer it  would be hard to imagine  but we enjoyed it to the masthead all  but fanny and even she perhaps a little  when we got in we had  run out of beer stout cocoa sodawater water fresh meat and  almost of biscuit  but it was a thousandfold pleasanter than a  great big birmingham liner like a new hotel and we liked the  officers and made friends with the quartermasters and i at  least made a friend of a baboon for we carried a cargo of apes  whose embraces have pretty near cost me a coat  the passengers  improved and were a very good specimen lot with no drunkard no  gambling that i saw and less grumbling and backbiting than one  would have asked of poor human nature  apes stallions cows  matches hay and poor menfolk all or almost all came  successfully to land  yours ever  r l s    letter  to henry james    newport usa september 1887  my dear james  here we are at newport in the house of the good  fairchilds and a sad burthen we have laid upon their shoulders  i  have been in bed practically ever since i came  i caught a cold on  the banks after having had the finest time conceivable and enjoyed  myself more than i could have hoped on board our strange floating  menagerie  stallions and monkeys and matches made our cargo and  the vast continent of these incongruities rolled the while like a  haystack and the stallions stood hypnotised by the motion looking  through the ports at our dinnertable and winked when the crockery  was broken and the little monkeys stared at each other in their  cages and were thrown overboard like little bluish babies and the  big monkey jacko scoured about the ship and rested willingly in  my arms to the ruin of my clothing and the man of the stallions  made a bower of the black tarpaulin and sat therein at the feet of  a raddled divinity like a picture on a box of chocolates and the  other passengers when they were not sick looked on and laughed   take all this picture and make it roll till the bell shall sound  unexpected notes and the fittings shall break lose in our state room and you have the voyage of the ludgate hill  she arrived in  the port of new york without beer porter sodawater curacoa  fresh meat or fresh water and yet we lived and we regret her  my wife is a good deal run down and i am no great shakes  america is as i remarked a fine place to eat in and a great  place for kindness but lord what a silly thing is popularity  i  envy the cool obscurity of skerryvore  if it even paid said  meanness and was abashed at himself  yours most sincerely  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    new york  end of september 1887  my dear s c  your delightful letter has just come and finds me  in a new york hotel waiting the arrival of a sculptor st  gaudens who is making a medallion of yours truly and who is to  boot one of the handsomest and nicest fellows i have seen  i  caught a cold on the banks fog is not for me nearly died of  interviewers and visitors during twentyfour hours in new york  cut for newport with lloyd and valentine a journey like fairyland  for the most engaging beauties one little rocky and pineshaded  cove after another each with a house and a boat at anchor so that  i left my heart in each and marvelled why american authors had been  so unjust to their country caught another cold on the train  arrived at newport to go to bed and to grow worse and to stay in  bed until i left again the fairchilds proving during this time  kindness itself mr fairchild simply one of the most engaging men  in the world and one of the children blair aet ten a great joy  and amusement in his solemn adoring attitude to the author of  treasure island  here i was interrupted by the arrival of my sculptor  i have  begged him to make a medallion of himself and give me a copy  i  will not take up the sentence in which i was wandering so long but  begin fresh  i was ten or twelve days at newport then came back  convalescent to new york  fanny and lloyd are off to the  adirondacks to see if that will suit and the rest of us leave  monday this is saturday to follow them up  i hope we may manage  to stay there all winter  i have a splendid appetite and have on  the whole recovered well after a mighty sharp attack  i am now on  a salary of 500 pounds a year for twelve articles in scribners  magazine on what i like it is more than 500 pounds but i cannot  calculate more precisely  you have no idea how much is made of me  here i was offered 2000 pounds for a weekly article  eh heh how  is that but i refused that lucrative job  the success of  underwoods is gratifying  you see the verses are sane that is  their strong point and it seems it is strong enough to carry them  a thousand thanks for your grand letter ever yours  r l s    letter  to w e henley    new york september 1887  my dear lad  herewith verses for dr hake which please  communicate  i did my best with the interviewers i dont know if  lloyd sent you the result my heart was too sick  you can do  nothing with them and yet  literally sweated with anxiety to  please and took me down in long hand  i have been quite ill but go better  i am being not busted but  medallioned by st gaudens who is a firstrate plain high minded artist and honest fellow you would like him down to the  ground  i believe sculptors are fine fellows when they are not  demons  o i am now a salaried person 600 pounds a year to write  twelve articles in scribners magazine it remains to be seen if it  really pays huge as the sum is but the slavery may overweigh me   i hope you will like my answer to hake and specially that he will  love to all  yours affectionately  r l s  le salarie    letter  to r a m stevenson    saranac lake adirondacks new york usa october 1887  my dear bob  the cold of colorado was too rigorous for me i  could not risk the long railway voyage and the season was too late  to risk the eastern cape hatteras side of the steamer one so here  we stuck and stick  we have a wooden house on a hilltop  overlooking a river and a village about a quarter of a mile away  and very wooded hills the whole scene is very highland bar want  of heather and the wooden houses  i have got one good thing of my sea voyage  it is proved the sea  agrees heartily with me and my mother likes it so if i get any  better or no worse my mother will likely hire a yacht for a month  or so in summer  good lord  what fun  wealth is only useful for  two things  a yacht and a string quartette  for these two i will  sell my soul  except for these i hold that 700 pounds a year is as  much as anybody can possibly want and i have had more so i know  for the extry coins were for no use excepting for illness which  damns everything  i was so happy on board that ship i could not have believed it  possible  we had the beastliest weather and many discomforts but  the mere fact of its being a trampship gave us many comforts we  could cut about with the men and officers stay in the wheelhouse  discuss all manner of things and really be a little at sea  and  truly there is nothing else  i had literally forgotten what  happiness was and the full mind  full of external and physical  things not full of cares and labours and rot about a fellows  behaviour  my heart literally sang i truly care for nothing so  much as for that  we took so north a course that we saw  newfoundland no one in the ship had ever seen it before  it was beyond belief to me how she rolled in seemingly smooth  water the bell striking the fittings bounding out of our state room  it is worth having lived these last years partly because i  have written some better books which is always pleasant but  chiefly to have had the joy of this voyage  i have been made a lot  of here and it is sometimes pleasant sometimes the reverse but i  could give it all up and agree that  was the author of my works  for a good seventy ton schooner and the coins to keep her on  and  to think there are parties with yachts who would make the exchange   i know a little about fame now it is no good compared to a yacht  and anyway there is more fame in a yacht more genuine fame to  cross the atlantic and come to anchor in newport say with the  union jack and go ashore for your letters and hang about the pier  among the holiday yachtsmen  thats fame thats glory and nobody  can take it away they cant say your book is bad you have crossed  the atlantic  i should do it south by the west indies to avoid  the damned banks and probably come home by steamer and leave the  skipper to bring the yacht home  well if all goes well we shall maybe sail out of southampton  water some of these days and take a run to havre and try the  baltic or somewhere  love to you all  ever your afft  robert louis stevenson    letter  to edmund gosse    saranac lake oct 8th 1887  my dear gosse  i have just read your article twice with cheers  of approving laughter  i do not believe you ever wrote anything so  funny  tyndalls shell the passage on the davos press and its  invaluable issues and that on v hugo and swinburne are  exquisite so i say it more ruefully is the touch about the  doctors  for the rest i am very glad you like my verses so well  and the qualities you ascribe to them seem to me well found and  well named  i own to that kind of candour you attribute to me   when i am frankly interested i suppose i fancy the public will be  so too and when i am moved i am sure of it  it has been my luck  hitherto to meet with no staggering disillusion  before and  after may be two and yet i believe the habit is now too  thoroughly ingrained to be altered  about the doctors you were  right that dedication has been the subject of some pleasantries  that made me grind and of your happily touched reproof which made  me blush  and to miscarry in a dedication is an abominable form of  bookwreck i am a good captain i would rather lose the tent and  save my dedication  i am at saranac lake in the adirondacks i suppose for the winter   it seems a firstrate place we have a house in the eye of many  winds with a view of a piece of running water  highland all but  the dear hue of peat  and of many hills  highland also but for  the lack of heather  soon the snow will close on us we are here  some twenty miles  twentyseven they say but this i profoundly  disbelieve  in the woods communication by letter is slow and let  me be consistent aleatory by telegram is as near as may be  impossible  i had some experience of american appreciation i liked a little of  it but there is too much a little of that would go a long way to  spoil a man and i like myself better in the woods  i am so damned  candid and ingenuous for a cynic and so much of a cweatu of  impulse  aw if you remember that admirable leech that i begin  to shirk any more taffy i think i begin to like it too well  but  let us trust the gods they have a rod in pickle reverently i doff  my trousers and with screwed eyes await the amari aliquid of the  great god busby  i thank you for the article in all ways and remain yours  affectionately  r l s    letter  to w h low    saranac october 1887  sir   i have to trouble you with the following paroles bien  senties  we are here at a firstrate place  bakers is the name  of our house but we dont address there we prefer the tender care  of the postoffice as more aristocratic it is no use to telegraph  even to the care of the postoffice who does not give a single  damn  bakers has a prophets chamber which the hypercritical  might describe as a garret with a hole in the floor  in that  garret sir i have to trouble you and your wife to come and  slumber  not now however  with manly hospitality i choke off  any sudden impulse  because first my wife and my mother are gone  a note for the latter strongly suspected to be in the hand of  your talented wife now sits silent on the mantel shelf one to  niagara and tother to indianapolis  because second we are not  yet installed  and because third i wont have you till i have a  buffalo robe and leggings lest you should want to paint me as a  plain man which i am not but a rank saranacker and wild man of  the woods  yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to william archer    saranac lake october 1887  dear archer  many thanks for the wondrous tale  it is scarcely a  work of genius as i believe you felt  thanks also for your  pencillings though i defend shrew or at least many of the  shrews  we are here i suppose for the winter in the adirondacks a hill  and forest country on the canadian border of new york state very  unsettled and primitive and cold and healthful or we are the more  bitterly deceived  i believe it will do well for me but must not  boast  my wife is away to indiana to see her family my mother lloyd and  i remain here in the cold which has been exceeding sharp and the  hill air which is inimitably fine  we all eat bravely and sleep  well and make great fires and get along like one oclock  i am now a salaried party i am a bourgeois now i am to write a  weekly paper for scribners at a scale of payment which makes my  teeth ache for shame and diffidence  the editor is i believe to  apply to you for we were talking over likely men and when i  instanced you he said he had had his eye upon you from the first   it is worth while perhaps to get in tow with the scribners they  are such thorough gentlefolk in all ways that it is always a  pleasure to deal with them  i am like to be a millionaire if this  goes on and be publicly hanged at the social revolution  well i  would prefer that to dying in my bed and it would be a godsend to  my biographer if ever i have one  what are you about  i hope you  are all well and in good case and spirits as i am now after a  most nefast experience of despondency before i left but indeed i  was quite run down  remember me to mrs archer and give my  respects to tom  yours very truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to henry james    saranac lake october 1887  i know not the day but the month it  is the drear october by the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir  my dear henry james  this is to say first the voyage was a huge  success  we all enjoyed it bar my wife to the ground  sixteen  days at sea with a cargo of hay matches stallions and monkeys  and in a ship with no style on and plenty of sailors to talk to  and the endless pleasures of the sea  the romance of it the sport  of the scratch dinner and the smashing crockery the pleasure  an  endless pleasure  of balancing to the swell  well its over  second i had a fine time rather a troubled one at newport and  new york saw much of and liked hugely the fairchilds st gaudens  the sculptor gilder of the century  just saw the dear alexander   saw a lot of my old and admirable friend will low whom i wish you  knew and appreciated  was medallioned by st gaudens and at last  escaped to  third saranac lake where we now are and which i believe we mean  to like and pass the winter at  our house  emphatically bakers   is on a hill and has a sight of a stream turning a corner in the  valley  bless the face of running water  and sees some hills  too and the paganly prosaic roofs of saranac itself the lake it  does not see nor do i regret that i like water fresh water i  mean either running swiftly among stones or else largely  qualified with whisky  as i write the sun which has been long a  stranger shines in at my shoulder from the next room the bell of  lloyds typewriter makes an agreeable music as it patters off at a  rate which astonishes this experienced novelist the early chapters  of a humorous romance from still further off  the walls of  bakers are neither ancient nor massive  rumours of valentine  about the kitchen stove come to my ears of my mother and fanny i  hear nothing for the excellent reason that they have gone sparking  off one to niagara one to indianapolis  people complain that i  never give news in my letters  i have wiped out that reproach  but now fourth i have seen the article and it may be from  natural partiality i think it the best you have written  o  i  remember the gautier which was an excellent performance and the  balzac which was good and the daudet over which i licked my  chops but the r l s is better yet  it is so humorous and it  hits my little frailties with so neat and so friendly a touch  and alan is the occasion for so much happy talk and the quarrel is  so generously praised  i read it twice though it was only some  hours in my possession and low who got it for me from the  century sat up to finish it ere he returned it and sir we were  all delighted  here is the paper out nor will anything not even  friendship not even gratitude for the article induce me to begin  a second sheet so here with the kindest remembrances and the  warmest good wishes i remain yours affectionately  r l s    letter  to charles baxter    saranac 18th november 1887  my dear charles  no likely im going to waste a sheet of paper      i am offered 1600 pounds 8000 for the american serial  rights on my next story  as you say times are changed since the  lothian road  well the lothian road was grand fun too i could  take an afternoon of it with great delight  but im awfu grand  noo and long may it last  remember me to any of the faithful  if there are any left  i wish  i could have a crack with you  yours ever affectionately  r l s  i find i have forgotten more than i remembered of business      please let us know if you know for how much skerryvore is let  you will here detect the female mind i let it for what i could  get nor shall the possession of this knowledge which i am happy  to have forgot increase the amount by so much as the shadow of a  sixpenny piece but my females are agog  yours ever  r l s    letter  to charles scribner    saranac november 20 or 21 1887  my dear mr scribner  heaven help me i am under a curse just  now  i have played fast and loose with what i said to you and  that i beg you to believe in the purest innocence of mind  i  told you you should have the power over all my work in this  country and about a fortnight ago when mclure was here i calmly  signed a bargain for the serial publication of a story  you will  scarce believe that i did this in mere oblivion but i did and all  that i can say is that i will do so no more and ask you to forgive  me  please write to me soon as to this  will you oblige me by paying in for three articles as already  sent to my account with john paton  co 52 william street  this  will be most convenient for us  the fourth article is nearly done and i am the more deceived or  it is a buster  now as to the first thing in this letter i do wish to hear from  you soon and i am prepared to hear any reproach or what is  harder to hear any forgiveness for i have deserved the worst   yours sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to e l burlingame    saranac november 1887  dear mr burlingame  i enclose corrected proof of beggars which  seems good  i mean to make a second sermon which if it is about  the same length as pulvis et umbra might go in along with it as  two sermons in which case i should call the first the whole  creation and the second any good  we shall see but you might  say how you like the notion  one word  if you have heard from mr scribner of my unhappy  oversight in the matter of a story you will make me ashamed to  write to you and yet i wish to beg you to help me into quieter  waters  the oversight committed  and i do think it was not so bad  as mr scribner seems to think itand discovered i was in a  miserable position  i need not tell you that my first impulse was  to offer to share or to surrender the price agreed upon when it  should fall due and it is almost to my credit that i arranged to  refrain  it is one of these positions from which there is no  escape i cannot undo what i have done  and i wish to beg you   should mr scribner speak to you in the matter  to try to get him  to see this neglect of mine for no worse than it is  unpardonable  enough because a breach of an agreement but still pardonable  because a piece of sheer carelessness and want of memory done god  knows without design and since most sincerely regretted  i have  no memory  you have seen how i omitted to reserve the american  rights in jekyll  last winter i wrote and demanded as an  increase a less sum than had already been agreed upon for a story  that i gave to cassells  for once that my forgetfulness has by a  cursed fortune seemed to gain instead of lose me money it is  painful indeed that i should produce so poor an impression on the  mind of mr scribner  but i beg you to believe and if possible to  make him believe that i am in no degree or sense a faiseur and  that in matters of business my design at least is honest  nor  bating bad memory and selfdeception am i untruthful in such  affairs  if mr scribner shall have said nothing to you in the matter  please regard the above as unwritten and believe me yours very  truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to e l burlingame    saranac november 1887  dear mr burlingame  the revise seemed all right so i did not  trouble you with it indeed my demand for one was theatrical to  impress that obdurate dog your reader  herewith a third paper   it has been a cruel long time upon the road but here it is and  not bad at last i fondly hope  i was glad you liked the lantern  bearers i did too  i thought it was a good paper really  contained some excellent sense and was ingeniously put together   i have not often had more trouble than i have with these papers  thirty or forty pages of foul copy twenty is the very least i have  had  well you pay high it is fit that i should have to work  hard it somewhat quiets my conscience  yours very truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to j a symonds    saranac lake adirondack mountains new york usa november 21  1887  my dear symonds  i think we have both meant and wanted to write  to you any time these months but we have been much tossed about  among new faces and old and new scenes and old and scenes like  this of saranac which are neither one nor other  to give you some  clue to our affairs i had best begin pretty well back  we sailed  from the thames in a vast bucket of iron that took seventeen days  from shore to shore  i cannot describe how i enjoyed the voyage  nor what good it did me but on the banks i caught friend catarrh   in new york and then in newport i was pretty ill but on my return  to new york lying in bed most of the time with st gaudens the  sculptor sculping me and my old friend low around i began to pick  up once more  now here we are in a kind of wilderness of hills and  firwoods and boulders and snow and wooden houses  so far as we  have gone the climate is grey and harsh but hungry and somnolent  and although not charming like that of davos essentially bracing  and briskening  the country is a kind of insane mixture of  scotland and a touch of switzerland and a dash of america and a  thought of the british channel in the skies  we have a decent  house   december 6th   a decent house as i was saying sir on a hilltop with a look  down a scottish river in front and on one hand a perthshire hill  on the other the beginnings and skirts of the village play hide  and seek among other hills  we have been below zero i know not  how far 10 at 8 am once and when it is cold it is delightful  but hitherto the cold has not held and we have chopped in and out  from frost to thaw from snow to rain from quiet air to the most  disastrous northwesterly curdlers of the blood  after a week of  practical thaw the ice still bears in favoured places  so there  is hope  i wonder if you saw my book of verses  it went into a second  edition because of my name i suppose and its prose merits  i do  not set up to be a poet  only an allround literary man  a man  who talks not one who sings  but i believe the very fact that it  was only speech served the book with the public  horace is much a  speaker and see how popular most of martial is only speech and i  cannot conceive a person who does not love his martial most of  burns also such as the louse the toothache the haggis  and lots more of his best  excuse this little apology for my  house but i dont like to come before people who have a note of  song and let it be supposed i do not know the difference  to return to the more important  news  my wife again suffers in  high and cold places i again profit  she is off today to new  york for a change as heretofore to berne but i am glad to say in  better case than then  still it is undeniable she suffers and you  must excuse her at least if we both prove bad correspondents  i  am decidedly better but i have been terribly cut up with business  complications  one disagreeable as threatening loss one of the  most intolerable complexion as involving me in dishonour  the  burthen of consistent carelessness  i have lost much by it in the  past and for once to my damnation i have gained  i am sure you  will sympathise  it is hard work to sleep it is hard to be told  you are a liar and have to hold your peace and think yes by  god and a thief too  you remember my lectures on ajax or the  unintentional sin  well i know all about that now  nothing seems  so unjust to the sufferer  or is more just in essence  laissez  passer la justice de dieu  lloyd has learned to use the typewriter and has most gallantly  completed upon that the draft of a tale which seems to me not  without merit and promise it is so silly so gay so absurd in  spots to my partial eyes so genuinely humorous  it is true he  would not have written it but for the new arabian nights but it is  strange to find a young writer funny  heavens but i was  depressing when i took the pen in hand  and now i doubt if i am  sadder than my neighbours  will this beginner move in the inverse  direction  let me have your news and believe me my dear symonds with  genuine affection yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w e henley    saranac december 1887  my dear lad  i was indeed overjoyed to hear of the dumas  in the  matter of the dedication are not cross dedications a little  awkward  lang and rider haggard did it to be sure  perpend  and  if you should conclude against a dedication there is a passage in  memories and portraits written at you when i was most desperate  to stir you up a bit which might be quoted  something about  dumas still waiting his biographer  i have a decent time when the  weather is fine when it is grey or windy or wet as it too often  is i am merely degraded to the dirt  i get some work done every  day with a devil of a heave not extra good ever and i regret my  engagement  whiles i have had the most deplorable business  annoyances too have been threatened with having to refund money  got over that and found myself in the worse scrape of being a kind  of unintentional swindler  these have worried me a great deal  also old age with his stealing steps seems to have clawed me in his  clutch to some tune  do you play all fours  we are trying it it is still all haze to  me  can the elder hand beg more than once  the port admiral is at  boston mingling with millionaires  i am but a weed on lethe wharf   the wife is only soso  the lord lead us all  if i can only get  off the stage with clean hands i shall sing hosanna  put is  described quite differently from your version in a book i have  what are your rules  the port admiral is using a game of put in a  tale of his the first copy of which was gloriously finished about  a fortnight ago and the revise gallantly begun  the finsbury  tontine it is named and might fill two volumes and is quite  incredibly silly and in parts it seems to me pretty humorous   love to all from  an old old man  i say taines origines de la france contemporaine is no end it  would turn the dead body of charles fox into a living tory    letter  to mrs fleeming jenkin    saranac lake december 1887  my dear mrs jenkin  the opal is very well it is fed with  glycerine when it seems hungry  i am very well and get about much  more than i could have hoped  my wife is not very well there is  no doubt the high level does not agree with her and she is on the  move for a holiday to new york  lloyd is at boston on a visit and  i hope has a good time  my mother is really firstrate she and i  despairing of other games for two now play all fours out of a  gamebook and have not yet discovered its niceties if any  you will have heard i dare say that they made a great row over me  here  they also offered me much money a great deal more than my  works are worth  i took some of it and was greedy and hasty and  am now very sorry  i have done with big prices from now out   wealth and selfrespect seem in my case to be strangers  we were talking the other day of how well fleeming managed to grow  rich  ah that is a rare art something more intellectual than a  virtue  the book has not yet made its appearance here the life  alone with a little preface is to appear in the states and the  scribners are to send you half the royalties  i should like it to  do well for fleemings sake  will you please send me the greek watercarriers song  i have a  particular use for it  have i any more news i wonder  and echo wonders along with me   i am strangely disquieted on all political matters and i do not  know if it is the signs of the times or the sign of my own time  of life  but to me the sky seems black both in france and england  and only partly clear in america  i have not seen it so dark in my  time of that i am sure  please let us have some news and excuse me for the sake of my  wellknown idleness and pardon fanny who is really not very well  for this long silence  very sincerely your friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to miss adelaide boodle    saranac lake december 1887  my dear miss boodle  i am so much afraid our gamekeeper may  weary of unacknowledged reports  hence in the midst of a perfect  horror of detestable weathers of a quite incongruous strain and  with less desire for correspondence than  well than  well with  no desire for correspondence behold me dash into the breach  do  keep up your letters  they are most delightful to this exiled  backwoods family and in your next we shall hope somehow or other  to hear better news of you and yours  that in the first place   and to hear more news of our beasts and birds and kindly fruits of  earth and those human tenants who are truly too much with us  i am very well better than for years  that is for good  but then  my wife is no great shakes the place does not suit her  it is my  private opinion that no place does  and she is now away down to  new york for a change which as lloyd is in boston leaves my  mother and me and valentine alone in our windbeleaguered hilltop  hatbox of a house  you should hear the cows butt against the walls  in the early morning while they feed you should also see our back  log when the thermometer goes as it does go away  away below  zero till it can be seen no more by the eye of man  not the  thermometer which is still perfectly visible but the mercury  which curls up into the bulb like a hibernating bear you should  also see the lad who does chores for us with his red stockings  and his thirteen year old face and his highly manly tramp into the  room and his two alternative answers to all questions about the  weather  either cold or with a really lyrical movement of the  voice lovely  raining  will you take this miserable scarp for what it is worth  will you  also understand that i am the man to blame and my wife is really  almost too much out of health to write or at least doesnt write   and believe me with kind remembrance to mrs boodle and your  sisters very sincerely yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    saranac 12th december 87  give us news of all your folk  a merry christmas from all of us  my dear charles  will you please send 20 pounds to  for a  christmas gift from   moreover i cannot remember what i told you  to send to   but as god has dealt so providentially with me this  year i now propose to make it 20 pounds  i beg of you also to consider my strange position  i jined a club  which it was said was to defend the union and had a letter from  the secretary which his name i believe was lord warmingpan or  words to that effect to say i am elected and had better pay up a  certain sum of money i forget what  now i cannae verra weel draw  a blank cheque and send to   lord warmingpan or words to that effect london england  and man if it was possible i would be dooms glad to be out o  this bit scrapie  mebbe the club was cad  the union but i  wouldnae like to sweir and mebbe it wasnae or mebbe only words to  that effec  but i wouldnae care just exacly about sweirin  do  ye no think henley or pollick or some o they london fellies  micht mebbe perhaps find out for me and just what the soom was   and that you would aiblins pay for me  for i thocht i was sae dam  patriotic jinin and it would be a kind o a comedoun to be  turned out again  mebbe lang would ken or mebbe rider haggyard   theyre kind o union folks  but its my belief his name was  warmingpan whatever yours  thomson alias robert louis stevenson  could it be warminster    letter  to miss monroe    saranac lake new york december 19 1887  dear miss monroe  many thanks for your letter and your good  wishes  it was much my desire to get to chicago  had i done  or  if i yet do  so i shall hope to see the original of my  photograph which is one of my show possessions but the fates are  rather contrary  my wife is far from well i myself dread worse  than almost any other imaginable peril that miraculous and really  insane invention the american railroad car  heaven help the man   may i add the woman  that sets foot in one  ah if it were only  an ocean to cross it would be a matter of small thought to me   and great pleasure  but the railroad car  every man has his weak  point and i fear the railroad car as abjectly as i do an earwig  and on the whole on better grounds  you do not know how bitter  it is to have to make such a confession for you have not the  pretension nor the weakness of a man  if i do get to chicago you  will hear of me  so much can be said  and do you never come east  i was pleased to recognise a word of my poor old deacon in your  letter  it would interest me very much to hear how it went and  what you thought of piece and actors and my collaborator who  knows and respects the photograph would be pleased too  still in  the hope of seeing you i am yours very truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to henry james    saranac lake winter 18878  my dear henry james  it may please you to know how our family has  been employed  in the silence of the snow the afternoon lamp has  lighted an eager fireside group  my mother reading fanny lloyd  and i devoted listeners and the work was really one of the best  works i ever heard and its author is to be praised and honoured  and what do you suppose is the name of it and have you ever read  it yourself and i am bound i will get to the bottom of the page  before i blow the gaff if i have to fight it out on this line all  summer for if you have not to turn a leaf there can be no  suspense the conspectory eye being swift to pick out proper names  and without suspense there can be little pleasure in this world  to my mind at least  and in short the name of it is roderick  hudson if you please  my dear james it is very spirited and  very sound and very noble too  hudson mrs hudson rowland o  all firstrate  rowland a very fine fellow hudson as good as he  can stick did you know hudson  i suspect you did mrs h his  real born mother a thing rarely managed in fiction  we are all keeping pretty fit and pretty hearty but this letter is  not from me to you it is from a reader of r h to the author of  the same and it says nothing and has nothing to say but thank  you  we are going to reread casamassima as a proper pendant  sir i  think these two are your best and care not who knows it  may i beg you the next time roderick is printed off to go over  the sheets of the last few chapters and strike out immense and  tremendous  you have simply dropped them there like your pocket handkerchief all you have to do is to pick them up and pouch them  and your room  what do i say  your cathedral  will be swept  and garnished  i am dear sir your delighted reader  robert louis stevenson  ps  perhaps it is a pang of causeless honesty perhaps  i hope  it will set a value on my praise of roderick perhaps its a burst  of the diabolic but i must break out with the news that i cant  bear the portrait of a lady  i read it all and i wept too but i  cant stand your having written it and i beg you will write no  more of the like  infra sir below you  i cant help it  it may  be your favourite work but in my eyes its below you to write and  me to read  i thought roderick was going to be another such at the  beginning and i cannot describe my pleasure as i found it taking  bones and blood and looking out at me with a moved and human  countenance whose lineaments are written in my memory until my  last of days  r l s  my wife begs your forgiveness i believe for her silence    letter  to sidney colvin    saranac lake december 1887  my dear colvin  this goes to say that we are all fit and the  place is very bleak and wintry and up to now has shown no such  charms of climate as davos but is a place where men eat and where  the cattarh catarrh cattarrh or cattarrhh appears to be  unknown  i walk in my verandy in the snaw sir looking down over  one of those dabbled wintry landscapes that are to be frank so  chilly to the human bosom and up at a grey english  nay  mehercle scottish  heaven and i think it pretty bleak and the  wind swoops at me round the corner like a lion and fluffs the  snow in my face and i could aspire to be elsewhere but yet i do  not catch cold and yet when i come in i eat  so that hitherto  saranac if not deliriously delectable has not been a failure  nay from the mere point of view of the wicked body it has proved  a success  but i wish i could still get to the woods alas nous  nirons plus au bois is my poor song the paths are buried the  dingles drifted full a little walk is grown a long one till  spring comes i fear the burthen will hold good  i get along with my papers for scribner not fast nor so far  specially well only this last the fourth one which makes a third  part of my whole task i do believe is pulled off after a fashion   it is a mere sermon  smith opens out but it is true and i find  it touching and beneficial to me at least and i think there is  some fine writing in it some very apt and pregnant phrases   pulvis et umbra i call it i might have called it a darwinian  sermon if i had wanted  its sentiments although parsonic will  not offend even you i believe  the other three papers i fear  bear many traces of effort and the ungenuine inspiration of an  income at so much per essay and the honest desire of the incomer  to give good measure for his money  well i did my damndest  anyway  we have been reading h jamess roderick hudson which i eagerly  press you to get at once  it is a book of a high order  the last  volume in particular  i wish meredith would read it  it took my  breath away  i am at the seventh book of the aeneid and quite amazed at its  merits also very often floored by its difficulties  the circe  passage at the beginning and the sublime business of amata with  the simile of the boys top  o lord what a happy thought  have  specially delighted me  i am dear sir your respected friend  john gregg gillson jp mria etc    letter  to sidney colvin    saranac december 24 1887  my dear colvin  thank you for your explanations  i have done no  more virgil since i finished the seventh book for i have first  been eaten up with taine and next have fallen head over heels into  a new tale the master of ballantrae  no thought have i now apart  from it and i have got along up to page ninetytwo of the draft  with great interest  it is to me a most seizing tale  there are  some fantastic elements the most is a dead genuine human problem   human tragedy i should say rather  it will be about as long i  imagine as kidnapped  dramatis personae  1 my old lord durrisdeer 2 the master of ballantrae and 3 henry durie his sons 4 clementina engaged to the first married to the second 5 ephraim mackellar land steward at durrisdeer and narrator of  the most of the book 6 francis burke chevalier de st louis one of prince charlies  irishmen and narrator of the rest  besides these many instant figures most of them dumb or nearly  so  jessie brown the whore captain crail captain maccombie our  old friend alan breck our old friend riach both only for an  instant teach the pirate vulgarly blackbeard john paul and  macconochie servants at durrisdeer  the date is from 1745 to 65  about  the scene near kirkcudbright in the states and for a  little moment in the french east indies  i have done most of the  big work the quarrel duel between the brothers and announcement  of the death to clementina and my lord  clementina henry and  mackellar nicknamed squaretoes are really very fine fellows the  master is all i know of the devil  i have known hints of him in  the world but always cowards he is as bold as a lion but with  the same deadly causeless duplicity i have watched with so much  surprise in my two cowards  tis true i saw a hint of the same  nature in another man who was not a coward but he had other things  to attend to the master has nothing else but his devilry  here  come my visitors  and have now gone or the first relay of them  and i hope no more may come  for mark you sir this is our day   saturday as ever was and here we sit my mother and i before a  large wood fire and await the enemy with the most steadfast  courage and without snow and greyness  and the woman fanny in new  york for her health which is far from good and the lad lloyd at  the inn in the village because he has a cold and the handmaid  valentine abroad in a sleigh upon her messages and tomorrow  christmas and no mistake  such is human life  la carriere  humaine  i will enclose if i remember the required autograph  i will do better put it on the back of this page  love to all  and mostly my very dear colvin to yourself  for whatever i say  or do or dont say or do you may be very sure i am  yours  always affectionately  r l s    letter  to miss adelaide boodle    saranac lake adirondacks ny usa christmas 1887  my dear miss boodle  and a very good christmas to you all and  better fortune and if worse the more courage to support it   which i think is the kinder wish in all human affairs  somewhile   i fear a good while  after this you should receive our christmas  gift we have no tact and no taste only a welcome and often  tonic brutality and i dare say the present even after my friend  baxter has acted on and reviewed my hints may prove a white  elephant  that is why i dread presents  and therefore pray  understand if any element of that hamper prove unwelcome it is to  be exchanged  i will not sit down under the name of a giver of  white elephants  i never had any elephant but one and his  initials were r l s and he trod on my foot at a very early age   but this is a fable and not in the least to the point  which is  that if for once in my life i have wished to make things nicer  for anybody but the elephant see fable do not suffer me to have  made them ineffably more embarrassing and exchange  ruthlessly  exchange   for my part i am the most cockered up of any mortal being and one  of the healthiest or thereabout at some modest distance from the  bulls eye  i am condemned to write twelve articles in scribners  magazine for the love of gain i think i had better send you them  what is far more to the purpose i am on the jump with a new story  which has bewitched me  i doubt it may bewitch no one else  it is  called the master of ballantrae  pronounce ballantray  if it is  not good well mine will be the fault for i believe it is a good  tale  the greetings of the season to you and your mother and your  sisters  my wife heartily joins  and i am yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson  ps  you will think me an illiterate dog  i am for the first  time reading robertsons sermons  i do not know how to express  how much i think of them  if by any chance you should be as  illiterate as i and not know them it is worth while curing the  defect  r l s    letter  to charles baxter    saranac lake january 88  dear charles  you are the flower of doers    will my doer  collaborate thus much in my new novel  in the year 1794 or 5 mr  ephraim mackellar am late steward on the durrisdeer estates  completed a set of memoranda as long as a novel with regard to  the death of the then late lord durrisdeer and as to that of his  attainted elder brother called by the family courtesy title the  master of ballantrae  these he placed in the hands of john  macbrair  ws the family agent on the understanding they were  to be sealed until 1862 when a century would have elapsed since  the affair in the wilderness my lords death  you succeeded mr  macbrairs firm the durrisdeers are extinct and last year in an  old green box you found these papers with macbrairs indorsation   it is that indorsation of which i want a copy you may remember  when you gave me the papers i neglected to take that and i am  sure you are a man too careful of antiquities to have let it fall  aside  i shall have a little introduction descriptive of my visit  to edinburgh arrival there denner with yoursel and first  reading of the papers in your smokingroom  all of which of  course you well remember  ever yours affectionately  r l s  your name is my friend mr johnstone thomson ws    letter  to e l burlingame    saranac winter 18878  dear mr burlingame  i am keeping the sermon to see if i cant  add another  meanwhile i will send you very soon a different  paper which may take its place  possibly some of these days soon i  may get together a talk on things current which should go in if  possible earlier than either  i am now less nervous about these  papers i believe i can do the trick without great strain though  the terror that breathed on my back in the beginning is not yet  forgotten  the master of ballantrae i have had to leave aside as i was quite  worked out  but in about a week i hope to try back and send you  the first four numbers  these are all drafted it is only the  revision that has broken me down as it is often the hardest work   these four i propose you should set up for me at once and well  copyright em in a pamphlet  i will tell you the names of the bona  fide purchasers in england  the numbers will run from twenty to thirty pages of my manuscript   you can give me that much can you not  it is a howling good tale   at least these first four numbers are the end is a trifle more  fantastic but tis all picturesque  dont trouble about any more french books i am on another scent  you see just now  only the french in hindustan i await with  impatience as that is for ballantrae  the scene of that romance  is scotland  the states  scotland  india  scotland  and the  states again so it jumps like a flea  i have enough about the  states now and very much obliged i am yet if drakes tragedies of  the wilderness is as i gather a collection of originals i should  like to purchase it  if it is a picturesque vulgarisation i do  not wish to look it in the face  purchase i say for i think it  would be well to have some such collection by me with a view to  fresh works  yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson  ps  if you think of having the master illustrated i suggest  that hole would be very well up to the scottish which is the  larger part  if you have it done here tell your artist to look at  the hall of craigievar in billings baronial and ecclesiastical  antiquities and he will get a broad hint for the hall at  durrisdeer  it is i think the chimney of craigievar and the roof  of pinkie and perhaps a little more of pinkie altogether but i  should have to see the book myself to be sure  hole would be  invaluable for this  i dare say if you had it illustrated you  could let me have one or two for the english edition  r l s    letter  to william archer    saranac winter 18878  my dear archer  what am i to say  i have read your friends book  with singular relish  if he has written any other i beg you will  let me see it and if he has not i beg him to lose no time in  supplying the deficiency  it is full of promise but i should like  to know his age  there are things in it that are very clever to  which i attach small importance it is the shape of the age  and  there are passages particularly the rally in presence of the zulu  king that show genuine and remarkable narrative talent  a talent  that few will have the wit to understand a talent of strength  spirit capacity sufficient vision and sufficient selfsacrifice  which last is the chief point in a narrator  as a whole it is of course a fever dream of the most feverish   over bashville the footman i howled with derision and delight i  dote on bashville  i could read of him for ever de bashville je  suis le fervent  there is only one bashville and i am his devoted  slave bashville est magnifique mais il nest guere possible  he  is the note of the book  it is all mad mad and deliriously  delightful the author has a taste in chivalry like walter scotts  or dumas and then he daubs in little bits of socialism he soars  away on the wings of the romantic griffon  even the griffon as he  cleaves air shouting with laughter at the nature of the quest   and i believe in his heart he thinks he is labouring in a quarry of  solid granite realism  it is this that makes me  the most hardened adviser now extant   stand back and hold my peace  if mr shaw is below fiveand twenty let him go his path if he is thirty he had best be told  that he is a romantic and pursue romance with his eyes open  or  perhaps he knows it  god knows  my brain is softened  it is horrid fun  all i ask is more of it  thank you for the  pleasure you gave us and tell me more of the inimitable author  i say archer my god what women  yours very truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to william archer    saranac february 1888  my dear archer  pretty sick in bed but necessary to protest and  continue your education  why was jenkin an amateur in my eyes  you think because not  amusing i think he often was amusing  the reason is this  i  never or almost never saw two pages of his work that i could not  have put in one without the smallest loss of material  that is the  only test i know of writing  if there is anywhere a thing said in  two sentences that could have been as clearly and as engagingly and  as forcibly said in one then its amateur work  then you will  bring me up with old dumas  nay the object of a story is to be  long to fill up hours the storytellers art of writing is to  water out by continual invention historical and technical and yet  not seem to water seem on the other hand to practise that same wit  of conspicuous and declaratory condensation which is the proper art  of writing  that is one thing in which my stories fail  i am  always cutting the flesh off their bones  i would rise from the dead to preach  hope all well  i think my wife better but shes not allowed to  write and this only wrung from me by desire to boss and parsonise  and dominate strong in sickness is my first letter for days and  will likely be my last for many more  not blame my wife for her  silence  doctors orders  all much interested by your last and  fragment from brother and anecdotes of tomarcher  the sick but  still moral  r l s  tell shaw to hurry up  i want another    letter  to william archer    saranac spring 1888  my dear archer  it happened thus  i came forth from that  performance in a breathing heat of indignation  mind at this  distance of time and with my increased knowledge i admit there is  a problem in the piece but i saw none then except a problem in  brutality and i still consider the problem in that case not  established  on my way down the francais stairs i trod on an old  gentlemans toes whereupon with that suavity that so well becomes  me i turned about to apologise and on the instant repenting me  of that intention stopped the apology midway and added something  in french to this effect  no you are one of the laches who have  been applauding that piece  i retract my apology  said the old  frenchman laying his hand on my arm and with a smile that was  truly heavenly in temperance irony goodnature and knowledge of  the world ah monsieur vous etes bien jeune  yours very  truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to e l burlingame    saranac february 1888  dear mr burlingame  will you send me from the library some of  the works of my dear old g p r james  with the following  especially i desire to make or to renew acquaintance  the  songster the gipsy the convict the stepmother the gentleman of  the old school the robber  excusez du peu  this sudden return to an ancient favourite hangs upon an accident   the franklin county library contains two works of his the  cavalier and morley ernstein  i read the first with indescribable  amusement  it was worse than i had feared and yet somehow  engaging the second to my surprise was better than i had dared  to hope  a good honest dull interesting tale with a genuine  oldfashioned talent in the invention when not strained and a  genuine oldfashioned feeling for the english language  this  experience awoke appetite and you see i have taken steps to stay  it  r l s    letter  to e l burlingame    saranac february 1888  dear mr burlingame  1  of course then dont use it  dear man  i write these to please you not myself and you know a main sight  better than i do what is good  in that case however i enclose  another paper and return the corrected proof of pulvis et umbra  so that we may be afloat  2  i want to say a word as to the master  the master of  ballantrae shall be the name by all means  if you like and want  it i leave it to you to make an offer  you may remember i thought  the offer you made when i was still in england too small by which  i did not at all mean i thought it less than it was worth but too  little to tempt me to undergo the disagreeables of serial  publication  this tale if you want it you are to have for it is  the least i can do for you and you are to observe that the sum you  pay me for my articles going far to meet my wants i am quite open  to be satisfied with less than formerly  i tell you i do dislike  this battle of the dollars  i feel sure you all pay too much here  in america and i beg you not to spoil me any more  for i am  getting spoiled  i do not want wealth and i feel these big sums  demoralise me  my wife came here pretty ill she had a dreadful bad night today  she is better  but now valentine is ill and lloyd and i have got  breakfast and my hand somewhat shakes after washing dishes   yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson  ps  please order me the evening post for two months  my  subscription is run out  the mutiny and edwardes to hand    letter  to sidney colvin    saranac march 1888  my dear colvin  fanny has been very unwell  she is not long  home has been ill again since her return but is now better again  to a degree  you must not blame her for not writing as she is not  allowed to write at all not even a letter  to add to our  misfortunes valentine is quite ill and in bed  lloyd and i get  breakfast i have now 1015 just got the dishes washed and the  kitchen all clear and sit down to give you as much news as i have  spirit for after such an engagement  glass is a thing that really  breaks my spirit  i do not like to fail and with glass i cannot  reach the work of my high calling  the artists  i am as you may gather from this wonderfully better  this harsh  grey glum doleful climate has done me good  you cannot fancy how  sad a climate it is  when the thermometer stays all day below 10  degrees it is really cold and when the wind blows o commend me  to the result  pleasure in life is all delete there is no red  spot left fires do not radiate you burn your hands all the time  on what seem to be cold stones  it is odd zero is like summer  heat to us now and we like when the thermometer outside is really  low a room at about 48 degrees  60 degrees we find oppressive   yet the natives keep their holes at 90 degrees or even 100 degrees  this was interrupted days ago by household labours  since then i  have had and i tremble to write it but it does seem as if i had  beaten off an influenza  the cold is exquisite  valentine still  in bed  the proofs of the first part of the master of ballantrae  begin to come in soon you shall have it in the pamphlet form and  i hope you will like it  the second part will not be near so good  but there  we can but do as itll do with us  i have every reason  to believe this winter has done me real good so far as it has  gone and if i carry out my scheme for next winter and succeeding  years i should end by being a tower of strength  i want you to  save a good holiday for next winter i hope we shall be able to  help you to some larks  is there any greek isle you would like to  explore or any creek in asia minor  yours ever affectionately  r l s    letter  to the rev dr charteris    saranac lake winter 18871888  my dear dr charteris  i have asked douglas and foulis to send  you my last volume so that you may possess my little paper on my  father in a permanent shape not for what that is worth but as a  tribute of respect to one whom my father regarded with such love  esteem and affection  besides as you will see i have brought  you under contribution and i have still to thank you for your  letter to my mother so more than kind in much so just  it is my  hope when time and health permit to do something more definite  for my fathers memory  you are one of the very few who can if  you will help me  pray believe that i lay on you no obligation i  know too well you may believe me how difficult it is to put even  two sincere lines upon paper where all too is to order  but if  the spirit should ever move you and you should recall something  memorable of your friend his son will heartily thank you for a  note of it  with much respect believe me yours sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to henry james    saranac lake march 1888  my dear delightful james  to quote your heading to my wife i  think no man writes so elegant a letter i am sure none so kind  unless it be colvin and there is more of the stern parent about  him  i was vexed at your account of my admired meredith  i wish i  could go and see him as it is i will try to write  i read with  indescribable admiration your emerson  i begin to long for the day  when these portraits of yours shall be collected  do put me in   but emerson is a higher flight  have you a tourgueneff  you have  told me many interesting things of him and i seem to see them  written and forming a graceful and bildend sketch  my novel is a  tragedy four parts out of six or seven are written and gone to  burlingame  five parts of it are sound human tragedy the last  one or two i regret to say not so soundly designed i almost  hesitate to write them they are very picturesque but they are  fantastic they shame perhaps degrade the beginning  i wish i  knew that was how the tale came to me however  i got the  situation it was an old taste of mine  the older brother goes out  in the 45 the younger stays the younger of course gets title  and estate and marries the bride designate of the elder  a family  match but he the younger had always loved her and she had  really loved the elder  do you see the situation  then the devil  and saranac suggested this denouement and i joined the two ends in  a day or two of constant feverish thought and began to write  and  now  i wonder if i have not gone too far with the fantastic  the  elder brother is an incubus  supposed to be killed at culloden he  turns up again and bleeds the family of money on that stopping he  comes and lives with them whence flows the real tragedy the  nocturnal duel of the brothers very naturally and indeed i  think inevitably arising and second supposed death of the elder   husband and wife now really make up and then the cloven hoof  appears  for the third supposed death and the manner of the third  reappearance is steep steep sir  it is even very steep and i  fear it shames the honest stuff so far but then it is highly  pictorial and it leads up to the death of the elder brother at the  hands of the younger in a perfectly coldblooded murder of which i  wish and mean the reader to approve  you see how daring is the  design  there are really but six characters and one of these  episodic and yet it covers eighteen years and will be i imagine  the longest of my works  yours ever  r l s  read gosses raleigh  firstrate  yours ever  r l s    letter  to the rev dr charteris    saranac lake adirondacks new york usa spring 1888  my dear dr charteris  the funeral letter your notes and many  other things are reserved for a book memorials of a scottish  family if ever i can find time and opportunity  i wish i could  throw off all else and sit down to it today  yes my father was a  distinctly religious man but not a pious  the distinction  painfully and pleasurably recalls old conflicts it used to be my  great gun  and you who suffered for the whole church know how  needful it was to have some reserve artillery  his sentiments were  tragic he was a tragic thinker  now granted that life is tragic  to the marrow it seems the proper function of religion to make us  accept and serve in that tragedy as officers in that other and  comparable one of war  service is the word active service in the  military sense and the religious man  i beg pardon the pious man   is he who has a military joy in duty  not he who weeps over the  wounded  we can do no more than try to do our best  really i am  the grandson of the manse  i preach you a kind of sermon  box the  brats ears  my mother  to pass to matters more within my competence  finely  enjoys herself  the new country some new friends we have made  the interesting experiment of this climatewhich at least is  tragic  all have done her good  i have myself passed a better  winter than for years and now that it is nearly over have some  diffident hopes of doing well in the summer and eating a little  more air than usual  i thank you for the trouble you are taking and my mother joins  with me in kindest regards to yourself and mrs charteris  yours  very truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to s r crockett    saranac lake spring 1888  dear minister of the free kirk at penicuik  for o man i cannae  read your name  that i have been so long in answering your  delightful letter sits on my conscience badly  the fact is i let  my correspondence accumulate until i am going to leave a place and  then i pitch in overhaul the pile and my cries of penitence might  be heard a mile about  yesterday i despatched thirtyfive belated  letters  conceive the state of my conscience above all as the  sins of omission see boyhoods guide the shorter catechism are  in my view the only serious ones i call it my view but it cannot  have escaped you that it was also christs  however all that is  not to the purpose which is to thank you for the sincere pleasure  afforded by your charming letter  i get a good few such how few  that please me at all you would be surprised to learn  or have a  singularly just idea of the dulness of our race how few that  please me as yours did i can tell you in one word  none  i am no  great kirkgoer for many reasons  and the sermons one of them  and the first prayer another but the chief and effectual reason is  the stuffiness  i am no great kirkgoer says i but when i read  yon letter of yours i thought i would like to sit under ye  and  then i saw ye were to send me a bit buik and says i ill wait for  the bit buik and then ill mebbe can read the mans name and  anyway ill can kill twa birds wi ae stane  and man the buik  was neer heard tell o  that fact is an adminicle of excuse for my delay  and now dear minister of the illegible name thanks to you and  greeting to your wife and may you have good guidance in your  difficult labours and a blessing on your life  robert louis stevenson  no just so young sae youngs he was though  im awfae near forty man  address co charles scribners sons 743 broadway new york  dont put nb in your paper  put scotland and be done with it   alas that i should be thus stabbed in the home of my friends  the  name of my native land is not north britain whatever may be the  name of yours  r l s    letter  to miss ferrier    saranac lake april 1888  my dearest coggie  i wish i could find the letter i began to you  some time ago when i was ill but i cant and i dont believe there  was much in it anyway  we have all behaved like pigs and beasts  and barndoor poultry to you but i have been sunk in work and the  lad is lazy and blind and has been working too and as for fanny  she has been and still is really unwell  i had a mean hope you  might perhaps write again before i got up steam  i could not have  been more ashamed of myself than i am and i should have had  another laugh  they always say i cannot give news in my letters  i shall shake  off that reproach  on monday if she is well enough fanny leaves  for california to see her friends it is rather an anxiety to let  her go alone but the doctor simply forbids it in my case and she  is better anywhere than here  a bleak blackguard beggarly  climate of which i can say no good except that it suits me and  some others of the same or similar persuasions whom by all rights  it ought to kill  it is a form of arctic st andrews i should  imagine and the miseries of forty degrees below zero with a high  wind have to be felt to be appreciated  the greyness of the  heavens here is a circumstance eminently revolting to the soul i  have near forgot the aspect of the sun  i doubt if this be news  it is certainly no news to us  my mother suffers a little from the  inclemency of the place but less on the whole than would be  imagined  among other wild schemes we have been projecting yacht  voyages and i beg to inform you that cogia hassan was cast for the  part of passenger  they may come off  again this is not news   the lad  well the lad wrote a tale this winter which appeared to  me so funny that i have taken it in hand and some of these days  you will receive a copy of a work entitled a game of bluff by  lloyd osbourne and robert louis stevenson  otherwise he the lad is much as usual  there remains i believe  to be considered only r l s the housebond prop pillar  breadwinner and bully of the establishment  well i do think him  much better he is making piles of money the hope of being able to  hire a yacht ere long dances before his eyes otherwise he is not  in very high spirits at this particular moment though compared  with last year at bournemouth an angel of joy  and now is this news cogia or is it not  it all depends upon the  point of view and i call it news  the devil of it is that i can  think of nothing else except to send you all our loves and to  wish exceedingly you were here to cheer us all up  but well see  about that on board the yacht  your affectionate friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    saranac lake april 9th 1888  my dear colvin  i have been long without writing to you but am  not to blame i had some little annoyances quite for a private eye  but they ran me so hard that i could not write without lugging them  in which for several reasons i did not choose to do  fanny is  off to san francisco and next week i myself flit to new york   address scribners  where we shall go i know not nor i was going  to say care so bald and bad is my frame of mind  do you know our   ahem  fellow clubman colonel majendie  i had such an  interesting letter from him  did you see my sermon  it has evoked  the worst feeling  i fear people dont care for the truth or else  i dont tell it  suffer me to wander without purpose  i have sent  off twenty letters today and begun and stuck at a twentyfirst  and taken a copy of one which was on business and corrected  several galleys of proof and sorted about a bushel of old letters  so if any one has a right to be romantically stupid it is i  and i  am  really deeply stupid and at that stage when in old days i  used to pour out words without any meaning whatever and with my  mind taking no part in the performance  i suspect that is now the  case  i am reading with extraordinary pleasure the life of lord  lawrence  lloyd and i have a mutiny novel   next morning after twelve other letters  mutiny novel on hand   a tremendous work  so we are all at indian books  the idea of the  novel is lloyds  i call it a novel  tis a tragic romance of  the most tragic sort  i believe the end will be almost too much  for human endurance  when the hero is thrown to the ground with  one of his own sepoy soldiers knees upon his chest and the  cries begin in the beebeeghar  o truly you know it is a howler   the whole last part is  well the difficulty is that short of  resuscitating shakespeare i dont know who is to write it  i still keep wonderful  i am a great performer before the lord on  the penny whistle  dear sir sincerely yours  andrew jackson    letter  to miss adelaide boodle    saranac lake april 1888 address co messrs scribners sons  743 broadway ny  my dear gamekeeper  your p c proving you a good student of  micawber has just arrived and it paves the way to something i am  anxious to say  i wrote a paper the other day  pulvis et umbra   i wrote it with great feeling and conviction  to me it seemed  bracing and healthful it is in such a world so seen by me that  i am very glad to fight out my battle and see some fine sunsets  and hear some excellent jests between whiles round the camp fire   but i find that to some people this vision of mine is a nightmare  and extinguishes all ground of faith in god or pleasure in man   truth i think not so much of for i do not know it  and i could  wish in my heart that i had not published this paper if it  troubles folk too much  all have not the same digestion nor the  same sight of things  and it came over me with special pain that  perhaps this article which i was at the pains to send to her  might give dismalness to my gamekeeper at home  well i cannot  take back what i have said but yet i may add this  if my view be  everything but the nonsense that it may be  to me it seems self evident and blinding truth  surely of all things it makes this  world holier  there is nothing in it but the moral side  but the  great battle and the breathing times with their refreshments  i  see no more and no less  and if you look again it is not ugly  and it is filled with promise  pray excuse a desponding author for this apology  my wife is away  off to the uttermost parts of the states all by herself  i shall  be off i hope in a week but where  ah that i know not  i keep  wonderful and my wife a little better and the lad flourishing   we now perform duets on two d tin whistles it is no joke to make  the bass i think i must really send you one which i wish you  would correct    i may be said to live for these instrumental  labours now but i have always some childishness on hand  i am  dear gamekeeper your indulgent but intemperate squire  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    union house manasquan nj but address to scribners 11th may  1888  my dear charles  i have found a yacht and we are going the full  pitch for seven months  if i cannot get my health back more or  less tis madness but of course there is the hope and i will  play big    if this business fails to set me up well 2000  pounds is gone and i know i cant get better  we sail from san  francisco june 15th for the south seas in the yacht casco  with  a million thanks for all your dear friendliness ever yours  affectionately  robert louis stevenson    letter  to homer st gaudens    manasquan new jersey 27th may 1888  dear homer st gaudens  your father has brought you this day to  see me and he tells me it is his hope you may remember the  occasion  i am going to do what i can to carry out his wish and  it may amuse you years after to see this little scrap of paper  and to read what i write  i must begin by testifying that you  yourself took no interest whatever in the introduction and in the  most proper spirit displayed a singleminded ambition to get back  to play and this i thought an excellent and admirable point in  your character  you were also i use the past tense with a view  to the time when you shall read rather than to that when i am  writing a very pretty boy and to my european views startlingly  selfpossessed  my time of observation was so limited that you  must pardon me if i can say no more  what else i marked what  restlessness of foot and hand what graceful clumsiness what  experimental designs upon the furniture was but the common  inheritance of human youth  but you may perhaps like to know that  the lean flushed man in bed who interested you so little was in a  state of mind extremely mingled and unpleasant  harassed with work  which he thought he was not doing well troubled with difficulties  to which you will in time succeed and yet looking forward to no  less a matter than a voyage to the south seas and the visitation of  savage and desert islands your fathers friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to henry james    manasquan ahem new jersey may 28th 1888  my dear james  with what a torrent it has come at last  up to  now what i like best is the first number of a london life  you  have never done anything better and i dont know if perhaps you  have ever done anything so good as the girls outburst  tiptop   i have been preaching your later works in your native land  i had  to present the beltraffio volume to low and it has brought him to  his knees he was amazed at the first part of georginas reasons  although like me not so well satisfied with part ii  it is  annoying to find the american public as stupid as the english but  they will waken up in time  i wonder what they will think of two  nations    this dear james is a valedictory  on june 15th the schooner  yacht casco will weather and a jealous providence permitting  steam through the golden gates for honolulu tahiti the galapagos  guayaquil and  i hope not the bottom of the pacific  it will  contain your obedient umble servant and party  it seems too good  to be true and is a very good way of getting through the green sickness of maturity which with all its accompanying ills is now  declaring itself in my mind and life  they tell me it is not so  severe as that of youth if i and the casco are spared i shall  tell you more exactly as i am one of the few people in the world  who do not forget their own lives  goodbye then my dear fellow and please write us a word we  expect to have three mails in the next two months  honolulu  tahiti and guayaquil  but letters will be forwarded from  scribners if you hear nothing more definite directly  in 3  three days i leave for san francisco  ever yours most  cordially  r l s     chapter x  pacific voyages june 1888november 1890     to sidney colvin    yacht casco anaho bay nukahiva marquesas islands july 1888  my dear colvin  from this somewhat ahem out of the way place i  write to say how dye do  it is all a swindle  i chose these  isles as having the most beastly population and they are far  better and far more civilised than we  i know one old chief koo amua a great cannibal in his day who ate his enemies even as he  walked home from killing em and he is a perfect gentleman and  exceedingly amiable and simpleminded  no fool though  the climate is delightful and the harbour where we lie one of the  loveliest spots imaginable  yesterday evening we had near a score  natives on board lovely parties  we have a native god very rare  now  very rare and equally absurd to view  this sort of work is not favourable to correspondence  it takes me  all the little strength i have to go about and see and then come  home and note the strangeness around us  i shouldnt wonder if  there came trouble here some day all the same  i could name a  nation that is not beloved in certain islands  and it does not  know it  strange  like ourselves perhaps in india  love to all  and much to yourself  r l s    letter  to charles baxter    yacht casco at sea near the paumotus 7 am september 6th  1888 with a dreadful pen  my dear charles  last night as i lay under my blanket in the  cockpit courting sleep i had a comic seizure  there was nothing  visible but the southern stars and the steersman there out by the  binnacle lamp we were all looking forward to a most deplorable  landfall on the morrow praying god we should fetch a tuft of palms  which are to indicate the dangerous archipelago the night was as  warm as milk and all of a sudden i had a vision of  drummond  street  it came on me like a flash of lightning  i simply  returned thither and into the past  and when i remember all i  hoped and feared as i pickled about rutherfords in the rain and  the east wind how i feared i should make a mere shipwreck and yet  timidly hoped not how i feared i should never have a friend far  less a wife and yet passionately hoped i might how i hoped if i  did not take to drink i should possibly write one little book  etc etc  and then now  what a change  i feel somehow as if i  should like the incident set upon a brass plate at the corner of  that dreary thoroughfare for all students to read poor devils  when their hearts are down  and i felt i must write one word to  you  excuse me if i write little  when i am at sea it gives me a  headache when i am in port i have my diary crying give give   i shall have a fine book of travels i feel sure and will tell you  more of the south seas after very few months than any other writer  has done  except herman melville perhaps who is a howling cheese   good luck to you god bless you  your affectionate friend  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    fakarava low archipelago september 21st 1888  my dear colvin  only a word  get out your big atlas and imagine  a straight line from san francisco to anaho the ne corner of  nukahiva one of the marquesas islands imagine three weeks there   imagine a days sail on august 12th round the eastern end of the  island to taiohae the capital imagine us there till august  22nd  imagine us skirt the east side of uapu  perhaps ronapoa  on your atlas  and through the bondelais straits to taakauku in  hivaoa where we arrive on the 23rd imagine us there until  september 4th when we sailed for fakarava which we reached on the  9th after a very difficult and dangerous passage among these  isles  tuesday we shall leave for taiti where i shall knock off  and do some necessary work ashore  it looks pretty bald in the  atlas not in fact nor i trust in the 130 odd pages of diary which  i have just been looking up for these dates  the interest indeed  has been incredible  i did not dream there were such places or  such races  my health has stood me splendidly i am in for hours  wading over the knees for shells i have been five hours on  horseback  i have been up pretty near all night waiting to see  where the casco would go ashore and with my diary all ready   simply the most entertaining night of my life  withal i still have  colds i have one now and feel pretty sick too but not as at  home  instead of being in bed for instance i am at this moment  sitting snuffling and writing in an undershirt and trousers and as  for colour hands arms feet legs and face i am browner than  the berry  only my trunk and the aristocratic spot on which i sit  retain the vile whiteness of the north  please give my news and kind love to henley henry james and any  whom you see of wellwishers  accept from me the very best of my  affection  and believe me ever yours  the old man virulent  taiti october 7th 1888  never having found a chance to send this off i may add more of my  news  my cold took a very bad turn and i am pretty much out of  sorts at this particular living in a little bare onetwentieth furnished house surrounded by mangoes etc  all the rest are  well and i mean to be soon  but these taiti colds are very severe  and to children often fatal so they were not the thing for me   yesterday the brigantine came in from san francisco so we can get  our letters off soon  there are in papeete at this moment in a  little wooden house with grated verandahs two people who love you  very much and one of them is  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    taiti as ever was 6th october 1888  my dear charles     you will receive a lot of mostly very bad  proofs of photographs  the paper was so bad  please keep them  very private as they are for the book  we send them having  learned so dread a fear of the sea that we wish to put our eggs in  different baskets  we have been thrice within an ace of being  ashore  we were lost  for about twelve hours in the low  archipelago but by gods blessing had quiet weather all the time  and once in a squall we cam so near gaun heels ower hurdies  that i really dinnae ken why we didnae athegither  hence as i  say a great desire to put our eggs in different baskets  particularly on the pacific awhawhaw pacific ocean  you can have no idea what a mean time we have had owing to  incidental beastlinesses nor what a glorious owing to the  intrinsic interest of these isles  i hope the book will be a good  one nor do i really very much doubt that  the stuff is so  curious what i wonder is if the public will rise to it  a copy  of my journal or as much of it as is made shall go to you also  it is of course quite imperfect much being to be added and  corrected but o for the eggs in the different baskets  all the rest are well enough and all have enjoyed the cruise so  far in spite of its drawbacks  we have had an awfae time in some  ways mr baxter and if i wasnae sic a verra patient man when i  ken that i have to be there wad hae been a braw row and ance if i  hadnae happened to be on deck about three in

adelaide boodle    taiti october 10th 1888  dear giver  i am at a loss to conceive your object in giving me  to a person so locomotory as my proprietor  the number of thousand  miles that i have travelled the strange bedfellows with which i  have been made acquainted i lack the requisite literary talent to  make clear to your imagination  i speak of bedfellows pocket fellows would be a more exact expression for the place of my abode  is in my masters righthand trouserpocket and there as he waded  on the resounding beaches of nukahiva or in the shallow tepid  water on the reef of fakarava i have been overwhelmed by and  buried among all manner of abominable south sea shells beautiful  enough in their way i make no doubt but singular company for any  selfrespecting papercutter  he my master  or as i more justly  call him my bearer for although i occasionally serve him does  not he serve me daily and all day long carrying me like an african  potentate on my subjects legs  he is delighted with these isles  and this climate and these savages and a variety of other things   he now blows a flageolet with singular effects  sometimes the poor  thing appears stifled with shame sometimes it screams with agony  he pursues his career with truculent insensibility  health appears  to reign in the party  i was very nearly sunk in a squall  i am  sorry i ever left england for here there are no books to be had  and without books there is no stable situation for dear giver  your affectionate  wooden papercutter  a neighbouring pair of scissors snips a kiss in your direction    letter  to sidney colvin    taiti october 16th 1888  my dear colvin  the cruiser for san francisco departs tomorrow  morning bearing you some kind of a scratch  this much more  important packet will travel by way of auckland  it contains a  ballant and i think a better ballant than i expected ever to do   i can imagine how you will wag your pow over it and how ragged you  will find it etc but has it not spirit all the same and though  the verse is not all your fancy painted it has it not some life   and surely as narrative the thing has considerable merit  read  it get a typewritten copy taken and send me that and your opinion  to the sandwiches  i know i am only courting the most excruciating  mortification but the real cause of my sending the thing is that i  could bear to go down myself but not to have much ms go down with  me  to say truth we are through the most dangerous but it has  left in all minds a strong sense of insecurity and we are all for  putting eggs in various baskets  we leave here soon bound for uahiva reiatea borabora and the  sandwiches   o how my spirit languishes to step ashore on the sanguishes for there my letters wait there shall i know my fate o how my spirit languidges to step ashore on the sanguidges   18th  i think we shall leave here if all is well on monday  i am  quite recovered astonishingly recovered it must be owned these  climates and this voyage have given me more strength than i could  have thought possible  and yet the sea is a terrible place  stupefying to the mind and poisonous to the temper the sea the  motion the lack of space the cruel publicity the villainous  tinned foods the sailors the captain the passengers  but you  are amply repaid when you sight an island and drop anchor in a new  world  much trouble has attended this trip but i must confess  more pleasure  nor should i ever complain as in the last few  weeks with the curing of my illness indeed as if that were the  bursting of an abscess the cloud has risen from my spirits and to  some degree from my temper  do you know what they called the casco  at fakarava  the silver ship  is that not pretty  pray tell mrs  jenkin die silberne frau as i only learned it since i wrote her   i think of calling the book by that name  the cruise of the silver  ship  so there will be one poetic page at least  the title  at  the sandwiches we shall say farewell to the s s with mingled  feelings  she is a lovely creature  the most beautiful thing at  this moment in taiti  well i will take another sheet though i know i have nothing to  say  you would think i was bursting  but the voyage is all stored  up for the book which is to pay for it we fondly hope and the  troubles of the time are not worth telling and our news is little  here i conclude oct 24th i think for we are now stored and  the blue peter metaphorically flies  r l s    letter  to william and thomas archer    taiti october 17th 1888  dear archer  though quite unable to write letters i nobly send  you a line signifying nothing  the voyage has agreed well with  all it has had its pains and its extraordinary pleasures nothing  in the world can equal the excitement of the first time you cast  anchor in some bay of a tropical island and the boats begin to  surround you and the tattooed people swarm aboard  tell  tomarcher with my respex that hideandseek is not equal to it  no nor hideeinthedark which for the matter of that is a game  for the unskilful  the artist prefers daylight a goodsized  garden some shrubbery an open paddock and  come on macduff  tomarcher i am now a distinguished litterytour but that was not  the real bent of my genius  i was the best player of hideandseek  going not a good runner i was up to every shift and dodge i  could jink very well i could crawl without any noise through  leaves i could hide under a carrot plant it used to be my  favourite boast that i always walked into the den  you may care to  hear tomarcher about the children in these parts their parents  obey them they do not obey their parents and i am sorry to tell  you for i dare say you are already thinking the idea a good one  that it does not pay one halfpenny  there are three sorts of  civilisation tomarcher  the real oldfashioned one in which  children either had to find out how to please their dear papas or  their dear papas cut their heads off  this style did very well  but is now out of fashion  then the modern european style  in  which children have to behave reasonably well and go to school and  say their prayers or their dear papas will know the reason why   this does fairly well  then there is the south sea island plan  which does not do one bit  the children beat their parents here  it does not make their parents any better so do not try it  dear tomarcher i have forgotten the address of your new house but  will send this to one of your papas publishers  remember us all  to all of you and believe me yours respectably  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    tautira the garden of the world otherwise called hanschristian andersenville november 1888  my dear charles  whether i have a penny left in the wide world i  know not nor shall know till i get to honolulu where i  anticipate a devil of an awakening  it will be from a mighty  pleasant dream at least  tautira being mere heaven  but suppose  for the sake of argument any money to be left in the hands of my  painful doer what is to be done with it  save us from exile would  be the wise mans choice i suppose for the exile threatens to be  eternal  but yet i am of opinion  in case there should be some  dibs in the hand of the pd ie painful doer because if there  be none i shall take to my flageolet on the highroad and work  home the best way i can having previously made away with my family   i am of opinion that if  and his are in the customary state and  you are thinking of an offering and there should be still some  funds over you would be a real good pd to put some in with yours  and tak the credit ot like a wee man  i know its a beastly  thing to ask but it after all does no earthly harm only that  much good  and besides like enough theres nothing in the till  and there is an end  yet i live here in the full lustre of  millions it is thought i am the richest son of man that has yet  been to tautira  i  and i am secretly eaten with the fear of  lying in pawn perhaps for the remainder of my days in san  francisco  as usual my colds have much hashed my finances  do tell henley i write this just after having dismissed ori the  subchief in whose house i live mrs ori and pairai their  adopted child from the evening hour of music  during which i  publickly with a k blow on the flageolet  these are words of  truth  yesterday i told ori about w e h counterfeited his  playing on the piano and the pipe and succeeded in sending the six  feet four there is of that subchief somewhat sadly to his bed  feeling that his was not the genuine article after all  ori is  exactly like a colonel in the guards  i am dear charles ever  yours affectionately  r l s    letter  tautira 10th november 88    my dear charles  our mainmast is dryrotten and we are all to  the devil i shall lie in a debtors jail  never mind tautira is  first chop  i am so besotted that i shall put on the back of this  my attempt at words to wandering willie if you can conceive at all  the difficulty you will also conceive the vanity with which i  regard any kind of result and whatever mine is like it has some  sense and burnss has none   home no more home to me whither must i wander hunger my driver i go where i must cold blows the winter wind over hill and heather thick drives the rain and my roof is in the dust loved of wise men was the shade of my rooftree the true word of welcome was spoken in the door  dear days of old with the faces in the firelight kind folks of old you come again no more  home was home then my dear full of kindly faces home was home then my dear happy for the child fire and the windows bright glittered on the moorland song tuneful song built a palace in the wild now when day dawns on the brow of the moorland lone stands the house and the chimneystone is cold lone let it stand now the friends are all departed the kind hearts the true hearts that loved the place of old  r l s    letter  to j a symonds    november 11th 1888  one november night in the village of tautira we sat at the high  table in the hall of assembly hearing the natives sing  it was  dark in the hall and very warm though at times the land wind blew  a little shrewdly through the chinks and at times through the  larger openings we could see the moonlight on the lawn  as the  songs arose in the rattling tahitian chorus the chief translated  here and there a verse  farther on in the volume you shall read  the songs themselves and i am in hopes that not you only but all  who can find a savour in the ancient poetry of places will read  them with some pleasure  you are to conceive us therefore in  strange circumstances and very pleasing in a strange land and  climate the most beautiful on earth surrounded by a foreign race  that all travellers have agreed to be the most engaging and taking  a double interest in two foreign arts  we came forth again at last in a cloudy moonlight on the forest  lawn which is the street of tautira  the pacific roared outside  upon the reef  here and there one of the scattered palmbuilt  lodges shone out under the shadow of the wood the lamplight  bursting through the crannies of the wall  we went homeward  slowly ori a ori carrying behind us the lantern and the chairs  properties with which we had just been enacting our part of the  distinguished visitor  it was one of those moments in which minds  not altogether churlish recall the names and deplore the absence of  congenial friends and it was your name that first rose upon our  lips  how symonds would have enjoyed this evening said one and  then another  the word caught in my mind i went to bed and it  was still there  the glittering frosty solitudes in which your  days are cast arose before me  i seemed to see you walking there  in the late night under the pinetrees and the stars and i  received the image with something like remorse  there is a modern attitude towards fortune in this place i will  not use a graver name  staunchly to withstand her buffets and to  enjoy with equanimity her favours was the code of the virtuous of  old  our fathers it should seem wondered and doubted how they  had merited their misfortunes  we rather how we have deserved our  happiness  and we stand often abashed and sometimes revolted at  those partialities of fate by which we profit most  it was so with  me on that november night  i felt that our positions should be  changed   it was you dear symonds who should have gone upon that  voyage and written this account  with your rich stores of  knowledge you could have remarked and understood a thousand things  of interest and beauty that escaped my ignorance and the brilliant  colours of your style would have carried into a thousand sickrooms  the sea air and the strong sun of tropic islands  it was otherwise  decreed  but suffer me at least to connect you if only in name  and only in the fondness of imagination with the voyage of the  silver ship  robert louis stevenson  dear symonds  i send you this november 11th the morning of its  completion  if i ever write an account of this voyage may i place  this letter at the beginning  it represents  i need not tell you  for you too are an artist  a most genuine feeling which kept me  long awake last night and though perhaps a little elaborate i  think it a good piece of writing  we are in heaven here  do not  forget  r l s  please keep this  i have no perfect copy tautira on the peninsula of tahiti    letter  to thomas archer    tautira island of tahiti november 1888  dear tomarcher  this is a pretty state of things seven oclock  and no word of breakfast  and i was awake a good deal last night  for it was full moon and they had made a great fire of cocoanut  husks down by the sea and as we have no blinds or shutters this  kept my room very bright  and then the rats had a wedding or a  schoolfeast under my bed  and then i woke early and i have  nothing to read except virgils aeneid which is not good fun on an  empty stomach and a latin dictionary which is good for naught  and by some humorous accident your dear papas article on  skerryvore  and i read the whole of that and very impudent it is  but you must not tell your dear papa i said so or it might come to  a battle in which you might lose either a dear papa or a valued  correspondent or both which would be prodigal  and still no  breakfast so i said lets write to tomarcher  this is a much better place for children than any i have hitherto  seen in these seas  the girls and sometimes the boys play a very  elaborate kind of hopscotch  the boys play horses exactly as we do  in europe and have very good fun on stilts trying to knock each  other down in which they do not often succeed  the children of  all ages go to church and are allowed to do what they please  running about the aisles rolling balls stealing mammas bonnet  and publicly sitting on it and at last going to sleep in the  middle of the floor  i forgot to say that the whips to play  horses and the balls to roll about the church  at least i never  saw them used elsewhere  grow ready made on trees which is rough  on toyshops  the whips are so good that i wanted to play horses  myself but no such luck my hair is grey and i am a great big  ugly man  the balls are rather hard but very light and quite  round  when you grow up and become offensively rich you can  charter a ship in the port of london and have it come back to you  entirely loaded with these balls when you could satisfy your mind  as to their character and give them away when done with to your  uncles and aunts  but what i really wanted to tell you was this   besides the treetop toys hushaby toyshop on the treetop  i have seen some real made toys the first hitherto observed in the  south seas  this was how  you are to imagine a fourwheeled gig one horse in  the front seat two tahiti natives in their sunday clothes blue  coat white shirt kilt a little longer than the scotch of a blue  stuff with big white or yellow flowers legs and feet bare in the  back seat me and my wife who is a friend of yours under our feet  plenty of lunch and things  among us a great deal of fun in broken  tahitian one of the natives the subchief of the village being a  great ally of mine  indeed we have exchanged names so that he is  now called rui the nearest they can come to louis for they have  no l and no s in their language  rui is six feet three in his  stockings and a magnificent man  we all have straw hats for the  sun is strong  we drive between the sea which makes a great  noise and the mountains the road is cut through a forest mostly  of fruit trees the very creepers which take the place of our ivy  heavy with a great and delicious fruit bigger than your head and  far nicer called barbedine  presently we came to a house in a  pretty garden quite by itself very nicely kept the doors and  windows open no one about and no noise but that of the sea  it  looked like a house in a fairytale and just beyond we must ford a  river and there we saw the inhabitants  just in the mouth of the  river where it met the sea waves they were ducking and bathing  and screaming together like a covey of birds  seven or eight  little naked brown boys and girls as happy as the day was long and  on the banks of the stream beside them real toys  toy ships full  rigged and with their sails set though they were lying in the  dust on their beam ends  and then i knew for sure they were all  children in a fairystory living alone together in that lonely  house with the only toys in all the island and that i had myself  driven in my fourwheeled gig into a corner of the fairystory  and the question was should i get out again  but it was all  right i guess only one of the wheels of the gig had got into the  fairystory and the next jolt the whole thing vanished and we  drove on in our seaside forest as before and i have the honour to  be tomarchers valued correspondent teriitepa which he was  previously known as  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    yacht casco at sea 14th january 1889  my dear colvin  twenty days out from papeete  yes sir all  that and only for a guess in 4 degrees north or at the best 4  degrees 30 minutes though already the wind seems to smell a little  of the north pole  my handwriting you must take as you get for we  are speeding along through a nasty swell and i can only keep my  place at the table by means of a foot against the divan the  unoccupied hand meanwhile gripping the inkbottle  as we begin so  very slowly to draw near to seven months of correspondence we are  all in some fear and i want to have letters written before i shall  be plunged into that boiling pot of disagreeables which i  constantly expect at honolulu  what is needful can be added there  we were kept two months at tautira in the house of my dear old  friend ori a ori till both the masts of this invaluable yacht had  been repaired  it was all for the best  tautira being the most  beautiful spot and its people the most amiable i have ever found   besides which the climate suited me to the ground i actually went  seabathing almost every day and in our feasts we are all huge  eaters in taiarapu have been known to apply four times for pig   and then again i got wonderful materials for my book collected  songs and legends on the spot songs still sung in chorus by  perhaps a hundred persons not two of whom can agree on their  translation legends on which i have seen half a dozen seniors  sitting in conclave and debating what came next  once i went a  days journey to the other side of the island to tati the high  chief of the tevas  my chief that is for i am now a teva and  teriitera at your service  to collect more and correct what i had  already  in the meanwhile i got on with my work almost finished  the master of ballantrae which contains more human work than  anything of mine but kidnapped and wrote the half of another  ballad the song of rahero on a taiarapu legend of my own clan  sir  not so much fire as the feast of famine but promising to be  more even and correct  but the best fortune of our stay at tautira  was my knowledge of ori himself one of the finest creatures  extant  the day of our parting was a sad one  we deduced from it  a rule for travellers  not to stay two months in one place  which  is to cultivate regrets  at last our contemptible ship was ready to sea we went bound for  honolulu and the letterbag on christmas day and from then to now  have experienced every sort of minor misfortune squalls calms  contrary winds and seas pertinacious rains declining stores till  we came almost to regard ourselves as in the case of vanderdecken   three days ago our luck seemed to improve we struck a leading  breeze got creditably through the doldrums and just as we looked  to have the ne trades and a straight run the rains and squalls  and calms began again about midnight and this morning though  there is breeze enough to send us along we are beaten back by an  obnoxious swell out of the north  here is a page of complaint  when a verse of thanksgiving had perhaps been more in place  for  all this time we must have been skirting past dangerous weather in  the tail and circumference of hurricanes and getting only  annoyance where we should have had peril and illhumour instead of  fear  i wonder if i have managed to give you any news this time or  whether the usual damn hangs over my letter  the midwife  whispered be thou dull or at least inexplicit  anyway i have  tried my best am exhausted with the effort and fall back into the  land of generalities  i cannot tell you how often we have planned  our arrival at the monument  two nights ago the 12th january we  had it all planned out arrived in the lights and whirl of  waterloo hailed a hansom span up waterloo road over the bridge  etc etc and hailed the monument gate in triumph and with  indescribable delight  my dear custodian i always think we are  too sparing of assurances  cordelia is only to be excused by regan  and goneril in the same nursery i wish to tell you that the longer  i live the more dear do you become to me nor does my heart own  any stronger sentiment  if the bloody schooner didnt send me  flying in every sort of direction at the same time i would say  better what i feel so much but really if you were here you would  not be writing letters i believe and even i though of a more  marine constitution am much perturbed by this bobbery and wish  o  ye gods how i wish  that it was done and we had arrived and i  had pandoras box my mail bag in hand and was in the lively hope  of something eatable for dinner instead of salt horse tinned  mutton duff without any plums and pie fruit which now make up  our whole repertory  o pandoras box  i wonder what you will  contain  as like as not you will contain but little money  if  that be so we shall have to retire to frisco in the casco and  thence by sea via panama to southampton where we should arrive in  april  i would like fine to see you on the tug  ten years older  both of us than the last time you came to welcome fanny and me to  england  if we have money however we shall do a little  differently  send the casco away from honolulu empty of its high born lessees for that voyage to frisco is one long dead beat in  foul and at last in cold weather stay awhile behind follow by  steamer cross the states by train stay awhile in new york on  business and arrive probably by the german line in southampton   but all this is a question of money  we shall have to lie very  dark awhile to recruit our finances  what comes from the book of  the cruise i do not want to touch until the capital is repaid  r l s    letter  to e l burlingame    honolulu january 1889  my dear burlingame  here at last i have arrived  we could not  get away from tahiti till christmas day and then had thirty days  of calms and squalls a deplorable passage  this has thrown me all  out of gear in every way  i plunge into business  1  the master  herewith go three more parts  you see he grows in  balk this making ten already and i am not yet sure if i can  finish it in an eleventh which shall go to you quam primum  i  hope by next mail  2  illustrations to m  i totally forgot to try to write to hole   it was just as well for i find it impossible to forecast with  sufficient precision  you had better throw off all this and let  him have it at once  please do  all and at once  see further  and i should hope he would still be in time for the later numbers   the three pictures i have received are so truly good that i should  bitterly regret having the volume imperfectly equipped  they are  the best illustrations i have seen since i dont know when  3  money  tomorrow the mail comes in and i hope it will bring  me money either from you or home but i will add a word on that  point  4  my address will be honolulu  no longer yacht casco which i am  packing off  till probably april  5  as soon as i am through with the master i shall finish the  game of bluff  now rechristened the wrong box  this i wish to  sell cash down  it is of course copyright in the states and i  offer it to you for five thousand dollars  please reply on this by  return  also please tell the typewriter who was so good as to be  amused by our follies that i am filled with admiration for his  piece of work  6  master again  please see that i havent the name of the  governor of new york wrong 1764 is the date in part ten  i have  no book of reference to put me right  observe you now have up to  august inclusive in hand so you should begin to feel happy  is this all  i wonder and fear not  henry the trader has not yet  turned up  i hope he may tomorrow when we expect a mail  not  one word of business have i received either from the states or  england nor anything in the shape of coin which leaves me in a  fine uncertainty and quite penniless on these islands  hm who  is a gentleman of a courtly order and much tinctured with letters  is very polite i may possibly ask for the position of palace  doorkeeper  my voyage has been a singular mixture of good and ill fortune  as far as regards interest and material the fortune has  been admirable as far as regards time money and impediments of  all kinds from squalls and calms to rotten masts and sprung spars  simply detestable  i hope you will be interested to hear of two  volumes on the wing  the cruise itself you are to know will make  a big volume with appendices some of it will first appear as what  they call letters in some of mclures papers  i believe the book  when ready will have a fair measure of serious interest  i have  had great fortune in finding old songs and ballads and stories for  instance and have many singular instances of life in the last few  years among these islands  the second volume is of ballads  you know ticonderoga  i have  written another  the feast of famine a marquesan story  a third  is half done  the song of rahero a genuine tahitian legend  a  fourth dances before me  a hawaiian fellow this the priests  drought or some such name  if as i half suspect i get enough  subjects out of the islands ticonderoga shall be suppressed and  well call the volume south sea ballads  in health spirits  renewed interest in life and i do believe refreshed capacity for  work the cruise has proved a wise folly  still were not home  and although the friend of a crowned head are penniless upon  these as one of my correspondents used to call them lovely but  fatil islands  by the way who wrote the lion of the nile  my  dear sir that is something like  overdone in bits it has a true  thought and a true ring of language  beg the anonymous from me to  delete when he shall republish the two last verses and end on  the lion of the nile  one lampman has a good sonnet on a winter  evening in i think the same number  he seems ill named but i  am tempted to hope a man is not always answerable for his name   for instance you would think you knew mine  no such matter  it  is  at your service and mr scribners and that of all of the  faithful  teriitera pray pronounce tayreetayra or gallice  teritera  r l s  more when the mail shall come  i am an idiot  i want to be clear on one point  some of holes  drawings must of course be too late and yet they seem to me so  excellent i would fain have the lot complete  it is one thing for  you to pay for drawings which are to appear in that soulswallowing  machine your magazine  quite another if they are only to  illustrate a volume  i wish you to take a brisk even a fiery  decision on the point and let hole know  to resume my desultory  song i desire you would carry the same fire hereinbefore  suggested into your decision on the wrong box for in my present  state of benighted ignorance as to my affairs for the last seven  months  i know not even whether my house or my mothers house have  been let  i desire to see something definite in front of me   outside the lot of palace doorkeeper  i believe the said wrong box  is a real lark in which of course i may be grievously deceived  but the typewriter is with me  i may also be deceived as to the  numbers of the master now going and already gone but to me they  seem first chop sir first chop  i hope i shall pull off that  damned ending but it still depresses me  this is your doing mr  burlingame  you would have it there and then and i fear it  i  fear that ending  r l s    letter  to charles baxter    honolulu february 8th 1889  my dear charles  here we are at honolulu and have dismissed the  yacht and lie here till april anyway in a fine state of haze  which i am yet in hopes some letter of yours still on the way may  dissipate  no money and not one word as to money  however i  have got the yacht paid off in triumph i think and though we stay  here impignorate it should not be for long even if you bring us  no extra help from home  the cruise has been a great success both  as to matter fun and health and yet lord man were pleased to  be ashore  yon was a very fine voyage from tahiti up here but   the dry lands a fine place too and we dont mind squalls any  longer and eh man thats a great thing  blow blow thou wintry  wind thou hast done me no appreciable harm beyond a few grey  hairs  altogether this foolhardy venture is achieved and if i  have but nine months of life and any kind of health i shall have  both eaten my cake and got it back again with usury  but man  there have been days when i felt guilty and thought i was in no  position for the head of a house  your letter and accounts are doubtless at s f and will reach me  in course  my wife is no great shakes she is the one who has  suffered most  my mother has had a huge old time lloyd is first  chop i so well that i do not know myself  seabathing if you  please and what is far more dangerous entertaining and being  entertained by his majesty here who is a very fine intelligent  fellow but o charles what a crop for the drink  he carries it  too like a mountain with a sparrow on its shoulders  we  calculated five bottles of champagne in three hours and a half  afternoon and the sovereign quite presentable although  perceptibly more dignified at the end     the extraordinary health i enjoy and variety of interests i find  among these islands would tempt me to remain here only for lloyd  who is not well placed in such countries for a permanency and a  little for colvin to whom i feel i owe a sort of filial duty  and  these two considerations will no doubt bring me back  to go to bed  again  in england  yours ever affectionately  r l s    letter  to r a m stevenson    honolulu hawaiian islands february 1889  my dear bob  my extremely foolhardy venture is practically over   how foolhardy it was i dont think i realised  we had a very small  schooner and like most yachts overrigged and oversparred and  like many american yachts on a very dangerous sail plan  the  waters we sailed in are of course entirely unlighted and very  badly charted in the dangerous archipelago through which we were  fools enough to go we were perfectly in ignorance of where we were  for a whole night and half the next day and this in the midst of  invisible islands and rapid and variable currents and we were  lucky when we found our whereabouts at last  we have twice had all  we wanted in the way of squalls  once as i came on deck i found  the green sea over the cockpit coamings and running down the  companion like a brook to meet me at that same moment the foresail  sheet jammed and the captain had no knife this was the only  occasion on the cruise that ever i set a hand to a rope but i  worked like a trojan judging the possibility of haemorrhage better  than the certainty of drowning  another time i saw a rather  singular thing  our whole ships company as pale as paper from the  captain to the cook we had a black squall astern on the port side  and a white squall ahead to starboard the complication passed off  innocuous the black squall only fetching us with its tail and the  white one slewing off somewhere else  twice we were a long while  days in the close vicinity of hurricane weather but again luck  prevailed and we saw none of it  these are dangers incident to  these seas and small craft  what was an amazement and at the same  time a powerful stroke of luck both our masts were rotten and we  found it out  i was going to say in time but it was stranger and  luckier than that  the head of the mainmast hung over so that  hands were afraid to go to the helm and less than three weeks  before  i am not sure it was more than a fortnight  we had been  nearly twelve hours beating off the lee shore of eimeo or moorea  next island to tahiti in half a gale of wind with a violent head  sea  she would neither tack nor wear once and had to be boxed off  with the mainsail  you can imagine what an ungodly show of kites  we carried  and yet the mast stood  the very day after that in  the southern bight of tahiti we had a near squeak the wind  suddenly coming calm the reefs were close in with my eye what a  surf  the pilot thought we were gone and the captain had a boat  cleared when a lucky squall came to our rescue  my wife hearing  the order given about the boats remarked to my mother isnt that  nice  we shall soon be ashore  thus does the female mind  unconsciously skirt along the verge of eternity  our voyage up  here was most disastrous  calms squalls head sea waterspouts of  rain hurricane weather all about and we in the midst of the  hurricane season when even the hopeful builder and owner of the  yacht had pronounced these seas unfit for her  we ran out of food  and were quite given up for lost in honolulu  people had ceased to  speak to belle about the casco as a deadly subject  but the perils of the deep were part of the programme and though i  am very glad to be done with them for a while and comfortably  ashore where a squall does not matter a snuff to any one i feel  pretty sure i shall want to get to sea again ere long  the  dreadful risk i took was financial and doubleheaded  first i  had to sink a lot of money in the cruise and if i didnt get  health how was i to get it back  i have got health to a wonderful  extent and as i have the most interesting matter for my book bar  accidents i ought to get all i have laid out and a profit  but  second what i own i never considered till too late there was the  danger of collisions of damages and heavy repairs of disablement  towing and salvage indeed the cruise might have turned round and  cost me double  nor will this danger be quite over till i hear the  yacht is in san francisco for though i have shaken the dust of her  deck from my feet i fear as a point of law she is still mine  till she gets there  from my point of view up to now the cruise has been a wonderful  success  i never knew the world was so amusing  on the last  voyage we had grown so used to sealife that no one wearied though  it lasted a full month except fanny who is always ill  all the  time our visits to the islands have been more like dreams than  realities  the people the life the beachcombers the old stories  and songs i have picked up so interesting the climate the  scenery and in some places the women so beautiful  the women  are handsomest in tahiti the men in the marquesas both as fine  types as can be imagined  lloyd reminds me i have not told you  one characteristic incident of the cruise from a seminaval point  of view  one night we were going ashore in anaho bay the most  awful noise on deck the breakers distinctly audible in the cabin  and there i had to sit below entertaining in my best style a  negroid native chieftain much the worse for rum  you can imagine  the evenings pleasure  this naval report on cruising in the south seas would be incomplete  without one other trait  on our voyage up here i came one day into  the diningroom the hatch in the floor was open the ships boy  was below with a baler and two of the hands were carrying buckets  as for a fire this meant that the pumps had ceased working  one stirring day was that in which we sighted hawaii  it blew  fair but very strong we carried jib foresail and mainsail all  singlereefed and she carried her lee rail under water and flew   the swell the heaviest i have ever been out in  i tried in vain  to estimate the height at least fifteen feet  came tearing after  us about a point and a half off the wind  we had the best hand   old louis  at the wheel and really he did nobly and had noble  luck for it never caught us once  at times it seemed we must have  it louis would look over his shoulder with the queerest look and  dive down his neck into his shoulders and then it missed us  somehow and only sprays came over our quarter turning the little  outside lane of deck into a mill race as deep as to the cockpit  coamings  i never remember anything more delightful and exciting   pretty soon after we were lying absolutely becalmed under the lee  of hawaii of which we had been warned and the captain never  confessed he had done it on purpose but when accused he smiled   really i suppose he did quite right for we stood committed to a  dangerous race and to bring her to the wind would have been rather  a heartsickening manoeuvre  r l s    letter  to marcel schwob    honolulu sandwich islands february 8th 1889  dear sir  i thank you  from the midst of such a flurry as you  can imagine with seven months accumulated correspondence on my  table  for your two friendly and clever letters  pray write me  again  i shall be home in may or june and not improbably shall  come to paris in the summer  then we can talk or in the interval  i may be able to write which is today out of the question  pray  take a word from a man of crushing occupations and count it as a  volume  your little conte is delightful  ah yes you are right i  love the eighteenth century and so do you and have not listened  to its voice in vain  the hunted one  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    honolulu 8th march 1889  my dear charles  at last i have the accounts  the doer has done  excellently and in the words of  i reciprocate every step of  your behaviour    i send a letter for bob in your care as i  dont know his liverpool address by which for he is to show you  part of it you will see we have got out of this adventure  or  hope to have  with wonderful fortune  i have the retrospective  horrors on me when i think of the liabilities i incurred but  thank god i think im in port again and i have found one climate  in which i can enjoy life  even honolulu is too cold for me but  the south isles were a heaven upon earth to a puir catarrhal party  like johnsone  we think as tahiti is too complete a banishment  to try madeira  its only a week from england good  communications and i suspect in climate and scenery not unlike our  dear islands in people alas there can be no comparison  but  friends could go and i could come in summer so i should not be  quite cut off  lloyd and i have finished a story the wrong box  if it is not  funny i am sure i do not know what is  i have split over writing  it  since i have been here i have been toiling like a galley  slave  three numbers of the master to rewrite five chapters of  the wrong box to write and rewrite and about five hundred lines of  a narrative poem to write rewrite and rerewrite  now i have the  master waiting me for its continuation two numbers more when  thats done i shall breathe  this spasm of activity has been  chequered with champagne parties  happy and glorious hawaii ponoi  paua  kou moi  native hawaiians dote upon your monarch  hawaiian god save the king  in addition to my other labours i am  learning the language with a native moonshee  kalakaua is a  terrible companion a bottle of fizz is like a glass of sherry to  him he thinks nothing of five or six in an afternoon as a whet for  dinner  you should see a photograph of our party after an  afternoon with h h m  my what a crew  yours ever  affectionately  robert louis stevenson    letter  to henry james    honolulu march 1889  my dear james  yes  i own up  i am untrue to friendship and  what is less but still considerable to civilisation  i am not  coming home for another year  there it is cold and bald and now  you wont believe in me at all and serve me right says you and  the devil take me  but look here and judge me tenderly  i have  had more fun and pleasure of my life these past months than ever  before and more health than any time in ten long years  and even  here in honolulu i have withered in the cold and this precious  deep is filled with islands which we may still visit and though  the sea is a deathful place i like to be there and like squalls  when they are over and to draw near to a new island i cannot  say how much i like  in short i take another year of this sort of  life and mean to try to work down among the poisoned arrows and  mean if it may be to come back again when the thing is through  and converse with henry james as heretofore and in the meanwhile  issue directions to h j to write to me once more  let him  address here at honolulu for my views are vague and if it is sent  here it will follow and find me if i am to be found and if i am  not to be found the man james will have done his duty and we shall  be at the bottom of the sea where no postoffice clerk can be  expected to discover us or languishing on a coral island the  philosophic drudges of some barbarian potentate  perchance of an  american missionary  my wife has just sent to mrs sitwell a  translation tant bien que mal of a letter i have had from my  chief friend in this part of the world  go and see her and get a  hearing of it it will do you good it is a better method of  correspondence than even henry jamess  i jest but seriously it  is a strange thing for a tough sick middleaged scrivener like r  l s to receive a letter so conceived from a man fifty years old  a leading politician a crack orator and the great wit of his  village  boldly say the highly popular mp of tautira  my  nineteenth century strikes here and lies alongside of something  beautiful and ancient  i think the receipt of such a letter might  humble shall i say even  and for me i would rather have  received it than written redgauntlet or the sixth aeneid  all  told if my books have enabled or helped me to make this voyage to  know rui and to have received such a letter they have in the old  prefatorial expression not been writ in vain  it would seem from  this that i have been not so much humbled as puffed up but i  assure you i have in fact been both  a little of what that letter  says is my own earning not all but yet a little and the little  makes me proud and all the rest ashamed and in the contrast how  much more beautiful altogether is the ancient man than him of to day  well well henry james is pretty good though he is of the  nineteenth century and that glaringly  and to curry favour with  him i wish i could be more explicit but indeed i am still of  necessity extremely vague and cannot tell what i am to do nor  where i am to go for some while yet  as soon as i am sure you  shall hear  all are fairly well  the wife your countrywoman  least of all troubles are not entirely wanting but on the whole  we prosper and we are all affectionately yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    honolulu april 2nd 1889  my dear colvin  i am beginning to be ashamed of writing on to you  without the least acknowledgment like a tramp but i do not care   i am hardened and whatever be the cause of your silence i mean to  write till all is blue  i am outright ashamed of my news which is  that we are not coming home for another year  i cannot but hope it  may continue the vast improvement of my health  i think it good  for fanny and lloyd and we have all a taste for this wandering and  dangerous life  my mother i send home to my relief as this part  of our cruise will be if we can carry it out rather difficult in  places  here is the idea  about the middle of june unless the  boston board objects we sail from honolulu in the missionary ship  barquentine auxiliary steamer morning star  she takes us through  the gilberts and marshalls and drops us this is my great idea on  ponape one of the volcanic islands of the carolines  here we stay  marooned among a doubtful population with a spanish vicegovernor  and five native kings and a sprinkling of missionaries all at  loggerheads on the chance of fetching a passage to sydney in a  trader a labour ship or maybe but this appears too bright a  ship of war  if we cant get the morning star and the board has  many reasons that i can see for refusing its permission i mean to  try to fetch fiji hire a schooner there do the fijis and  friendlies hit the course of the richmond at tonga tabu make back  by tahiti and so to s f and home  perhaps in june 1890  for  the latter part of the cruise will likely be the same in either  case  you can see for yourself how much variety and adventure this  promises and that it is not devoid of danger at the best but if  we can pull it off in safety gives me a fine book of travel and  lloyd a fine lecture and diorama which should vastly better our  finances  i feel as if i were untrue to friendship believe me colvin when  i look forward to this absence of another year my conscience sinks  at thought of the monument but i think you will pardon me if you  consider how much this tropical weather mends my health  remember  me as i was at home and think of me seabathing and walking about  as jolly as a sandboy  you will own the temptation is strong and  as the scheme bar fatal accidents is bound to pay into the  bargain sooner or later it seems it would be madness to come home  now with an imperfect book no illustrations to speak of no  diorama and perhaps fall sick again by autumn  i do not think i  delude myself when i say the tendency to catarrh has visibly  diminished  it is a singular tiring that as i was packing up old papers ere i  left skerryvore i came on the prophecies of a drunken highland  sibyl when i was seventeen  she said i was to be very happy to  visit america and to be much upon the sea  it seems as if it were  coming true with a vengeance  also do you remember my strong  old rooted belief that i shall die by drowning  i dont want that  to come true though it is an easy death but it occurs to me  oddly with these long chances in front  i cannot say why i like  the sea no man is more cynically and constantly alive to its  perils i regard it as the highest form of gambling and yet i love  the sea as much as i hate gambling  fine clean emotions a world  all and always beautiful air better than wine interest  unflagging there is upon the whole no better life  yours ever  r l s    letter  to e l burlingame    honolulu april 1889  my dear burlingame  this is to announce the most prodigious  change of programme  i have seen so much of the south seas that i  desire to see more and i get so much health here that i dread a  return to our vile climates  i have applied accordingly to the  missionary folk to let me go round in the morning star and if the  boston board should refuse i shall get somehow to fiji hire a  trading schooner and see the fijis and friendlies and samoa  he  would be a south seayer mr burlingame  of course if i go in the  morning star i see all the eastern or western islands  before i sail i shall make out to let you have the last of the  master  though i tell you it sticks  and i hope to have had some  proofs forbye of the verses anyway  and now to business  i want if you can find them in the british sixpenny edition if  not in some equally compact and portable shape  seaside library  for instance  the waverley novels entire or as entire as you can  get em and the following of marryat  phantom ship peter simple  percival keene privateersman children of the new forest frank  mildmay newton forster dog fiend snarleyyow  also midshipman  easy kingsburn carlyles french revolution motleys dutch  republic langs letters on literature a complete set of my works  jenkin in duplicate also familiar studies ditto  i have to thank you for the accounts which are satisfactory  indeed and for the cheque for 1000  another account will have  come and gone before i see you  i hope it will be equally roseate  in colour  i am quite worked out and this cursed end of the  master hangs over me like the arm of the gallows but it is always  darkest before dawn and no doubt the clouds will soon rise but it  is a difficult thing to write above all in mackellarese and i  cannot yet see my way clear  if i pull this off the master will  be a pretty good novel or i am the more deceived and even if i  dont pull it off itll still have some stuff in it  we shall remain here until the middle of june anyway but my mother  leaves for europe early in may  hence our mail should continue to  come here but not hers  i will let you know my next address  which will probably be sydney  if we get on the morning star i  propose at present to get marooned on ponape and take my chance of  getting a passage to australia  it will leave times and seasons  mighty vague and the cruise is risky but i shall know something  of the south seas when it is done or else the south seas will  contain all there is of me  it should give me a fine book of  travels anyway  low will probably come and ask some dollars of you  pray let him  have them they are for outfit  o another complete set of my  books should go to captain a h otis care of dr merritt yacht  casco oakland cal  in haste  r l s    letter  to miss adelaide boodle    honolulu april 6th 1889  my dear miss boodle  nobody writes a better letter than my  gamekeeper  so gay so pleasant so engagingly particular  answering by some delicate instinct all the questions she  suggests  it is a shame you should get such a poor return as i can  make from a mind essentially and originally incapable of the art  epistolary  i would let the papercutter take my place but i am  sorry to say the little wooden seaman did after the manner of  seamen and deserted in the societies  the place he seems to have  stayed at  seems for his absence was not observed till we were  near the equator  was tautira and i assure you he displayed  good taste tautira being as nigh hand heaven as a papercutter  or anybody has a right to expect  i think all our friends will be very angry with us and i give the  grounds of their probable displeasure bluntly  we are not coming  home for another year  my mother returns next month  fanny  lloyd and i push on again among the islands on a trading schooner  the equator  first for the gilbert group which we shall have an  opportunity to explore thoroughly then if occasion serve to the  marshalls and carolines and if occasion or money fail to samoa  and back to tahiti  i own we are deserters but we have excuses   you cannot conceive how these climates agree with the wretched  houseplant of skerryvore  he wonders to find himself seabathing  and cutting about the world loose like a grownup person  they  agree with fanny too who does not suffer from her rheumatism and  with lloyd also  and the interest of the islands is endless and  the sea though i own it is a fearsome place is very delightful   we had applied for places in the american missionary ship the  morning star but this trading schooner is a far preferable idea  giving us more time and a thousandfold more liberty so we  determined to cut off the missionaries with a shilling  the sandwich islands do not interest us very much we live here  oppressed with civilisation and look for good things in the  future  but it would surprise you if you came out tonight from  honolulu all shining with electric lights and all in a bustle  from the arrival of the mail which is to carry you these lines  and crossed the long wooden causeway along the beach and came out  on the road through kapiolani park and seeing a gate in the  palings with a tub of goldfish by the wayside entered casually  in  the buildings stand in three groups by the edge of the beach  where an angry little spitfire sea continually spirts and thrashes  with impotent irascibility the big seas breaking further out upon  the reef  the first is a small house with a very large summer  parlour or lanai as they call it here roofed but practically  open  there you will find the lamps burning and the family sitting  about the table dinner just done  my mother my wife lloyd  belle my wifes daughter austin her child and tonight by way  of rarity a guest  all about the walls our south sea curiosities  war clubs idols pearl shells stone axes etc and the walls are  only a small part of a lanai the rest being glazed or latticed  windows or mere open space  you will see there no sign of the  squire however and being a person of a humane disposition you  will only glance in over the balcony railing at the merrymakers in  the summer parlour and proceed further afield after the exile   you look round there is beautiful green turf many trees of an  outlandish sort that drop thorns  look out if your feet are bare  but i beg your pardon you have not been long enough in the south  seas  and many oleanders in full flower  the next group of  buildings is ramshackle and quite dark you make out a coachhouse  door and look in  only some cocoanuts you try round to the left  and come to the sea front where venus and the moon are making  luminous tracks on the water and a great swell rolls and shines on  the outer reef and here is another door  all these places open  from the outside  and you go in and find photography tubs of  water negatives steeping a tap and a chair and an inkbottle  where my wife is supposed to write round a little further a third  door entering which you find a picture upon the easel and a table  sticky with paints a fourth door admits you to a sort of court  where there is a hen sitting  i believe on a fallacious egg  no  sign of the squire in all this  but right opposite the studio door  you have observed a third little house from whose open door  lamplight streams and makes hay of the strong moonlight shadows   you had supposed it made no part of the grounds for a fence runs  round it lined with oleander but as the squire is nowhere else is  it not just possible he may be here  it is a grim little wooden  shanty cobwebs bedeck it friendly mice inhabit its recesses the  mailed cockroach walks upon the wall so also i regret to say the  scorpion  herein are two pallet beds two mosquito curtains  strung to the pitchboards of the roof two tables laden with books  and manuscripts three chairs and in one of the beds the squire  busy writing to yourself as it chances and just at this moment  somewhat bitten by mosquitoes  he has just set fire to the insect  powder and will be all right in no time but just now he  contemplates large white blisters and would like to scratch them  but knows better  the house is not bare it has been inhabited by  kanakas and  you know what children are  the bare wood walls  are pasted over with pages from the graphic harpers weekly etc   the floor is matted and i am bound to say the matting is filthy   there are two windows and two doors one of which is condemned on  the panels of that last a sheet of paper is pinned up and covered  with writing  i cull a few plums   a duckhammock for each person a patent organ like the commandants at taiohae cheap and bad cigars for presents revolvers permanganate of potass liniment for the head and sulphur fine toothcomb   what do you think this is  simply life in the south seas  foreshortened  these are a few of our desiderata for the next  trip which we jot down as they occur  there i have really done my best and tried to send something like  a letter  one letter in return for all your dozens  pray remember  us all to yourself mrs boodle and the rest of your house  i do  hope your mother will be better when this comes  i shall write and  give you a new address when i have made up my mind as to the most  probable and i do beg you will continue to write from time to time  and give us airs from home  tomorrow  think of it  i must be  off by a quarter to eight to drive in to the palace and breakfast  with his hawaiian majesty at 830  i shall be dead indeed  please  give my news to scott i trust he is better give him my warm  regards  to you we all send all kinds of things and i am the  absentee squire  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    honolulu april 1889  my dear charles  as usual your letter is as good as a cordial  and i thank you for it and all your care kindness and generous  and thoughtful friendship from my heart  i was truly glad to hear  a word of colvin whose long silence has terrified me and glad to  hear that you condoned the notion of my staying longer in the south  seas for i have decided in that sense  the first idea was to go  in the morning star missionary ship but now i have found a  trading schooner the equator which is to call for me here early  in june and carry us through the gilberts  what will happen then  the lord knows  my mother does not accompany us  she leaves here  for home early in may and you will hear of us from her but not i  imagine anything more definite  we shall get dumped on  butaritari and whether we manage to go on to the marshalls and  carolines or whether we fall back on samoa heaven must decide  but i mean to fetch back into the course of the richmond  to  think you dont know what the richmond is  the steamer of the  eastern south seas joining new zealand tongatabu the samoas  taheite and rarotonga and carrying by last advices sheep in the  saloon  into the course of the richmond and make taheite again  on the home track  would i like to see the scots observer   wouldnt i not  but whaur  im direckit at space  they have nae  post offishes at the gilberts and as for the carlines  ye see  mr baxter were no just in the punkshewal centre o civlisation   but pile them up for me and when ive decided on an address ill  let you ken and yell can send them stavin after me  ever your  affectionate  r l s    letter  to charles baxter    honolulu 10th may 1889  my dear charles  i am appalled to gather from your last just to  hand that you have felt so much concern about the letter  pray  dismiss it from your mind  but i think you scarce appreciate how  disagreeable it is to have your private affairs and private  unguarded expressions getting into print  it would soon sicken any  one of writing letters  i have no doubt that letter was very  wisely selected but it just shows how things crop up  there was a  raging jealousy between the two yachts our captain was nearly in a  fight over it  however no more and whatever you think my dear  fellow do not suppose me angry with you or  although i was  annoyed at the circumstance  a very different thing  but it is  difficult to conduct life by letter and i continually feel i may  be drifting into some matter of offence in which my heart takes no  part  i must now turn to a point of business  this new cruise of ours is  somewhat venturesome and i think it needful to warn you not to be  in a hurry to suppose us dead  in these illcharted seas it is  quite on the cards we might be cast on some unvisited or very  rarely visited island that there we might lie for a long time  even years unheard of and yet turn up smiling at the hinder end   so do not let me be rowpit till you get some certainty we have  gone to davie jones in a squall or graced the feast of some  barbarian in the character of long pig  i have just been a week away alone on the lee coast of hawaii the  only white creature in many miles riding five and a half hours one  day living with a native seeing four lepers shipped off to  molokai hearing native causes and giving my opinion as amicus  curiae as to the interpretation of a statute in english a lovely  week among gods best  at least gods sweetest works   polynesians  it has bettered me greatly  if i could only stay  there the time that remains i could get my work done and be happy  but the care of my family keeps me in vile honolulu where i am  always out of sorts amidst heat and cold and cesspools and beastly  haoles  what is a haole  you are one and so i am sorry to say  am i  after so long a dose of whites it was a blessing to get  among polynesians again even for a week  well charles there are waur haoles than yoursel ill say that  for ye and trust before i sail i shall get another letter with  more about yourself  ever your affectionate friend  r l s    letter  to w h low    honolulu about 20th may 89  my dear low  the goods have come many daughters have done  virtuously but thou excellest them all  i have at length  finished the master it has been a sore cross to me but now he is  buried his bodys under hatches  his soul if there is any hell  to go to gone to hell and i forgive him  it is harder to forgive  burlingame for having induced me to begin the publication or  myself for suffering the induction  yes i think hole has done  finely it will be one of the most adequately illustrated books of  our generation he gets the note he tells the story  my story  i  know only one failure  the master standing on the beach  you  must have a letter for me at sydney  till further notice   remember me to mrs will h the godlike sculptor and any of the  faithful  if you want to cease to be a republican see my little  kaiulani as she goes through  but she is gone already  you will  die a red i wear the colours of that little royal maiden nous  allons chanter a la ronde si vous voulez only she is not blonde  by several chalks though she is but a halfblood and the wrong  half edinburgh scots like mysel  but o low i love the  polynesian  this civilisation of ours is a dingy ungentlemanly  business it drops out too much of man and too much of that the  very beauty of the poor beast  who has his beauties in spite of  zola and co  as usual here is a whole letter with no news  i am  a bloodless inhuman dog and no doubt zola is a better  correspondent  long live your fine old english admiral  yours i  mean  the usa one at samoa i wept tears and loved myself and  mankind when i read of him  he is not too much civilised  and  there was gordon too and there are others beyond question  but  if you could live the only white folk in a polynesian village  and drink that warm light vin du pays of human affection and  enjoy that simple dignity of all about you  i will not gush for i  am now in my fortieth year which seems highly unjust but there it  is mr low and the lord enlighten your affectionate  r l s    letter  to mrs r l stevenson    kalawao molokai may 1889  dear fanny  i had a lovely sail up  captain cameron and mr  gilfillan both born in the states yet the first still with a  strong highland and the second still with a strong lowland accent  were good company the night was warm the victuals plain but good   mr gilfillan gave me his berth and i slept well though i heard  the sisters sick in the next stateroom poor souls  heavy rolling  woke me in the morning i turned in all standing so went right on  the upper deck  the day was on the peep out of a low morning bank  and we were wallowing along under stupendous cliffs  as the lights  brightened we could see certain abutments and buttresses on their  front where wood clustered and grass grew brightly  but the whole  brow seemed quite impassable and my heart sank at the sight  two  thousand feet of rock making 19 degrees the captain guesses  seemed quite beyond my powers  however i had come so far and to  tell you the truth i was so cowed with fear and disgust that i  dared not go back on the adventure in the interests of my own self respect  presently we came up with the leper promontory  lowland  quite bare and bleak and harsh a little town of wooden houses two  churches a landingstair all unsightly sour northerly lying  athwart the sunrise with the great wall of the pali cutting the  world out on the south  our lepers were sent on the first boat  about a dozen one poor child very horrid one white man leaving a  large grown family behind him in honolulu and then into the second  stepped the sisters and myself  i do not know how it would have  been with me had the sisters not been there  my horror of the  horrible is about my weakest point but the moral loveliness at my  elbow blotted all else out and when i found that one of them was  crying poor soul quietly under her veil i cried a little myself  then i felt as right as a trivet only a little crushed to be there  so uselessly  i thought it was a sin and a shame she should feel  unhappy i turned round to her and said something like this   ladies god himself is here to give you welcome  im sure it is  good for me to be beside you i hope it will be blessed to me i  thank you for myself and the good you do me  it seemed to cheer  her up but indeed i had scarce said it when we were at the  landingstairs and there was a great crowd hundreds of god save  us pantomime masks in poor human flesh waiting to receive the  sisters and the new patients  every hand was offered  i had gloves but i had made up my mind on  the boats voyage not to give my hand that seemed less offensive  than the gloves  so the sisters and i went up among that crew and  presently i got aside for i felt i had no business there and set  off on foot across the promontory carrying my wrap and the camera   all horror was quite gone from me  to see these dread creatures  smile and look happy was beautiful  on my way through kalaupapa i  was exchanging cheerful alohas with the patients coming galloping  over on their horses i was stopping to gossip at housedoors i  was happy only ashamed of myself that i was here for no good  one  woman was pretty and spoke good english and was infinitely  engaging and in the old phrase towardly she thought i was the  new white patient and when she found i was only a visitor a  curious change came in her face and voice  the only sad thing  morally sad i mean  that i met that morning  but for all that  they tell me none want to leave  beyond kalaupapa the houses  became rare dry stone dykes grassy stony land one sick  pandanus a dreary country from overhead in the little clinging  wood shogs of the pali chirruping of birds fell the low sun was  right in my face the trade blew pure and cool and delicious i  felt as right as ninepence and stopped and chatted with the  patients whom i still met on their horses with not the least  disgust  about halfway over i met the superintendent a leper  with a horse for me and o wasnt i glad  but the horse was one  of those curious dogged cranky brutes that always dully want to  go somewhere else and my traffic with him completed my crushing  fatigue  i got to the guesthouse an empty house with several  rooms kitchen bath etc  there was no one there and i let the  horse go loose in the garden lay down on the bed and fell asleep  dr swift woke me and gave me breakfast then i came back and slept  again while he was at the dispensary and he woke me for dinner  and i came back and slept again and he woke me about six for  supper and then in about an hour i felt tired again and came up  to my solitary guesthouse played the flageolet and am now  writing to you  as yet you see i have seen nothing of the  settlement and my crushing fatigue though i believe that was  moral and a measure of my cowardice and the doctors opinion make  me think the pali hopeless  you dont look a strong man said  the doctor but are you sound  i told him the truth then he  said it was out of the question and if i were to get up at all i  must be carried up  but as it seems men as well as horses  continually fall on this ascent  the doctor goes up with a change  of clothes  it is plain that to be carried would in itself be very  fatiguing to both mind and body and i should then be at the  beginning of thirteen miles of mountain road to be ridden against  time  how should i come through  i hope you will think me right  in my decision  i mean to stay and shall not be back in honolulu  till saturday june first  you must all do the best you can to  make ready  dr swift has a wife and an infant son beginning to toddle and  run and they live here as composed as brick and mortar  at least  the wife does a kentucky german a fine enough creature i  believe who was quite amazed at the sisters shedding tears  how  strange is mankind  gilfillan too a good fellow i think and far  from a stupid kept up his hard lowland scottish talk in the boat  while the sister was covering her face but i believe he knew and  did it partly in embarrassment and part perhaps in mistaken  kindness  and that was one reason too why i made my speech to  them  partly too i did it because i was ashamed to do so and  remembered one of my golden rules when you are ashamed to speak  speak up at once  but mind you that rule is only golden with  strangers with your own folks there are other considerations   this is a strange place to be in  a bell has been sounded at  intervals while i wrote now all is still but a musical humming of  the sea not unlike the sound of telegraph wires the night is  quite cool and pitch dark with a small fine rain one light over  in the leper settlement one cricket whistling in the garden my  lamp here by my bedside and my pen cheeping between my inky  fingers  next day lovely morning slept all night 80 degrees in the shade  strong sweet anaho tradewind  louis    letter  to sidney colvin    honolulu june 1889  my dear colvin  i am just home after twelve days journey to  molokai seven of them at the leper settlement where i can only  say that the sight of so much courage cheerfulness and devotion  strung me too high to mind the infinite pity and horror of the  sights  i used to ride over from kalawao to kalaupapa about three  miles across the promontory the cliffwall ivied with forest and  yet inaccessible from steepness on my left go to the sisters  home which is a miracle of neatness play a game of croquet with  seven leper girls 90 degrees in the shade got a little oldmaid  meal served me by the sisters and ride home again tired enough  but not too tired  the girls have all dolls and love dressing  them  you who know so many ladies delicately clad and they who  know so many dressmakers please make it known it would be an  acceptable gift to send scraps for doll dressmaking to the reverend  sister maryanne bishop home kalaupapa molokai hawaiian islands  i have seen sights that cannot be told and heard stories that  cannot be repeated  yet i never admired my poor race so much nor  strange as it may seem loved life more than in the settlement  a  horror of moral beauty broods over the place  thats like bad  victor hugo but it is the only way i can express the sense that  lived with me all these days  and this even though it was in great  part catholic and my sympathies flew never with so much difficulty  as towards catholic virtues  the passbook kept with heaven stirs  me to anger and laughter  one of the sisters calls the place the  ticket office to heaven  well what is the odds  they do their  darg and do it with kindness and efficiency incredible and we must  take folks virtues as we find them and love the better part  of  old damien whose weaknesses and worse perhaps i heard fully i  think only the more  it was a european peasant  dirty bigoted  untruthful unwise tricky but superb with generosity residual  candour and fundamental goodhumour  convince him he had done  wrong it might take hours of insult and he would undo what he had  done and like his corrector better  a man with all the grime and  paltriness of mankind but a saint and hero all the more for that   the place as regards scenery is grand gloomy and bleak  mighty  mountain walls descending sheer along the whole face of the island  into a sea unusually deep the front of the mountain ivied and  furred with clinging forest one viridescent cliff  about halfway  from east to west the low bare stony promontory edged in between  the cliff and the ocean the two little towns kalawao and  kalaupapa seated on either side of it as bare almost as bathing  machines upon a beach and the population  gorgons and chimaeras  dire  all this tear of the nerves i bore admirably and the day  after i got away rode twenty miles along the opposite coast and up  into the mountains  they call it twenty i am doubtful of the  figures  i should guess it nearer twelve but let me take credit  for what residents allege and i was riding again the day after so  i need say no more about health  honolulu does not agree with me  at all  i am always out of sorts there with slight headache  blood to the head etc  i had a good deal of work to do and did it  with miserable difficulty and yet all the time i have been gaining  strength as you see which is highly encouraging  by the time i  am done with this cruise i shall have the material for a very  singular book of travels  names of strange stories and characters  cannibals pirates ancient legends old polynesian poetry  never  was so generous a farrago  i am going down now to get the story of  a shipwrecked family who were fifteen months on an island with a  murderer  there is a specimen  the pacific is a strange place  the nineteenth century only exists there in spots  all round it  is a no mans land of the ages a stirabout of epochs and races  barbarisms and civilisations virtues and crimes  it is good of you to let me stay longer but if i had known how ill  you were i should be now on my way home  i had chartered my  schooner and made all arrangements before at last we got definite  news  i feel highly guilty i should be back to insult and worry  you a little  our address till further notice is to be co r  towns and co sydney  that is final  i only got the arrangement  made yesterday but you may now publish it abroad  yours ever  r l s    letter  to james payn    honolulu hi june 13th 1889  my dear james payn  i get sad news of you here at my offsetting  for further voyages  i wish i could say what i feel  sure there  was never any man less deserved this calamity for i have heard you  speak time and again and i remember nothing that was unkind  nothing that was untrue nothing that was not helpful from your  lips  it is the illtalkers that should hear no more  god knows  i know no word of consolation but i do feel your trouble  you are  the more open to letters now let me talk to you for two pages  i  have nothing but happiness to tell and you may bless god you are a  man so soundhearted that even in the freshness of your calamity  i can come to you with my own good fortune unashamed and secure of  sympathy  it is a good thing to be a good man whether deaf or  whether dumb and of all our fellowcraftsmen whom yet they count  a jealous race i never knew one but gave you the name of honesty  and kindness  come to think of it gravely this is better than the  finest hearing  we are all on the march to deafness blindness  and all conceivable and fatal disabilities we shall not all get  there with a report so good  my good news is a health  astonishingly reinstated  this climate these voyagings these  landfalls at dawn new islands peaking from the morning bank new  forested harbours new passing alarms of squalls and surf new  interests of gentle natives  the whole tale of my life is better  to me than any poem  i am fresh just now from the leper settlement of molokai playing  croquet with seven leper girls sitting and yarning with old  blind leper beachcombers in the hospital sickened with the  spectacle of abhorrent suffering and deformation amongst the  patients touched to the heart by the sight of lovely and effective  virtues in their helpers  no stranger time have i ever had nor  any so moving  i do not think it a little thing to be deaf god  knows and god defend me from the same  but to be a leper of one  of the selfcondemned how much more awful and yet theres a way  there also  there are molokais everywhere said mr dutton  father damiens dresser you are but new landed in yours and my  dear and kind adviser i wish you with all my soul that patience  and courage which you will require  think of me meanwhile on a  trading schooner bound for the gilbert islands thereafter for the  marshalls with a diet of fish and cocoanut before me bound on a  cruise of  well of investigation to what islands we can reach  and to get some day or other to sydney where a letter addressed  to the care of r towns  co will find me sooner or later and if  it contain any good news whether of your welfare or the courage  with which you bear the contrary will do me good  yours  affectionately although so near a stranger  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    schooner equator apaiang lagoon august 22nd 1889  my dear colvin  the missionary ship is outside the reef trying  vainly to get in so i may have a chance to get a line off  i am  glad to say i shall be home by june next for the summer or we  shall know the reason why  for gods sake be well and jolly for  the meeting  i shall be i believe a different character from  what you have seen this long while  this cruise is up to now a  huge success being interesting pleasant and profitable  the  beachcomber is perhaps the most interesting character here the  natives are very different on the whole from polynesians  they  are moral standoffish for good reasons and protected by a dark  tongue  it is delightful to meet the few hawaiians mostly  missionaries that are dotted about with their italian brio and  their ready friendliness  the whites are a strange lot many of  them good kind pleasant fellows others quite the lowest i have  ever seen even in the slums of cities  i wish i had time to  narrate to you the doings and character of three white murderers  more or less proven i have met  one the only undoubted assassin  of the lot quite gained my affection in his big home out of a  wreck with his new hebrides wife in her savage turban of hair and  yet a perfect lady and his three adorable little girls in rob roy  macgregor dresses dancing to the hand organ performing circus on  the floor with startling effects of nudity and curling up together  on a mat to sleep three sizes three attitudes three rob roy  dresses and six little clenched fists  the murderer meanwhile  brooding and gloating over his chicks till your whole heart went  out to him and yet his crime on the face of it was dark   disembowelling in his own house an old man of seventy and him  drunk  it is lunchtime i see and i must close up with my warmest love  to you  i wish you were here to sit upon me when required  ah if  you were but a good sailor  i will never leave the sea i think  it is only there that a briton lives  my poor grandfather it is  from him i inherit the taste i fancy and he was round many  islands in his day but i please god shall beat him at that  before the recall is sounded  would you be surprised to learn that  i contemplate becoming a shipowner  i do but it is a secret   life is far better fun than people dream who fall asleep among the  chimney stacks and telegraph wires  love to henry james and others near  ever yours my dear fellow  robert louis stevenson  equator town  apemama october 1889  no morning star came however and so now i try to send this to you  by the schooner j l tiernan  we have been about a month ashore  camping out in a kind of town the king set up for us  on the idea  that i was really a big chief in england  he dines with us  sometimes and sends up a cook for a share of our meals when he  does not come himself  this sounds like high living alas  undeceive yourself  salt junk is the mainstay a low island  except for cocoanuts is just the same as a ship at sea  brackish  water no supplies and very little shelter  the king is a great  character  a thorough tyrant very much of a gentleman a poet a  musician a historian or perhaps rather more a genealogist  it is  strange to see him lying in his house among a lot of wives nominal  wives writing the history of apemama in an accountbook his  description of one of his own songs which he sang to me himself  as about sweethearts and trees and the sea  and no true all thesame lie seems about as compendious a definition of lyric  poetry as a man could ask  tembinoka is here the great attraction   all the rest is heat and tedium and villainous dazzle and yet more  villainous mosquitoes  we are like to be here however many a  long week before we get away and then whither  a strange trade  this voyaging  so vague so bounddown so helpless  fanny has  been planting some vegetables and we have actually onions and  radishes coming up  ah oniondespiser were you but awhile in a  low island how your heart would leap at sight of a costers  barrow  i think i could shed tears over a dish of turnips  no  doubt we shall all be glad to say farewell to low islands  i had  near said for ever  they are very tame and i begin to read up the  directory and pine for an island with a profile a running brook  or were it only a well among the rocks  the thought of a mango  came to me early this morning and set my greed on edge but you do  not know what a mango is so   i have been thinking a great deal of you and the monument of late  and even tried to get my thoughts into a poem hitherto without  success  god knows how you are  i begin to weary dreadfully to  see you  well in nine months i hope but that seems a long time   i wonder what has befallen me too that flimsy part of me that  lives or dwindles in the public mind and what has befallen the  master and what kind of a box the merry box has been found  it is  odd to know nothing of all this  we had an old woman to do devil work for you about a month ago in a chinamans house on apaiang  august 23rd or 24th  you should have seen the crone with a noble  masculine face like that of an old crone sic a body like a  mans naked all but the feathery female girdle knotting cocoanut  leaves and muttering spells  fanny and i and the good captain of  the equator and the chinaman and his native wife and sisterin law all squatting on the floor about the sibyl and a crowd of  dark faces watching from behind her shoulder she sat right in the  doorway and tittering aloud with strange appalled embarrassed  laughter at each fresh adjuration  she informed us you were in  england not travelling and now no longer sick she promised us a  fair wind the next day and we had it so i cherish the hope she  was as right about sidney colvin  the shipownering has rather  petered out since i last wrote and a good many other plans beside  health  fanny very soso i pretty right upon the whole and  getting through plenty work  i know not quite how but it seems to  me not bad and in places funny  south sea yarns  1 the wrecker                                  r l s 2 the pearl fisher   by    and                           lloyd o 3 the beachcombers    the pearl fisher part done lies in sydney  it is the wrecker we  are now engaged upon  strange ways of life i think they set  forth  things that i can scarce touch upon or even not at all in  my travel book and the yarns are good i do believe  the pearl  fisher is for the new york ledger  the yarn is a kind of monte  cristo one  the wrecker is the least good as a story i think but  the characters seem to me good  the beachcombers is more  sentimental  these three scarce touch the outskirts of the life we  have been viewing a hotbed of strange characters and incidents   lord how different from europe or the pallid states  farewell   heaven knows when this will get to you  i burn to be in sydney and  have news  r l s    letter  to sidney colvin    schooner equator at sea 190 miles off samoa  monday december  2nd 1889  my dear colvin  we are just nearing the end of our long cruise   rain calms squalls bang  theres the foretopmast gone rain  calm squalls away with the staysail more rain more calm more  squalls a prodigious heavy sea all the time and the equator  staggering and hovering like a swallow in a storm and the cabin a  great square crowded with wet human beings and the rain  avalanching on the deck and the leaks dripping everywhere  fanny  in the midst of fifteen males bearing up wonderfully  but such  voyages are at the best a trial  we had one particularity  coming  down on winslow reef p d position doubtful  two positions in  the directory a third if you cared to count that on the chart  heavy sea running and the night due  the boats were cleared  bread put on board and we made up our packets for a boat voyage of  four or five hundred miles and turned in expectant of a crash   needless to say it did not come and no doubt we were far to  leeward  if we only had twopenceworth of wind we might be at  dinner in apia tomorrow evening but no such luck  here we roll  dead before a light air  and that is no point of sailing at all  for a fore and aft schooner  the sun blazing overhead thermometer  88 degrees four degrees above what i have learned to call south  sea temperature but for all that land so near and so much grief  being happily astern we are all pretty gay on board and have been  photographing and draughtplaying and skylarking like anything  i  am minded to stay not very long in samoa and confine my studies  there as far as any one can forecast to the history of the late  war  my book is now practically modelled  if i can execute what  is designed there are few better books now extant on this globe  bar the epics and the big tragedies and histories and the choice  lyric poetics and a novel or so  none  but it is not executed  yet and let not him that putteth on his armour vaunt himself  at  least nobody has had such stuff such wild stories such beautiful  scenes such singular intimacies such manners and traditions so  incredible a mixture of the beautiful and horrible the savage and  civilised  i will give you here some idea of the table of  contents which ought to make your mouth water  i propose to call  the book the south seas  it is rather a large

observations on samoan manners under the similar heads in other  polynesian islands  it is still possible though unlikely that i  may add a passing visit to fiji or tonga or even both but i am  growing impatient to see yourself and i do not want to be later  than june of coming to england  anyway you see it will be a large  work and as it will be copiously illustrated the lord knows what  it will cost  we shall return god willing by sydney ceylon  suez and i guess marseilles the manymasted copyright epithet   i shall likely pause a day or two in paris but all that is too far  ahead  although now it begins to look near  so near and i can  hear the rattle of the hansom up endell street and see the gates  swing back and feel myself jump out upon the monument steps   hosanna  home again  my dear fellow now that my father is done  with his troubles and 17 heriot row no more than a mere shell you  and that gaunt old monument in bloomsbury are all that i have in  view when i use the word home some passing thoughts there may be  of the rooms at skerryvore and the blackbirds in the chine on a  may morning but the essence is s c and the museum  suppose by  some damned accident you were no more  well i should return just  the same because of my mother and lloyd whom i now think to send  to cambridge but all the spring would have gone out of me and  ninety per cent of the attraction lost  i will copy for you here  a copy of verses made in apemama   i heard the pulse of the besieging sea throb far away all night  i heard the wind fly crying and convulse tumultuous palms i rose and strolled  the isle was all bright sand and flailing fans and shadows of the palm the heaven all moon and wind and the blind vault  the keenest planet slain for venus slept the king my neighbour with his host of wives slept in the precinct of the palisade where single in the wind under the moon among the slumbering cabins blazed a fire sole streetlamp and the only sentinel to other lands and nights my fancy turned to london first and chiefly to your house the manypillared and the wellbeloved there yearning fancy lighted there again in the upper room i lay and heard far off the unsleeping city murmur like a shell the muffled tramp of the museum guard once more went by me i beheld again lamps vainly brighten the dispeopled street again i longed for the returning morn the awaking traffic the bestirring birds the consentaneous trill of tiny song that weaves round monumental cornices a passing charm of beauty  most of all for your light foot i wearied and your knock that was the glad reveille of my day lo now when to your task in the great house at morning through the portico you pass one moment glance where by the pillared wall farvoyaging island gods begrimed with smoke sit now unworshipped the rude monument of faiths forgot and races undivined sit now disconsolate remembering well the priest the victim and the songful crowd the blaze of the blue noon and that huge voice incessant of the breakers on the shore as far as these from their ancestral shrine so far so foreign your divided friends wander estranged in body not in mind  r l s    letter  to e l burlingame    schooner equator at sea wednesday 4th december 1889  my dear burlingame  we are now about to rise like whales from  this long dive and i make ready a communication which is to go to  you by the first mail from samoa  how long we shall stay in that  group i cannot forecast but it will be best still to address at  sydney where i trust when i shall arrive perhaps in one month  from now more probably in two or three to find all news  business  will you be likely to have a space in the magazine for  a serial story which should be ready i believe by april at  latest by autumn  it is called the wrecker and in book form will  appear as number 1 of south sea yarns by r l s and lloyd  osbourne  here is the table as far as fully conceived and indeed  executed   the story is founded on fact the mystery i really believe to be  insoluble the purchase of a wreck has never been handled before  no more has san francisco  these seem all elements of success   there is besides a character jim pinkerton of the advertising  american on whom we build a good deal and some sketches of the  american merchant marine opium smuggling in honolulu etc  it  should run to about three hundred pages of my ms  i would like  to know if this tale smiles upon you if you will have a vacancy  and what you will be willing to pay  it will of course be  copyright in both the states and england  i am a little anxious to  have it tried serially as it tests the interest of the mystery  pleasure  we have had a fine time in the gilbert group though  four months on low islands which involves low diet is a largish  order and my wife is rather down  i am myself up to now a  pillar of health though our long and vile voyage of calms  squalls cataracts of rain sails carried away foretopmast lost  boats cleared and packets made on the approach of a p d reef  etc has cured me of salt brine and filled me with a longing for  beef steak and mangoes not to be depicted  the interest has been  immense  old king tembinoka of apemama the napoleon of the group  poet tyrant altogether a man of mark gave me the woven corselets  of his grandfather his father and his uncle and what pleased me  more told me their singular story then all manner of strange  tales facts and experiences for my south sea book which should be  a tearer mr burlingame  no one at least has had such stuff  we are now engaged in the hell of a dead calm the heat is cruel   it is the only time when i suffer from heat  i have nothing on but  a pair of serge trousers and a singlet without sleeves of oxford  gauze  o yes and a red sash about my waist and yet as i sit  here in the cabin sweat streams from me  the rest are on deck  under a bit of awning we are not much above a hundred miles from  port and we might as well be in kamschatka  however i should be  honest  this is the first calm i have endured without the added  bane of a heavy swell and the intoxicated bluebottle wallowings  and knockings of the helpless ship  i wonder how you liked the end of the master that was the hardest  job i ever had to do did i do it  my wife begs to be remembered to yourself and mrs burlingame   remember all of us to all friends particularly low in case i  dont get a word through for him  i am yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    samoa december 1889  my dear baxter     i cannot return until i have seen either  tonga or fiji or both  and i must not leave here till i have  finished my collections on the war  a very interesting bit of  history the truth often very hard to come at and the search for  me much complicated by the german tongue from the use of which i  have desisted i suppose these fifteen years  the last two days i  have been mugging with a dictionary from five to six hours a day  besides this i have to call upon keep sweet and judiciously  interview all sorts of persons  english american german and  samoan  it makes a hard life above all as after every interview  i have to come and get my notes straight on the nail  i believe i  should have got my facts before the end of january when i shall  make our tonga or fiji  i am down right in the hurricane season  but they had so bad a one last year i dont imagine there will be  much of an edition this  say that i get to sydney some time in  april and i shall have done well and be in a position to write a  very singular and interesting book or rather two for i shall  begin i think with a separate opuscule on the samoan trouble  about as long as kidnapped not very interesting but valuable   and a thing proper to be done  and then hey for the big south  sea book  a devil of a big one and full of the finest sport  this morning as i was going along to my breakfast a little before  seven reading a number of blackwoods magazine i was startled by  a soft talofa alii note for my mother  they are quite courteous  here in the european style quite unlike tahiti right in my ear   it was mataafa coming from early mass in his white coat and white  linen kilt with three fellows behind him  mataafa is the nearest  thing to a hero in my history and really a fine fellow plenty  sense and the most dignified quiet gentle manners  talking of  blackwood  a file of which i was lucky enough to find here in the  lawyers  mrs oliphant seems in a staggering state  from the  wrong box to the master i scarce recognise either my critic or  myself  i gather that the master should do well and at least that  notice is agreeable reading  i expect to be home in june  you  will have gathered that i am pretty well  in addition to my  labours i suppose i walk five or six miles a day and almost every  day i ride up and see fanny and lloyd who are in a house in the  bush with ah fu  i live in apia for historys sake with moors an  american trader  day before yesterday i was arrested and fined for  riding fast in the street which made my blood bitter as the wife  of the manager of the german firm has twice almost ridden me down  and there seems none to say her nay  the germans have behaved  pretty badly here but not in all ways so ill as you may have  gathered  they were doubtless much provoked and if the insane  knappe had not appeared upon the scene might have got out of the  muddle with dignity  i write along without rhyme or reason as  things occur to me  i hope from my outcries about printing you do not think i want you  to keep my news or letters in a blue beard closet  i like all  friends to hear of me they all should if i had ninety hours in the  day and strength for all of them but you must have gathered how  hard worked i am and you will understand i go to bed a pretty  tired man  29th december 1889  tomorrow monday i wont swear to my day of the month this is  the sunday between christmas and new year i go up the coast with  mr clarke one of the london society missionaries in a boat to  examine schools see tamasese etc  lloyd comes to photograph   pray heaven we have good weather this is the rainy season we  shall be gone four or five days and if the rain keep off i shall  be glad of the change if it rain it will be beastly  this  explains still further how hard pressed i am as the mail will be  gone ere i return and i have thus lost the days i meant to write  in  i have a boy henry who interprets and copies for me and is  a great nuisance  he said he wished to come to me in order to  learn long expressions  henry goes up along with us and as i am  not fond of him he may before the trip is over hear some strong  expressions  i am writing this on the back balcony at moors  palms and a hill like the hill of kinnoull looking in at me myself  lying on the floor and like the parties in handels song clad  in robes of virgin white the ink is dreadful the heat delicious  a fine going breeze in the palms and from the other side of the  house the sudden angry splash and roar of the pacific on the reef  where the warships are still piled from last years hurricane some  under water one high and dry upon her side the strangest figure  of a ship was ever witnessed the narrow bay there is full of  ships the menofwar covered with sail after the rains and  especially the german ship which is fearfully and awfully top  heavy rolling almost yards in in what appears to be calm water  samoa apia at least is far less beautiful than the marquesas or  tahiti  a more gentle scene gentler acclivities a tamer face of  nature and this much aided for the wanderer by the great german  plantations with their countless regular avenues of palms  the  island has beautiful rivers of about the bigness of our waters in  the lothians with pleasant pools and waterfalls and overhanging  verdure and often a great volume of sound so that once i thought  i was passing near a mill and it was only the voice of the river   i am not specially attracted by the people but they are courteous  the women very attractive and dress lovely the men purposelike  well set up tall lean and dignified  as i write the breeze is  brisking up doors are beginning to slam  and shutters a strong  draught sweeps round the balcony it looks doubtful for tomorrow   here i shut up  ever your affectionate  r l stevenson    letter  to dr scott    apia samoa january 20th 1890  my dear scott  shameful indeed that you should not have heard of  me before  i have now been some twenty months in the south seas  and am up to date a person whom you would scarce know  i think  nothing of long walks and rides  i was four hours and a half gone  the other day partly riding partly climbing up a steep ravine  i  have stood a six months voyage on a copra schooner with about  three months ashore on coral atolls which means except for  cocoanuts to drink no change whatever from ships food  my wife  suffered badly  it was too rough a business altogether  lloyd  suffered  and in short i was the only one of the party who kept  my end up  i am so pleased with this climate that i have decided to settle  have even purchased a piece of land from three to four hundred  acres i know not which till the survey is completed and shall  only return next summer to wind up my affairs in england  thenceforth i mean to be a subject of the high commissioner  now you would have gone longer yet without news of your truant  patient but that i have a medical discovery to communicate  i  find i can almost immediately fight off a cold with liquid  extract of coca two or if obstinate three teaspoonfuls in the  day for a variable period of from one to five days sees the cold  generally to the door  i find it at once produces a glow stops  rigour and though it makes one very uncomfortable prevents the  advance of the disease  hearing of this influenza it occurred to  me that this might prove remedial and perhaps a stronger  exhibition  injections of cocaine for instance  still better  if on my return i find myself let in for this epidemic which seems  highly calculated to nip me in the bud i shall feel very much  inclined to make the experiment  see what a gulf you may save me  from if you shall have previously made it on anima vili on some  less important sufferer and shall have found it worse than  useless  how is miss boodle and her family  greeting to your brother and  all friends in bournemouth yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    februar den 3en 1890 dampfer lubeck zwischen apia und sydney  my dear charles  i have got one delightful letter from you and  heard from my mother of your kindness in going to see her  thank  you for that  you can in no way more touch and serve me    ay  ay it is sad to sell 17 sad and fine were the old days  when i  was away in apemama i wrote two copies of verse about edinburgh  and the past so ink black so golden bright  i will send them if  i can find them for they will say something to you and indeed one  is more than half addressed to you  this is it    to my old comrades   do you remember  can we eer forget  how in the coiled perplexities of youth in our wild climate in our scowling town we gloomed and shivered sorrowed sobbed and feared the belching winter wind the missile rain the rare and welcome silence of the snows the laggard morn the haggard day the night the grimy spell of the nocturnal town do you remember  ah could one forget as when the fevered sick that all night long listed the wind intone and hear at last the everwelcome voice of the chanticleer sing in the bitter hour before the dawn  with sudden ardour these desire the day  here a squall sends all flying  so sang in the gloom of youth the bird of hope so we exulting hearkened and desired for lo as in the palace porch of life we huddled with chimeras from within  how sweet to hear  the music swelled and fell and through the breach of the revolving doors what dreams of splendour blinded us and fled i have since then contended and rejoiced amid the glories of the house of life profoundly entered and the shrine beheld yet when the lamp from my expiring eyes shall dwindle and recede the voice of love fall insignificant on my closing ears what sound shall come but the old cry of the wind in our inclement city what return but the image of the emptiness of youth filled with the sound of footsteps and that voice of discontent and rapture and despair so as in darkness from the magic lamp the momentary pictures gleam and fade and perish and the night resurges  these shall i remember and then all forget   theyre pretty secondrate but felt  i cant be bothered to copy  the other  i have bought 314 and a half acres of beautiful land in the bush  behind apia when we get the house built the garden laid and  cattle in the place it will be something to fall back on for  shelter and food and if the island could stumble into political  quiet it is conceivable it might even bring a little income     we range from 600 to 1500 feet have five streams waterfalls  precipices profound ravines rich tablelands fifty head of cattle  on the ground if any one could catch them a great view of  forest sea mountains the warships in the haven  really a noble  place  some day you are to take a long holiday and come and see  us  it has been all planned  with all these irons in the fire and cloudy prospects you may be  sure i was pleased to hear a good account of business  i believed  the master was a sure card  i wonder why henley thinks it grimy  grim it is god knows but sure not grimy else i am the more  deceived  i am sorry he did not care for it i place it on the  line with kidnapped myself  well see as time goes on whether it  goes above or falls below  r l s    letter  to e l burlingame    ss lubeck between apia and sydney february 1890  my dear burlingame  i desire nothing better than to continue my  relation with the magazine to which it pleases me to hear i have  been useful  the only thing i have ready is the enclosed barbaric  piece  as soon as i have arrived in sydney i shall send you some  photographs a portrait of tembinoka perhaps a view of the palace  or of the matted men at their singing also ts flag which my  wife designed for him  in a word what i can do best for you  it  will be thus a foretaste of my book of travels  i shall ask you to  let me have if i wish it the use of the plates made and to make  up a little tract of the verses and illustrations of which you  might send six copies to h m tembinoka king of apemama via  butaritari gilbert islands  it might be best to send it by  crawford and co s f  there is no postal service and schooners  must take it how they may and when  perhaps some such note as  this might be prefixed  at my departure from the island of apemama for which you will look  in vain in most atlases the king and i agreed since we both set  up to be in the poetical way that we should celebrate our  separation in verse  whether or not his majesty has been true to  his bargain the laggard posts of the pacific may perhaps inform me  in six months perhaps not before a year  the following lines  represent my part of the contract and it is hoped by their  pictures of strange manners they may entertain a civilised  audience  nothing throughout has been invented or exaggerated the  lady herein referred to as the authors muse has confined herself  to stringing into rhyme facts and legends that i saw or heard  during two months residence upon the island  r l s  you will have received from me a letter about the wrecker  no  doubt it is a new experiment for me being disguised so much as a  study of manners and the interest turning on a mystery of the  detective sort i think there need be no hesitation about beginning  it in the fall of the year  lloyd has nearly finished his part  and i shall hope to send you very soon the ms of about the first  foursevenths  at the same time i have been employing myself in  samoa collecting facts about the recent war and i propose to  write almost at once and to publish shortly a small volume called  i know not what  the war in samoa the samoa trouble an island  war the war of the three consuls i know not  perhaps you can  suggest  it was meant to be a part of my travel book but material  has accumulated on my hands until i see myself forced into volume  form and i hope it may be of use if it come soon  i have a few  photographs of the war which will do for illustrations  it is  conceivable you might wish to handle this in the magazine although  i am inclined to think you wont and to agree with you  but if  you think otherwise there it is  the travel letters fifty of  them are already contracted for in papers these i was quite bound  to let mclure handle as the idea was of his suggestion and i  always felt a little sore as to one trick i played him in the  matter of the endpapers  the warvolume will contain some very  interesting and picturesque details  more i cant promise for it   of course the fifty newspaper letters will be simply patches chosen  from the travel volume or volumes as it gets written  but you see i have in hand  say half done  1 the wrecker  lloyds copy half done mine not touched  2 the pearl fisher a  novel promised to the ledger and which will form when it comes in  book form no 2 of our south sea yarns  not begun but all material ready  3 the war volume  ditto  4 the big travel book which includes the letters  you know how they stand  5 the ballads  excusez du peu  and you see what madness it would be to make any  fresh engagement  at the same time you have the wrecker and the  war volume if you like either  or both  to keep my name in the  magazine  it begins to look as if i should not be able to get any more  ballads done this somewhile  i know the book would sell better if  it were all ballads and yet i am growing half tempted to fill up  with some other verses  a good few are connected with my voyage  such as the home of tembinoka sent herewith and would have a  sort of slight affinity to the south sea ballads  you might tell  me how that strikes a stranger  in all this my real interest is with the travel volume which  ought to be of a really extraordinary interest  i am sending you tembinoka as he stands but there are parts of  him that i hope to better particularly in stanzas iii and ii  i  scarce feel intelligent enough to try just now and i thought at  any rate you had better see it set it up if you think well and  let me have a proof so at least we shall get the bulk of it  straight  i have spared you tenkoruti tenbaitake tembinatake  and other barbarous names because i thought the dentists in the  states had work enough without my assistance but my chiefs name is  tembinoka pronounced according to the present quite modern habit  in the gilberts tembinok  compare in the margin tengkorootch a  singular new trick setting at defiance all south sea analogy for  nowhere else do they show even the ability far less the will to  end a word upon a consonant  loia is lloyds name ship becomes  shipe teapot tipote etc  our admirable friend herman melville  of whom since i could judge i have thought more than ever had no  ear for languages whatever  his hapar tribe should be hapaa etc  but this is of no interest to you  suffice it you see how i am as  usual up to the neck in projects and really all likely bairns this  time  when will this activity cease  too soon for me i dare to  say  r l s    letter  to james payn    february 4th 1890 ss lubeck  my dear james payn  in virtue of confessions in your last you  would at the present moment if you were along of me be sick and  i will ask you to receive that as an excuse for my hand of write   excuse a plain seaman if he regards with scorn the likes of you  pore landlubbers ashore now  reference to nautical ditty   which i may however be allowed to add that when eight months mail  was laid by my side one evening in apia and my wife and i sat up  the most of the night to peruse the same  precious indisposed we  were next day in consequence  no letter out of so many more  appealed to our hearts than one from the pore stickinthemud  landlubbering common or garden londoner james payn  thank you  for it my wife says cant i see him when we get back to london   i have told her the thing appeared to me within the spear of  practical politix  why cant i spell and write like an honest  sober godfearing litry gent  i think its the motion of the  ship  here i was interrupted to play chess with the chief  engineer as i grow old i prefer the athletic sport of cribbage  of which i am sure i misquote i have just been reading in your  delightful literary recollections  how you skim along you and  andrew lang different as you are and yet the only two who can  keep a fellow smiling every page and ever and again laughing out  loud  i joke wi deeficulty i believe i am not funny and when i  am mrs oliphant says im vulgar and somebody else says in  latin that im a whore which seems harsh and even uncalled for   i shall stick to weepers a 5s weeper 2s 6d laugher 1s  shocker  my dear sir i grow more and more idiotic i cannot even feign  sanity  sometime in the month of june a stalwart weatherbeaten  man evidently of seafaring antecedents shall be observed wending  his way between the athenaeum club and waterloo place  arrived off  no 17 he shall be observed to bring his head sharply to the wind  and tack into the outer haven  captain payn in the harbour   ay ay sir  what ship  barquentin r l s nine hundred and  odd days out from the port of bournemouth homeward bound with  yarns and curiosities  who was it said for gods sake dont speak of it about scott  and his tears  he knew what he was saying  the fear of that hour  is the skeleton in all our cupboards that hour when the pastime  and the livelihood go together and  i am getting hard of hearing  myself a pore young child of forty but new come frae my mammy o  excuse these follies and accept the expression of all my regards   yours affectionately  r l stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    union club sydney march 7th 1890  my dear charles  i did not send off the enclosed before from  laziness having gone quite sick and being a blooming prisoner  here in the club and indeed in my bedroom  i was in receipt of  your letters and your ornamental photo and was delighted to see  how well you looked and how reasonably well i stood    i am  sure i shall never come back home except to die i may do it but  shall always think of the move as suicidal unless a great change  comes over me of which as yet i see no symptom  this visit to  sydney has smashed me handsomely and yet i made myself a prisoner  here in the club upon my first arrival  this is not encouraging  for further ventures sydney winter  or i might almost say  sydney spring for i came when the worst was over  is so small an  affair comparable to our june depression at home in scotland     the pipe is right again it was the springs that had rusted and  ought to have been oiled  its voice is now that of an angel but  lord here in the club i dare not wake it  conceive my impatience  to be in my own backwoods and raise the sound of minstrelsy  what  pleasures are to be compared with those of the unvirtuous virtuoso   yours ever affectionately the unvirtuous virtuoso  robert louis stevenson    letter  to sidney colvin    ss  janet nicoll off upolu spring 1890  my dearest colvin  i was sharply ill at sydney cut off right  out of bed in this steamer on a fresh island cruise and have  already reaped the benefit  we are excellently found this time on  a spacious vessel with an excellent table the captain  supercargo our one fellowpassenger etc very nice and the  charterer mr henderson the very man i could have chosen  the  truth is i fear this life is the only one that suits me so long  as i cruise in the south seas i shall be well and happy  alas  no i do not mean that and absit omen  i mean that so soon as i  cease from cruising the nerves are strained the decline  commences and i steer slowly but surely back to bedward  we left  sydney had a cruel rough passage to auckland for the janet is the  worst roller i was ever aboard of  i was confined to my cabin  ports closed self shied out of the berth stomach pampered till  the day i left on a diet of perpetual eggnogg revolted at ships  food and ship eating in a frowsy bunk clinging with one hand to  the plate with the other to the glass and using the knife and  fork except at intervals with the eyelid  no matter  i picked  up hand over hand  after a day in auckland we set sail again  were blown up in the main cabin with calcium fires as we left the  bay  let no man say i am unscientific  when i ran on the alert  out of my stateroom and found the main cabin incarnadined with the  glow of the last scene of a pantomime i stopped dead  what is  this said i  this ship is on fire i see that but why a  pantomime  and i stood and reasoned the point until my head was  so muddled with the fumes that i could not find the companion  a  few seconds later the captain had to enter crawling on his belly  and took days to recover if he has recovered from the fumes  by  singular good fortune we got the hose down in time and saved the  ship but lloyd lost most of his clothes and a great part of our  photographs was destroyed  fanny saw the native sailors tossing  overboard a blazing trunk she stopped them in time and behold it  contained my manuscripts  thereafter we had three or two days  fine weather  then got into a gale of wind with rain and a  vexatious sea  as we drew into our anchorage in a bight of savage  island a man ashore told me afterwards the sight of the janet  nicoll made him sick and indeed it was rough play though nothing  to the night before  all through this gale i worked four to six  hours per diem spearing the inkbottle like a flying fish and  holding my papers together as i might  for of all things what i  was at was history  the samoan business  and i had to turn from  one to another of these piles of manuscript notes and from one  page to another in each until i should have found employment for  the hands of briareus  all the same this history is a godsend for  a voyage i can put in time getting events coordinated and the  narrative distributed when my muchheaving numskull would be  incapable of finish or fine style  at savage we met the missionary  barque john williams  i tell you it was a great day for savage  island  the path up the cliffs was crowded with gay islandresses  i like that feminine plural who wrapped me in their embraces and  picked my pockets of all my tobacco with a manner which a touch  would have made revolting but as it was was simply charming like  the golden age  one pretty little stalwart minx with a red  flower behind her ear had searched me with extraordinary zeal and  when soon after i missed my matches i accused her she still  following us of being the thief  after some delay and with a  subtle smile she produced the box gave me one match and put the  rest away again  too tired to add more  your most affectionate  r l s    letter  to e l burlingame    ss janet nicoll off peru island kingsmills group july 13th  90  my dear burlingame  i am moved to write to you in the matter of  the end papers  i am somewhat tempted to begin them again  follow  the reasons pro and con  1st  i must say i feel as if something in the nature of the end  paper were a desirable finish to the number and that the  substitutes of occasional essays by occasional contributors somehow  fail to fill the bill  should you differ with me on this point no  more is to be said  and what follows must be regarded as lost  words  2nd  i am rather taken with the idea of continuing the work  for  instance should you have no distaste for papers of the class  called random memories i should enjoy continuing them of course  at intervals and when they were done i have an idea they might  make a readable book  on the other hand i believe a greater  freedom of choice might be taken the subjects more varied and more  briefly treated in somewhat approaching the manner of andrew lang  in the sign of the ship it being well understood that the broken  sticks method is one not very suitable as colonel burke would say  to my genius and not very likely to be pushed far in my practice   upon this point i wish you to condense your massive brain  in the  last lot i was promised and i fondly expected to receive a vast  amount of assistance from intelligent and genial correspondents  i  assure you i never had a scratch of a pen from any one above the  level of a village idiot except once when a lady sowed my head  full of grey hairs by announcing that she was going to direct her  life in future by my counsels  will the correspondents be more  copious and less irrelevant in the future  suppose that to be the  case will they be of any use to me in my place of exile  is it  possible for a man in samoa to be in touch with the great heart of  the people  and is it not perhaps a mere folly to attempt from so  hopeless a distance anything so delicate as a series of papers   upon these points perpend and give me the results of your  perpensions  3rd  the emolument would be agreeable to your humble servant  i have now stated all the pros and the most of the cons are come  in by the way  there follows however one immense con with a  capital c which i beg you to consider particularly  i fear  that to be of any use for your magazine these papers should begin  with the beginning of a volume  even supposing my hands were free  this would be now impossible for next year  you have to consider  whether supposing you have no other objection it would be worth  while to begin the series in the middle of a volume or desirable  to delay the whole matter until the beginning of another year  now supposing that the cons have it and you refuse my offer let  me make another proposal which you will be very inclined to refuse  at the first offgo but which i really believe might in time come  to something  you know how the penny papers have their answers to  correspondents  why not do something of the same kind for the  culchawed  why not get men like stimson brownell professor  james goldwin smith and others who will occur to you more readily  than to me to put and to answer a series of questions of  intellectual and general interest until at last you should have  established a certain standard of matter to be discussed in this  part of the magazine  i want you to get me bound volumes of the magazine from its start   the lord knows i have had enough copies where they are i know not   a wandering author gathers no magazines  the wrecker is in no forrader state than in last reports  i have  indeed got to a period when i cannot well go on until i can refresh  myself on the proofs of the beginning  my respected collaborator  who handles the machine which is now addressing you has indeed  carried his labours farther but not i am led to understand with  what we used to call a blessing at least i have been refused a  sight of his latest labours  however there is plenty of time  ahead and i feel no anxiety about the tale except that it may  meet with your approval  all this voyage i have been busy over my travels which given a  very high temperature and the saloon of a steamer usually going  before the wind and with the cabins in front of the engines has  come very near to prostrating me altogether  you will therefore  understand that there are no more poems  i wonder whether there  are already enough and whether you think that such a volume would  be worth the publishing  i shall hope to find in sydney some  expression of your opinion on this point  living as i do among   not the most cultured of mankind splendidly educated and perfect  gentlemen when sober  i attach a growing importance to friendly  criticisms from yourself  i believe that this is the most of our business  as for my health  i got over my cold in a fine style but have not been very well of  late  to my unaffected annoyance the bloodspitting has started  again  i find the heat of a steamer decidedly wearing and trying  in these latitudes and i am inclined to think the superior  expedition rather dearly paid for  still the fact that one does  not even remark the coming of a squall nor feel relief on its  departure is a mercy not to be acknowledged without gratitude   the rest of the family seem to be doing fairly well both seem less  run down than they were on the equator and mrs stevenson very  much less so  we have now been three months away have visited  about thirtyfive islands many of which were novel to us and some  extremely entertaining some also were old acquaintances and  pleasant to revisit  in the meantime we have really a capital  time aboard ship in the most pleasant and interesting society and  with considering the length and nature of the voyage an excellent  table  please remember us all to mr scribner the young chieftain  of the house and the lady whose health i trust is better  to  mrs burlingame we all desire to be remembered and i hope you will  give our news to low st gaudens faxon and others of the  faithful in the city  i shall probably return to samoa direct  having given up all idea of returning to civilisation in the  meanwhile  there on my ancestral acres which i purchased six  months ago from a blind scots blacksmith you will please address  me until further notice  the name of the ancestral acres is going  to be vailima but as at the present moment nobody else knows the  name except myself and the copatentees it will be safer if less  ambitious to address r l s apia samoa  the ancestral acres  run to upwards of three hundred they enjoy the ministrations of  five streams whence the name  they are all at the present moment  under a trackless covering of magnificent forest which would be  worth a great deal if it grew beside a railway terminus  to me as  it stands it represents a handsome deficit  obliging natives from  the cannibal islands are now cutting it down at my expense  you  would be able to run your magazine to much greater advantage if the  terms of authors were on the same scale with those of my cannibals   we have also a house about the size of a manufacturers lodge   tis but the egg of the future palace over the details of which on  paper mrs stevenson and i have already shed real tears what it  will be when it comes to paying for it i leave you to imagine   but if it can only be built as now intended it will be with  genuine satisfaction and a growunded pride that i shall welcome you  at the steps of my old colonial home when you land from the  steamer on a longmerited holiday  i speak much at my ease yet i  do not know i may be now an outlaw a bankrupt the abhorred of  all good men  i do not know you probably do  has hyde turned  upon me  have i fallen like danvers carew  it is suggested to me that you might like to know what will be my  future society  three consuls all at loggerheads with one  another or at the best in a clique of two against one three  different sects of missionaries not upon the best of terms and  the catholics and protestants in a condition of unhealable ill feeling as to whether a wooden drum ought or ought not to be beaten  to announce the time of school  the native population very  genteel very songful very agreeable very goodlooking  chronically spoiling for a fight a circumstance not to be entirely  neglected in the design of the palace  as for the white  population of technically the beach i dont suppose it is  possible for any person not thoroughly conversant with the south  seas to form the smallest conception of such a society with its  grogshops its apparently unemployed hangerson its merchants of  all degrees of respectability and the reverse  the paper of which  i must really send you a copy  if yours were really a live  magazine you would have an exchange with the editor  i assure  you it has of late contained a great deal of matter about one of  your contributors  rejoices in the name of samoa times and south  sea advertiser  the advertisements in the advertiser are  permanent being simply subsidies for its existence  a dashing  warfare of newspaper correspondence goes on between the various  residents who are rather fond of recurring to one anothers  antecedents  but when all is said there are a lot of very nice  pleasant people and i dont know that apia is very much worse than  half a hundred towns that i could name  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    hotel sebastopol noumea august 1890  my dear charles  i have stayed here a week while lloyd and my  wife continue to voyage in the janet nicoll this i did partly to  see the convict system partly to shorten my stay in the extreme  cold  hear me with my extreme moi qui suis originaire dedinbourg   of sydney at this season  i am feeling very seedy utterly  fatigued and overborne with sleep  i have a fine old gentleman of  a doctor who attends and cheers and entertains if he does not  cure me but even with his ministrations i am almost incapable of  the exertion sufficient for this letter and i am really as i  write falling down with sleep  what is necessary to say i must  try to say shortly  lloyd goes to clear out our establishments   pray keep him in funds if i have any if i have not pray try to  raise them  here is the idea  to install ourselves at the risk  of bankruptcy in samoa  it is not the least likely it will pay  although it may but it is almost certain it will support life  with very few external expenses  if i die it will be an endowment  for the survivors at least for my wife and lloyd and my mother  who might prefer to go home has her own  hence i believe i shall  do well to hurry my installation  the letters are already in part  done in part done is a novel for scribner in the course of the  next twelve months i should receive a considerable amount of money   i am aware i had intended to pay back to my capital some of this   i am now of opinion i should act foolishly  better to build the  house and have a roof and farm of my own and thereafter with a  livelihood assured save and repay     there is my livelihood  all but books and wine ready in a nutshell and it ought to be  more easy to save and to repay afterwards  excellent say you but  will you save and will you repay  i do not know said the bell of  old bow    it seems clear to me    the deuce of the affair  is that i do not know when i shall see you and colvin  i guess you  will have to come and see me  many a time already we have arranged  the details of your visit in the yet unbuilt house on the mountain   i shall be able to get decent wine from noumea  we shall be able  to give you a decent welcome and talk of old days  apropos of old  days do you remember still the phrase we heard in waterloo place   i believe you made a piece for the piano on that phrase  pray if  you remember it send it me in your next  if you find it  impossible to write correctly send it me a la recitative and  indicate the accents  do you feel you must how strangely heavy  and stupid i am  i must at last give up and go sleep i am simply  a rag  the morrow  i feel better but still dim and groggy  tonight i  go to the governors such a lark  no dress clothes  twentyfour  hours notice  ablebodied polish tailor  suit made for a man  with the figure of a puncheon  same hastily altered for self with  the figure of a bodkin  sight inconceivable  never mind dress  clothes which nobody can deny and the officials have been all  so civil that i liked neither to refuse nor to appear in mufti   bad dress clothes only prove you are a grisly ass no dress  clothes even when explained indicate a want of respect  i wish  you were here with me to help me dress in this wild raiment and to  accompany me to m noelpardons  i cannot say what i would give  if there came a knock now at the door and you came in  i guess  noelpardon would go begging and we might burn the fr 200 dress  clothes in the back garden for a bonfire or what would be yet more  expensive and more humorous get them once more expanded to fit  you and when that was done a second time cut down for my gossamer  dimensions  i hope you never forget to remember me to your father who has  always a place in my heart as i hope i have a little in his  his  kindness helped me infinitely when you and i were young i recall  it with gratitude and affection in this town of convicts at the  worlds end  there are very few things my dear charles worth  mention  on a retrospect of life the days flash and colour one  day with another flames dazzles and puts to sleep and when the  days are gone like a fastflying thaumatrope they make but a  single pattern  only a few things stand out and among these   most plainly to me  rutland square  ever my dear charles your  affectionate friend  robert louis stevenson  ps  just returned from trying on the dress clo  lord you  should see the coat  it stands out at the waist like a bustle the  flaps cross in front the sleeves are like bags    letter  to e l burlingame    union club sydney august 1890  my dear burlingame  ballads  the deuce is in this volume  it has cost me more botheration and  dubiety than any other i ever took in hand  on one thing my mind  is made up  the verses at the end have no business there and  throw them down  many of them are bad many of the rest want nine  years keeping and the remainder are not relevant  throw them  down some i never want to hear of more others will grow in time  towards decent items in a second underwoods  and in the meanwhile  down with them  at the same time i have a sneaking idea the  ballads are not altogether without merit  i dont know if theyre  poetry but theyre good narrative or im deceived  youve never  said one word about them from which i astutely gather you are dead  set against  he was a diplomatic man  extract from epitaph of  e l b  and remained on good terms with minor poets  you  will have to judge  one of the gladstonian trinity of paths must  be chosen  1st either publish the five ballads such as they  are in a volume called ballads in which case pray send sheets at  once to chatto and windus  or 2nd write and tell me you think  the book too small and ill try and get into the mood to do some  more  or 3rd write and tell me the whole thing is a blooming  illusion in which case draw off some twenty copies for my private  entertainment and charge me with the expense of the whole dream  in the matter of rhyme no man can judge himself i am at the  worlds end have no one to consult and my publisher holds his  tongue  i call it unfair and almost unmanly  i do indeed begin to  be filled with animosity lord wait till you see the continuation  of the wrecker when i introduce some new york publishers   its  a good scene the quantities you drink and the really hideous  language you are represented as employing may perhaps cause you one  tithe of the pain you have inflicted by your silence on sir the  poetaster  r l s  lloyd is off home my wife and i dwell sundered  she in lodgings  preparing for the move i here in the club and at my old trade   bedridden  naturally the visit home is given up we only wait our  opportunity to get to samoa where please address me  have i yet asked you to despatch the books and papers left in your  care to me at apia samoa  i wish you would quam primum  r l s    letter  to henry james    union club sydney august 1890  my dear henry james  kipling is too clever to live  the bete  humaine i had already perused in noumea listening the while to the  strains of the convict band  he a beast but not human and to be  frank not very interesting  nervous maladies  the homicidal  ward would be the better name  o this game gets very tedious  your two long and kind letters have helped to entertain the old  familiar sickbed  so has a book called the bondman by hall caine  i wish you would look at it  i am not halfway through yet  read  the book and communicate your views  hall caine by the way  appears to take hugos view of history and chronology  later the  book doesnt keep up it gets very wild  i must tell you plainly  i cant tell colvin  i do not think i  shall come to england more than once and then itll be to die   health i enjoy in the tropics even here which they call sub or  semitropical i come only to catch cold  i have not been out  since my arrival live here in a nice bedroom by the fireside and  read books and letters from henry james and send out to get his  tragic muse only to be told they cant be had as yet in sydney  and have altogether a placid time  but i cant go out  the  thermometer was nearly down to 50 degrees the other day  no  temperature for me mr james  how should i do in england  i fear  not at all  am i very sorry  i am sorry about seven or eight  people in england and one or two in the states  and outside of  that i simply prefer samoa  these are the words of honesty and  soberness  i am fasting from all but sin coughing the bondman  a couple of eggs and a cup of tea  i was never fond of towns  houses society or it seems civilisation  nor yet it seems was  i ever very fond of what is technically called gods green earth   the sea islands the islanders the island life and climate make  and keep me truly happier  these last two years i have been much  at sea and i have never wearied sometimes i have indeed grown  impatient for some destination more often i was sorry that the  voyage drew so early to an end and never once did i lose my  fidelity to blue water and a ship  it is plain then that for me  my exile to the place of schooners and islands can be in no sense  regarded as a calamity  goodbye just now  i must take a turn at my proofs  nb  even my wife has weakened about the sea  she wearied the  last time we were ashore to get afloat again  yours ever  r l s    letter  to marcel schwob    union club sydney august 19th 1890  my dear mr schwob  mais alors vous avez tous les bonheurs  vous  more about villon it seems incredible  when it is put in  order pray send it me  you wish to translate the black arrow  dear sir you are hereby  authorised but i warn you i do not like the work  ah if you  who know so well both tongues and have taste and instruction  if  you would but take a fancy to translate a book of mine that i  myself admired  for we sometimes admire our own  or i do  with  what satisfaction would the authority be granted  but these things  are too much to expect  vous ne detestez pas alors mes bonnes  femmes moi je les deteste  i have never pleased myself with any  women of mine save two character parts one of only a few lines   the countess of rosen and madame desprez in the treasure of  franchard  i had indeed one moment of pride about my poor black arrow  dickon  crookback i did and i do think is a spirited and possible figure   shakespeares  o if we can call that cocoon shakespeare   shakespeares is spirited  one likes to see the untaught athlete  butting against the adamantine ramparts of human nature head down  breach up it reminds us how trivial we are today and what safety  resides in our triviality  for spirited it may be but o sure not  possible  i love dumas and i love shakespeare  you will not  mistake me when i say that the richard of the one reminds me of the  porthos of the other and if by any sacrifice of my own literary  baggage i could clear the vicomte de bragelonne of porthos jekyll  might go and the master and the black arrow you may be sure and  i should think my life not lost for mankind if half a dozen more of  my volumes must be thrown in  the tone of your pleasant letters makes me egotistical you make me  take myself too gravely  comprehend how i have lived much of my  time in france and loved your country and many of its people and  all the time was learning that which your country has to teach   breathing in rather that atmosphere of art which can only there be  breathed and all the time knew  and raged to know  that i might  write with the pen of angels or of heroes and no frenchman be the  least the wiser  and now steps in m marcel schwob writes me the  most kind encouragement and reads and understands and is kind  enough to like my work  i am just now overloaded with work  i have two huge novels on hand   the wrecker and the pearl fisher in collaboration with my  stepson  the latter the pearl fisher i think highly of for a  black ugly trampling violent story full of strange scenes and  striking characters  and then i am about waistdeep in my big book  on the south seas  the big book on the south seas it ought to be  and shall  and besides i have some verses in the press which  however i hesitate to publish  for i am no judge of my own verse  selfdeception is there so facile  all this and the cares of an  impending settlement in samoa keep me very busy and a cold as  usual keeps me in bed  alas i shall not have the pleasure to see you yet awhile if ever   you must be content to take me as a wandering voice and in the  form of occasional letters from recondite islands and address me  if you will be good enough to write to apia samoa  my stepson  mr osbourne goes home meanwhile to arrange some affairs it is  not unlikely he may go to paris to arrange about the illustrations  to my south seas in which case i shall ask him to call upon you  and give you some word of our outlandish destinies  you will find  him intelligent i think and i am sure if par hasard you should  take any interest in the islands he will have much to tell you   herewith i conclude and am your obliged and interested  correspondent  robert louis stevenson  ps  the story you refer to has got lost in the post    letter  to andrew lang    union club sydney august 1890  my dear lang  i observed with a great deal of surprise and  interest that a controversy in which you have been taking sides at  home in yellow london hinges in part at least on the gilbert  islanders and their customs in burial  nearly six months of my  life has been passed in the group  i have revisited it but the  other day and i make haste to tell you what i know  the upright  stones  i enclose you a photograph of one on apemama  are  certainly connected with religion i do not think they are adored   they stand usually on the windward shore of the islands that is to  say apart from habitation on enclosed islands where the people  live on the sea side i do not know how it is never having lived  on one  i gathered from tembinoka rex apemamae that the pillars  were supposed to fortify the island from invasion  spiritual  martellos  i think he indicated they were connected with the cult  of tenti  pronounce almost as chintz in english the t being  explosive but you must take this with a grain of salt for i knew  no word of gilbert island and the kings english although  creditable is rather vigorous than exact  now here follows the  point of interest to you  such pillars or standing stones have  no connection with graves  the most elaborate grave that i have  ever seen in the group  to be certain  is in the form of a raised  border of gravel usually strewn with broken glass  one of which  i cannot be sure that it was a grave for i was told by one that it  was and by another that it was not  consisted of a mound about  breast high in an excavated taro swamp on the top of which was a  childs house or rather maniapa  that is to say shed or open  house such as is used in the group for social or political  gatherings  so small that only a child could creep under its  eaves  i have heard of another great tomb on apemama which i did  not see but here again by all accounts no sign of a standing  stone  my report would be  no connection between standing stones  and sepulture  i shall however send on the terms of the problem  to a highly intelligent resident trader who knows more than  perhaps any one living white or native of the gilbert group and  you shall have the result  in samoa whither i return for good i  shall myself make inquiries up to now i have neither seen nor  heard of any standing stones in that group  yours  r l stevenson    letter  to mrs charles fairchild    union club sydney september 1890  my dear mrs fairchild  i began a letter to you on board the  janet nicoll on my last cruise wrote i believe two sheets and  ruthlessly destroyed the flippant trash  your last has given me  great pleasure and some pain for it increased the consciousness of  my neglect  now this must go to you whatever it is like     you are quite right our civilisation is a hollow fraud all  the fun of life is lost by it all it gains is that a larger number  of persons can continue to be contemporaneously unhappy on the  surface of the globe  o unhappy  there is a big word and a  false  continue to be not nearly  by about twenty per cent  so  happy as they might be  that would be nearer the mark  when  observe that word which i will write again and larger   when you come to see us in samoa you will see for yourself a  healthy and happy people  you see you are one of the very few of our friends rich enough to  come and see us and when my house is built and the road is made  and we have enough fruit planted and poultry and pigs raised it is  undeniable that you must come  must is the word that is the way  in which i speak to ladies  you and fairchild anyway  perhaps my  friend blair  well arrange details in good time  it will be the  salvation of your souls and make you willing to die  let me tell you this  in 74 or 5 there came to stay with my  father and mother a certain mr seed a prime minister or something  of new zealand  he spotted what my complaint was told me that i  had no business to stay in europe that i should find all i cared  for and all that was good for me in the navigator islands sat up  till four in the morning persuading me demolishing my scruples   and i resisted  i refused to go so far from my father and mother   o it was virtuous and o wasnt it silly  but my father who was  always my dearest got to his grave without that pang and now in  1890 i or what is left of me go at last to the navigator  islands  god go with us  it is but a pisgah sight when all is  said i go there only to grow old and die but when you come you  will see it is a fair place for the purpose  flaubert has not turned up i hope he will soon i knew of him only  through maxime descamps  with kindest messages to yourself and  all of yours i remain  robert louis stevenson     chapter xi  life in samoa november 1890december 1892     letter  to e l burlingame    vailima apia samoa nov 7 1890  i wish you to add to the words at the end of the prologue they  run i think thus and this is the yarn of loudon dodd add  not as he told but as he wrote it afterwards for his diversion   this becomes the more needful because when all is done i shall  probably revert to taiohae and give final details about the  characters in the way of a conversation between dodd and havers   these little snippets of information and faitsdivers have always a  disjointed brokenbacked appearance yet readers like them  in  this book we have introduced so many characters that this kind of  epilogue will be looked for and i rather hope looking far ahead  that i can lighten it in dialogue  we are well past the middle now  how does it strike you and can  you guess my mystery  it will make a fattish volume  i say have you ever read the highland widow  i never had till  yesterday  i am half inclined bar a trip or two to think it  scotts masterpiece and it has the name of a failure  strange  things are readers  i expect proofs and revises in duplicate  we have now got into a small barrack at our place  we see the sea  six hundred feet below filling the end of two vales of forest  on  one hand the mountain runs above us some thousand feet higher  great trees stand round us in our clearing there is an endless  voice of birds i have never lived in such a heaven just now i  have fever which mitigates but not destroys my gusto in my  circumstances  you may envy  robert louis stevenson     o i dont know if i mentioned that having seen your new tail  to the magazine i cried off interference at least for this trip   did i ask you to send me my books and papers and all the bound  volumes of the mag quorum pars  i might add that were there a  good book or so  new  i dont believe there is  such would be  welcome  i desire  i positively begin to awake  to be remembered to  scribner low st gaudens russell sullivan  well well you  fellows have the feast of reason and the flow of soul i have a  betterlooking place and climate  you should hear the birds on the  hill now  the day has just wound up with a shower it is still  light without though i write within here at the cheek of a lamp  my wife and an invaluable german are wrestling about bread on the  back verandah and how the birds and the frogs are rattling and  piping and hailing from the woods  here and there a throaty  chuckle here and there cries like those of jolly children who  have lost their way here and there the ringing sleighbell of the  tree frog  out and away down below me on the sea it is still  raining it will be wet under foot on schooners and the house will  leak how well i know that  here the showers only patter on the  iron roof and sometimes roar and within the lamp burns steady on  the tafacovered walls with their dusky tartan patterns and the  bookshelves with their thin array of books and no squall can rout  my house or bring my heart into my mouth  the wellpleased south  sea islander  r l s    letter  to e l burlingame    vailima december 1890  my dear burlingame  by some diabolical accident i have mislaid  your last  what was in it  i know not and here i am caught  unexpectedly by the american mail a week earlier than by  computation  the computation not the mail is supposed to be in  error  the vols of scribners have arrived and present a noble  appearance in my house which is not a noble structure at present   but by autumn we hope to be sprawling in our verandah twelve feet  sir by eightyeight in front and seventytwo on the flank view  of the sea and mountains sunrise moonrise and the german fleet  at anchor three miles away in apia harbour  i hope some day to  offer you a bowl of kava there or a slice of a pineapple or some  lemonade from my own hedge  i know a hedge where the lemons grow   shakespeare  my house at this moment smells of them strong and  the rain which a while ago roared there now rings in minute drops  upon the iron roof  i have no wrecker for you this mail other  things having engaged me  i was on the whole rather relieved you  did not vote for regular papers as i feared the traces  it is my  design from time to time to write a paper of a reminiscential  beastly word description some of them i could scarce publish  from different considerations but some of them  for instance my  long experience of gambling places  homburg wiesbaden baden baden old monaco and new monte carlo  would make good magazine  padding if i got the stuff handled the right way  i never could  fathom why verse was put in magazines it has something to do with  the makingup has it not  i am scribbling a lot just now if you  are taken badly that way apply to the south seas  i could send  you some i believe anyway only none of it is thoroughly ripe   if kept back the volume of ballads ill soon make it a respectable  size if this fit continue  by the next mail you may expect some  more wrecker or i shall be displeased  probably no more than a  chapter however for it is a hard one and i am denuded of my  proofs my collaborator having walked away with them to england  hence some trouble in catching the just note  i am a mere farmer  my talk which would scarce interest you on  broadway is all of fuafua and tuitui and black boys and planting  and weeding and axes and cutlasses my hands are covered with  blisters and full of thorns letters are doubtless a fine thing  so are beer and skittles but give me farmering in the tropics for  real interest  life goes in enchantment i come home to find i am  late for dinner and when i go to bed at night i could cry for the  weariness of my loins and thighs  do not speak to me of vexation  the life brims with it but with living interest fairly  christmas i go to auckland to meet tamate the new guinea  missionary a man i love  the rest of my life is a prospect of  much rain much weeding and making of paths a little letters and  devilish little to eat  i am my dear burlingame with messages  to all whom it may concern very sincerely yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to henry james    vailima apia samoa december 29th 1890  my dear henry james  it is terrible how little everybody writes  and how much of that little disappears in the capacious maw of the  post office  many letters both from and to me i now know to have  been lost in transit  my eye is on the sydney post office a large  ungainly structure with a tower as being not a hundred miles from  the scene of disappearance but then i have no proof  the tragic  muse you announced to me as coming i had already ordered it from a  sydney bookseller  about two months ago he advised me that his  copy was in the post and i am still tragically museless  news news news  what do we know of yours  what do you care for  ours  we are in the midst of the rainy season and dwell among  alarms of hurricanes in a very unsafe little twostoried wooden  box 650 feet above and about three miles from the seabeach   behind us till the other slope of the island desert forest  peaks and loud torrents in front green slopes to the sea some  fifty miles of which we dominate  we see the ships as they go out  and in to the dangerous roadstead of apia and if they lie far out  we can even see their topmasts while they are at anchor  of sounds  of men beyond those of our own labourers there reach us at very  long intervals salutes from the warships in harbour the bell of  the cathedral church and the low of the conchshell calling the  labour boys on the german plantations  yesterday which was sunday   the quantieme is most likely erroneous you can now correct it   we had a visitor  baker of tonga  heard you ever of him  he is a  great man here  he is accused of theft rape judicial murder  private poisoning abortion misappropriation of public moneys   oddly enough not forgery nor arson  you would be amused if you  knew how thick the accusations fly in this south sea world  i make  no doubt my own character is something illustrious or if not yet  there is a good time coming  but all our resources have not of late been pacific  we have had  enlightened society  la farge the painter and your friend henry  adams  a great privilege  would it might endure  i would go  oftener to see them but the place is awkward to reach on  horseback  i had to swim my horse the last time i went to dinner  and as i have not yet returned the clothes i had to borrow i dare  not return in the same plight  it seems inevitable  as soon as  the wash comes in i plump straight into the american consuls  shirt or trousers  they i believe would come oftener to see me  but for the horrid doubt that weighs upon our commissariat  department we have often almost nothing to eat a guest would  simply break the bank my wife and i have dined on one avocado  pear i have several times dined on hard bread and onions  what  would you do with a guest at such narrow seasons  eat him or  serve up a labour boy fricasseed  work work is now arrested but i have written i should think  about thirty chapters of the south sea book they will all want  rehandling i dare say  gracious what a strain is a long book   the time it took me to design this volume before i could dream of  putting pen to paper was excessive and then think of writing a  book of travels on the spot when i am continually extending my  information revising my opinions and seeing the most finely  finished portions of my work come part by part in pieces  very  soon i shall have no opinions left  and without an opinion how to  string artistically vast accumulations of fact  darwin said no one  could observe without a theory i suppose he was right tis a fine  point of metaphysic but i will take my oath no man can write  without one  at least the way he would like to and my theories  melt melt melt and as they melt the thawwaters wash down my  writing and leave unideal tracts  wastes instead of cultivated  farms  kipling is by far the most promising young man who has appeared  since  ahem  i appeared  he amazes me by his precocity and  various endowment  but he alarms me by his copiousness and haste   he should shield his fire with both hands and draw up all his  strength and sweetness in one ball  draw all his strength and  all his sweetness up into one ball  i cannot remember marvells  words  so the critics have been saying to me but i was never  capable of  and surely never guilty of  such a debauch of  production  at this rate his works will soon fill the habitable  globe and surely he was armed for better conflicts than these  succinct sketches and flying leaves of verse  i look on i admire  i rejoice for myself but in a kind of ambition we all have for our  tongue and literature i am wounded  if i had this mans fertility  and courage it seems to me i could heave a pyramid  well we begin to be the old fogies now and it was high time  something rose to take our places  certainly kipling has the  gifts the fairy godmothers were all tipsy at his christening   what will he do with them  goodbye my dear james find an hour to write to us and register  your letter  yours affectionately  r l s    letter  to rudyard kipling    vailima 1891  sir  i cannot call to mind having written you but i am so throng  with occupation this may have fallen aside  i never heard tell i  had any friends in ireland and i am led to understand you are come  of no considerable family  the gentleman i now serve with assures  me however you are a very pretty fellow and your letter deserves  to be remarked  its true he is himself a man of a very low  descent upon the one side though upon the other he counts  cousinship with a gentleman my very good friend the late mr  balfour of the shaws in the lothian which i should be wanting in  good fellowship to forget  he tells me besides you are a man of  your hands i am not informed of your weapon but if all be true it  sticks in my mind i would be ready to make exception in your  favour and meet you like one gentleman with another  i suppose  thisll be your purpose in your favour which i could very ill make  out its one i would be sweir to baulk you of  it seems mr  mcilvaine which i take to be your name you are in the household  of a gentleman of the name of coupling  for whom my friend is very  much engaged  the distances being very uncommodious i think it  will be maybe better if we leave it to these two to settle all  thats necessary to honour  i would have you to take heed its a  very unusual condescension on my part that bear a kings name and  for the matter of that i think shame to be mingled with a person of  the name of coupling which is doubtless a very good house but one  i never heard tell of any more than stevenson  but your purpose  being laudable i would be sorry as the word goes to cut off my  nose to spite my face  i am sir your humble servant  a stewart chevalier de st louis  to mr milvaine gentleman private in a foot regiment under cover to mr coupling  he has read me some of your barrack room ballants which are not of  so noble a strain as some of mine in the gaelic but i could set  some of them to the pipes if this rencounter goes as its to be  desired  lets first as i understand you to move do each other  this rational courtesys and if either will survive we may grow  better acquaint  for your tastes for whats martial and for poetry  agree with mine  a s    letter  to marcel schwob    sydney january 19th 1891  my dear sir  sapristi comme vous y allez  richard iii and  dumas with all my heart but not hamlet  hamlet is great  literature richard iii a big black gross sprawling melodrama  writ with infinite spirit but with no refinement or philosophy by a  man who had the world himself mankind and his trade still to  learn  i prefer the vicomte de bragelonne to richard iii it is  better done of its kind  i simply do not mention the vicomte in  the same part of the building with hamlet or lear or othello or  any of those masterpieces that shakespeare survived to give us  also comme vous y allez in my commendation  i fear my solide  education classique had best be described like shakespeares as  little latin and no greek and i was educated let me inform you  for an engineer  i shall tell my bookseller to send you a copy of  memories and portraits where you will see something of my descent  and education as it was and hear me at length on my dear vicomte   i give you permission gladly to take your choice out of my works  and translate what you shall prefer too much honoured that so  clever a young man should think it worth the pains  my own choice  would lie between kidnapped and the master of ballantrae  should  you choose the latter pray do not let mrs henry thrust the sword  up to the hilt in the frozen ground  one of my inconceivable  blunders an exaggeration to stagger hugo  say she sought to  thrust it in the ground  in both these works you should be  prepared for scotticisms used deliberately  i fear my stepson will not have found time to get to paris he was  overwhelmed with occupation and is already on his voyage back  we  live here in a beautiful land amid a beautiful and interesting  people  the life is still very hard  my wife and i live in a two roomed cottage about three miles and six hundred and fifty feet  above the sea we have had to make the road to it our supplies are  very imperfect in the wild weather of this the hurricane season  we have much discomfort  one night the wind blew in our house so  outrageously that we must sit in the dark and as the sound of the  rain on the roof made speech inaudible you may imagine we found  the evening long  all these things however are pleasant to me   you say lartiste inconscient set off to travel  you do not divide  me right  06 of me is artist 04 adventurer  first i suppose  come letters then adventure and since i have indulged the second  part i think the formula begins to change  055 of an artist  045 of the adventurer were nearer true  and if it had not been  for my small strength i might have been a different man in all  things  whatever you do do not neglect to send me what you publish on  villon  i look forward to that with lively interest  i have no  photograph at hand but i will send one when i can  it would be  kind if you would do the like for i do not see much chance of our  meeting in the flesh  and a name and a handwriting and an  address and even a style  i know about as much of tacitus and  more of horace it is not enough between contemporaries such as we  still are  i have just remembered another of my books which i re read the other day and thought in places good  prince otto  it  is not as good as either of the others but it has one  recommendation  it has female parts so it might perhaps please  better in france  i will ask chatto to send you then  prince otto memories and  portraits underwoods and ballads none of which you seem to have  seen  they will be too late for the new year  let them be an  easter present  you must translate me soon you will soon have better to do than to  transverse the work of others  yours very truly  robert louis stevenson  with the worst pen in the south pacific    letter  to charles baxter    ss lubeck at sea on the return voyage from sydney march  1891  my dear charles  perhaps in my old days i do grow irascible the  old man virulent has long been my pet name for myself  well the  temper is at least all gone now time is good at lowering these  distemperatures far better is a sharp sickness and i am just and  scarce afoot again after a smoking hot little malady at sydney   and the temper being gone i still think the same     we have  not our parents for ever we are never very good to them when they  go and we have lost our frontfile man we begin to feel all our  neglects mighty sensibly  i propose a proposal  my mother is here  on board with me today for once i mean to make her as happy as i  am able and to do that which i know she likes  you on the other  hand go and see your father and do ditto and give him a real  good hour or two  we shall both be glad hereafter  yours ever  r l s    letter  to h b baildon    vailima upolu undated but written in 1891  my dear baildon  this is a real disappointment  it was so long  since we had met i was anxious to see where time had carried and  stranded us  last time we saw each other  it must have been all  ten years ago as we were new to the thirties  it was only for a  moment and now were in the forties and before very long we shall  be in our graves  sick and well i have had a splendid life of it  grudge nothing regret very little  and then only some little  corners of misconduct for which i deserve hanging and must  infallibly be damned  and take it all over damnation and all  would hardly change with any man of my time unless perhaps it were  gordon or our friend chalmers  a man i admire for his virtues  love for his faults and envy for the really a1 life he has with  everything heart  my heart i mean  could wish  it is curious to  think you will read this in the grey metropolis go the first grey  eastwindy day into the caledonian station if it looks at all as  it did of yore  i met satan there  and then go and stand by the  cross and remember the other one  him that went down  my  brother robert fergusson  it is a pity you had not made me out  and seen me as patriarch and planter  i shall look forward to some  record of your time with chalmers  you cant weary me of that  fellow he is as big as a house and far bigger than any church  where no man warms his hands  do you know anything of thomson  of  a b c d e f at all  as i write cs name mustard rises  my nose i have never forgiven that weak amiable boy a little  trick he played me when i could ill afford it  i mean that  whenever i think of it some of the old wrath kindles not that i  would hurt the poor soul if i got the world with it  and old x   is he still afloat  harmless bark  i gather you aint married  yet since your sister to whom i ask to be remembered goes with  you  did you see a silly tale john nicholsons predicament or  some such name in which i made free with your home at murrayfield   there is precious little sense in it but it might amuse   cassells published it in a thing called yuletide years ago and  nobody that ever i heard of read or has ever seen yuletide  it is  addressed to a class we never met  readers of cassells series and  that class of conscientious chaff and my tale was dull though i  dont recall that it was conscientious  only theres the house at  murrayfield and a dead body in it  glad the ballads amused you   they failed to entertain a coy public at which i wondered not  that i set much account by my verses which are the verses of  prosator but i do know how to tell a yarn and two of the yarns  are great  rahero is for its length a perfect folktale  savage  and yet fine full of tailforemost morality ancient as the granite  rocks if the historian not to say the politician could get that  yarn into his head he would have learned some of his a b c but  the average man at home cannot understand antiquity he is sunk  over the ears in roman civilisation and a tale like that of rahero  falls on his ears inarticulate  the spectator said there was no  psychology in it that interested me much  my grandmother as i  used to call that able paper and an able paper it is and a fair  one cannot so much as observe the existence of savage psychology  when it is put before it  i am at bottom a psychologist and  ashamed of it the tale seized me onethird because of its  picturesque features twothirds because of its astonishing  psychology and the spectator says theres none  i am going on  with a lot of island work exulting in the knowledge of a new  world a new created world and new men and i am sure my income  will decline and fall off for the effort of comprehension is death  to the intelligent public and sickness to the dull  i do not know why i pester you with all this trash above all as  you deserve nothing  i give you my warm talofa my love to you  samoan salutation  write me again when the spirit moves you  and  some day if i still live make out the trip again and let us hob anob with our grey pows on my verandah  yours sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w craibe angus    vailima samoa april 1891  dear mr angus  surely i remember you  it was w c murray who  made us acquainted and we had a pleasant crack  i see your poet  is not yet dead  i remember even our talk  or you would not think  of trusting that invaluable jolly beggars to the treacherous posts  and the perils of the sea and the carelessness of authors  i love  the idea but i could not bear the risk  however    hale be your heart hale be your fiddle      it was kindly thought upon  my interest in burns is as you suppose perennial  i would i  could be present at the exhibition with the purpose of which i  heartily sympathise but the nancy has not waited in vain for me i  have followed my chest the anchor is weighed long ago i have said  my last farewell to the hills and the heather and the lynns  like  leyden i have gone into far lands to die not stayed like burns to  mingle in the end with scottish soil  i shall not even return like  scott for the last scene  burns exhibitions are all over  tis a  far cry to lochow from tropical vailima   but still our hearts are true our hearts are highland and we in dreams behold the hebrides   when your hand is in will you remember our poor edinburgh robin   burns alone has been just to his promise follow burns he knew  best he knew whence he drew fire  from the poor whitefaced  drunken vicious boy that raved himself to death in the edinburgh  madhouse  surely there is more to be gleaned about fergusson and  surely it is high time the task was set about  i way tell you  because your poet is not dead something of how i feel  we are  three robins who have touched the scots lyre this last century   well the one is the worlds he did it he came off he is for  ever but i and the other  ah what bonds we have  born in the  same city both sickly both pestered one nearly to madness one  to the madhouse with a damnatory creed both seeing the stars and  the dawn and wearing shoeleather on the same ancient stones  under the same pends down the same closes where our common  ancestors clashed in their armour rusty or bright  and the old  robin who was before burns and the flood died in his acute  painful youth and left the models of the great things that were to  come and the new who came after outlived his greensickness and  has faintly tried to parody the finished work  if you will collect  the strays of robin fergusson fish for material collect any last  reechoing of gossip command me to do what you prefer  to write  the preface  to write the whole if you prefer  anything so that  another monument after burnss be set up to my unhappy  predecessor on the causey of auld reekie  you will never know nor  will any man how deep this feeling is  i believe fergusson lives  in me  i do but tell it not in gath every man has these fanciful  superstitions coming going but yet enduring only most men are  so wise or the poet in them so dead that they keep their follies  for themselves  i am yours very truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to edmund gosse    vailima april 1891  my dear gosse  i have to thank you and mrs gosse for many  mementoes chiefly for your life of your father  there is a very  delicate task very delicately done  i noted one or two  carelessnesses which i meant to point out to you for another  edition but i find i lack the time and you will remark them for  yourself against a new edition  they were two or perhaps three  flabbinesses of style which in your work amazed me  am i right  in thinking you were a shade bored over the last chapters or was  it my own fault that made me think them susceptible of a more  athletic compression  the flabbinesses were not there i think  but in the more admirable part where they showed the bigger   take it all together the book struck me as if you had been hurried  at the last but particularly hurried over the proofs and could  still spend a very profitable fortnight in earnest revision and  towards the end heroic compression  the book in design  subject and general execution is well worth the extra trouble   and even if i were wrong in thinking it specially wanted it will  not be lost for do we not know in flauberts dread confession  that prose is never done  what a medium to work in for a man  tired perplexed among different aims and subjects and spurred by  the immediate need of siller  however its mine for what its  worth and its one of yours the devil take it and you know as  well as flaubert and as well as me that it is never done in  other words it is a torment of the pit usually neglected by the  bards who lucky beggars approached the styx in measure  i speak  bitterly at the moment having just detected in myself the last  fatal symptom three blank verses in succession  and i believe  god help me a hemistich at the tail of them hence i have deposed  the labourer come out of hell by my private trap and now write to  you from my little place in purgatory  but i prefer hell  would i  could always dig in those red coals  or else be at sea in a  schooner bound for isles unvisited  to be on shore and not to  work is emptiness  suicidal vacancy  i was the more interested in your life of your father because i  meditate one of mine or rather of my family  i have no such  materials as you and our objections already made your attack  fills me with despair it is direct and elegant and your style is  always admirable to me  lenity lucidity usually a high strain of  breeding an elegance that has a pleasant air of the accidental   but beware of purple passages  i wonder if you think as well of  your purple passages as i do of mine  i wonder if you think as ill  of mine as i do of yours  i wonder i can tell you at least what  is wrong with yours  they are treated in the spirit of verse  the  spirit  i dont mean the measure i dont mean you fall into  bastard cadences what i mean is that they seem vacant and smoothed  out ironed if you like  and in a style which like yours aims  more and more successfully at the academic one purple word is  already much three  a whole phrase  is inadmissible  wed  yourself to a clean austerity  that is your force  wear a linen  ephod splendidly candid  arrange its folds but do not fasten it  with any brooch  i swear to you in your talking robes there  should be no patch of adornment and where the subject forces let  it force you no further than it must and be ready with a twinkle  of your pleasantry  yours is a fine tool and i see so well how to  hold it i wonder if you see how to hold mine  but then i am to  the neck in prose and just now in the dark interstylar cave all  methods and effects wooing me myself in the midst impotent to  follow any  i look for dawn presently and a full flowing river of  expression running whither it wills  but these useless seasons  above all when a man must continue to spoil paper are infinitely  weary  we are in our house after a fashion without furniture tis true  camping there like the family after a sale  but the bailiff has  not yet appeared he will probably come after  the place is  beautiful beyond dreams some fifty miles of the pacific spread in  front deep woods all round a mountain making in the sky a profile  of huge trees upon our left about us the little island of our  clearing studded with brave old gentlemen or ladies or the twa  o them whom we have spared  it is a good place to be in night  and morning we have theodore rousseaus always a new one hung to  amuse us on the walls of the world and the moon  this is our good  season we have a moon just now  makes the night a piece of  heaven  it amazes me how people can live on in the dirty north  yet if you saw our rainy season which is really a caulker for  wind wet and darkness  howling showers roaring winds pit blackness at noon you might marvel how we could endure that  and  we cant  but theres a winter everywhere only ours is in the  summer  mark my words  there will be a winter in heaven  and in  hell  cela rentre dans les procedes du bon dieu et vous verrez   theres another very good thing about vailima i am away from the  little bubble of the literary life  it is not all beer and  skittles is it  by the by my ballads seem to have been dam bad  all the crickets sing so in their crickety papers and i have no  ghost of an idea on the point myself  verse is always to me the  unknowable  you might tell me how it strikes a professional bard   not that it really matters for of course good or bad i dont  think i shall get into that galley any more  but i should like to  know if you join the shrill chorus of the crickets  the crickets  are the devil in all to you  tis a strange thing they seem to  rejoice like a strong man in their injustice  i trust you got my  letter about your browning book  in case it missed i wish to say  again that your publication of brownings kind letter as an  illustration of his character was modest proper and in radiant  good taste  in witness whereof etc etc  robert louis stevenson    letter  to miss rawlinson    vailima apia samoa april 1891  my dear may  i never think of you by any more ceremonial name so  i will not pretend  there is not much chance that i shall forget  you until the time comes for me to forget all this little turmoil  in a corner though indeed i have been in several corners of an  inconsiderable planet  you remain in my mind for a good reason  having given me in so short a time the most delightful pleasure   i shall remember and you must still be beautiful  the truth is  you must grow more so or you will soon be less  it is not so easy  to be a flower even when you bear a flowers name  and if i  admired you so much and still remember you it is not because of  your face but because you were then worthy of it as you must  still continue  will you give my heartiest congratulations to mr s  he has my  admiration he is a brave man when i was young i should have run  away from the sight of you pierced with the sense of my unfitness   he is more wise and manly  what a good husband he will have to be   and you  what a good wife  carry your love tenderly  i will  never forgive him  or you  it is in both your hands  if the face  that once gladdened my heart should be changed into one sour or  sorrowful  what a person you are to give flowers  it was so i first heard of  you and now you are giving the may flower  yes skerryvore has passed it was for us  but i wish you could  see us in our new home on the mountain in the middle of great  woods and looking far out over the pacific  when mr s is very  rich he must bring you round the world and let you see it and see  the old gentleman and the old lady  i mean to live quite a long  while yet and my wife must do the same or else i couldnt manage  it so you see you will have plenty of time and its a pity not  to see the most beautiful places and the most beautiful people  moving there and the real stars and moon overhead instead of the  tin imitations that preside over london  i do not think my wife  very well but i am in hopes she will now have a little rest  it  has been a hard business above all for her we lived four months  in the hurricane season in a miserable house overborne with work  illfed continually worried drowned in perpetual rain beaten  upon by wind so that we must sit in the dark in the evenings and  then i ran away and she had a month of it alone  things go better  now the back of the work is broken and we are still foolish  enough to look forward to a little peace  i am a very different  person from the prisoner of skerryvore  the other day i was three andtwenty hours in an open boat it made me pretty ill but fancy  its not killing me halfway  it is like a fairy story that i  should have recovered liberty and strength and should go round  again among my fellowmen boating riding bathing toiling hard  with a woodknife in the forest  i can wish you nothing more  delightful than my fortune in life i wish it you and better if  the thing be possible  lloyd is tinkling below me on the typewriter my wife has just left  the room she asks me to say she would have written had she been  well enough and hopes to do it still  accept the best wishes of  your admirer  robert louis stevenson    letter  to miss adelaide boodle    vailima may 1891  my dear adelaide  i will own you just did manage to tread on my  gouty toe and i beg to assure you with most people i should simply  have turned away and said no more  my cudgelling was therefore in  the nature of a caress or testimonial  god forbid i should seem to judge for you on such a point it was  what you seemed to set forth as your reasons that fluttered my old  presbyterian spirit  for mind you i am a child of the  covenanters  whom i do not love but they are mine after all my  fathers and my mothers  and they had their merits too and their  ugly beauties and grotesque heroisms that i love them for the  while i laugh at them but in their name and mine do what you think  right and let the world fall  that is the privilege and the duty  of private persons and i shall think the more of you at the  greater distance because you keep a promise to your fellowman  your helper and creditor in life by just so much as i was tempted  to think the less of you o not much or i would never have been  angry when i thought you were the swallower of a tinfoil  formula  i must say i was uneasy about my letter not because it was too  strong as an expression of my unregenerate sentiments but because  i knew full well it should be followed by something kinder  and  the mischief has been in my health  i fell sharply sick in sydney  was put aboard the lubeck pretty bad got to vailima hung on a  month there and didnt pick up as well as my work needed set off  on a journey gained a great deal lost it again and am back at  vailima still no good at my necessary work  i tell you this for  my imperfect excuse that i should not have written you again sooner  to remove the bad taste of my last  a road has been called adelaide road it leads from the back of our  house to the bridge and thence to the garden and by a bifurcation  to the pig pen  it is thus much traversed particularly by fanny   an oleander the only one of your seeds that prospered in this  climate grows there and the name is now some week or ten days  applied and published  adelaide road leads also into the bush to  the banana patch and by a second bifurcation over the left branch  of the stream to the plateau and the right hand of the gorges  in  short it leads to all sorts of good and is besides in itself a  pretty winding path bound downhill among big woods to the margin  of the stream  what a strange idea to think me a jewhater  isaiah and david and  heine are good enough for me and i leave more unsaid  were i of  jew blood i do not think i could ever forgive the christians the  ghettos would get in my nostrils like mustard or lit gunpowder   just so you as being a child of the presbytery i retain  i need  not dwell on that  the ascendant hand is what i feel most  strongly i am bound in and in with my forbears were he one of  mine i should not be struck at all by mr moss of bevis marks i  should still see behind him moses of the mount and the tables and  the shining face  we are all nobly born fortunate those who know  it blessed those who remember  i am my dear adelaide most genuinely yours  robert louis stevenson  write by return to say you are better and i will try to do the  same    letter  to charles baxter    vailima tuesday 19th may 91  my dear charles  i dont know what you think of me not having  written to you at all during your illness  i find two sheets begun  with your name but that is no excuse    i am keeping bravely  getting about better every day and hope soon to be in my usual  fettle  my books begin to come and i fell once more on the old  bailey session papers  i have 1778 1784 and 1786  should you be  able to lay hands on any other volumes above all a little later i  should be very glad you should buy them for me  i particularly  want one or two during the course of the peninsular war  come to  think i ought rather to have communicated this want to bain   would it bore you to communicate to that effect with the great man   the sooner i have them the better for me  tis for henry shovel   but henry shovel has now turned into a work called the shovels of  newton french  including memoirs of henry shovel a private in the  peninsular war which work is to begin in 1664 with the marriage  of skipper afterwards alderman shovel of bristol henrys great greatgrandfather and end about 1832 with his own second marriage  to the daughter of his runaway aunt  will the public ever stand  such an opus  gude kens but it tickles me  two or three  historical personages will just appear  judge jeffreys  wellington colquhoun grant and i think townsend the runner  i  know the public wont like it let em lump it then i mean to make  it good it will be more like a saga  adieu yours ever  affectionately  r l stevenson    letter  to e l burlingame    vailima summer 1891  my dear burlingame  i find among my grandfathers papers his own  reminiscences of his voyage round the north with sir walter eighty  years ago labuntur anni  they are not remarkably good but he was  not a bad observer and several touches seem to me speaking  it  has occurred to me you might like them to appear in the magazine   if you would kindly let me know and tell me how you would like it  handled  my grandads ms runs to between six and seven thousand  words which i could abbreviate of anecdotes that scarce touch sir  w  would you like this done  would you like me to introduce the  old gentleman  i had something of the sort in my mind and could  fill a few columns rather a propos  i give you the first offer of  this according to your request for though it may forestall one of  the interests of my biography the thing seems to me particularly  suited for prior appearance in a magazine  i see the first number of the wrecker i thought it went lively  enough and by a singular accident the picture is not unlike tai ohae  thus we see the age of miracles etc  yours very sincerely  r l s  proofs for next mail    letter  to w craibe angus    summer 1891  dear mr angus  you can use my letter as you will  the parcel  has not come pray heaven the next post bring it safe  is it  possible for me to write a preface here  i will try if you like  if you think i must  though surely there are rivers in assyria   of course you will send me sheets of the catalogue i suppose it  the preface need not be long perhaps it should be rather very  short  be sure you give me your views upon these points  also  tell me what names to mention among those of your helpers and do  remember to register everything else it is not safe  the true place in my view for a monument to fergusson were the  churchyard of haddington  but as that would perhaps not carry many  votes i should say one of the two following sites first either  as near the site of the old bedlam as we could get or second  beside the cross the heart of his city  upon this i would have a  fluttering butterfly and i suggest the citation   poor butterfly thy case i mourn   for the case of fergusson is not one to pretend about  a more  miserable tragedy the sun never shone upon or in consideration of  our climate i should rather say refused to brighten  yours  truly  robert louis stevenson  where burns goes will not matter  he is no local poet like your  robin the first he is general as the casing air  glasgow as the  chief city of scottish men would do well but for gods sake  dont let it be like the glasgow memorial to knox  i remember  when i first saw this laughing for an hour by shrewsbury clock  r l s    letter  to h c ide    vailima june 19 1891  dear mr ide  herewith please find the document which i trust  will prove sufficient in law  it seems to me very attractive in  its eclecticism scots english and roman law phrases are all  indifferently introduced and a quotation from the works of haynes  bayly can hardly fail to attract the indulgence of the bench   yours very truly  robert louis stevenson  i robert louis stevenson advocate of the scots bar author of the  master of ballantrae and moral emblems stuck civil engineer sole  owner and patentee of the palace and plantation known as vailima in  the island of upolu samoa a british subject being in sound mind  and pretty well i thank you in body  in consideration that miss annie h ide daughter of h c ide in  the town of saint johnsbury in the county of caledonia in the  state of vermont united states of america was born out of all  reason upon christmas day and is therefore out of all justice  denied the consolation and profit of a proper birthday  and considering that i the said robert louis stevenson have  attained an age when o we never mention it and that i have now no  further use for a birthday of any description  and in consideration that i have met h c ide the father of the  said annie h ide and found him about as white a land commissioner  as i require  have transferred and do hereby transfer to the said annie h ide  all and whole my rights and priviledges in the thirteenth day of  november formerly my birthday now hereby and henceforth the  birthday of the said annie h ide to have hold exercise and  enjoy the same in the customary manner by the sporting of fine  raiment eating of rich meats and receipt of gifts compliments  and copies of verse according to the manner of our ancestors  and i direct the said annie h ide to add to the said name of annie  h ide the name louisa  at least in private and i charge her to  use my said birthday with moderation and humanity et tamquam bona  filia familiae the said birthday not being so young as it once  was and having carried me in a very satisfactory manner since i  can remember  and in case the said annie h ide shall neglect or contravene  either of the above conditions i hereby revoke the donation and  transfer my rights in the said birthday to the president of the  united states of america for the time being  in witness whereof i have hereto set my hand

vailima october 1891  my dear henry james  from this perturbed and hunted being expect  but a line and that line shall be but a whoop for adela  o shes  delicious delicious i could live and die with adela  die rather  the better of the two you never did a straighter thing and never  will  david balfour second part of kidnapped is on the stocks at last  and is not bad i think  as for the wrecker its a machine you  know  dont expect aught else  a machine and a police machine  but i believe the end is one of the most genuine butcheries in  literature and we point to our machine with a modest pride as the  only police machine without a villain  our criminals are a most  pleasing crew and leave the dock with scarce a stain upon their  character  what a different line of country to be trying to draw adela and  trying to write the last four chapters of the wrecker  heavens  its like two centuries and ours is such rude transpontine  business aiming only at a certain fervour of conviction and sense  of energy and violence in the men and yours is so neat and bright  and of so exquisite a surface  seems dreadful to send such a book  to such an author but your name is on the list  and we do  modestly ask you to consider the chapters on the norah creina with  the study of captain nares and the forementioned last four with  their brutality of substance and the curious and perhaps unsound  technical manoeuvre of running the story together to a point as we  go along the narrative becoming more succinct and the details  fining off with every page  sworn affidavit of  r l s  no person now alive has beaten adela  i adore adela and her maker   sic subscrib  robert louis stevenson  a sublime poem to follow  adela adela adela chart what have you done to my elderly heart of all the ladies of paper and ink i count you the paragon call you the pink the word of your brother depicts you in part you raving maniac adela chart but in all the asylums that cumber the ground so delightful a maniac was neer to be found  i pore on you dote on you clasp you to heart i laud love and laugh at you adela chart and thank my dear maker the while i admire that i can be neither your husband nor sire  your husbands your sires were a difficult part youre a byway to suicide adela chart but to read of depicted by exquisite james o sure youre the flower and quintessence of dames  r l s   eructavit cor meum   my heart was inditing a goodly matter about adela chart though oft ive been touched by the volatile dart to none have i grovelled but adela chart there are passable ladies no question in art  but where is the marrow of adela chart i dreamed that to tyburn i passed in the cart  i dreamed i was married to adela chart from the first i awoke with a palpable start the second

the tales of my  grandfather soon but i guess well try and finish off the wrecker  first  a propos of whom please send some advanced sheets to  cassells  away ahead of you  so that they may get a dummy out  do you wish to illustrate my grandfather  he mentions as excellent  a portrait of scott by basil halls brother  i dont think i ever  saw this engraved would it not if you could get track of it  prove a taking embellishment  i suggest this for your  consideration and inquiry  a new portrait of scott strikes me as  good  there is a hard tough constipated old portrait of my  grandfather hanging in my aunts house mrs alan stevenson 16 st  leonards terrace chelsea which has never been engraved  the  better portrait josephs bust has been reproduced i believe  twice  and which i am sure my aunt would let you have a copy of   the plate could be of use for the book when we get so far and thus  to place it in the magazine might be an actual saving  i am swallowed up in politics for the first i hope for the last  time in my sublunary career  it is a painful thankless trade but  one thing that came up i could not pass in silence  much drafting  addressing deputationising has eaten up all my time and again to  my contrition i leave you wreckerless  as soon as the mail leaves  i tackle it straight  yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to e l burlingame    vailima autumn 1891  my dear burlingame  the time draws nigh the mail is near due  and i snatch a moment of collapse so that you may have at least  some sort of a scratch of note along with the   \ end  \ of   \ the    \ wrecker      hurray  which i mean to go herewith  it has taken me a devil of a pull  but i think its going to be ready  if i did not know you were on  the stretch waiting for it and trembling for your illustrations i  would keep it for another finish but things being as they are i  will let it go the best way i can get it  i am now within two  pages of the end of chapter xxv which is the last chapter the  end with its gathering up of loose threads being the dedication to  low and addressed to him  this is my last and best expedient for  the knotting up of these loose cards  tis possible i may not get  that finished in time in which case youll receive only chapters  xxii to xxv by this mail which is all that can be required for  illustration  i wish you would send me memoirs of baron marbot french  introduction to the study of the history of language strong  logeman  wheeler principles of psychology william james morris   magnussons saga library any volumes that are out george  merediths one of our conquerors la bas by huysmans french  oconnor morriss great commanders of modern times lifes  handicap by kipling of taines origines de la france  contemporaine i have only as far as la revolution vol iii if  another volume is out please add that  there is for a bookbox  i hope you will like the end i think it is rather strong meat  i  have got into such a deliberate dilatory expansive turn that the  effort to compress this last yarn was unwelcome but the longest  yarn has to come to an end sometime  please look it over for  carelessnesses and tell me if it had any effect upon your jaded  editorial mind  ill see if ever i have time to add more  i add to my bookbox list adams historical essays the plays of a  w pinero  all that have appeared and send me the rest in course  as they do appear noughts and crosses by q robertsons scotland  under her early kings  sunday  the deed is done didst thou not hear a noise  the end has been  written to this endless yarn and i am once more a free man  what  will he do with it    letter  to w craibe angus    vailima samoa november 1891  my dear mr angus  herewith the invaluable sheets  they came  months after your letter and i trembled but here they are and i  have scrawled my vile name on them and thocht shame as i did it   i am expecting the sheets of your catalogue so that i may attack  the preface  please give me all the time you can  the sooner the  better you might even send me early proofs as they are sent out  to give me more incubation  i used to write as slow as judgment  now i write rather fast but i am still a slow study and sit a  long while silent on my eggs  unconscious thought there is the  only method  macerate your subject let it boil slow then take  the lid off and look in  and there your stuff is good or bad   but the journalists method is the way to manufacture lies it is  willworship  if you know the luminous quaker phrase and the will  is only to be brought in the field for study and again for  revision  the essential part of work is not an act it is a state  i do not know why i write you this trash  many thanks for your handsome dedication  i have not yet had time  to do more than glance at mrs begg it looks interesting  yours  very truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to miss annie h ide    vailima samoa november 1891  my dear louisa  your picture of the church the photograph of  yourself and your sister and your very witty and pleasing letter  came all in a bundle and made me feel i had my moneys worth for  that birthday  i am now i must be one of your nearest relatives  exactly what we are to each other i do not know i doubt if the  case has ever happened before  your papa ought to know and i  dont believe he does but i think i ought to call you in the  meanwhile and until we get the advice of counsel learned in the  law my namedaughter  well i was extremely pleased to see by the  church that my namedaughter could draw by the letter that she  was no fool and by the photograph that she was a pretty girl  which hurts nothing  see how virtues are rewarded  my first idea  of adopting you was entirely charitable and here i find that i am  quite proud of it and of you and that i chose just the kind of  namedaughter i wanted  for i can draw too or rather i mean to  say i could before i forgot how and i am very far from being a  fool myself however much i may look it and i am as beautiful as  the day or at least i once hoped that perhaps i might be going to  be  and so i might  so that you see we are well met and peers on  these important points  i am very glad also that you are older  than your sister  so should i have been if i had had one  so  that the number of points and virtues which you have inherited from  your namefather is already quite surprising  i wish you would tell your father  not that i like to encourage my  rival  that we have had a wonderful time here of late and that  they are having a cold day on mulinuu and the consuls are writing  reports and i am writing to the times and if we dont get rid of  our friends this time i shall begin to despair of everything but my  namedaughter  you are quite wrong as to the effect of the birthday on your age   from the moment the deed was registered as it was in the public  press with every solemnity the 13th of november became your own  and only birthday and you ceased to have been born on christmas  day  ask your father  i am sure he will tell you this is sound  law  you are thus become a month and twelve days younger than you  were but will go on growing older for the future in the regular  and human manner from one 13th november to the next  the effect on  me is more doubtful i may as you suggest live for ever i might  on the other hand come to pieces like the onehorse shay at a  moments notice doubtless the step was risky but i do not the  least regret that which enables me to sign myself your revered and  delighted namefather  robert louis stevenson    letter  to fred orr    vailima upolu samoa november 28th 1891  dear sir  your obliging communication is to hand  i am glad to  find that you have read some of my books and to see that you spell  my name right  this is a point for some reason of great  difficulty and i believe that a gentleman who can spell stevenson  with a v at sixteen should have a show for the presidency before  fifty  by that time   i nearer to the wayside inn   predict that you will have outgrown your taste for autographs but  perhaps your son may have inherited the collection and on the  morning of the great day will recall my prophecy to your mind  and  in the papers of 1921 say this letter may arouse a smile  whatever you do read something else besides novels and newspapers  the first are good enough when they are good the second at their  best are worth nothing  read great books of literature and  history try to understand the roman empire and the middle ages be  sure you do not understand when you dislike them condemnation is  noncomprehension  and if you know something of these two periods  you will know a little more about today and may be a good  president  i send you my best wishes and am yours  robert louis stevenson  author of a vast quantity of little books    letter  to e l burlingame    vailima december 1891  my dear burlingame  the end of the wrecker having but just come  in you will i dare say be appalled to receive three possibly  four chapters of a new book of the least attractive sort  a  history of nowhere in a corner for no time to mention running to  a volume  well it may very likely be an illusion it is very  likely no one could possibly wish to read it but i wish to publish  it  if you dont cotton to the idea kindly set it up at my  expense and let me know your terms for publishing  the great  affair to me is to have per return if it might be four or five   better say half a dozen  sets of the roughest proofs that can be  drawn  there are a good many men here whom i want to read the  blessed thing and not one would have the energy to read ms  at  the same time if you care to glance at it and have the time i  should be very glad of your opinion as to whether i have made any  step at all towards possibly inducing folk at home to read matter  so extraneous and outlandish  i become heavy and owlish years sit  upon me it begins to seem to me to be a mans business to leave  off his damnable faces and say his say  else i could have made it  pungent and light and lively  in considering kindly forget that i  am r l s think of the four chapters as a book you are reading  by an inhabitant of our lovely but fatil islands and see if it  could possibly amuse the hebetated public  i have to publish  anyway you understand i have a purpose beyond i am concerned for  some of the parties to this quarrel  what i want to hear is from  curiosity what i want you to judge of is what we are to do with  the book in a business sense  to me it is not business at all i  had meant originally to lay all the profits to the credit of samoa  when it comes to the pinch of writing i judge this unfair  i give  too much  and i mean to keep if there be any profit at all one half for the artisan the rest i shall hold over to give to the  samoans for that which i choose and against work done  i think i  have never heard of greater insolence than to attempt such a  subject yet the tale is so strange and mixed and the people so  oddly charactered  above all the whites  and the high note of  the hurricane and the warships is so well prepared to take popular  interest and the latter part is so directly in the days movement  that i am not without hope but some may read it and if they dont  a murrain on them  here is for the first time a tale of greeks   homeric greeks  mingled with moderns and all true odysseus  alongside of rajah brooke proportion gardee and all true  here  is for the first time since the greeks that i remember the  history of a handful of men where all know each other in the eyes  and live close in a few acres narrated at length and with the  seriousness of history  talk of the modern novel here is a modern  history  and if i had the misfortune to found a school the  legitimate historian might lie down and die for he could never  overtake his material  here is a little tale that has not caret ed its vates sacer is another point  r l s    letter  to henry james    december 7th 1891  my dear henry james  thanks for yours your former letter was  lost so it appears was my long and masterly treatise on the tragic  muse  i remember sending it very well and there went by the same  mail a long and masterly tractate to gosse about his daddys life  for which i have been long expecting an acknowledgment and which  is plainly gone to the bottom with the other  if you see gosse  please mention it  these gems of criticism are now lost  literature like the tomes of alexandria  i could not do em  again  and i must ask you to be content with a dull head a weary  hand and short commons for today as i am physically tired with  hard work of every kind the labours of the planter and the author  both piled upon me mountain deep  i am delighted beyond expression  by bourgets book  he has phrases which affect me almost like  montaigne i had read ere this a masterly essay of his on pascal  this book does it i write for all his essays by this mail and  shall try to meet him when i come to europe  the proposal is to  pass a summer in france i think in royat where the faithful could  come and visit me they are now not many  i expect henry james to  come and break a crust or two with us  i believe it will be only  my wife and myself and she will go over to england but not i or  possibly incog to southampton and then to boscombe to see poor  lady shelley  i am writing  trying to write in a babel fit for  the bottomless pit my wife her daughter her grandson and my  mother all shrieking at each other round the house  not in war  thank god but the din is ultra martial and the note of lloyd  joins in occasionally and the cause of this todo is simply cacao  whereof chocolate comes  you may drink of our chocolate perhaps in  five or six years from now and not know it  it makes a fine  bustle and gives us some hard work out of which i have slunk for  today  i have a story coming out  god knows when or how it answers to  the name of the beach of falesa and i think well of it  i was  delighted with the tragic muse i thought the muse herself one of  your best works i was delighted also to hear of the success of  your piece as you know i am a dam failure and might have dined  with the dinner club that daudet and these parties frequented  next day  i have just been breakfasting at baiae and brindisi and the charm  of bourget hagrides me  i wonder if this exquisite fellow all  made of fiddlestrings and scent and intelligence could bear any  of my bald prose  if you think he could ask colvin to send him a  copy of these last essays of mine when they appear and tell  bourget they go to him from a south sea island as literal homage   i have read no new book for years that gave me the same literary  thrill as his sensations ditalie  if as i imagine my cutand dry literature would be death to him and worse than death   journalism  be silent on the point  for i have a great curiosity  to know him and if he doesnt know my work i shall have the  better chance of making his acquaintance  i read the pupil the  other day with great joy your little boy is admirable why is  there no little boy like that unless he hails from the great  republic  here i broke off and wrote bourget a dedication no use resisting  its a love affair  o hes exquisite i bless you for the gift of  him  i have really enjoyed this book as i  almost as i  used to  enjoy books when i was going twenty  twentythree and these are  the years for reading  r l s    letter  to e l burlingame    vailima jan 2nd 92  my dear burlingame  overjoyed you were pleased with wrecker and  shall consider your protests  there is perhaps more art than you  think for in the peccant chapter where i have succeeded in packing  into one a dedication an explanation and a termination  surely  you had not recognised the phrase about boodle  it was a quotation  from jim pinkerton and seemed to me agreeably skittish  however  all shall be prayerfully considered  to come to a more painful subject  herewith go three more chapters  of the wretched history as you see i approach the climax  i  expect the book to be some 70000 words of which you have now 45   can i finish it for next mail  i am going to try  tis a long  piece of journalism and full of difficulties here and there of  this kind and that and will make me a power of friends to be sure   there is one becker who will probably put up a window to me in the  church where he was baptized and i expect a testimonial from  captain hand  sorry to let the mail go without the scott this has been a bad  month with me and i have been below myself  i shall find a way to  have it come by next or know the reason why  the mail after  anyway  a bit of a sketch map appears to me necessary for my history  perhaps two  if i do not have any tis impossible any one should  follow and i even when not at all interested demand that i shall  be able to follow even a tourist book without a map is a cross to  me and there must be others of my way of thinking  i inclose the  very artless one that i think needful  vailima in case you are  curious is about as far again behind tanugamanono as that is from  the sea  mclure is publishing a short story of mine some 50000 words i  think the beach of falesa when hes done with it i want you and  cassell to bring it out in a little volume i shall send you a  dedication for it i believe it good indeed to be honest very  good  good gear that pleases the merchant  the other map that i half threaten is a chart for the hurricane   get me kimberleys report of the hurricane  not to be found here   it is of most importance i must have it with my proofs of that  part if i cannot have it earlier which now seems impossible   yours in hot haste  r l stevenson    letter  to j m barrie    vailima samoa february 1892  dear mr barrie  this is at least the third letter i have written  you but my correspondence has a bad habit of not getting so far as  the post  that which i possess of manhood turns pale before the  business of the address and envelope  but i hope to be more  fortunate with this  for besides the usual and often recurrent  desire to thank you for your workyou are one of four that have  come to the front since i was watching and had a corner of my own  to watch and there is no reason unless it be in these mysterious  tides that ebb and flow and make and mar and murder the works of  poor scribblers why you should not do work of the best order  the  tides have borne away my sentence of which i was weary at any  rate and between authors i may allow myself so much freedom as to  leave it pending  we are both scots besides and i suspect both  rather scotty scots my own scotchness tends to intermittency but  is at times erisypelitous  if that be rightly spelt  lastly i  have gathered we had both made our stages in the metropolis of the  winds  our virgils grey metropolis and i count that a lasting  bond  no place so brands a man  finally i feel it a sort of duty to you to report progress  this  may be an error but i believed i detected your hand in an article   it may be an illusion it may have been by one of those  industrious insects who catch up and reproduce the handling of each  emergent man  but ill still hope it was yours  and hope it may  please you to hear that the continuation of kidnapped is under way   i have not yet got to alan so i do not know if he is still alive  but david seems to have a kick or two in his shanks  i was pleased  to see how the anglosaxon theory fell into the trap  i gave my  lowlander a gaelic name and even commented on the fact in the  text yet almost all critics recognised in alan and david a saxon  and a celt  i know not about england in scotland at least where  gaelic was spoken in fife little over the century ago and in  galloway not much earlier i deny that there exists such a thing as  a pure saxon and i think it more than questionable if there be  such a thing as a pure celt  but what have you to do with this and what have i  let us  continue to inscribe our little bits of tales and let the heathen  rage  yours with sincere interest in your career  robert louis stevenson    letter  to william morris    vailima samoa feb 1892  master  a plea from a place so distant should have some weight  and from a heart so grateful should have some address  i have been  long in your debt master and i did not think it could be so much  increased as you have now increased it  i was long in your debt  and deep in your debt for many poems that i shall never forget and  for sigurd before all and now you have plunged me beyond payment  by the saga library  and so now true to human nature being  plunged beyond payment i come and bark at your heels  for surely master that tongue that we write and that you have  illustrated so nobly is yet alive  she has her rights and laws  and is our mother our queen and our instrument  now in that  living tongue where has one sense whereas another  in the  heathslayings story p 241 line 13 it bears one of its ordinary  senses  elsewhere and usually through the two volumes which is  all that has yet reached me of this entrancing publication whereas  is made to figure for where  for the love of god my dear and honoured morris use where and  let us know whereas we are wherefore our gratitude shall grow  whereby you shall be the more honoured wherever men love clear  language whereas now although we honour we are troubled  whereunder please find inscribed to this very impudent but yet  very anxious document the name of one of the most distant but not  the youngest or the coldest of those who honour you  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs charles fairchild    vailima march 1892  my dear mrs fairchild  i am guilty in your sight but my affairs  besiege me      the chiefjusticeship of a family of nineteen  persons is in itself no sinecure and sometimes occupies me for  days  two weeks ago for four days almost entirely and for two  days entirely  besides which i have in the last few months  written all but one chapter of a history of samoa for the last  eight or nine years and while i was unavoidably delayed in the  writing of this awaiting material put in onehalf of david  balfour the sequel to kidnapped  add the ordinary impediments of  life and admire my busyness  i am now an old but healthy  skeleton and degenerate much towards the machine  by six at work   stopped at halfpast ten to give a history lesson to a step grandson eleven lunch after lunch we have a musical performance  till two then to work again bath 440 dinner five cards in  the evening till eight and then to bed  only i have no bed only  a chest with a mat and blankets  and read myself to sleep  this  is the routine but often sadly interrupted  then you may see me  sitting on the floor of my verandah haranguing and being harangued  by squatting chiefs on a question of a road or more privately  holding an inquiry into some dispute among our familiars myself on  my bed the boys on the floor  for when it comes to the judicial i  play dignity  or else going down to apia on some more or less  unsatisfactory errand  altogether it is a life that suits me but  it absorbs me like an ocean  that is what i have always envied and  admired in scott with all that immensity of work and study his  mind kept flexible glancing to all points of natural interest   but the lean hot spirits such as mine become hypnotised with  their bit occupations  if i may use scotch to you  it is so far  more scornful than any english idiom  well i cant help being a  skeleton and you are to take this devious passage for an apology  i thought aladdin capital fun but why in fortune did he pretend  it was moral at the end  the socalled nineteenth century ou va til se nicher  tis a trifle but pyle would do well to knock the  passage out and leave his boguey tale a boguey tale and a good  one at that  the arrival of your box was altogether a great success to the  castaways  you have no idea where we live  do you know in all  these islands there are not five hundred whites and no postal  delivery and only one village  it is no more  and would be a  mean enough village in europe  we were asked the other day if  vailima were the name of our post town and we laughed  do you  know though we are but three miles from the village metropolis we  have no road to it and our goods are brought on the packsaddle   and do you know  or i should rather say can you believe  or in  the famous old tichborne trial phrase would you be surprised to  learn that all you have read of vailima  or subpriorsford as i  call it  is entirely false and we have no icemachine and no  electric light and no water supply but the cistern of the heavens  and but one public room and scarce a bedroom apiece  but of  course it is well known that i have made enormous sums by my  evanescent literature and you will smile at my false humility   the point however is much on our minds just now  we are  expecting an invasion of kiplings very glad we shall be to see  them but two of the party are ladies and i tell you we had to  hold a council of war to stow them  you european ladies are so  particular with all of mine sleeping has long become a public  function as with natives and those who go down much into the sea  in ships  dear mrs fairchild i must go to my work  i have but two words to  say in conclusion  first civilisation is rot  second console a savage with more of the milk of that over  civilised being your adorable schoolboy  as i wrote these remarkable words i was called down to eight  oclock prayers and have just worked through a chapter of joshua  and five verses with five treble choruses of a samoan hymn but  the music was good our boys and precentress tis always a woman  that leads did better than i ever heard them and to my great  pleasure i understood it all except one verse  this gave me the  more time to try and identify what the parts were doing and  further convict my dull ear  beyond the fact that the soprano rose  to the tonic above on one occasion i could recognise nothing   this is sickening but i mean to teach my ear better before i am  done with it or this vile carcase  i think it will amuse you for a last word to hear that our  precentress  she is the washerwoman  is our shame  she is a  good healthy comely strapping young wench full of energy and  seriousness a splendid workwoman delighting to train our chorus  delighting in the poetry of the hymns which she reads aloud on  the least provocation with a great sentiment of rhythm  well  then what is curious  ah we did not know but it was told us in  a whisper from the cookhouse  she is not of good family  dont  let it get out please everybody knows it of course here there  is no reason why europe and the states should have the advantage of  me also  and the rest of my housefolk are all chiefpeople i  assure you  and my late overseer far the best of his race is a  really serious chief with a good name  tina is the name it is  not in the almanach de gotha it must have got dropped at press   the odd thing is we rather share the prejudice  i have almost  always  though not quite always  found the higher the chief the  better the man through all the islands or at least that the best  man came always from a highish rank  i hope helen will continue to  prove a bright exception  with love to fairchild and the huge schoolboy i am my dear mrs  fairchild yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to e l burlingame    vailima march 1892  my dear burlingame  herewith chapters ix and x and i am left  face to face with the horrors and dilemmas of the present regimen   pray for those that go down to the sea in ships  i have promised  henley shall have a chance to publish the hurricane chapter if he  like so please let the slips be sent quam primum to c baxter  ws 11 s charlotte street edinburgh  i got on mighty quick  with that chapter  about five days of the toughest kind of work   god forbid i should ever have such another pirn to wind  when i  invent a language there shall be a direct and an indirect pronoun  differently declined  then writing would be some fun   direct     indirect    he         tu   him        tum   his        tus   ex  he seized tum by tus throat but tu at the same moment caught  him by his hair  a fellow could write hurricanes with an  inflection like that  yet there would he difficulties too  do what you please about the beach and i give you carte blanche to  write in the matter to baxter  or telegraph if the time press  to  delay the english contingent  herewith the two last slips of the  wrecker  i cannot go beyond  by the way pray compliment the  printers on the proofs of the samoa racket but hint to them that  it is most unbusinesslike and unscholarly to clip the edges of the  galleys these proofs should really have been sent me on large  paper and i and my friends here are all put to a great deal of  trouble and confusion by the mistake  for as you must conceive  in a matter so contested and complicated the number of corrections  and the length of explanations is considerable  please add to my former orders   le chevalier des touches   by barbey daurevilly les diaboliques         correspondance de henri beyle stendahl  yours sincerely  r l stevenson    letter  to t w dover    vailima plantation upolu samoa june 20th 1892  sir  in reply to your very interesting letter i cannot fairly  say that i have ever been poor or known what it was to want a  meal  i have been reduced however to a very small sum of money  with no apparent prospect of increasing it and at that time i  reduced myself to practically one meal a day with the most  disgusting consequences to my health  at this time i lodged in the  house of a working man and associated much with others  at the  same time from my youth up i have always been a good deal and  rather intimately thrown among the workingclasses partly as a  civil engineer in outoftheway places partly from a strong and  i hope not illfavoured sentiment of curiosity  but the place  where perhaps i was most struck with the fact upon which you  comment was the house of a friend who was exceedingly poor in  fact i may say destitute and who lived in the attic of a very  tall house entirely inhabited by persons in varying stages of  poverty  as he was also in illhealth i made a habit of passing  my afternoon with him and when there it was my part to answer the  door  the steady procession of people begging and the expectant  and confident manner in which they presented themselves struck me  more and more daily and i could not but remember with surprise  that though my father lived but a few streets away in a fine house  beggars scarce came to the door once a fortnight or a month  from  that time forward i made it my business to inquire and in the  stories which i am very fond of hearing from all sorts and  conditions of men learned that in the time of their distress it  was always from the poor they sought assistance and almost always  from the poor they got it  trusting i have now satisfactorily answered your question which i  thank you for asking i remain with sincere compliments  robert louis stevenson    letter  to e l burlingame    vailima summer 1892  my dear burlingame  first of all you have all the corrections on  the wrecker  i found i had made what i meant and forgotten it  and was so careless as not to tell you  second of course and by all means charge corrections on the  samoa book to me but there are not near so many as i feared  the  lord hath dealt bountifully with me and i believe all my advisers  were amazed to see how nearly correct i had got the truck at least  i was  with this you will receive the whole revise and a  typewritten copy of the last chapter  and the thing now is speed  to catch a possible revision of the treaty  i believe cassells are  to bring it out but baxter knows and the thing has to be crammed  through prestissimo a la chasseur  you mention the belated barbeys what about the equally belated  pineros  and i hope you will keep your bookshop alive to supplying  me continuously with the saga library  i cannot get enough of  sagas i wish there were nine thousand talk about realism  all seems to flourish with you i also prosper none the less for  being quit of that abhorred task samoa  i could give a supper  party here were there any one to sup  never was such a  disagreeable task but the thing had to be told     there i trust i am done with this cursed chapter of my career bar  the rotten eggs and broken bottles that may follow of course   pray remember speed is now all that can be asked hoped or  wished  i give up all hope of proofs revises proof of the map  or sic like and you on your side will try to get it out as  reasonably seemly as may be  whole samoa book herewith  glory be to god  yours very  sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    vailima plantation upolu samoan islands 18th july 1892  my dear charles    i have been now for some time contending  with powers and principalities and i have never once seen one of  my own letters to the times  so when you see something in the  papers that you think might interest the exiles of upolu do not  think twice out with your saxpence and send it flying to vailima   of what you say of the past eh man it was a queer time and  awful miserable but theres no sense in denying it was awful fun   do you mind the youth in highland garb and the tableful of coppers   do you mind the signal of waterloo place  hey how the blood  stands to the heart at such a memory  hae ye the notes ot   gies them  gudes sake man gies the notes ot i mind ye made  a tune ot an played it on your pinanny gies the notes  dear  lord that past  glad to hear henleys prospects are fair  his new volume is the  work of a real poet  he is one of those who can make a noise of  his own with words and in whom experience strikes an individual  note  there is perhaps no more genuine poet living bar the big  guns  in case i cannot overtake an acknowledgment to himself by  this mail please let him hear of my pleasure and admiration  how  poorly  compares  he is all smart journalism and cleverness  it  is all bright and shallow and limpid like a business paper  a  good one sentend but there is no blot of hearts blood and the  old night  there are no harmonics there is scarce harmony to his  music and in henley  all of these a touch a sense within sense  a sound outside the sound the shadow of the inscrutable eloquent  beyond all definition  the first london voluntary knocked me  wholly  ever yours affectionately my dear charles  robert louis stevenson  kind memories to your father and all friends    letter  to w e henley    vailima plantation upolu samoa august 1st 1892  my dear henley  it is impossible to let your new volume pass in  silence  i have not received the same thrill of poetry since g  ms joy of earth volume and love in a valley and i do not know  that even that was so intimate and deep  again and again i take  the book down and read and my blood is fired as it used to be in  youth  andante con moto in the voluntaries and the thing about  the trees at night no xxiv i think are up to date my  favourites  i did not guess you were so great a magician these  are new tunes this is an undertone of the true apollo these are  not verse they are poetry  inventions creations in language  i  thank you for the joy you have given me and remain your old friend  and present huge admirer  robert louis stevenson  the hand is really the hand of esau but under a course of  threatened scriveners cramp  for the next edition of the book of verses pray accept an  emendation  last three lines of echoes no xliv read    but life in act  how should the grave be victor over these mother a mother of men   the two vocatives scatter the effect of this inimitable close  if  you insist on the longer line equip grave with an epithet  r l s    letter  to e l burlingame    vailima upolu august 1st 92  my dear burlingame  herewith my grandfather  i have had rather a  bad time suppressing the old gentleman who was really in a very  garrulous stage as for getting him in order i could do but little  towards that however there are one or two points of interest  which may justify us in printing  the swinging of his stick and  not knowing the sailor of coruiskin in particular and the account  of how he wrote the lives in the bell book particularly please me  i hope my own little introduction is not egoistic or rather i do  not care if it is  it was that old gentlemans blood that brought  me to samoa  by the by vols vii viii and ix of adamss history have never  come to hand no more have the dictionaries  please send me stonehenge on horse stories and interludes by barry  pain and edinburgh sketches and memoirs by david masson  the  wrecker has turned up  so far as i have seen it is very  satisfactory but on pp 548 549 there has been a devil of a  miscarriage  the two latin quotations instead of following each  other being separated doubtless for printing considerations by a  line of prose  my compliments to the printers there is doubtless  such a thing as good printing but there is such a thing as good  sense  the sequel to kidnapped david balfour by name is about three quarters done and gone to press for serial publication  by what i  can find out it ought to be through hand with that and ready for  volume form early next spring  yours very sincerely  r l s    letter  to andrew lang    vailima august 1892  my dear lang  i knew you would prove a trusty purveyor  the  books you have sent are admirable  i got the name of my hero out  of brown  blair of balmyle  francie blair  but whether to call  the story blair of balmyle or whether to call it the young  chevalier i have not yet decided  the admirable cameronian tract   perhaps you will think this a cheat  is to be boned into david  balfour where it will fit better and really furnishes me with a  desired foothold over a boggy place  later no it wont go in and i fear i must give up the  idolatrous occupant upon the throne a phrase that overjoyed me  beyond expression  i am in a deuce of a flutter with politics  which i hate and in which i certainly do not shine but a fellow  cannot stand aside and look on at such an exhibition as our  government  taint decent no gent can hold a candle to it  but  its a grind to be interrupted by midnight messengers and pass your  days writing proclamations which are never proclaimed and  petitions which aint petited and letters to the times which it  makes my jaws yawn to reread and all your time have your heart  with david balfour  he has just left glasgow this morning for  edinburgh james more has escaped from the castle it is far more  real to me than the behring sea or the baring brothers either  he  got the news of james mores escape from the lord advocate and  started off straight to comfort catriona  you dont know her  shes james mores daughter and a respectable young wumman the  miss grants think so  the lord advocates daughters  so there  cant be anything really wrong  pretty soon we all go to holland  and be hanged thence to dunkirk and be damned and the tale  concludes in paris and be pollparrotted  this is the last  authentic news  you are not a real hardworking novelist not a  practical novelist so you dont know the temptation to let your  characters maunder  dumas did it and lived  but it is not war  it aint sportsmanlike and i have to be stopping their chatter all  the time  browns appendix is great reading   my only grief is that i cant use the idolatrous occupant   yours ever  r l s  blessing and praising you for a useful though idolatrous occupant  of kensington    letter  to the countess of jersey    august 14 1745  to miss amelia balfour  my dear cousin  we are going an  expedition to leeward on tuesday morning  if a lady were perhaps  to be encountered on horseback  say towards the gasigasi river   about six am i think we should have an episode somewhat after  the style of the 45  what a misfortune my dear cousin that you  should have arrived while your cousin graham was occupying my only  guestchamber  for osterley park is not so large in samoa as it  was at home  but happily our friend haggard has found a corner for  you  the king over the water  the gasigasi water  will be pleased to  see the clan of balfour mustering so thick around his standard  i have one serious word been so lucky as to get a really secret  interpreter so all is for the best in our little adventure into  the waverley novels  i am your affectionate cousin  robert louis stevenson  observe the stealth with which i have blotted my signature but we  must be political a outrance    letter  to the countess of jersey    my dear cousin  i send for your information a copy of my last  letter to the gentleman in question  tis thought more wise in  consideration of the difficulty and peril of the enterprise that  we should leave the town in the afternoon and by several  detachments  if you would start for a ride with the master of  haggard and captain lockhart of lee say at three oclock of the  afternoon you would make some rencounters by the wayside which  might be agreeable to your political opinions  all present will be  staunch  the master of haggard might extend his ride a little and return  through the marsh and by the nuns house i trust that has the  proper flavour so as a little to diminish the effect of  separation  i remain your affectionate cousin to command  o tusitala  ps  it is to be thought this present year of grace will be  historical    letter  to mrs charles fairchild    vailima august 1892  my dear mrs fairchild  thank you a thousand times for your  letter  you are the angel of the sort of information that i  care about i appoint you successor to the newspaper press and i  beg of you whenever you wish to gird at the age or think the bugs  out of proportion to the roses or despair or enjoy any cosmic or  epochal emotion to sit down again and write to the hermit of  samoa  what do i think of it all  well i love the romantic  solemnity of youth and even in this form although not without  laughter i have to love it still  they are such ducks  but what  are they made of  we were just as solemn as that about atheism and  the stars and humanity but we were all for belief anyway  we held  atheism and sociology of which none of us nor indeed anybody  knew anything for a gospel and an iron rule of life and it was  lucky enough or there would have been more windows broken  what  is apt to puzzle one at first sight in the new youth is that with  such rickety and risky problems always at heart they should not  plunge down a niagara of dissolution  but let us remember the high  practical timidity of youth  i was a particularly brave boy  this  i think of myself looking back  and plunged into adventures and  experiments and ran risks that it still surprises me to recall   but dear me what a fear i was in of that strange blind machinery  in the midst of which i stood and with what a compressed heart and  what empty lungs i would touch a new crank and await developments   i do not mean to say i do not fear life still i do and that  terror for an adventurer like myself is still one of the chief  joys of living  but it was different indeed while i was yet girt with the priceless  robes of inexperience then the fear was exquisite and infinite   and so when you see all these little ibsens who seem at once so  dry and so excitable and faint in swathes over a play i suppose   for a wager that would seem to me merely tedious smile behind  your hand and remember the little dears are all in a blue funk   it must be very funny and to a spectator like yourself i almost  envy it  but never get desperate human nature is human nature  and the roman empire since the romans founded it and made our  european human nature what it is bids fair to go on and to be true  to itself  these little bodies will all grow up and become men and  women and have heaps of fun nay and are having it now and  whatever happens to the fashion of the age it makes no difference   there are always high and brave and amusing lives to be lived  and a change of key however exotic does not exclude melody  even  chinamen hard as we find it to believe enjoy being chinese  and  the chinaman stands alone to be unthinkable natural enough as the  representative of the only other great civilisation  take my  people here at my doors their life is a very good one it is quite  thinkable quite acceptable to us  and the little dears will be  soon skating on the other foot sooner or later in each  generation the onehalf of them at least begin to remember all the  material they had rejected when first they made and nailed up their  little theory of life and these become reactionaries or  conservatives and the ship of man begins to fill upon the other  tack  here is a sermon by your leave  it is your own fault you have  amused and interested me so much by your breath of the new youth  which comes to me from so far away where i live up here in my  mountain and secret messengers bring me letters from rebels and  the government sometimes seizes them and generally grumbles in its  beard that stevenson should really be deported  o my life is the  more lively never fear  it has recently been most amusingly varied by a visit from lady  jersey  i took her over mysteriously under the pseudonym of my  cousin miss amelia balfour to visit mataafa our rebel and we  had great fun and wrote a ouida novel on our life here in which  every author had to describe himself in the ouida glamour and of  which  for the jerseys intend printing it  i must let you have a  copy  my wifes chapter and my description of myself should i  think amuse you  but there were finer touches still as when  belle and lady jersey came out to brush their teeth in front of the  rebel kings palace and the night guard squatted opposite on the  grass and watched the process or when i and my interpreter and  the king with his secretary mysteriously disappeared to conspire   ever yours sincerely  r l stevenson    letter  to gordon browne    vailima samoa autumn 1892 to the artist who did the illustrations to uma  dear sir  i only know you under the initials g b but you have  done some exceedingly spirited and satisfactory illustrations to my  story the beach of falesa and i wish to write and thank you  expressly for the care and talent shown  such numbers of people  can do good black and whites  so few can illustrate a story or  apparently read it  you have shown that you can do both and your  creation of wiltshire is a real illumination of the text  it was  exactly so that wiltshire dressed and looked and you have the line  of his nose to a nicety  his nose is an inspiration  nor should i  forget to thank you for case particularly in his last appearance   it is a singular fact  which seems to point still more directly to  inspiration in your case  that your missionary actually resembles  the fleshandblood person from whom mr tarleton was drawn  the  general effect of the islands is all that could be wished indeed i  have but one criticism to make that in the background of case  taking the dollar from mr tarletons head  head  not hand as  the fools have printed it  the natives have a little too much the  look of africans  but the great affair is that you have been to the pains to  illustrate my story instead of making conscientious black and  whites of people sitting talking  i doubt if you have left  unrepresented a single pictorial incident  i am writing by this  mail to the editor in the hopes that i may buy from him the  originals and i am dear sir your very much obliged  robert louis stevenson    letter  to miss morse    vailima samoan islands october 7th 1892  dear madam  i have a great diffidence in answering your valued  letter  it would be difficult for me to express the feelings with  which i read it  and am now trying to reread it as i dictate  this  you ask me to forgive what you say must seem a liberty and i  find that i cannot thank you sufficiently or even find a word with  which to qualify your letter  dear madam such a communication  even the vainest man would think a sufficient reward for a lifetime  of labour  that i should have been able to give so much help and  pleasure to your sister is the subject of my grateful wonder  that she being dead and speaking with your pen should be able to  repay the debt with such a liberal interest is one of those things  that reconcile us with the world and make us take hope again  i do  not know what i have done to deserve so beautiful and touching a  compliment and i feel there is but one thing fit for me to say  here that i will try with renewed courage to go on in the same  path and to deserve if not to receive a similar return from  others  you apologise for speaking so much about yourselves  dear madam i  thought you did so too little  i should have wished to have known  more of those who were so sympathetic as to find a consolation in  my work and so graceful and so tactful as to acknowledge it in  such a letter as was yours  will you offer to your mother the expression of a sympathy which  coming from a stranger must seem very airy but which yet is  genuine and accept for yourself my gratitude for the thought which  inspired you to write to me and the words which you found to  express it  robert louis stevenson    letter  to e l burlingame    vailima plantation samoan islands oct 10th 1892  my dear burlingame  it is now as you see the 10th of october  and there has not reached the island of upolu one single copy or  rag of a copy of the samoa book  i lie there has come one and  that in the pocket of a missionary man who is at daggers drawn with  me who lends it to all my enemies conceals it from all my  friends and is bringing a lawsuit against me on the strength of  expressions in the same which i have forgotten and now cannot see   this is pretty tragic i think you will allow and i was inclined  to fancy it was the fault of the post office  but i hear from my  sisterinlaw mrs sanchez that she is in the same case and has  received no footnote  i have also to consider that i had no  letter from you last mail although you ought to have received by  that time my grandfather and scott and me and my grandfather   taking one consideration with another therefore i prefer to  conceive that no 743 broadway has fallen upon gentle and  continuous slumber and is become an enchanted palace among  publishing houses  if it be not so if the footnotes were really  sent i hope you will fall upon the post office with all the vigour  you possess  how does the wrecker go in the states  it seems to  be doing exceptionally well in england  yours sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to j m  barrie    vailima plantation samoan islands november 1st 1892  dear mr barrie  i can scarce thank you sufficiently for your  extremely amusing letter  no the auld licht idyls never reached  me  i wish it had and i wonder extremely whether it would not be  good for me to have a pennyworth of the auld licht pulpit  it is a  singular thing that i should live here in the south seas under  conditions so new and so striking and yet my imagination so  continually inhabit that cold old huddle of grey hills from which  we come  i have just finished david balfour i have another book  on the stocks the young chevalier which is to be part in france  and part in scotland and to deal with prince charlie about the  year 1749 and now what have i done but begun a third which is to  be all moorland together and is to have for a centrepiece a figure  that i think you will appreciate  that of the immortal braxfield   braxfield himself is my grand premier or since you are so much  involved in the british drama let me say my heavy lead     your descriptions of your dealings with lord rintoul are  frightfully unconscientious  you should never write about anybody  until you persuade yourself at least for the moment that you love  him above all anybody on whom your plot revolves  it will always  make a hole in the book and if he has anything to do with the  mechanism prove a stick in your machinery  but you know all this  better than i do and it is one of your most promising traits that  you do not take your powers too seriously  the little minister  ought to have ended badly we all know it did and we are  infinitely grateful to you for the grace and good feeling with  which you lied about it  if you had told the truth i for one  could never have forgiven you  as you had conceived and written  the earlier parts the truth about the end though indisputably  true to fact would have been a lie or what is worse a discord in  art  if you are going to make a book end badly it must end badly  from the beginning  now your book began to end well  you let  yourself fall in love with and fondle and smile at your puppets   once you had done that your honour was committed  at the cost of  truth to life you were bound to save them  it is the blot on  richard feverel for instance that it begins to end well and then  tricks you and ends ill  but in that case there is worse behind  for the illending does not inherently issue from the plot  the  story had in fact ended well after the great last interview  between richard and lucy  and the blind illogical bullet which  smashes all has no more to do between the boards than a fly has to  do with the room into whose open window it comes buzzing  it might  have so happened it needed not and unless needs must we have no  right to pain our readers  i have had a heavy case of conscience  of the same kind about my braxfield story  braxfield  only his  name is hermiston  has a son who is condemned to death plainly  there is a fine tempting fitness about this and i meant he was to  hang  but now on considering my minor characters i saw there were  five people who would  in a sense who must  break prison and  attempt his rescue  they were capable hardy folks too who might  very well succeed  why should they not then  why should not young  hermiston escape clear out of the country and be happy if he  could with his   but soft  i will not betray my secret of my  heroine  suffice it to breathe in your ear that she was what hardy  calls and others in their plain way dont a pure woman  much  virtue in a capital letter such as yours was  write to me again in my infinite distance  tell me about your new  book  no harm in telling me i am too far off to be indiscreet  there are too few near me who would care to hear  i am rushes by  the riverside and the stream is in babylon  breathe your secrets  to me fearlessly and if the trade wind caught and carried them  away there are none to catch them nearer than australia unless it  were the tropic birds  in the unavoidable absence of my  amanuensis who is buying eels for dinner i have thus concluded my  despatch like st paul with my own hand  and in the inimitable words of lord kames faur ye weel ye bitch   yours very truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to e l burlingame    vailima plantation nov 2nd 1892  my dear burlingame  in the first place i have to acknowledge  receipt of your munificent cheque for three hundred and fifty  dollars  glad you liked the scott voyage rather more than i did  upon the whole  as the proofs have not turned up at all there can  be no question of returning them and i am therefore very much  pleased to think you have arranged not to wait  the volumes of  adams arrived along with yours of october 6th  one of the  dictionaries has also blundered home apparently from the colonies  the other is still to seek  i note and sympathise with your  bewilderment as to falesa  my own direct correspondence with mr  baxter is now about three months in abeyance  altogether you see  how well it would be if you could do anything to wake up the post  office  not a single copy of the footnote has yet reached samoa  but i hear of one having come to its address in hawaii  glad to  hear good news of stoddard  yours sincerely  r l stevenson  ps  since the above was written an aftermath of post matter came  in among which were the proofs of my grandfather  i shall correct  and return them but as i have lost all confidence in the post  office i shall mention here  first galley 4th line from the  bottom for as read or  should i ever again have to use my work without waiting for proofs  bear in mind this golden principle  from a congenital defect i  must suppose i am unable to write the word or  wherever i write  it the printer unerringly puts as  and those who read for me had  better wherever it is possible substitute or for as  this the  more so since many writers have a habit of using as which is death  to my temper and confusion to my face  r l s    letter  to lieutenant eeles    vailima plantation upolu samoan islands november 15th 1892  dear eeles  in the first place excuse me writing to you by  another hand as that is the way in which alone all my  correspondence gets effected  before i took to this method or  rather before i found a victim it simply didnt get effected  thank you again and again first for your kind thought of writing  to me and second for your extremely amusing and interesting  letter  you can have no guess how immediately interesting it was  to our family  first of all the poor soul at nukufetau is an old  friend of ours and we have actually treated him ourselves on a  former visit to the island  i dont know if hoskin would approve  of our treatment it consisted i believe mostly in a present of  stout and a recommendation to put nails in his watertank  we also  as you seem to have done recommended him to leave the island and  i remember very well how wise and kind we thought his answer  he  had halfcaste children he said who would suffer and perhaps be  despised if he carried them elsewhere if he left them there alone  they would almost certainly miscarry and the best thing was that  he should stay and die with them  but the cream of the fun was  your meeting with burn  we not only know him but as the french  say we dont know anybody else he is our intimate and adored  original and  prepare your mind  he was is and ever will be  tommy haddon  as i dont believe you to be inspired i suspect you  to have suspected this  at least it was a mighty happy suspicion   you are quite right  tommy is really a good chap though about  as comic as they make them  i was extremely interested in your fiji legend and perhaps even  more so in your capital account of the curacoas misadventure   alas we have nothing so thrilling to relate  all hangs and fools  on in this isle of misgovernment without change though not  without novelty but wholly without hope unless perhaps you should  consider it hopeful that i am still more immediately threatened  with arrest  the confounded thing is that if it comes off i  shall be sent away in the ringarooma instead of the curacoa  the  former ship burst upon by the run  she had been sent off by  despatch and without orders  and to make me a little more easy in  my mind she brought newspapers clamouring for my incarceration   since then i have had a conversation with the german consul  he  said he had read a review of my samoa book and if the review were  fair must regard it as an insult and one that would have to be  resented  at the same time i learn that letters addressed to the  german squadron lie for them here in the post office  reports are  current of other english ships being on the way  i hope to  goodness yours will be among the number  and i gather from one  thing and another that there must be a holy row going on between  the powers at home and that the issue like all else connected  with samoa is on the knees of the gods  one thing however is  pretty sure  if that issue prove to be a german protectorate i  shall have to tramp  can you give us any advice as to a fresh  field of energy  we have been searching the atlas and it seems  difficult to fill the bill  how would rarotonga do  i forget if  you have been there  the best of it is that my new house is going  up like winking and i am dictating this letter to the  accompaniment of saws and hammers  a hundred black boys and about  a score draughtoxen perished or at least barely escaped with  their lives from the mudholes on our road bringing up the  materials  it will be a fine legacy to higms protectorate  and doubtless the governor will take it for his countryhouse  the  ringarooma people by the way seem very nice  i liked stansfield  particularly  our middy has gone up to san francisco in pursuit of the phantom  education  we have good word of him and i hope he will not be in  disgrace again as he was when the hope of the british navy  need  i say that i refer to admiral burney  honoured us last  the next  time you come as the new house will be finished we shall be able  to offer you a bed  nares and meiklejohn may like to hear that our  new room is to be big enough to dance in  it will be a very  pleasant day for me to see the curacoa in port again and at least a  proper contingent of her officers skipping in my all  we have just had a feast on my birthday at which we had three of  the ringaromas and i wish they had been three curacoas  say  yourself hoskin and burney the ever great  consider this an  invitation  our boys had got the thing up regardless  there were  two huge sows  oh brutes of animals that would have broken down a  hansom cab  four smaller pigs two barrels of beef and a horror  of vegetables and fowls  we sat down between forty and fifty in a  big new native house behind the kitchen that you have never seen  and ate and public spoke till all was blue  then we had about half  an hours holiday with some beer and sherry and brandy and soda to  restrengthen the european heart and then out to the old native  house to see a siva  finally all the guests were packed off in a  trackless black night and down a road that was rather fitted for  the curacoa than any human pedestrian though to be sure i do not  know the draught of the curacoa  my ladies one and all desire to  be particularly remembered to our friends on board and all look  forward as i do myself in the hope of your return  yours  sincerely  robert louis stevenson  and let me hear from you again    letter  to charles baxter    1st dec 92     i have a novel on the stocks to be called the justiceclerk   it is pretty scotch the grand premier is taken from braxfield   oh by the by send me cockburns memorials  and some of the  story is  well  queer  the heroine is seduced by one man and  finally disappears with the other man who shot him    mind you  i expect the justiceclerk to be my masterpiece  my braxfield is  already a thing of beauty and a joy for ever and so far as he has  gone far my best character  later  second thought  i wish pitcairns criminal trials quam primum   also an absolutely correct text of the scots judiciary oath  also in case pitcairn does not come down late enough i wish as  full a report as possible of a scotch murder trial between 1790 1820  understand the fullest possible  is there any book which would guide me as to the following facts  the justiceclerk tries some people capitally on circuit  certain  evidence cropping up the charge is transferred to the jcs own  son  of course in the next trial the jc is excluded and the  case is called before the lordjustice general  where would this trial have to be  i fear in edinburgh which  would not suit my view  could it be again at the circuit town  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs jenkin    december 5th 1892  my dear mrs jenkin     so much said i come with guilty speed  to what more immediately concerns myself  spare us a month or two  for old sakes sake and make my wife and me happy and proud  we  are only fourteen days from san francisco just about a month from  liverpool we have our new house almost finished  the thing can be  done i believe we can make you almost comfortable  it is the  loveliest climate in the world our political troubles seem near an  end  it can be done it must  do please make a virtuous effort  come and take a glimpse of a new world i am sure you do not dream  of and some old friends who do often dream of your arrival  alas i was just beginning to get eloquent and there goes the  lunch bell and after lunch i must make up the mail  do come  you must not come in february or march  bad months   from april on it is delightful  your sincere friend  robert louis stevenson    letter  to henry james    december 5th 1892  my dear james  how comes it so great a silence has fallen  the  still small voice of selfapproval whispers me it is not from me   i have looked up my register and find i have neither written to  you nor heard from you since june 22nd on which day of grace that  invaluable work began  this is not as it should be  how to get  back  i remember acknowledging with rapture the  of the master  and i remember receiving marbot  was that our last relation  hey well anyway as you may have probably gathered from the  papers i have been in devilish hot water and what may be new to  you devilish hard at work  in twelve calendar months i finished  the wrecker wrote all of falesa but the first chapter well much  of the history of samoa did something here and there to my life  of my grandfather and began and finished david balfour  what do  you think of it for a year  since then i may say i have done  nothing beyond draft three chapters of another novel the justice clerk which ought to be shorter and a blower  at least if it  dont make a spoon it will spoil the horn of an aurochs if thats  how it should be spelt  on the hot water side it may entertain you to know that i have been  actually sentenced to deportation by my friends on mulinuu c j  cedercrantz and baron senfft von pilsach  the awful doom  however declined to fall owing to circumstances over which  i  only heard of it so to speak last night  i mean officially but  i had walked among rumours  the whole tale will be some day put  into my hand and i shall share it with humorous friends  it is likely however by my judgment that this epoch of gaiety in  samoa will soon cease and the fierce white light of history will  beat no longer on yours sincerely and his fellows here on the  beach  we ask ourselves whether the reason will more rejoice over  the end of a disgraceful business or the unregenerate man more  sorrow over the stoppage of the fun  for say what you please it  has been a deeply interesting time  you dont know what news is  nor what politics nor what the life of man till you see it on so  small a scale and with your own liberty on the board for stake  i  would not have missed it for much  and anxious friends beg me to  stay at home and study human nature in brompton drawingrooms   farceurs  and anyway you know that such is not my talent  i could  never be induced to take the faintest interest in brompton qua  brompton or a drawingroom qua a drawingroom  i am an epick  writer with a k to it but without the necessary genius  hurry up with another book of stories  i am now reduced to two of  my contemporaries you and barrie  o and kipling  you and barrie  and kipling are now my muses three  and with kipling as you know  there are reservations to be made  and you and barrie dont write  enough  i should say i also read anstey when he is serious and  can almost always get a happy day out of marion crawford  ce nest  pas toujours la guerre but its got life to it and guts and it  moves  did you read the witch of prague  nobody could read it  twice of course and the first time even it was necessary to skip   e pur si muove  but barrie is a beauty the little minister and  the window in thrums eh  stuff in that young man but he must see  and not be too funny  genius in him but theres a journalist at  his elbow  theres the risk  look what a page is the glove  business in the window knocks a man flat thats guts if you  please  why have i wasted the little time that is left with a sort of naked  review article  i dont know im sure  i suppose a mere  ebullition of congested literary talk i am beginning to think a  visit from friends would be due  wish you could come  let us have your news anyway and forgive this silly stale  effusion  yours ever  robert louis stevenson    letter  to j m barrie    vailima december 1892  dear j m barrie  you will be sick of me soon i cannot help it   i have been off my work for some time and reread the edinburgh  eleven and had a great mind to write a parody and give you all  your sauce back again and see how you would like it yourself  and  then i read for the first time  i know not how the window in  thrums i dont say that it is better than the minister its less  of a tale  and there is a beauty a material beauty of the tale  ipse which clever critics nowadays long and love to forget it has  more real flaws but somehow it is  well i read it last anyway  and its by barrie  and hes the man for my money  the glove is a  great page it is startlingly original and as true as death and  judgment  tibbie birse in the burial is great but i think it was  a journalist that got in the word official  the same character  plainly had a word to say to thomas haggard  thomas affects me as  a lie  i beg your pardon doubtless he was somebody you knew that  leads people so far astray  the actual is not the true  i am proud to think you are a scotchman  though to be sure i know  nothing of that country being only an english tourist quo gavin  ogilvy  i commend the hard case of mr gavin ogilvy to j m  barrie whose work is to me a source of living pleasure and  heartfelt national pride  there are two of us now that the shirra  might have patted on the head  and please do not think when i thus  seem to bracket myself with you that i am wholly blinded with  vanity  jess is beyond my frontier line i could not touch her  skirt i have no such glamour of twilight on my pen  i am a  capable artist but it begins to look to me as if you were a man of  genius  take care of yourself for my sake  its a devilish hard  thing for a man who writes so many novels as i do that i should  get so few to read  and i can read yours and i love them  a pity for you that my amanuensis is not on stock today and my  own hand perceptibly worse than usual  yours  robert louis stevenson  december 5th 1892  ps  they tell me your health is not strong  man come out here  and try the prophets chamber  theres only one bad point to us   we do rise early  the amanuensis states that you are a lover of  silence  and that ours is a noisy house  and she is a chatterbox   i am not answerable for these statements though i do think there  is a touch of garrulity about my premises  we have so little to  talk about you see  the house is three miles from town in the  midst of great silent forests  there is a burn close by and when  we are not talking you can hear the burn and the birds and the  sea breaking on the coast three miles away and six hundred feet  below us and about three times a month a bell  i dont know where  the bell is nor who rings it it may be the bell in hans  andersens story for all i know  it is never hot here  86 in the  shade is about our hottest  and it is never cold except just in  the early mornings  take it for all in all i suppose this island  climate to be by far the healthiest in the world  even the  influenza entirely lost its sting  only two patients died and one  was a man nearly eighty and the other a child below four months   i wont tell you if it is beautiful for i want you to come here  and see for yourself  everybody on the premises except my wife has  some scotch blood in their veins  i beg your pardon  except the  natives  and then my wife is a dutchwoman  and the natives are  the next thing conceivable to highlanders before the fortyfive   we would have some grand cracks  r l s  come it will broaden your mind and be the making of me     chapter xii  life in samoa continued january 1893december 1894     letter  to charles baxter    april 1893     about the justiceclerk i long to go at it but will first  try to get a short story done  since january i have had two severe  illnesses my boy and some heartbreaking anxiety over fanny and  am only now convalescing  i came down to dinner last night for the  first time and that only because the service had broken down and  to relieve an inexperienced servant  nearly four months now i have  rested my brains and if it be true that rest is good for brains i  ought to be able to pitch in like a giant refreshed  before the  autumn i hope to send you some justiceclerk or weir of  hermiston as colvin seems to prefer i own to indecision   received syntax dance of death and pitcairn which last i have  read from end to end since its arrival with vast improvement   what a pity it stops so soon  i wonder is there nothing that seems  to prolong the series  why doesnt some young man take it up  how  about my old friend fountainhalls decisions  i remember as a boy  that there was some good reading there  perhaps you could borrow  me that and send it on loan and perhaps laings memorials  therewith and a work im ashamed to say i have never read  balfours letters    i have come by accident through a  correspondent on one very curious and interesting fact  namely  that stevenson was one of the names adopted by the macgregors at  the proscription  the details supplied by my correspondent are  both convincing and amusing but it would be highly interesting to  find out more of this  r l s    letter  to a conan doyle    vailima apia samoa april 5th 1893  dear sir  you have taken many occasions to make yourself very  agreeable to me for which i might in decency have thanked you  earlier  it is now my turn and i hope you will allow me to offer  you my compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting  adventures of sherlock holmes  that is the class of literature  that i like when i have the toothache  as a matter of fact it was  a pleurisy i was enjoying when i took the volume up and it will  interest you as a medical man to know that the cure was for the  moment effectual  only the one thing troubles me  can this be my  old friend joe bell  i am yours very truly  robert louis stevenson  ps  and lo here is your address supplied me here in samoa  but  do not take mine o frolic fellow spookist from the same source  mine is wrong  r l s    letter  to s r crockett    vailima samoa may 17th 1893  dear mr crockett  i do not owe you two letters nor yet nearly  one sir  the last time i heard of you you wrote about an  accident and i sent you a letter to my lawyer charles baxter  which does not seem to have been presented as i see nothing of it  in his accounts  query was that lost  i should not like you to  think i had been so unmannerly and so inhuman  if you have written  since your letter also has miscarried as is much the rule in this  part of the world unless you register  your book is not yet to hand but will probably follow next month   i detected you early in the bookman which i usually see and noted  you in particular as displaying a monstrous ingratitude about the  footnote  well mankind is ungrateful mans ingratitude to man  makes countless thousands mourn quo rab  or words to that  effect  by the way an anecdote of a cautious sailor  bill  bill says i to him or words to that effect  i shall never take that walk by the fishers tryst and glencorse   i shall never see auld reekie  i shall never set my foot again  upon the heather  here i am until i die and here will i be  buried  the word is out and the doom written  or if i do come  it will be a voyage to a further goal and in fact a suicide  which however if i could get my family all fixed up in the money  way i might perhaps perform or attempt  but there is a plaguey  risk of breaking down by the way and i believe i shall stay here  until the end comes like a good boy as i am  if i did it i  should put upon my trunks  passenger to  hades  how strangely  wrong your information is  in the first place i should never  carry a novel to sydney i should post it from here  in the second  place weir of hermiston is as yet scarce begun  its going to be  excellent no doubt but it consists of about twenty pages  i have  a tale a shortish tale in length but it has proved long to do  the ebb tide some part of which goes home this mail  it is by me  and mr osbourne and is really a singular work  there are only  four characters and three of them are bandits  well two of them  are and the third is their comrade and accomplice  it sounds  cheering doesnt it  barratry and drunkenness and vitriol and  i cannot tell you all what are the beams of the roof  and yet  i  dont know  i sort of think theres something in it  youll see  which is more than i ever can whether davis and attwater come off  or not  weir of hermiston is a much greater undertaking and the plot is  not good i fear but lord justiceclerk hermiston ought to be a  plum  of other schemes more or less executed it skills not to  speak  i am glad to hear so good an account of your activity and  interests and shall always hear from you with pleasure though i  am and must continue a mere sprite of the inkbottle unseen in  the flesh  please remember me to your wife and to the fouryear old sweetheart if she be not too engrossed with higher matters   do you know where the road crosses the burn under glencorse church   go there and say a prayer for me  moriturus salutat  see that  its a sunny day i would like it to be a sunday but thats not  possible in the premises and stand on the righthand bank just  where the road goes down into the water and shut your eyes and if  i dont appear to you well it cant be helped and will be  extremely funny  i have no concern here but to work and to keep an eye on this  distracted people  i live just now wholly alone in an upper room  of my house because the whole family are down with influenza bar  my wife and myself  i get my horse up sometimes in the afternoon  and have a ride in the woods and i sit here and smoke and write  and rewrite and destroy and rage at my own impotence from six in  the morning till eight at night with trifling and not always  agreeable intervals for meals  i am sure you chose wisely to keep your country charge  there a  minister can be something not in a town  in a town the most of  them are empty houses  and public speakers  why should you  suppose your book will be slated because you have no friends  a  new writer if he is any good will be acclaimed generally with  more noise than he deserves  but by this time you will know for  certain  i am yours sincerely  robert louis stevenson  ps  be it known to this fluent generation that i r l s in  the fortythird of my age and the twentieth of my professional  life wrote twentyfour pages in twentyone days working from six  to eleven and again in the afternoon from two to four or so  without fail or interruption  such are the gifts the gods have  endowed us withal  such was the facility of this prolific writer  r l s    letter  to augustus st gaudens    vailima samoa may 29th 1893  my dear godlike sculptor  i wish in the most delicate manner in  the world to insinuate a few commissions  no 1 is for a couple of copies of my medallion as giltedged and  hightoned as it is possible to make them  one is for our house  here and should be addressed as above  the other is for my friend  sidney colvin and should be addressed  sidney colvin esq  keeper of the print room british museum london  no 2 this is a rather large order and demands some explanation   our house is lined with varnished wood of a dark ruddy colour very  beautiful to see at the same time it calls very much for gold  there is a limit to picture frames and really you know there has  to be a limit to the pictures you put inside of them  accordingly  we have had an idea of a certain kind of decoration which i  think you might help us to make practical  what we want is an  alphabet of gilt letters very much such as people play with and  all mounted on spikes like drawingpins say two spikes to each  letter one at top and one at bottom  say that they were this  height                 i                i                i  and that you chose a model of some really exquisitely fine clear  type from some roman monument and that they were made either of  metal or some composition gilt  the point is could not you in  your land of wooden houses get a manufacturer to take the idea and  manufacture them at a venture so that i could get two or three  hundred pieces or so at a moderate figure  you see suppose you  entertain an honoured guest when he goes he leaves his name in  gilt letters on your walls an infinity of fun and decoration can  be got out of hospitable and festive mottoes and the doors of  every room can be beautified by the legend of their names  i  really think there is something in the idea and you might be able  to push it with the brutal and licentious manufacturer using my  name if necessary though i should think the name of the godlike  sculptor would be more germane  in case you should get it started  i should tell you that we should require commas in order to write  the samoan language which is full of words written thus  lau  tie tie  as the samoan language uses but a very small proportion  of the consonants we should require a double or treble stock of  all vowels and of f g l u n p s t and v  the other day in sydney i think you might be interested to hear i  was sculpt a second time by a man called  as well as i can  remember and read  i mustnt criticise a present and he had very  little time to do it in  it is thought by my family to be an  excellent likeness of mark twain  this poor fellow by the by met  with the devil of an accident  a model of a statue which he had  just finished with a desperate effort was smashed to smithereens on  its way to exhibition  please be sure and let me know if anything is likely to come of  this letter business and the exact cost of each letter so that i  may count the cost before ordering  yours sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to edmund gosse    june 10th 1893  my dear gosse  my mother tells me you never received the very  long and careful letter that i sent you more than a year ago or is  it two years  i was indeed so much surprised at your silence that i wrote to  henry james and begged him to inquire if you had received it his  reply was an if possible higher power of the same silence  whereupon i bowed my head and acquiesced  but there is no doubt  the letter was written and sent and i am sorry it was lost for it  contained among other things an irrecoverable criticism of your  fathers life with a number of suggestions for another edition  which struck me at the time as excellent  well suppose we call that cried off and begin as before  it is  fortunate indeed that we can do so being both for a while longer  in the day  but alas when i see works of the late j a s  i  can see no help and no reconciliation possible  i wrote him a  letter i think three years ago heard in some roundabout way that  he had received it waited in vain for an answer which had  probably miscarried and in a humour between frowns and smiles  wrote to him no more  and now the strange poignant pathetic  brilliant creature is gone into the night and the voice is silent  that uttered so much excellent discourse and i am sorry that i did  not write to him again  yet i am glad for him light lie the turf   the saturday is the only obituary i have seen and i thought it  very good upon the whole  i should be half tempted to write an in  memoriam but i am submerged with other work  are you going to do  it  i very much admire your efforts that way you are our only  academician  so you have tried fiction  i will tell you the truth  when i saw  it announced i was so sure you would send it to me that i did not  order it  but the order goes this mail and i will give you news  of it  yes honestly fiction is very difficult it is a terrible  strain to carry your characters all that time  and the difficulty  of according the narrative and the dialogue in a work in the third  person is extreme  that is one reason out of half a dozen why i  so often prefer the first  it is much in my mind just now because  of my last work just off the stocks three days ago the ebb tide   a dreadful grimy business in the third person where the strain  between a vilely realistic dialogue and a narrative style pitched  about in phrase four notes higher than it should have been has  sown my head with grey hairs or i believe so  if my head escaped  my heart has them  the truth is i have a little lost my way and stand bemused at the  crossroads  a subject  ay i have dozens i have at least four  novels begun they are none good enough and the mill waits and  ill have to take second best  the ebb tide i make the world a  present of i expect and i suppose deserve to be torn to pieces  but there was all that good work lying useless and i had to finish  it  all your news of your family is pleasant to hear  my wife has been  very ill but is now better i may say i am ditto the ebb tide  having left me high and dry which is a good example of the mixed  metaphor  our home and estate and our boys and the politics of  the island keep us perpetually amused and busy and i grind away  with an odd dogged down sensation  and an idea in petto that the  game is about played out  i have got too realistic and i must  break the trammels  i mean i would if i could but the yoke is  heavy  i saw with amusement that zola says the same thing and  truly the debacle was a mighty big book i have no need for a  bigger though the last part is a mere mistake in my opinion  but  the emperor and sedan and the doctor at the ambulance and the  horses in the field of battle lord how gripped it is  what an  epical performance  according to my usual opinion i believe i  could go over that book and leave a masterpiece by blotting and no  ulterior art  but that is an old story ever new with me  taine  gone and renan and symonds and tennyson and browning the suns  go swiftly out and i see no suns to follow nothing but a  universal twilight of the demidivinities with parties like you  and me and lang beating on toy drums and playing on penny whistles  about glowworms  but zola is big anyway he has plenty in his  belly too much that is all he wrote the debacle and he wrote la  bete humaine perhaps the most excruciatingly silly book that i  ever read to an end  and why did i read it to an end w e g   because the animal in me was interested in the lewdness  not  sincerely of course my mind refusing to partake in it but the  flesh was slightly pleased  and when it was done i cast it from  me with a peal of laughter and forgot it as i would forget a  montepin  taine is to me perhaps the chief of these losses i did  luxuriate in his origines it was something beyond literature not  quite so good if you please but so much more systematic and the  pages that had to be written always so adequate  robespierre  napoleon were both excellent good  june 18th 93  well i have left fiction wholly and gone to my grandfather and  on the whole found peace  by next month my grandfather will begin  to be quite grown up  i have already three chapters about as good  as done by which of course as you know i mean till further  notice or the next discovery  i like biography far better than  fiction myself  fiction is too free  in biography you have your  little handful of facts little bits of a puzzle and you sit and  think and fit em together this way and that and get up and throw  em down and say damn and go out for a walk  and its real  soothing and when done gives an idea of finish to the writer that  is very peaceful  of course its not really so finished as quite  a rotten novel it always has and always must have the incurable  illogicalities of life about it the fathoms of slack and the miles  of tedium  still thats where the fun comes in and when you have  at last managed to shut up the castle spectre dulness the very  outside of his door looks beautiful by contrast  there are pages  in these books that may seem nothing to the reader but you  remember what they were you know what they might have been and  they seem to you witty beyond comparison  in my grandfather ive  had for instance to give up the temporal order almost entirely  doubtless the temporal order is the great foe of the biographer it  is so tempting so easy and lo there you are in the bog  ever  yours  r l stevenson  with all kind messages from self and wife to you and yours  my  wife is very much better having been the early part of this year  alarmingly ill  she is now all right only complaining of trifles  annoying to her but happily not interesting to her friends  i am  in a hideous state having stopped drink and smoking yes both   no wine no tobacco and the dreadful part of it is that  looking  forward  i have  what shall i say  nauseating intimations that  it ought to be for ever    letter  to henry james    vailima plantation samoan islands june 17th 1893  my dear henry james  i believe i have neglected a mail in  answering yours  you will be very sorry to hear that my wife was  exceedingly ill and very glad to hear that she is better  i  cannot say that i feel any more anxiety about her  we shall send  you a photograph of her taken in sydney in her customary island  habit as she walks and gardens and shrilly drills her brown  assistants  she was very ill when she sat for it which may a  little explain the appearance of the photograph  it reminds me of  a friend of my grandmothers who used to say when talking to  younger women aweel when i was young i wasnae just exactly what  ye wad call bonny but i was pale penetratin and interestin   i would not venture to hint that fanny is no bonny but there is  no doubt but that in this presentment she is pale penetratin  and interesting  as you are aware i have been wading deep waters and contending  with the great ones of the earth not wholly without success  it  is you may be interested to hear a dreary and infuriating  business  if you can get the fools to admit one thing they will  always save their face by denying another  if you can induce them  to take a step to the right hand they generally indemnify  themselves by cutting a caper to the left  i always held upon no  evidence whatever from a mere sentiment or intuition that  politics was the dirtiest the most foolish and the most random of  human employments  i always held but now i know it  fortunately  you have nothing to do with anything of the kind and i may spare  you the horror of further details  i received from you a book by a man by the name of anatole france   why should i disguise it  i have no use for anatole  he writes  very prettily and then afterwards  baron marbot was a different  pair of shoes  so likewise is the baron de vitrolles whom i am  now perusing with delight  his escape in 1814 is one of the best  pages i remember anywhere to have read  but marbot and vitrolles  are dead and what has become of the living  it seems as if  literature were coming to a stand  i am sure it is with me and i  am sure everybody will say so when they have the privilege of  reading the ebb tide  my dear man the grimness of that story is  not to be depicted in words  there are only four characters to be  sure but they are such a troop of swine  and their behaviour is  really so deeply beneath any possible standard that on a  retrospect i wonder i have been able to endure them myself until  the yarn was finished  well there is always one thing it will  serve as a touchstone  if the admirers of zola admire him for his  pertinent ugliness and pessimism i think they should admire this  but if as i have long suspected they neither admire nor  understand the mans art and only wallow in his rancidness like a  hound in offal then they will certainly be disappointed in the ebb  tide  alas poor little tale it is not even rancid  by way of an antidote or febrifuge i am going on at a great rate  with my history of the stevensons which i hope may prove rather  amusing in some parts at least  the excess of materials weighs  upon me  my grandfather is a delightful comedy part and i have to  treat him besides as a serious and in his way a heroic figure  and at times i lose my way and i fear in the end will blur the  effect  however a la grace de dieu  ill make a spoon or spoil a  horn  you see i have to do the building of the bell rock by  cutting down and packing my grandsires book which i rather hope i  have done but do not know  and it makes a huge chunk of a very  different style and quality between chapters ii and iv  and it  cant be helped  it is just a delightful and exasperating  necessity  you know the stuff is really excellent narrative   only perhaps theres too much of it  there is the rub  well  well it will be plain to you that my mind is affected it might be  with less  the ebb tide and northern lights are a full meal for  any plain man  i have written and ordered your last book the real thing so be  sure and dont send it  what else are you doing or thinking of  doing  news i have none and dont want any  i have had to stop  all strong drink and all tobacco and am now in a transition state  between the two which seems to be near madness  you never smoked  i think so you can never taste the joys of stopping it  but at  least you have drunk and you can enter perhaps into my annoyance  when i suddenly find a glass of claret or a brandyandwater give  me a splitting headache the next morning  no mistake about it  drink anything and theres your headache  tobacco just as bad for  me  if i live through this breach of habit i shall be a white livered puppy indeed  actually i am so made or so twisted that i  do not like to think of a life without the red wine on the table  and the tobacco with its lovely little coal of fire  it doesnt  amuse me from a distance  i may find it the garden of eden when i  go in but i dont like the colour of the gateposts  suppose  somebody said to you you are to leave your home and your books  and your clubs and go out and camp in midafrica and command an  expedition you would howl and kick and flee  i think the same  of a life without wine and tobacco and if this goes on ive got  to go and do it sir in the living flesh  i thought bourget was a friend of yours  and i thought the french  were a polite race  he has taken my dedication with a stately  silence that has surprised me into apoplexy  did i go and dedicate  my book to the nasty alien and the norrid frenchman and the  bloody furrineer  well i wouldnt do it again and unless his  case is susceptible of explanation you might perhaps tell him so  over the walnuts and the wine by way of speeding the gay hours   sincerely i thought my dedication worth a letter  if anything be worth anything here below  do you know the story of  the man who found a button in his hash and called the waiter   what do you call that says he  well said the waiter what  dyou expect  expect to find a gold watch and chain  heavenly  apologue is it not  i expected rather to find a gold watch and  chain i expected to be able to smoke to excess and drink to  comfort all the days of my life and i am still indignantly staring  on this button  its not even a button its a teetotal badge   ever yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to henry james    apia july 1893  my dear henry james  yes  les trophees on the whole a book   it is excellent but is it a lifes work  i always suspect you of  a volume of sonnets up your sleeve when is it coming down  i am  in one of my moods of wholesale impatience with all fiction and all  verging on it reading instead with rapture fountainhalls  decisions  you never read it  well it hasnt much form and is  inexpressibly dreary i should suppose to others  and even to me  for pages  its like walking in a mine underground and with a  damned bad lantern and picking out pieces of ore  this and war  will be my excuse for not having read your doubtless charming  work of fiction  the revolving year will bring me round to it and  i know when fiction shall begin to feel a little solid to me  again that i shall love it because its james  do you know when  i am in this mood i would rather try to read a bad book  its not  so disappointing anyway  and fountainhall is prime two big folio  volumes and all dreary and all true and all as terse as an  obituary and about one interesting fact on an average in twenty  pages and ten of them unintelligible for technicalities  theres  literature if you like  it feeds it falls about you genuine like  rain  rain  nobody has done justice to rain in literature yet   surely a subject for a scot  but then you cant do rain in that  ledgerbook style that i am trying for  or between a ledgerbook  and an old ballad  how to get over how to escape from the  besotting particularity of fiction  roland approached the house  it had green doors and window blinds and there was a scraper on  the upper step  to hell with roland and the scraper  yours  ever  r l s    letter  to a conan doyle    vailima july 12 1893  my dear dr conan doyle  the white company has not yet turned up  but when it does  which i suppose will be next mail  you shall  hear news of me  i have a great talent for compliment accompanied  by a hateful even a diabolic frankness  delighted to hear i have a chance of seeing you and mrs doyle  mrs stevenson bids me say what is too true that our rations are  often spare  are you great eaters  please reply  as to ways and means here is what you will have to do  leave san  francisco by the down mail get off at samoa and twelve days or a  fortnight later you can continue your journey to auckland per  upolu which will give you a look at tonga and possibly fiji by the  way  make this a first part of your plans  a fortnight even of  vailima diet could kill nobody  we are in the midst of war here rather a nasty business with the  headtaking and there seem signs of other trouble  but i believe  you need make no change in your design to visit us  all should be  well over and if it were not why you need not leave the steamer   yours very truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to charles baxter    19th july 93     we are in the thick of war  see illustrated london news  we  have only two outside boys left to us  nothing is doing and per  contra little paying    my life here is dear but i can live  within my income for a time at least  so long as my prices keep up   and it seems a clear duty to waste none of it on gadding about      my life of my family fills up intervals and should be an  excellent book when it is done but big damnably big  my dear old man i perceive by a thousand signs that we grow old  and are soon to pass away  i hope with dignity if not with  courage at least  i am myself very ready or would be  will be   when i have made a little money for my folks  the blows that have  fallen upon you are truly terrifying i wish you strength to bear  them  it is strange i must seem to you to blaze in a birmingham  prosperity and happiness and to myself i seem a failure  the  truth is i have never got over the last influenza yet and am  miserably out of heart and out of kilter  lungs pretty right  stomach nowhere spirits a good deal overshadowed but well come  through it yet and cock our bonnets  i confess with sorrow that  i am not yet quite sure about the intellects but i hope it is only  one of my usual periods of nonwork  they are more unbearable now  because i cannot rest  no rest but the grave for sir walter  o  the words ring in a mans head  r l s    letter  to a conan doyle    vailima august 23rd 1893  my dear dr conan doyle  i am reposing after a somewhat severe  experience upon which i think it my duty to report to you   immediately after dinner this evening it occurred to me to re narrate to my native overseer simele your story of the engineers  thumb  and sir i have done it  it was necessary i need hardly  say to go somewhat farther afield than you have done  to explain  for instance what a railway is what a steam hammer what a coach  and horse what coining what a criminal and what the police  i  pass over other and no less necessary explanations  but i did  actually succeed and if you could have seen the drawn anxious  features and the bright feverish eyes of simele you would have  for the moment at least tasted glory  you might perhaps think  that were you to come to samoa you might be introduced as the  author of the engineers thumb  disabuse yourself  they do not  know what it is to make up a story  the engineers thumb god  forgive me was narrated as a piece of actual and factual history   nay and more i who write to you have had the indiscretion to  perpetrate a trifling piece of fiction entitled the bottle imp   parties who come up to visit my unpretentious mansion after having  admired the ceilings by vanderputty and the tapestry by gobbling  manifest towards the end a certain uneasiness which proves them to  be fellows of an infinite delicacy  they may be seen to shrug a  brown shoulder to roll up a speaking eye and at last secret  bursts from them  where is the bottle  alas my friends i feel  tempted to say you will find it by the engineers thumb  talofa soifuia  oau o lau no moni o tusitala

struck me as quite good  have you any  document for the decapitation  it sounds steepish  the devil of  all that first part is that you see old dumas yet your louis xiv  is distinctly good  i am much interested with this book which  fulfils a good deal and promises more  question  how far a  historical novel should be wholly episodic  i incline to that  view with trembling  i shake hands with you on old murat  r l s    letter  to george meredith    sept 5th 1893 vailima plantation upolu samoa  my dear meredith  i have again and again taken up the pen to  write to you and many beginnings have gone into the waste paper  basket i have one now  for the second time in my life  and feel  a big man on the strength of it  and no doubt it requires some  decision to break so long a silence  my health is vastly restored  and i am now living patriarchally in this place six hundred feet  above the sea on the shoulder of a mountain of 1500  behind me  the unbroken bush slopes up to the backbone of the island 3 to  4000 without a house with no inhabitants save a few runaway black  boys wild pigs and cattle and wild doves and flying foxes and  many particoloured birds and many black and many white  a very  eerie dim strange place and hard to travel  i am the head of a  household of five whites and of twelve samoans to all of whom i  am the chief and father  my cook comes to me and asks leave to  marry  and his mother a fine old chief woman who has never lived  here does the same  you may be sure i granted the petition  it  is a life of great interest complicated by the tower of babel  that old enemy  and i have all the time on my hands for literary  work  my house is a great place we have a hall fifty feet long  with a great redwood stair ascending from it where we dine in  state  myself usually dressed in a singlet and a pair of trousers   and attended on by servants in a single garment a kind of kilt   also flowers and leaves  and their hair often powdered with lime   the european who came upon it suddenly would think it was a dream   we have prayers on sunday night  i am a perfect pariah in the  island not to have them oftener but the spirit is unwilling and  the flesh proud and i cannot go it more  it is strange to see the  long line of the brown folk crouched along the wall with lanterns  at intervals before them in the big shadowy hall with an oak  cabinet at one end of it and a group of rodins which native taste  regards as prodigieusement leste presiding over all from the top   and to hear the long rambling samoan hymn rolling up god bless me  what style  but i am off business today and this is not meant to  be literature  i have asked colvin to send you a copy of catriona which i am  sometimes tempted to think is about my best work  i hear word  occasionally of the amazing marriage  it will be a brave day for  me when i get hold of it  gower woodseer is now an ancient lean  grim exiled scot living and labouring as for a wager in the  tropics still active still with lots of fire in him but the  youth  ah the youth where is it  for years after i came here  the critics those genial gentlemen used to deplore the relaxation  of my fibre and the idleness to which i had succumbed  i hear less  of this now the next thing is they will tell me i am writing  myself out and that my unconscientious conduct is bringing their  grey hairs with sorrow to the dust  i do not know  i mean i do  know one thing  for fourteen years i have not had a days real  health i have wakened sick and gone to bed weary and i have done  my work unflinchingly  i have written in bed and written out of  it written in hemorrhages written in sickness written torn by  coughing written when my head swam for weakness and for so long  it seems to me i have won my wager and recovered my glove  i am  better now have been rightly speaking since first i came to the  pacific and still few are the days when i am not in some physical  distress  and the battle goes on  ill or well is a trifle so as  it goes  i was made for a contest and the powers have so willed  that my battlefield should be this dingy inglorious one of the bed  and the physic bottle  at least i have not failed but i would  have preferred a place of trumpetings and the open air over my  head  this is a devilish egotistical yarn  will you try to imitate me in  that if the spirit ever moves you to reply  and meantime be sure  that away in the midst of the pacific there is a house on a wooded  island where the name of george meredith is very dear and his  memory since it must be no more is continually honoured  ever  your friend  robert louis stevenson  remember me to mariette if you please and my wife sends her most  kind remembrances to yourself  r l s    letter  to augustus st gaudens    vailima september 1893  my dear st gaudens  i had determined not to write to you till i  had seen the medallion but it looks as if that might mean the  greek kalends or the day after tomorrow  reassure yourself your  part is done it is ours that halts  the consideration of  conveyance over our sweet little road on boys backs for we cannot  very well apply the horses to this work there is only one you  cannot put it in a panier to put it on the horses back we have  not the heart  beneath the beauty of r l s to say nothing of  his verses which the publishers find heavy enough and the genius  of the godlike sculptor the spine would snap and the wellknit  limbs of the ahem carthorse would be loosed by death  so you  are to conceive me sitting in my house dubitative and the  medallion chuckling in the warehouse of the german firm for some  days longer and hear me meanwhile on the golden letters  alas they are all my fancy painted but the price is prohibitive   i cannot do it  it is another daydream burst  another gable of  abbotsford has gone down fortunately before it was builded so  theres nobody injured  except me  i had a strong conviction that  i was a great hand at writing inscriptions and meant to exhibit  and test my genius on the walls of my house and now i see i cant   it is generally thus  the battle of the golden letters will never  be delivered  on making preparation to open the campaign the king  found himself face to face with invincible difficulties in which  the rapacity of a mercenary soldiery and the complaints of an  impoverished treasury played an equal part  ever yours  robert louis stevenson  i enclose a bill for the medallion have been trying to find your  letter quite in vain and therefore must request you to pay for  the bronze letters yourself and let me know the damage  r l s    letter  to j horne stevenson    vailima samoa november 5th 1893  my dear stevenson  a thousand thanks for your voluminous and  delightful collections  baxter  so soon as it is ready  will let  you see a proof of my introduction which is only sent out as a  sprat to catch whales  and you will find i have a good deal of  what you have only mine in a perfectly desultory manner as is  necessary to an exile  my uncles pedigree is wrong there was  never a stevenson of caldwell of course but they were tenants of  the muirs the farm held by them is in my introduction and i have  already written to charles baxter to have a search made in the  register house  i hope he will have had the inspiration to put it  under your surveillance  your information as to your own family is  intensely interesting and i should not wonder but what you and we  and old john stevenson land labourer in the parish of dailly  came all of the same stock  ayrshire  and probably cunningham   seems to be the home of the race  our part of it  from the  distribution of the name  which your collections have so much  extended without essentially changing my knowledge of  we seem  rather pointed to a british origin  what you say of the engineers  is fresh to me and must be well thrashed out  this introduction  of it will take a long while to walk about  as perhaps i may be  tempted to let it become long after all i am writing this for my  own pleasure solely  greetings to you and other speculatives of  our date long bygone alas  yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson  ps  i have a different version of my grandfathers arms  or my  father had if i could find it  r l s    letter  to john pn    vailima samoa december 3rd 1893  dear johnnie  well i must say you seem to be a tremendous  fellow  before i was eight i used to write stories  or dictate  them at least  and i had produced an excellent history of moses  for which i got 1 pound from an uncle but i had never gone the  length of a play so you have beaten me fairly on my own ground  i  hope you may continue to do so and thanking you heartily for your  nice letter i shall beg you to believe me yours truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to russell pn    vailima samoa december 3rd 1893  dear russell  i have to thank you very much for your capital  letter which came to hand here in samoa along with your mothers   when you grow up and write stories like me you will be able to  understand that there is scarce anything more painful than for an  author to hold a pen he has to do it so much that his heart  sickens and his fingers ache at the sight or touch of it so that  you will excuse me if i do not write much but remain with  compliments and greetings from one scot to another  though i was  not born in ceylon  youre ahead of me there  yours very truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to alison cunningham    vailima december 5 1893  my dearest cummy  this goes to you with a merry christmas and a  happy new year  the happy new year anyway for i think it should  reach you about noors day  i dare say it may be cold and frosty   do you remember when you used to take me out of bed in the early  morning carry me to the back windows show me the hills of fife  and quote to me   a the hills are covered wi snaw an winters noo come fairly   there is not much chance of that here  i wonder how my mother is  going to stand the winter  if she can it will be a very good  thing for her  we are in that part of the year which i like the  best  the rainy or hurricane season  when it is good it is  very very good and when it is bad it is horrid and our fine  days are certainly fine like heaven such a blue of the sea such  green of the trees and such crimson of the hibiscus flowers you  never saw and the air as mild and gentle as a babys breath and  yet not hot  the mail is on the move and i must let up  with much love i am  your laddie  r l s    letter  to charles baxter    6th december 1893  october 25 1685  at privy council george murray lieutenant of  the kings guard and others did on the 21st of september last  obtain a clandestine order of privy council to apprehend the person  of janet pringle daughter to the late clifton and she having  retired out of the way upon information he got an order against  andrew pringle her uncle to produce her    but she having  married andrew pringle her uncles son to disappoint all their  designs of selling her a boy of thirteen years old  but my boy  is to be fourteen so i extract no further  fountainhall i 320  may 6 1685  wappus pringle of clifton was still alive after  all and in prison for debt and transacts with lieutenant murray  giving security for 7000 marks  i 372  no it seems to have been her brother who had succeeded   my dear charles  the above is my story and i wonder if any light  can be thrown on it  i prefer the girls father dead and the  question is how in that case could lieutenant george murray get  his order to apprehend and his power to sell her in marriage  or  might lieutenant g be her tutor and she fugitive to the  pringles and on the discovery of her whereabouts hastily married  a good legal note on these points is very ardently desired by me  it will be the cornerstone of my novel  this is for  i am quite wrong to tell you  for you will tell  others  and nothing will teach you that all my schemes are in the  air and vanish and reappear again like shapes in the clouds  it  is for heathercat  whereof the first volume will be called the  killing time and i believe i have authorities ample for that  but  the second volume is to be called i believe darien and for that  i want i fear a good deal of truck   darien papers carstairs papers marchmont papers jerviswoode correspondence   i hope may do me  some sort of general history of the darien  affair if there is a decent one which i misdoubt it would also  be well to have  the one with most details if possible  it is  singular how obscure to me this decade of scots history remains  16901700  a deuce of a want of light and grouping to it   however i believe i shall be mostly out of scotland in my tale  first in carolina next in darien  i want also  i am the daughter  of the horseleech truly  blacks new large map of scotland  sheets 3 4 and 5 a 7s 6d touch  i believe if you can get the   caldwell papers   they had better come also and if there be any reasonable work   but no i must call a halt     i fear the song looks doubtful but ill consider of it and i can  promise you some reminiscences which it will amuse me to write  whether or not it will amuse the public to read of them  but its  an unco business to supply deidheid coapy    letter  to j m barrie    vailima samoa december 7th 1893  my dear barrie  i have received duly the magnum opus and it  really is a magnum opus  it is a beautiful specimen of clarks  printing paper sufficient and the illustrations all my fancy  painted  but the particular flower of the flock to whom i have  hopelessly lost my heart is tibby birse  i must have known tibby  birse when she was a servants mantuamaker in edinburgh and  answered to the name of miss broddie  she used to come and sew  with my nurse sitting with her legs crossed in a masculine manner  and swinging her foot emphatically she used to pour forth a  perfectly unbroken stream of gossip  i didnt hear it i was  immersed in far more important business with a box of bricks but  the recollection of that thin perpetual shrill sound of a voice  has echoed in my ears sinsyne  i am bound to say she was younger  than tibbie but there is no mistaking that and the indescribable  and eminently scottish expression  i have been very much prevented of late having carried out  thoroughly to my own satisfaction two considerable illnesses had a  birthday and visited honolulu where politics are if possible a  shade more exasperating than they are with us  i am told that it  was just when i was on the point of leaving that i received your  superlative epistle about the cricket eleven  in that case it is  impossible i should have answered it which is inconsistent with my  own recollection of the fact  what i remember is that i sat down  under your immediate inspiration and wrote an answer in every way  worthy  if i didnt as it seems proved that i couldnt it will  never be done now  however i did the next best thing i equipped  my cousin graham balfour with a letter of introduction and from  him if you know how  for he is rather of the scottish character   you may elicit all the information you can possibly wish to have as  to us and ours  do not be bluffed off by the somewhat stern and  monumental first impression that he may make upon you  he is one  of the best fellows in the world and the same sort of fool that we  are only betterlooking with all the faults of vailimans and some  of his own  i say nothing about virtues  i have lately been returning to my wallowing in the mire  when i  was a child and indeed until i was nearly a man i consistently  read covenanting books  now that i am a greybeard  or would be  if i could raise the beard  i have returned and for weeks back  have read little else but wodrow walker shields etc  of course  this is with an idea of a novel but in the course of it i made a  very curious discovery  i have been accustomed to hear refined and  intelligent critics  those who know so much better what we are  than we do ourselves  trace down my literary descent from all  sorts of people including addison of whom i could never read a  word  well laigh i your lug sir  the clue was found  my style  is from the covenanting writers  take a particular case  the  fondness for rhymes  i dont know of any english prosewriter who  rhymes except by accident and then a stone had better be tied  around his neck and himself cast into the sea  but my covenanting  buckies rhyme all the time  a beautiful example of the unconscious  rhyme above referred to  do you know and have you really tasted these delightful works   if not it should be remedied there is enough of the auld licht in  you to be ravished  i suppose you know that success has so far attended my banners  my  political banners i mean and not my literary  in conjunction with  the three great powers i have succeeded in getting rid of my  president and my chiefjustice  theyve gone home the one to  germany the other to souwegia  i hear little echoes of footfalls  of their departing footsteps through the medium of the newspapers      whereupon i make you my salute with the firm remark that it is time  to be done with trifling and give us a great book and my ladies  fall into line with me to pay you a most respectful courtesy and  we all join in the cry come to vailima  my dear sir your souls health is in it  you will never do the  great book you will never cease to work in l etc till you come  to vailima  robert louis stevenson    letter  to r le gallienne    vailima samoa december 28th 1893  dear mr le gallienne  i have received some time ago through our  friend miss taylor a book of yours  but that was by no means my  first introduction to your name  the same book had stood already  on my shelves i had read articles of yours in the academy and by  a piece of constructive criticism which i trust was sound had  arrived at the conclusion that you were logroller  since then i  have seen your beautiful verses to your wife  you are to conceive  me then as only too ready to make the acquaintance of a man who  loved good literature and could make it  i had to thank you  besides for a triumphant exposure of a paradox of my own  the  literaryprostitute disappeared from view at a phrase of yours   the essence is not in the pleasure but the sale  true  you are  right i was wrong the author is not the whore but the libertine  and yet i shall let the passage stand  it is an error but it  illustrated the truth for which i was contending that literature   painting  all art are no other than pleasures which we turn into  trades  and more than all this i had and i have to thank you for the  intimate loyalty you have shown to myself for the eager welcome  you give to what is good  for the courtly tenderness with which  you touch on my defects  i begin to grow old i have given my top  note i fancy  and i have written too many books  the world  begins to be weary of the old booth and if not weary familiar  with the familiarity that breeds contempt  i do not know that i am  sensitive to criticism if it be hostile i am sensitive indeed  when it is friendly and when i read such criticism as yours i am  emboldened to go on and praise god  you are still young and you may live to do much  the little  artificial popularity of style in england tends i think to die  out the british pig returns to his true love the love of the  styleless of the shapeless of the slapdash and the disorderly   there is trouble coming i think and you may have to hold the fort  for us in evil days  lastly let me apologise for the crucifixion that i am inflicting  on you bien a contrecoeur by my bad writing  i was once the  best of writers landladies puzzled as to my trade used to have  their honest bosoms set at rest by a sight of a page of manuscript   ah they would say no wonder they pay you for that  and  when i sent it in to the printers it was given to the boys  i was  about thirtynine i think when i had a turn of scriveners palsy  my hand got worse and for the first time i received clean proofs   but it has gone beyond that now i know i am like my old friend  james payn a terror to correspondents and you would not believe  the care with which this has been written  believe me to be very  sincerely yours  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs a baker    december 1893  dear madam  there is no trouble and i wish i could help instead   as it is i fear i am only going to put you to trouble and  vexation  this braille writing is a kind of consecration and i  would like if i could to have your copy perfect  the two volumes  are to be published as vols i and ii of the adventures of david  balfour  1st kidnapped 2nd catriona  i am just sending home a  corrected kidnapped for this purpose to messrs cassell and in  order that i may if possible be in time i send it to you first of  all  please as soon as you have noted the changes forward the  same to cassell and co la belle sauvage yard ludgate hill  i am writing to them by this mail to send you catriona  you say dear madam you are good enough to say it is a keen  pleasure to you to bring my book within the reach of the blind  conceive then what it is to me and believe me sincerely yours  robert louis stevenson  i was a barren tree before i blew a quenched coal i could not on their midnight shore the lonely blind console  a moment lend your hand i bring my sheaf for you to bind and you can teach my words to sing in the darkness of the blind  r l s    letter  to henry james    apia december 1893  my dear henry james  the mail has come upon me like an armed man  three days earlier than was expected and the lord help me  it is  impossible i should answer anybody the way they should be  your  jubilation over catriona did me good and still more the subtlety  and truth of your remark on the starving of the visual sense in  that book  tis true and unless i make the greater effort  and  am as a step to that convinced of its necessity  it will be more  true i fear in the future  i hear people talking and i feel them  acting and that seems to me to be fiction  my two aims may be  described as   1st  war to the adjective 2nd  death to the optic nerve  admitted we live in an age of the optic nerve in literature  for  how many centuries did literature get along without a sign of it   however ill consider your letter  how exquisite is your character of the critic in essays in london   i doubt if you have done any single thing so satisfying as a piece  of style and of insight  yours ever  r l s    letter  to charles baxter    1st january 94  my dear charles  i am delighted with your idea and first i will  here give an amended plan and afterwards give you a note of some of  the difficulties  plan of the edinburgh edition  14 vols     it may be a question whether my times letters might not be  appended to the footnote with a note of the dates of discharge of  cedercrantz and pilsach  i am particularly pleased with this idea of yours because i am  come to a dead stop  i never can remember how bad i have been  before but at any rate i am bad enough just now i mean as to  literature in health i am well and strong  i take it i shall be  six months before im heard of again and this time i could put in  to some advantage in revising the text and if it were thought  desirable writing prefaces  i do not know how many of them might  be thought desirable  i have written a paper on treasure island  which is to appear shortly  master of ballantrae  i have one  drafted  the wrecker is quite sufficiently done already with the  last chapter but i suppose an historic introduction to david  balfour is quite unavoidable  prince otto i dont think i could  say anything about and black arrow dont want to  but it is  probable i could say something to the volume of travels  in the  verse business i can do just what i like better than anything else  and extend underwoods with a lot of unpublished stuff  apropos if  i were to get printed off a very few poems which are somewhat too  intimate for the public could you get them run up in some luxuous  manner so that fools might be induced to buy them in just a  sufficient quantity to pay expenses and the thing remain still in a  manner private  we could supply photographs of the illustrations   and the poems are of vailima and the family  i should much like to  get this done as a surprise for fanny  r l s    letter  to h b baildon    vailima january 15th 1894  my dear baildon  last mail brought your book and its dedication   frederick street and the gardens and the shortlived jack o  lantern are again with me  and the note of the east wind and  froebels voice and the smell of soup in thomsons stair  truly  you had no need to put yourself under the protection of any other  saint were that saint our tamate himself  yourself were enough  and yourself coming with so rich a sheaf  for what is this that you say about the muses  they have certainly  never better inspired you than in jael and sisera and herodias  and john the baptist good stout poems fiery and sound  tis  but a mask and behind it chuckles the god of the garden i shall  never forget  by the by an error of the press page 49 line 4  no infants lesson are the ways of god  the is dropped  and this reminds me you have a bad habit which is to be comminated  in my theory of letters  same page two lines lower  but the  vultures track is surely as fine to the ear as but vultures  track and this latter version has a dreadful baldness  the  reader goes on with a sense of impoverishment of unnecessary  sacrifice he has been robbed by footpads and goes scouting for  his lost article  again in the second epode these fine verses  would surely sound much finer if they began as a hardy climber  who has set his heart than with the jejune as hardy climber  i  do not know why you permit yourself this license with grammar you  show in so many pages that you are superior to the paltry sense  of rhythm which usually dictates it  as though some poetaster had  been suffered to correct the poets text  by the way i confess to  a heartfelt weakness for auriculas  believe me the very grateful  and characteristic pickthank but still sincere and affectionate  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w h low    vailima january 15th 1894  my dear low     pray you stoop your proud head and sell  yourself to some jew magazine and make the visit out  i assure  you this is the spot for a sculptor or painter  this and no  other  i dont say to stay there but to come once and get the  living colour into them  i am used to it i do not notice it  rather prefer my grey freezing recollections of scotland but  there it is and every morning is a thing to give thanks for and  every night another  bar when it rains of course  about the wrecker  rather late days and i still suspect i had  somehow offended you however alls well that ends well and i am  glad i am forgiven  did you not fail to appreciate the attitude of  dodd  he was a fizzle and a stick he knew it he knew nothing  else and there is an undercurrent of bitterness in him  and then  the problem that pinkerton laid down  why the artist can do  nothing else is one that continually exercises myself  he cannot   granted  but scott could  and montaigne  and julius caesar  and  many more  and why cant r l s  does it not amaze you  it  does me  i think of the renaissance fellows and their allround  human sufficiency and compare it with the ineffable smallness of  the field in which we labour and in which we do so little  i think  david balfour a nice little book and very artistic and just the  thing to occupy the leisure of a busy man but for the top flower  of a mans life it seems to me inadequate  small is the word it  is a small age and i am of it  i could have wished to be  otherwise busy in this world  i ought to have been able to build  lighthouses and write david balfours too  hinc illae lacrymae  i  take my own case as most handy but it is as illustrative of my  quarrel with the age  we take all these pains and we dont do as  well as michael angelo or leonardo or even fielding who was an  active magistrate or richardson who was a busy bookseller  jai  honte pour nous my ears burn  i am amazed at the effect which this chicago exhibition has  produced upon you and others  it set mrs fairchild literally mad   to judge by her letters  and i wish i had seen anything so  influential  i suppose there was an aura a halo some sort of  effulgency about the place for here i find you louder than the  rest  well it may be there is a time coming and i wonder when  it comes whether it will be a time of little exclusive oneeyed  rascals like you and me or parties of the old stamp who can paint  and fight and write and keep books of double entry and sculp and  scalp  it might be  you have a lot of stuff in the kettle and a  great deal of it celtic  i have changed my mind progressively  about england practically the whole of scotland is celtic and the  western half of england and all ireland and the celtic blood  makes a rare blend for art  if it is stiffened up with latin  blood you get the french  we were less lucky  we had only  scandinavians themselves decidedly artistic and the lowgerman  lot  however that is a good startingpoint and with all the  other elements in your crucible it may come to something great  very easily  i wish you would hurry up and let me see it  here is  a long while i have been waiting for something good in art and  what have i seen  zolas debacle and a few of kiplings tales   are you a reader of barbey daurevilly  he is a neverfailing  source of pleasure to me for my sins i suppose  what a work is  the rideau cramoisi and lensorcelee and le chevalier des  touches  this is degenerating into mere twaddle  so please remember us all  most kindly to mrs low and believe me ever yours  robert louis stevenson  ps  were all your privateers voiceless in the war of 1812  did  no one of them write memoirs  i shall have to do my privateer from  chic if you cant help me  my application to scribner has been  quite in vain  see if you can get hold of some historic sharp in  the club and tap him they must some of them have written memoirs  or notes of some sort perhaps still unprinted if that be so get  them copied for me  r l s    letter  to h b baildon    vailima january 30th 1894  my dear baildon  call not blessed  yes if i could die just  now or say in half a year i should have had a splendid time of it  on the whole  but it gets a little stale and my work will begin  to senesce and parties to shy bricks at me and now it begins to  look as if i should survive to see myself impotent and forgotten   its a pity suicide is not thought the ticket in the best circles  but your letter goes on to congratulate me on having done the one  thing i am a little sorry for a little  not much  for my father  himself lived to think that i had been wiser than he  but the  cream of the jest is that i have lived to change my mind and think  that he was wiser than i  had i been an engineer and literature  my amusement it would have been better perhaps  i pulled it off  of course i won the wager and it is pleasant while it lasts but  how long will it last  i dont know say the bells of old bow  all of which goes to show that nobody is quite sane in judging  himself  truly had i given way and gone in for engineering i  should be dead by now  well the gods know best  i hope you got my letter about the rescue  adieu  r l s  true for you about the benefit  except by kisses jests song et  hoc genus omne man cannot convey benefit to another  the  universal benefactor has been there before him    letter  to j h bates    vailima samoa march 25th 1894  my dear mr joe h bates  i shall have the greatest pleasure in  acceding to your complimentary request  i shall think it an honour  to be associated with your chapter and i need not remind you for  you have said it yourself how much depends upon your own exertions  whether to make it to me a real honour or only a derision  this is  to let you know that i accept the position that you have seriously  offered to me in a quite serious spirit  i need scarce tell you  that i shall always be pleased to receive reports of your  proceedings and if i do not always acknowledge them you are to  remember that i am a man very much occupied otherwise and not at  all to suppose that i have lost interest in my chapter  in this world which as you justly say is so full of sorrow and  suffering it will always please me to remember that my name is  connected with some efforts after alleviation nor less so with  purposes of innocent recreation which after all are the only  certain means at our disposal for bettering human life  with kind regards to yourself to mr l c congdon to e m g  bates and to mr edward hugh higlee bates and the heartiest  wishes for the future success of the chapter believe me yours  cordially  robert louis stevenson    letter  to william archer    vailima samoa march 27th 1894  my dear archer  many thanks for your theatrical world  do you  know it strikes me as being really very good  i have not yet read  much of it but so far as i have looked there is not a dull and  not an empty page in it  hazlitt whom you must often have thought  of would have been pleased  come to think of it i shall put this  book upon the hazlitt shelf  you have acquired a manner that i can  only call august otherwise i should have to call it such amazing  impudence  the bauble shop and becket are examples of what i mean   but it sets you weel  marjorie fleming i have known as you surmise for long  she was  possibly  no i take back possibly  she was one of the greatest  works of god  your note about the resemblance of her verses to  mine gave me great joy though it only proved me a plagiarist  by  the by was it not over the childs garden of verses that we first  scraped acquaintance  i am sorry indeed to hear that my esteemed  correspondent tomarcher has such poor taste in literature  i fear  he cannot have inherited this trait from his dear papa  indeed i  may say i know it for i remember the energy of papas disapproval  when the work passed through his hands on its way to a second  birth which none regrets more than myself  it is an odd fact or  perhaps a very natural one i find few greater pleasures than  reading my own works but i never o i never read the black arrow   in that country tomarcher reigns supreme  well and after all if  tomarcher likes it it has not been written in vain  we have just now a curious breath from europe  a young fellow just  beginning letters and no fool turned up here with a letter of  introduction in the wellknown blue ink and decorative hieroglyphs  of george meredith  his name may be known to you  it is sidney  lysaght  he is staying with us but a day or two and it is strange  to me and not unpleasant to hear all the names old and new come  up again  but oddly the new are so much more in number  if i  revisited the glimpses of the moon on your side of the ocean i  should know comparatively few of them  my amanuensis deserts me  i should have said you for yours is the  loss my script having lost all bond with humanity  one touch of  nature makes the whole world kin  that nobody can read my hand   it is a humiliating circumstance that thus evens us with printers  you must sometimes think it strange  or perhaps it is only i that  should so think it  to be following the old round in the gas  lamps and the crowded theatres when i am away here in the tropical  forest and the vast silences  my dear archer my wife joins me in the best wishes to yourself and  mrs archer not forgetting tom and i am yours very cordially  robert louis stevenson    letter  to w b yeats    vailima samoa april 14 1894  dear sir  long since when i was a boy i remember the emotions  with which i repeated swinburnes poems and ballads  some ten  years ago a similar spell was cast upon me by merediths love in  the valley the stanzas beginning when her mother tends her  haunted me and made me drunk like wine and i remember waking with  them all the echoes of the hills about hyeres  it may interest you  to hear that i have a third time fallen in slavery  this is to  your poem called the lake isle of innisfrae  it is so quaint and  airy simple artful and eloquent to the heart  but i seek words  in vain  enough that always night and day i hear lake water  lapping with low sounds on the shore and am yours gratefully  robert louis stevenson    letter  to george meredith    vailima samoa april 17th 1894  my dear meredith  many good things have the gods sent to me of  late  first of all there was a letter from you by the kind hand of  mariette if she is not too great a lady to be remembered in such a  style and then there came one lysaght with a charming note of  introduction in the wellknown hand itself  we had but a few days  of him and liked him well  there was a sort of geniality and  inward fire about him at which i warmed my hands  it is long since  i have seen a young man who has left in me such a favourable  impression and i find myself telling myself o i must tell this  to lysaght or this will interest him in a manner very unusual  after so brief an acquaintance  the whole of my family shared in  this favourable impression and my halls have reechoed ever since  i am sure he will be amused to know with widdicombe fair  he will have told you doubtless more of my news than i could tell  you myself he has your european perspective a thing long lost to  me  i heard with a great deal of interest the news of box hill   and so i understand it is to be enclosed  allow me to remark that  seems a far more barbaric trait of manners than the most barbarous  of ours  we content ourselves with cutting off an occasional head  i hear we may soon expect the amazing marriage  you know how long  and with how much curiosity i have looked forward to the book   now in so far as you have adhered to your intention gower  woodsere will be a family portrait age twentyfive of the highly  respectable and slightly influential and fairly aged tusitala  you  have not known that gentleman console yourself he is not worth  knowing  at the same time my dear meredith he is very sincerely  yours  for what he is worth for the memories of old times and in  the expectation of many pleasures still to come  i suppose we  shall never see each other again flitting youths of the lysaght  species may occasionally cover these unconscionable leagues and  bear greetings to and fro  but we ourselves must be content to  converse on an occasional sheet of notepaper and i shall never see  whether you have grown older and you shall never deplore that  gower woodsere should have declined into the pantaloon tusitala   it is perhaps better so  let us continue to see each other as we  were and accept my dear meredith my love and respect  robert louis stevenson  ps  my wife joins me in the kindest messages to yourself and  mariette    letter  to charles baxter    vailima april 17 94  my dear charles  st ives is now well on its way into the second  volume  there remains no mortal doubt that it will reach the three  volume standard  i am very anxious that you should send me   1st  tom and jerry a cheap edition  2nd  the book by ashton  the dawn of the century i think it was  called  which colvin sent me and which has miscarried and  3rd  if it is possible a file of the edinburgh courant for the  years 1811 1812 1813 or 1814  i should not care for a whole  year  if it were possible to find me three months winter months  by preference it would do my business not only for st ives but  for the justiceclerk as well  suppose this to be impossible  perhaps i could get the loan of it from somebody or perhaps it  would be possible to have some one read a file for me and make  notes  this would be extremely bad as unhappily one mans food is  another mans poison and the reader would probably leave out  everything i should choose  but if you are reduced to that you  might mention to the man who is to read for me that balloon  ascensions are in the order of the day  4th  it might be as well to get a book on balloon ascension  particularly in the early part of the century        iii  at last this book has come from scribner and alas  i have  the first six or seven chapters of st ives to recast entirely   who could foresee that they clothed the french prisoners in yellow   but that one fatal fact  and also that they shaved them twice a  week  damns the whole beginning  if it had been sent in time it  would have saved me a deal of trouble     i have had a long letter from dr scott dalgleish 25 mayfield  terrace asking me to put my name down to the ballantyne memorial  committee  i have sent him a pretty sharp answer in favour of  cutting down the memorial and giving more to the widow and  children  if there is to be any foolery in the way of statues or  other trash please send them a guinea but if they are going to  take my advice and put up a simple tablet with a few heartfelt  words and really devote the bulk of the subscriptions to the wife  and family i will go to the length of twenty pounds if you will  allow me and if the case of the family be at all urgent and at  least i direct you to send ten pounds  i suppose you had better  see scott dalgleish himself on the matter  i take the opportunity  here to warn you that my head is simply spinning with a multitude  of affairs and i shall probably forget a half of my business at  last  r l s    letter  to mrs sitwell    vailima april 1894  my dear friend  i have at last got some photographs and hasten  to send you as you asked a portrait of tusitala  he is a strange  person not so lean say experts but infinitely battered mighty  active again on the whole going up and down our breakneck road at  all hours of the day and night on horseback holding meetings with  all manner of chiefs quite a political personage  god save the  mark  in a small way but at heart very conscious of the  inevitable flat failure that awaits every one  i shall never do a  better book than catriona that is my highwater mark and the  trouble of production increases on me at a great rate  and mighty  anxious about how i am to leave my family  an elderly man with  elderly preoccupations whom i should be ashamed to show you for  your old friend but not a hope of my dying soon and cleanly and  winning off the stage  rather i am daily better in physical  health  i shall have to see this business out after all and i  think in that case they should have  they might have  spared me  all my illhealth this decade past if it were not to unbar the  doors  i have no taste for old age and my nose is to be rubbed in  it in spite of my face  i was meant to die young and the gods do  not love me  this is very like an epitaph bar the handwriting which is  anything but monumental and i dare say i had better stop  fanny  is down at her own cottage planting or deplanting or replanting i  know not which and she will not be home till dinner by which time  the mail will be all closed else she would join me in all good  messages and remembrances of love  i hope you will congratulate  burne jones from me on his baronetcy  i cannot make out to be  anything but raspingly harrowingly sad so i will close and not  affect levity which i cannot feel  do not altogether forget me  keep a corner of your memory for the exile  louis    letter  to charles baxter    vailima may 1894  my dear charles  my dear fellow i wish to assure you of the  greatness of the pleasure that this edinburgh edition gives me  i  suppose it was your idea to give it that name  no other would have  affected me in the same manner  do you remember how many years  ago  i would be afraid to hazard a guess  one night when i  communicated to you certain intimations of early death and  aspirations after fame  i was particularly maudlin and my remorse  the next morning on a review of my folly has written the matter  very deeply in my mind from yours it may easily have fled  if any  one at that moment could have shown me the edinburgh edition i  suppose i should have died  it is with gratitude and wonder that i  consider the way in which i have been led  could a more  preposterous idea have occurred to us in those days when we used to  search our pockets for coppers too often in vain and combine  forces to produce the threepence necessary for two glasses of beer  or wander down the lothian road without any than that i should be  strong and well at the age of fortythree in the island of upolu  and that you should be at home bringing out the edinburgh edition   if it had been possible i should almost have preferred the lothian  road edition say with a picture of the old dutch smuggler on the  covers  i have now something heavy on my mind  i had always a  great sense of kinship with poor robert fergusson  so clever a  boy so wild of such a mixed strain so unfortunate born in the  same town with me and as i always felt rather by express  intimation than from evidence so like myself  now the injustice  with which the one robert is rewarded and the other left out in the  cold sits heavy on me and i wish you could think of some way in  which i could do honour to my unfortunate namesake  do you think  it would look like affectation to dedicate the whole edition to his  memory  i think it would  the sentiment which would dictate it to  me is too abstruse and besides i think my wife is the proper  person to receive the dedication of my lifes work  at the same  time it is very odd  it really looks like the transmigration of  souls  i feel that i must do something for fergusson burns has  been before me with the gravestone  it occurs to me you might take  a walk down the canongate and see in what condition the stone is   if it be at all uncared for we might repair it and perhaps add a  few words of inscription  i must tell you what i just remembered in a flash as i was walking  about dictating this letter  there was in the original plan of the  master of ballantrae a sort of introduction describing my arrival  in edinburgh on a visit to yourself and your placing in my hands  the papers of the story  i actually wrote it and then condemned  the idea  as being a little too like scott i suppose  now i must  really find the ms and try to finish it for the e e  it will  give you what i should so much like you to have another corner of  your own in that lofty monument  suppose we do what i have proposed about fergussons monument i  wonder if an inscription like this would look arrogant    this stone originally erected by robert burns has been repaired at the charges of robert louis stevenson and is by him rededicated to the memory of robert fergusson as the gift of one edinburgh lad to another   in spacing this inscription i would detach the names of fergusson  and burns but leave mine in the text  or would that look like sham modesty and is it better to bring out  the three roberts    letter  to r a m stevenson    vailima june 1894  my dear bob  i must make out a letter this mail or perish in the  attempt  all the same i am deeply stupid in bed with a cold  deprived of my amanuensis and conscious of the wish but not the  furnished will  you may be interested to hear how the family  inquiries go  it is now quite certain that we are a secondrate  lot and came out of cunningham or clydesdale therefore british  folk so that you are cymry on both sides and i cymry and pict   we may have fought with king arthur and known merlin  the first of  the family stevenson of stevenson was quite a great party and  dates back to the wars of edward first  the last male heir of  stevenson of stevenson died 1670 220 pounds 10s to the bad from  drink  about the same time the stevensons who were mostly in  cunningham before crop up suddenly in the parish of neilston over  the border in renfrewshire  of course they may have been there  before but there is no word of them in that parish till 1675 in  any extracts i have  our first traceable ancestor was a tenant  farmer of muir of cauldwells  james in nethercarsewell   presently two families of maltmen are found in glasgow both by  reduplicated proofs related to james the son of james in nether  carsewell  we descend by his second marriage from robert one of  these died 1733  it is not very romantic up to now but has  interested me surprisingly to fish out always hoping for more   and occasionally getting at least a little clearness and  confirmation  but the earliest date 1655 apparently the marriage  of james in nether carsewell cannot as yet be pushed back  from  which of any number of dozen little families in cunningham we  should derive god knows  of course it doesnt matter a hundred  years hence an argument fatal to all human enterprise industry  or pleasure  and to me it will be a deadly disappointment if i  cannot roll this stone away  one generation further might be  nothing but it is my present object of desire and we are so near  it  there is a man in the same parish called constantine if i  could only trace to him i could take you far afield by that one  talisman of the strange christian name of constantine  but no such  luck  and i kind of fear we shall stick at james  so much though all inchoate i trouble you with knowing that you  at least must take an interest in it  so much is certain of that  strange celtic descent that the past has an interest for it  apparently gratuitous but fiercely strong  i wish to trace my  ancestors a thousand years if i trace them by gallowses  it is  not love not pride not admiration it is an expansion of the  identity intimately pleasing and wholly uncritical i can expend  myself in the person of an inglorious ancestor with perfect  comfort or a disgraced if i could find one  i suppose perhaps  it is more to me who am childless and refrain with a certain shock  from looking forwards  but i am sure in the solid grounds of  race that you have it also in some degree  i james a tenant of the muirs in nethercarsewell                  neilston married 1665 jean keir

unhappily belle who is my amanuensis is out of the way on  other affairs and i have to make the unwelcome effort  o this is  beautiful i am quite pleased with myself  graham has just  arrived last night my mother is coming by the other steamer in  three days and has told me of your meeting and he said you  looked a little older than i did so that i suppose we keep step  fairly on the downward side of the hill  he thought you looked  harassed and i could imagine that too  i sometimes feel harassed   i have a great family here about me a great anxiety  the loss to  use my grandfathers expression the loss of our family is that  we are disbelievers in the morrow  perhaps i should say rather  in next year  the future is always black to us it was to robert  stevenson to thomas i suspect to alan to r a m s it was so  almost to his ruin in youth to r l s who had a hard hopeful  strain in him from his mother it was not so much so once but  becomes daily more so  daily so much more so that i have a  painful difficulty in believing i can ever finish another book or  that the public will ever read it  i have so huge a desire to know exactly what you are doing that i  suppose i should tell you what i am doing by way of an example  i  have a room now a part of the twelvefoot verandah sparred in at  the most inaccessible end of the house  daily i see the sunrise  out of my bed which i still value as a tonic a perpetual tuning  fork a look of gods face once in the day  at six my breakfast  comes up to me here and i work till eleven  if i am quite well i  sometimes go out and bathe in the river before lunch twelve  in  the afternoon i generally work again now alone drafting now with  belle dictating  dinner is at six and i am often in bed by eight   this is supposing me to stay at home  but i must often be away  sometimes all day long sometimes till twelve one or two at  night when you might see me coming home to the sleeping house  sometimes in a trackless darkness sometimes with a glorious tropic  moon everything drenched with dew  unsaddling and creeping to  bed and you would no longer be surprised that i live out in this  country and not in bournemouth  in bed  my great recent interruptions have as you know come from  politics not much in my line you will say  but it is impossible  to live here and not feel very sorely the consequences of the  horrid white mismanagement  i tried standing by and looking on  and it became too much for me  they are such illogical fools a  logical fool in an office with a lot of red tape is conceivable   furthermore he is as much as we have any reason to expect of  officials  a thoroughly commonplace unintellectual lot  but  these people are wholly on wires laying their ears down skimming  away pausing as though shot and presto full spread on the other  tack  i observe in the official class mostly an insane jealousy of  the smallest kind as compared to which the artists is of a grave  modest character  the actors even a desire to extend his little  authority and to relish it like a glass of wine that is  impayable  sometimes when i see one of these little kings  strutting over one of his victories  wholly illegal perhaps and  certain to be reversed to his shame if his superiors ever heard of  it  i could weep  the strange thing is that they have nothing  else  i auscultate them in vain no real sense of duty no real  comprehension no real attempt to comprehend no wish for  information  you cannot offend one of them more bitterly than by  offering information though it is certain that you have more and  obvious that you have other information than they have and  talking of policy they could not play a better stroke than by  listening to you and it need by no means influence their action   tenez you know what a french post office or railway official is   that is the diplomatic card to the life  dickens is not in it  caricature fails  all this keeps me from my work and gives me the unpleasant side of  the world  when your letters are disbelieved it makes you angry  and that is rot and i wish i could keep out of it with all my  soul  but i have just got into it again and farewell peace  my work goes along but slowly  i have got to a crossing place i  suppose the present book saint ives is nothing it is in no  style in particular a tissue of adventures the central character  not very well done no philosophic pith under the yarn and in  short if people will read it thats all i ask and if they wont  damn them  i like doing it though and if you ask me why  after  that i am on weir of hermiston and heathercat two scotch stories  which will either be something different or i shall have failed   the first is generally designed and is a private story of two or  three characters in a very grim vein  the second  alas the  thought  is an attempt at a real historical novel to present a  whole field of time the race  our own race  the west land and  clydesdale blue bonnets under the influence of their last trial  when they got to a pitch of organisation in madness that no other  peasantry has ever made an offer at  i was going to call it the  killing time but this man crockett has forestalled me in that   well itll be a big smash if i fail in it but a gallant attempt   all my weary reading as a boy which you remember well enough will  come to bear on it and if my mind will keep up to the point it was  in a while back perhaps i can pull it through  for two months past fanny belle austin her child and i have  been alone but yesterday as i mentioned graham balfour arrived  and on wednesday my mother and lloyd will make up the party to its  full strength  i wish you could drop in for a month or a week or  two hours  that is my chief want  on the whole it is an  unexpectedly pleasant corner i have dropped into for an end of it  which i could scarcely have foreseen from wilsons shop or the  princes street gardens or the portobello road  still i would  like to hear what my alter ego thought of it and i would sometimes  like to have my old maitre es arts express an opinion on what i do   i put this very tamely being on the whole a quiet elderly man but  it is a strong passion with me though intermittent  now try to  follow my example and tell me something about yourself louisa the  bab and your work and kindly send me some specimens of what  youre about  i have only seen one thing by you about notre dame  in the westminster or st jamess since i left england now i  suppose six years ago  i have looked this trash over and it is not at all the letter i  wanted to write  not truck about officials ancestors and the  like rancidness  but you have to let your pen go in its own  brokendown gait like an old butchers pony stop when it pleases  and go on again as it will  ever my dear bob your affectionate  cousin  r l stevenson    letter  to henry james    vailima july 7th 1894  dear henry james  i am going to try and dictate to you a letter  or a note and begin the same without any spark of hope my mind  being entirely in abeyance  this malady is very bitter on the  literary man  i have had it now coming on for a month and it  seems to get worse instead of better  if it should prove to be  softening of the brain a melancholy interest will attach to the  present document  i heard a great deal about you from my mother  and graham balfour the latter declares that you could take a first  in any samoan subject  if that be so i should like to hear you on  the theory of the constitution  also to consult you on the force  of the particles o lo o and ua which are the subject of a dispute  among local pundits  you might if you ever answer this give me  your opinion on the origin of the samoan race just to complete the  favour  they both say that you are looking well and i suppose i may  conclude from that that you are feeling passably  i wish i was   do not suppose from this that i am ill in body it is the numskull  that i complain of  and when that is wrong as you must be very  keenly aware you begin every day with a smarting disappointment  which is not good for the temper  i am in one of the humours when  a man wonders how any one can be such an ass as to embrace the  profession of letters and not get apprenticed to a barber or keep  a bakedpotato stall  but i have no doubt in the course of a week  or perhaps tomorrow things will look better  we have at present in port the model warship of great britain  she  is called the curacoa and has the nicest set of officers and men  conceivable  they the officers are all very intimate with us  and the front verandah is known as the curacoa club and the road  up to vailima is known as the curacoa track  it was rather a  surprise to me many naval officers have i known and somehow had  not learned to think entirely well of them and perhaps sometimes  ask myself a little uneasily how that kind of men could do great  actions and behold the answer comes to me and i see a ship that  i would guarantee to go anywhere it was possible for men to go and  accomplish anything it was permitted man to attempt  i had a  cruise on board of her not long ago to manua and was delighted   the goodwill of all on board the grim playfulness of  quarters  with the wounded falling down at the word the ambulances hastening  up and carrying them away the captain suddenly crying fire in  the wardroom and the squad hastening forward with the hose and  last and most curious spectacle of all all the men in their dust coloured fatigue clothes at a note of the bugle falling  simultaneously flat on deck and the ship proceeding with its  prostrate crew  quasi to ram an enemy our dinner at night in a  wild open anchorage the ship rolling almost to her gunwales and  showing us alternately her bulwarks up in the sky and then the  wild broken cliffy palmcrested shores of the island with the surf  thundering and leaping close aboard  we had the wardroom mess on  deck lit by pink wax tapers everybody of course in uniform but  myself and the first lieutenant who is a rheumaticky body  wrapped in a boat cloak  gradually the sunset faded out the  island disappeared from the eye though it remained menacingly  present to the ear with the voice of the surf and then the captain  turned on the searchlight and gave us the coast the beach the  trees the native houses and the cliffs by glimpses of daylight a  kind of deliberate lightning  about which time i suppose we must  have come as far as the dessert and were probably drinking our  first glass of port to her majesty  we stayed two days at the  island and had in addition a very picturesque snapshot at the  native life  the three islands of manua are independent and are  ruled over by a little slip of a halfcaste girl about twenty who  sits all day in a pink gown in a little white european house with  about a quarter of an acre of roses in front of it looking at the  palmtrees on the village street and listening to the surf  this  so far as i could discover was all she had to do  this is a very  dull place she said  it appears she could go to no other village  for fear of raising the jealousy of her own people in the capital   and as for going about tafatafaoing as we say here its cost was  too enormous  a strong ablebodied native must walk in front of  her and blow the conch shell continuously from the moment she  leaves one house until the moment she enters another  did you ever  blow the conch shell  i presume not but the sweat literally  hailed off that man and i expected every moment to see him burst a  bloodvessel  we were entertained to kava in the guesthouse with  some very original features  the young men who run for the kava  have a right to misconduct themselves ad libitum on the way back  and though they were told to restrain themselves on the occasion of  our visit there was a strange hurlyburly at their return when  they came beating the trees and the posts of the houses leaping  shouting and yelling like bacchants  i tasted on that occasion what it is to be great  my name was  called next after the captains and several chiefs a thing quite  new to me and not at all samoan practice drank to me by name  and now if you are not sick of the curacoa and manua i am at  least on paper  and i decline any longer to give you examples of  how not to write  by the by you sent me long ago a work by anatole france which i  confess i did not taste  since then i have made the acquaintance  of the abbe coignard and have become a faithful adorer  i dont  think a better book was ever written  and i have no idea what i have said and i have no idea what i  ought to have said and i am a total ass but my heart is in the  right place and i am my dear henry james yours  r l s    letter  to mr marcel schwob    vailima upolu samoa july 7 1894  dear mr marcel schwob  thank you for having remembered me in my  exile  i have read mimes twice as a whole and now as i write i  am reading it again as it were by accident and a piece at a time  my eye catching a word and travelling obediently on through the  whole number  it is a graceful book essentially graceful with  its haunting agreeable melancholy its pleasing savour of  antiquity  at the same time by its merits it shows itself rather  as the promise of something else to come than a thing final in  itself  you have yet to give us  and i am expecting it with  impatience  something of a larger gait something daylit not  twilit something with the colours of life not the flat tints of a  temple illumination something that shall be said with all the  clearnesses and the trivialities of speech not sung like a semi articulate lullaby  it will not please yourself as well when you  come to give it us but it will please others better  it will be  more of a whole more worldly more nourished more commonplace   and not so pretty perhaps not even so beautiful  no man knows  better than i that as we go on in life we must part from  prettiness and the graces  we but attain qualities to lose them  life is a series of farewells even in art even our proficiencies  are deciduous and evanescent  so here with these exquisite pieces  the xviith xviiith and ivth of the present collection  you will  perhaps never excel them i should think the hermes never   well you will do something else and of that i am in expectation   yours cordially  robert louis stevenson    letter  to a st gaudens    vailima samoa july 8 1894  my dear st gaudens  this is to tell you that the medallion has  been at last triumphantly transported up the hill and placed over  my smokingroom mantelpiece  it is considered by everybody a  firstrate but flattering portrait  we have it in a very good  light which brings out the artistic merits of the godlike  sculptor to great advantage  as for my own opinion i believe it  to be a speaking likeness and not flattered at all possibly a  little the reverse  the verses curse the rhyme look remarkably  well  please do not longer delay but send me an account for the expense  of the gilt letters  i was sorry indeed that they proved beyond  the means of a small farmer  yours very sincerely  robert louis stevenson    letter  to miss adelaide boodle    vailima july 14 1894  my dear adelaide     so at last you are going into mission  work where i think your heart always was  you will like it in a  way but remember it is dreary long  do you know the story of the  american tramp who was offered meals and a days wage to chop with  the back of an axe on a fallen trunk  damned if i can go on  chopping when i cant see the chips fly  you will never see the  chips fly in mission work never and be sure you know it  beforehand  the work is one long dull disappointment varied by  acute revulsions and those who are by nature courageous and  cheerful and have grown old in experience learn to rub their hands  over infinitesimal successes  however as i really believe there  is some good done in the long run  gutta cavat lapidem non vi in  this business  it is a useful and honourable career in which no  one should be ashamed to embark  always remember the fable of the  sun the storm and the travellers cloak  forget wholly and for  ever all small pruderies and remember that you cannot change  ancestral feelings of right and wrong without what is practically  soulmurder  barbarous as the customs may seem always hear them  with patience always judge them with gentleness always find in  them some seed of good see that you always develop them remember  that all you can do is to civilise the man in the line of his own  civilisation such as it is  and never expect never believe in  thaumaturgic conversions  they may do very well for st paul in  the case of an andaman islander they mean less than nothing  in  fact what you have to do is to teach the parents in the interests  of their greatgrandchildren  now my dear adelaide dismiss from your mind the least idea of  fault upon your side nothing is further from the fact  i cannot  forgive you for i do not know your fault  my own is plain enough  and the name of it is coldhearted neglect and you may busy  yourself more usefully in trying to forgive me  but ugly as my  fault is you must not suppose it to mean more than it does it  does not mean that we have at all forgotten you that we have  become at all indifferent to the thought of you  see in my life  of jenkin a remark of his very well expressed on the friendships  of men who do not write to each other  i can honestly say that i  have not changed to you in any way though i have behaved thus ill  thus cruelly  evil is done by want of  well principally by want  of industry  you can imagine what i would say in a novel of any  one who had behaved as i have done deteriora sequor  and you must  somehow manage to forgive your old friend and if you will be so  very good continue to give us news of you and let us share the  knowledge of your adventures sure that it will be always followed  with interest  even if it is answered with the silence of  ingratitude  for i am not a fool i know my faults i know they  are ineluctable i know they are growing on me  i know i may  offend again and i warn you of it  but the next time i offend  tell me so plainly and frankly like a lady and dont lacerate my  heart and bludgeon my vanity with imaginary faults of your own and  purely gratuitous penitence  i might suspect you of irony  we are all fairly well though i have been off work and off  as  you know very well  letterwriting  yet i have sometimes more  than twenty letters and sometimes more than thirty going out each  mail  and fanny has had a most distressing bronchitis for some  time which she is only now beginning to get over  i have just  been to see her she is lying  though she had breakfast an hour  ago about seven  in her big cool mosquitoproof room  ingloriously asleep  as for me you see that a doom has come upon  me  i cannot make marks with a pen  witness ingloriously above  and my amanuensis not appearing so early in the day for she is  then immersed in household affairs and i can hear her steering  the boys up and down the verandahs  you must decipher this  unhappy letter for yourself and i fully admit with everything  against you  a letter should be always well written how much more  a letter of apology  legibility is the politeness of men of  letters as punctuality of kings and beggars  by the punctuality  of my replies and the beauty of my handwriting judge what a fine  conscience i must have  now my dear gamekeeper i must really draw to a close  for i have  much else to write before the mail goes out three days hence   fanny being asleep it would not be conscientious to invent a  message from her so you must just imagine her sentiments  i find  i have not the heart to speak of your recent loss  you remember  perhaps when my father died you told me those ugly images of  sickness decline and impaired reason which then haunted me day  and night would pass away and be succeeded by things more happily  characteristic  i have found it so  he now haunts me strangely  enough in two guises as a man of fifty lying on a hillside and  carving mottoes on a stick strong and well and as a younger man  running down the sands into the sea near north berwick myself   aetat ii  somewhat horrified at finding him so beautiful when  stripped  i hand on your own advice to you in case you have  forgotten it as i know one is apt to do in seasons of bereavement   ever yours with much love and sympathy  robert louis stevenson    letter  to mrs baker    vailima samoa july 16 1894  dear mrs baker  i am very much obliged to you for your letter  and the enclosure from mr skinner  mr skinner says he thinks  mr stevenson must be a very kind man he little knows me  but i  am very sure of one thing that you are a very kind woman  i envy  you  my amanuensis being called away i continue in my own hand  or what is left of it  unusually legible i am thankful to see  i  envy you your beautiful choice of an employment  there must be no  regrets at least for a day so spent and when the night falls you  need ask no blessing on your work  inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these  yours truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to j m barrie    vailima july 13 1894  my dear barrie  this is the last effort of an ulcerated  conscience  i have been so long owing you a letter i have heard  so much of you fresh from the press from my mother and graham  balfour that i have to write a letter no later than today or  perish in my shame  but the deuce of it is my dear fellow that  you write such a very good letter that i am ashamed to exhibit  myself before my junior which you are after all in the light of  the dreary idiot i feel  understand that there will be nothing  funny in the following pages  if i can manage to be rationally  coherent i shall be more than satisfied  in the first place i have had the extreme satisfaction to be shown  that photograph of your mother  it bears evident traces of the  hand of an amateur  how is it that amateurs invariably take better  photographs than professionals  i must qualify invariably  my own  negatives have always represented a province of chaos and old night  in which you might dimly perceive fleecy spots of twilight  representing nothing so that if i am right in supposing the  portrait of your mother to be yours i must salute you as my  superior  is that your mothers breakfast  or is it only  afternoon tea  if the first do let me recommend to mrs barrie to  add an egg to her ordinary  which if you please i will ask her  to eat to the honour of her son and i am sure she will live much  longer for it to enjoy his fresh successes  i never in my life  saw anything more deliciously characteristic  i declare i can hear  her speak  i wonder my mother could resist the temptation of your  proposed visit to kirriemuir which it was like your kindness to  propose  by the way i was twice in kirriemuir i believe in the  year 71 when i was going on a visit to glenogil  it was  kirriemuir was it not  i have a distinct recollection of an inn  at the end  i think the upper end  of an irregular open place or  square in which i always see your characters evolve  but indeed  i did not pay much attention being all bent upon my visit to a  shootingbox where i should fish a real troutstream and i  believe preserved  i did too and it was a charming stream clear  as crystal without a trace of peat  a strange thing in scotland   and alive with trout the name of it i cannot remember it was  something like the queens river and in some hazy way connected  with memories of mary queen of scots  it formed an epoch in my  life being the end of all my troutfishing  i had always been  accustomed to pause and very laboriously to kill every fish as i  took it  but in the queens river i took so good a basket that i  forgot these niceties and when i sat down in a hard rain shower  under a bank to take my sandwiches and sherry lo and behold  there was the basketful of trouts still kicking in their agony  i  had a very unpleasant conversation with my conscience  all that  afternoon i persevered in fishing brought home my basket in  triumph and sometime that night in the wee sma hours ayont the  twal i finally forswore the gentle craft of fishing  i dare say  your local knowledge may identify this historic river i wish it  could go farther and identify also that particular free kirk in  which i sat and groaned on sunday  while my hand is in i must tell  you a story  at that antique epoch you must not fall into the  vulgar error that i was myself ancient  i was on the contrary  very young very green and what you will appreciate mr barrie  very shy  there came one day to lunch at the house two very  formidable old ladies  or one very formidable and the other what  you please  answering to the honoured and historic name of the  miss c as of balnamoon  at table i was exceedingly funny and  entertained the company with tales of geese and bubblyjocks  i  was great in the expression of my terror for these bipeds and  suddenly this horrid severe and eminently matronly old lady put  up a pair of gold eyeglasses looked at me awhile in silence and  pronounced in a clangorous voice her verdict  you give me very  much the effect of a coward mr stevenson  i had very nearly  left two vices behind me at glenogil  fishing and jesting at  table  and of one thing you may be very sure my lips were no more  opened at that meal  july 29th  no barrie tis in vain they try to alarm me with their bulletins   no doubt youre ill and unco ill i believe but i have been so  often in the same case that i know pleurisy and pneumonia are in  vain against scotsmen who can write i once could  you cannot  imagine probably how near me this common calamity brings you  ce  que jai tousse dans ma vie  how often and how long have i been on  the rack at night and learned to appreciate that noble passage in  the psalms when somebody or other is said to be more set on  something than they who dig for hid treasures  yea than those  who long for the morning  for all the world as you have been  racked and you have longed  keep your heart up and youll do   tell that to your mother if you are still in any danger or  suffering  and by the way if you are at all like me  and i tell  myself you are very like me  be sure there is only one thing good  for you and that is the sea in hot climates  mount sir into a  little frigot of 5000 tons or so and steer peremptorily for the  tropics and what if the ancient mariner who guides your frigot  should startle the silence of the ocean with the cry of land ho   say when the day is dawning  and you should see the turquoise  mountain tops of upolu coming hand over fist above the horizon   mr barrie sir tis then there would be larks  and though i  cannot be certain that our climate would suit you for it does not  suit some i am sure as death the voyage would do you good  would  do you best  and if samoa didnt do you neednt stay beyond the  month and i should have had another pleasure in my life which is  a serious consideration for me  i take this as the hand of the  lord preparing your way to vailima  in the desert certainly  in  the desert of cough and by the ghoulhaunted woodland of fever   but whither that way points there can be no question  and there  will be a meeting of the twa hoasting scots makers in spite of  fate fortune and the devil  absit omen  my dear barrie i am a little in the dark about this new work of  yours  what is to become of me afterwards  you say carefully   methought anxiously  that i was no longer me when i grew up  i  cannot bear this suspense  what is it  its no forgery  and am i  hangit  these are the elements of a very pretty lawsuit which you  had better come to samoa to compromise  i am enjoying a great  pleasure that i had long looked forward to reading ormes history  of indostan i had been looking out for it everywhere but at last  in four volumes large quarto beautiful type and page and with a  delectable set of maps and plans and all the names of the places  wrongly spelled  it came to samoa little barrie  i tell you  frankly you had better come soon  i am sair failed aready and  what i may be if you continue to dally i dread to conceive  i may  be speechless already or at least for a month or so im little  better than a teetoller  i beg pardon a teetotaller  it is not  exactly physical for i am in good health working four or five  hours a day in my plantation and intending to ride a paperchase  next sunday  ay man thats a fact and i havena had the hert to  breathe it to my mother yet  the obligations poleetical for i am  trying every means to live well with my german neighbours  and o  barrie but its no easy  to be sure there are many exceptions   and the whole of the above must be regarded as private  strictly  private  breathe it not in kirriemuir  tell it not to the  daughters of dundee  what a nice extract this would make for the  daily papers and how it would facilitate my position here     august 5th  this is sunday the lords day  the hour of attack approaches   and it is a singular consideration what i risk i may yet be the  subject of a tract and a good tract too  such as one which i  remember reading with recreant awe and rising hair in my youth of  a boy who was a very good boy and went to sunday schule and one  day kipped from it and went and actually bathed and was dashed  over a waterfall and he was the only son of his mother and she  was a widow  a dangerous trade that and one that i have to  practise  ill put in a word when i get home again to tell you  whether im killed or not  accident in the paper hunting field   death of a notorious author  we deeply regret to announce the  death of the most unpopular man in samoa who broke his neck at the  descent of magagi from the misconduct of his little raving lunatic  of an old beast of a pony  it is proposed to commemorate the  incident by the erection of a suitable pile  the design by our  local architect mr walker is highly artificial with a rich and  voluminous crockett at each corner a small but impervious barrieer  at the entrance an arch at the top an archer of a pleasing but  solid character at the bottom the colour will be genuine william black and lang lang may the ladies sit wi their fans in their  hands  well well they may sit as they sat for me and little  theyll reck the ungrateful jauds  muckle they cared about  tusitala when they had him  but now ye can see the difference  now leddies ye can repent when ower late o your former  cauldness and what yell perhaps allow me to ca your tepeedity   he was beautiful as the day but his day is done  and perhaps as  he was maybe gettin a wee thing flyblawn its nane too shune  monday august 6th  well sir i have escaped the dangerous conjunction of the widows  only son and the sabbath day  we had a most enjoyable time and  lloyd and i were 3 and 4 to arrive i will not tell here what  interval had elapsed between our arrival and the arrival of 1 and  2 the question sir is otiose and malign it deserves it shall  have no answer  and now without further delay to the main purpose  of this hasty note  we received and we have already in fact  distributed the gorgeous fahbrics of kirriemuir  whether from the  splendour of the robes themselves or from the direct nature of the  compliments with which you had directed us to accompany the  presentations one young lady blushed as she received the proofs of  your munificence    bad ink and the dregs of it at that but  the heart in the right place  still very cordially interested in  my barrie and wishing him well through his sickness which is of  the body and long defended from mine which is of the head and by  the impolite might be described as idiocy  the whole head is  useless and the whole sitting part painful  reason the recent  paper chase   there was racing and chasing in vailile plantation and vastly we enjoyed it but alas for the state of my foundation for it wholly has destroyed it   come my mind is looking up  the above is wholly impromptu  on  oath  tusitala  august 12 1894  and here mr barrie is news with a vengeance  mother hubbards  dog is well again  what did i tell you  pleurisy pneumonia and  all that kind of truck is quite unavailing against a scotchman who  can write  and not only that but it appears the perfidious dog is  married  this incident so far as i remember is omitted from the  original epic    she went to the graveyard to see him get him buried and when she came back the deil had got merried   it now remains to inform you that i have taken what we call here  german offence at not receiving cards and that the only  reparation i will accept is that mrs barrie shall incontinently  upon the receipt of this take and bring you to vailima in order to  apologise and be pardoned for this offence  the commentary of  tamaitai upon the event was brief but pregnant  well its a  comfort our guestroom is furnished for two  this letter about nothing has already endured too long  i shall  just present the family to mrs barrie  tamaitai tamaitai matua  teuila palema loia and with an extra low bow yours  tusitala    letter  to dr bakewell    vailima august 7 1894  dear dr bakewell  i am not more than human  i am more human  than is wholly convenient and your anecdote was welcome  what you  say about unwilling work my dear sir is a consideration always  present with me and yet not easy to give its due weight to  you  grow gradually into a certain income without spending a penny  more with the same sense of restriction as before when you  painfully scraped two hundred a year together you find you have  spent and you cannot well stop spending a far larger sum and  this expense can only be supported by a certain production   however i am off work this month and occupy myself instead in  weeding my cacao paper chases and the like  i may tell you my  average of work in favourable circumstances is far greater than you  suppose  from six oclock till eleven at latest and often till  twelve and again in the afternoon from two to four  my hand is  quite destroyed as you may perceive today to a really unusual  extent  i can sometimes write a decent fist still but i have just  returned with my arms all stung from three hours work in the  cacao  yours etc  r l s    letter  to james payn    vailima upolu samoa august 11 1894  my dear james payn  i hear from lang that you are unwell and it  reminds me of two circumstances  first that it is a very long  time since you had the exquisite pleasure of hearing from me and  second that i have been very often unwell myself and sometimes  had to thank you for a grateful anodyne  they are not good the circumstances to write an anodyne letter   the hills and my house at less than boom a minutes interval  quake with thunder and though i cannot hear that part of it  shells are falling thick into the fort of luatuanuu boom  it is  my friends of the curacoa the falke and the bussard bombarding  after all these  boom  months the rebels of atua  boomboom   it is most distracting in itself and the thought of the poor  devils in their fort boom with their bits of rifles far from  pleasant  boomboom  you can see how quick it goes and ill  say no more about mr bowwow only you must understand the  perpetual accompaniment of this discomfortable sound and make  allowances for the value of my copy  it is odd though i can well  remember when the francoprussian war began and i was in eilean  earraid far enough from the sound of the loudest cannonade i  could hear the shots fired and i felt the pang in my breast of a  man struck  it was sometimes so distressing so instant that i  lay in the heather on the top of the island with my face hid  kicking my heels for agony  and now when i can hear the actual  concussion of the air and hills when i know personally the people  who stand exposed to it i am able to go on tant bien que mal with  a letter to james payn  the blessings of age though mighty small  are tangible  i have heard a great deal of them since i came into  the world and now that i begin to taste of them  well  but this  is one that people do get cured of the excess of sensibility and  i had as lief these people were shot at as myself  or almost for  then i should have some of the fun such as it is  you are to conceive me then sitting in my little gallery room  shaken by these continual spasms of cannon and with my eye more or  less singly fixed on the imaginary figure of my dear james payn  i  try to see him in bed no go  i see him instead jumping up in his  room in waterloo place where ex hypothesi he is not sitting on  the table drawing out a very black briarroot pipe and beginning  to talk to a slim and illdressed visitor in a voice that is good  to hear and with a smile that is pleasant to see  after a little  more than half an hour the voice that was ill to hear has ceased  the cannonade is over  and i am thinking how i can get an  answering smile wafted over so many leagues of land and water and  can find no way  i have always been a great visitor of the sick and one of the sick  i visited was w e henley which did not make very tedious visits  so ill not get off much purgatory for them  that was in the  edinburgh infirmary the old one the true one with georgius  secundus standing and pointing his toe in a niche of the facade  and a mighty fine building it was  and i remember one winters  afternoon in that place of misery that henley and i chanced to  fall in talk about james payn himself  i am wishing you could have  heard that talk  i think that would make you smile  we had mixed  you up with john payne for one thing and stood amazed at your  extraordinary even painful versatility and for another we found  ourselves each students so well prepared for examinations on the  novels of the real mackay  perhaps after all this is worth  something in life  to have given so much pleasure to a pair so  different in every way as were henley and i and to be talked of  with so much interest by two such beg pardon clever lads  the cheerful lang has neglected to tell me what is the matter with  you so im sorry to say i am cut off from all the customary  consolations  i cant say think how much worse it would be if  you had a broken leg when you may have the crushing repartee up  your sleeve but it is my leg that is broken  this is a pity   but there are consolations  you are an englishman i believe you  are a man of letters you have never been made cb your hair was  not red you have played cribbage and whist you did not play  either the fiddle or the banjo you were never an aesthete you  never contributed to s journal your name is not jabez balfour  you are totally unconnected with the army and navy departments i  understand you to have lived within your income  why cheer up  here are many legitimate causes of congratulation  i seem to be  writing an obituary notice  absit omen  but i feel very sure that  these considerations will have done you more good than medicine  by the by did you ever play piquet  i have fallen a victim to  this debilitating game  it is supposed to be scientific god save  the mark what selfdeceivers men are  it is distinctly less so  than cribbage  but how fascinating  there is such material  opulence about it such vast ambitions may be realised  and are  not it may be called the monte cristo of games  and the thrill  with which you take five cards partakes of the nature of lust  and  you draw four sevens and a nine and the seven and nine of a suit  that you discarded and o but the world is a desert  you may see  traces of discouragement in my letter  all due to piquet  there  has been a disastrous turn of the luck against me a month or two  ago i was two thousand ahead now and for a week back i have been  anything from four thousand eight hundred to five thousand two  hundred astern  if i have a sixieme my beast of a partner has a  septieme and if i have three aces three kings three queens and  three knaves excuse the slight exaggeration the devil holds  quatorze of tens  i remain my dear james payn your sincere and  obliged friend  old friend let me say  robert louis stevenson    letter  to miss middleton    vailima samoa september 9 1894  dear miss middleton  your letter has been like the drawing up of  a curtain  of course i remember you very well and the skye  terrier to which you refer  a heavy dull fatted graceless  creature he grew up to be  was my own particular pet  it may  amuse you perhaps as much as the inn amused me if i tell you  what made this dog particularly mine  my father was the natural  god of all the dogs in our house and poor jura took to him of  course  jura was stolen and kept in prison somewhere for more  than a week as i remember  when he came back smeoroch had come  and taken my fathers heart from him  he took his stand like a  man and positively never spoke to my father again from that day  until the day of his death  it was the only sign of character he  ever showed  i took him up to my room and to be my dog in  consequence partly because i was sorry for him and partly because  i admired his dignity in misfortune  with best regards and thanks for having reminded me of so many  pleasant days old acquaintances dead friends and  what is  perhaps as pathetic as any of them  dead dogs i remain yours  truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to a conan doyle    vailima samoa september 9 1894  my dear conan doyle  if you found anything to entertain you in my  treasure island article it may amuse you to know that you owe it  entirely to yourself  your first book was by some accident read  aloud one night in my baronial all  i was consumedly amused by  it so was the whole family and we proceeded to hunt up back  idlers and read the whole series  it is a rattling good series  even people whom you would not expect came in quite the proper tone   miss braddon for instance who was really one of the best where  all are good  or all but one   in short i fell in love with  the first book series and determined that it should be all our  first books and that i could not hold back where the white plume  of conan doyle waved gallantly in the front  i hope they will  republish them though its a grievous thought to me that that  effigy in the german cap  likewise the other effigy of the noisome  old man with the long hair telling indelicate stories to a couple  of deformed negresses in a rancid shanty full of wreckage  should  be perpetuated  i may seem to speak in pleasantry  it is only a  seeming  that german cap sir would be found when i come to die  imprinted on my heart  enough  my heart is too full  adieu   yours very truly  robert louis stevenson  in a german cap damn em    letter  to charles baxter    vailima september 1894  my dear charles     well there is no more edmund baxter now  and i think i may say i know how you feel  he was one of the best  the kindest and the most genial men i ever knew  i shall always  remember his brisk cordial ways and the essential goodness which  he showed me whenever we met with gratitude  and the always is  such a little while now  he is another of the landmarks gone when  it comes to my own turn to lay my weapons down i shall do so with  thankfulness and fatigue and whatever be my destiny afterward i  shall be glad to lie down with my fathers in honour  it is human  at least if not divine  and these deaths make me think of it with  an ever greater readiness  strange that you should be beginning a  new life when i who am a little your junior am thinking of the  end of mine  but i have had hard lines i have been so long  waiting for death i have unwrapped my thoughts from about life so  long that i have not a filament left to hold by i have done my  fiddling so long under vesuvius that i have almost forgotten to  play and can only wait for the eruption and think it long of  coming  literally no man has more wholly outlived life than i   and still its good fun  r l s    letter  to r a m stevenson    vailima september 1894  dear bob  you are in error about the picts  they were a gaelic  race spoke a celtic tongue and we have no evidence that i know of  that they were blacker than other celts  the balfours i take it  were plainly celts their name shows it  the cold croft it  means so does their country  where the black scotch come from  nobody knows but i recognise with you the fact that the whole of  britain is rapidly and progressively becoming more pigmented  already in one mans life i can decidedly trace a difference in the  children about a school door  but colour is not an essential part  of a man or a race  take my polynesians an asiatic people  probably from the neighbourhood of the persian gulf  they range  through any amount of shades from the burnt hue of the low  archipelago islander which seems half negro to the bleached  pretty women of the marquesas close by on the map who come out  for a festival no darker than an italian their colour seems to  vary directly with the degree of exposure to the sun  and as with  negroes the babes are born white only it should seem a little  sack of pigment at the lower part of the spine which presently  spreads over the whole field  very puzzling  but to return  the  picts furnish today perhaps a third of the population of scotland  say another third for scots and britons and the third for norse  and angles is a bad third  edinburgh was a pictish place  but the  fact is we dont know their frontiers  tell some of your  journalist friends with a good style to popularise old skene or  say your prayers and read him for yourself he was a great  historian and i was his blessed clerk and did not know it and  you will not be in a state of grace about the picts till you have  studied him  j horne stevenson do you know him is working this  up with me and the fact is  its not interesting to the public   but its interesting and very interesting in itself and just now  very embarrassing  this rural parish supplied glasgow with such a  quantity of stevensons in the beginning of last century  there is  just a link wanting and we might be able to go back to the  eleventh century always undistinguished but clearly traceable   when i say just a link i guess i may be taken to mean a dozen   what a singular thing is this undistinguished perpetuation of a  family throughout the centuries and the sudden bursting forth of  character and capacity that began with our grandfather  but as i  go on in life day by day i become more of a bewildered child i  cannot get used to this world to procreation to heredity to  sight to hearing the commonest things are a burthen  the prim  obliterated polite face of life and the broad bawdy and  orgiastic  or maenadic  foundations form a spectacle to which no  habit reconciles me and i could wish my days to be bound each to  each by the same openmouthed wonder  they are anyway and  whether i wish it or not  i remember very well your attitude to life this conventional  surface of it  you had none of that curiosity for the social stage  directions the trivial ficelles of the business it is simian but  that is how the wild youth of man is captured you wouldnt  imitate hence you kept free  a wild dog outside the kennel  and  came dam near starving for your pains  the key to the business is  of course the belly difficult as it is to keep that in view in the  zone of three miraculous meals a day in which we were brought up   civilisation has become reflex with us you might think that hunger  was the name of the best sauce but hunger to the cold solitary  under a bush of a rainy night is the name of something quite  different  i defend civilisation for the thing it is for the  thing it has come to be the standpoint of a real old tory  my  ideal would be the female clan  but how can you turn these  crowding dumb multitudes back  they dont do anything because  they do things write able articles stitch shoes dig from the  purely simian impulse  go and reason with monkeys  no i am right about jean lillie  jean lillie our double great grandmother the daughter of david lillie sometime deacon of the  wrights married first alan stevenson who died may 26 1774 at  santt kittes of a fiver by whom she had robert stevenson born  8th june 1772 and second in may or june 1787 thomas smith a  widower and already the father of our grandmother  this  improbable double connection always tends to confuse a student of  the family thomas smith being doubly our greatgrandfather  i looked on the perpetuation of our honoured name with veneration   my mother collared one of the photos of course the other is stuck  up on my wall as the chief of our sept  do you know any of the  gaelicceltic sharps you might ask what the name means  it  puzzles me  i find a mstein and a macstephane and our own great grandfather always called himself steenson though he wrote it  stevenson  there are at least three places called stevenson   stevenson in cunningham stevenson in peebles and stevenson in  haddington  and it was not the celtic trick i understand to call  places after people  i am going to write to sir herbert maxwell  about the name but you might find some one  get the anglosaxon heresy out of your head they superimposed  their language they scarce modified the race only in berwickshire  and roxburgh have they very largely affected the place names  the  scandinavians did much more to scotland than the angles  the  saxons didnt come  enough of this sham antiquarianism  yes it is in the matter of  the book of course that collaboration shows as for the manner  it is superficially all mine in the sense that the last copy is  all in my hand  lloyd did not even put pen to paper in the paris  scenes or the barbizon scene it was no good he wrote and often  rewrote all the rest i had the best service from him on the  character of nares  you see we had been just meeting the man and  his memory was full of the mans words and ways  and lloyd is an  impressionist pure and simple  the great difficulty of  collaboration is that you cant explain what you mean  i know what  kind of effect i mean a character to give  what kind of tache he  is to make but how am i to tell my collaborator in words  hence  it was necessary to say make him soandso and this was all  right for nares and pinkerton and loudon dodd whom we both knew  but for bellairs for instance  a man with whom i passed ten  minutes fifteen years ago  what was i to say and what could lloyd  do  i as a personal artist can begin a character with only a  haze in my head but how if i have to translate the haze into words  before i begin  in our manner of collaboration which i think the  only possible  i mean that of one person being responsible and  giving the coup de pouce to every part of the work i was spared  the obviously hopeless business of trying to explain to my  collaborator what style i wished a passage to be treated in  these  are the times that illustrate to a man the inadequacy of spoken  language  now  to be just to written language  i can or could  find a language for my every mood but how could i tell any one  beforehand what this effect was to be which it would take every  art that i possessed and hours and hours of deliberate labour and  selection and rejection to produce  these are the impossibilities  of collaboration  its immediate advantage is to focus two minds  together on the stuff and to produce in consequence an  extraordinarily greater richness of purview consideration and  invention  the hardest chapter of all was cross questions and  crooked answers  you would not believe what that cost us before  it assumed the least unity and colour  lloyd wrote it at least  thrice and i at least five times  this is from memory  and was  that last chapter worth the trouble it cost  alas that i should  ask the question  two classes of men  the artist and the  educationalist  are sworn on soul and conscience not to ask it   you get an ordinary grinning redheaded boy and you have to  educate him  faith supports you you give your valuable hours the  boy does not seem to profit but that way your duty lies for which  you are paid and you must persevere  education has always seemed  to me one of the few possible and dignified ways of life  a  sailor a shepherd a schoolmaster  to a less degree a soldier   and i dont know why upon my soul except as a sort of  schoolmasters unofficial assistant and a kind of acrobat in  tights an artist almost exhaust the category  if i had to begin again  i know not  si jeunesse savait si  vieillesse pouvait    i know not at all  i believe i should try  to honour sex more religiously  the worst of our education is that  christianity does not recognise and hallow sex  it looks askance  at it over its shoulder oppressed as it is by reminiscences of  hermits and asiatic selftortures  it is a terrible hiatus in our  modern religions that they cannot see and make venerable that which  they ought to see first and hallow most  well it is so i cannot  be wiser than my generation  but no doubt there is something great in the halfsuccess that has  attended the effort of turning into an emotional religion bald  conduct without any appeal or almost none to the figurative  mysterious and constitutive facts of life  not that conduct is  not constitutive but dear its dreary  on the whole conduct is  better dealt with on the castiron gentleman and duty formula  with as little fervour and poetry as possible stoical and short     there is a new something or other in the wind which  exercises me hugely  anarchy  i mean anarchism  people who  for pitys sake commit dastardly murders very basely die like  saints and leave beautiful letters behind em did you see  vaillant to his daughter it was the new testament over again  people whose conduct is inexplicable to me and yet their spiritual  life higher than that of most  this is just what the early  christians must have seemed to the romans  is this then a new  drive among the monkeys  mind you bob if they go on being  martyred a few years more the gross dull not unkindly bourgeois  may get tired or ashamed or afraid of going on martyring and the  anarchists come out at the top just like the early christians   that is of course they will step into power as a personnel but  god knows what they may believe when they come to do so it cant  be stranger or more improbable than what christianity had come to  be by the same time  your letter was easily read the pagination presented no  difficulty and i read it with much edification and gusto  to look  back and to stereotype one bygone humour  what a hopeless thing   the mind runs ever in a thousand eddies like a river between  cliffs  you the ego are always spinning round in it east west  north and south  you are twenty years old and forty and five  and the next moment you are freezing at an imaginary eighty you  are never the plain fortyfour that you should be by dates  the  most philosophical language is the gaelic which has no present  tense  and the most useless  how then to choose some former  age and stick there  r l s    letter  to sir herbert maxwell    vailima samoa september 10 1894  dear sir herbert maxwell  i am emboldened by reading your very  interesting rhind lectures to put to you a question  what is my  name stevenson  i find it in the forms stevinetoun stevensoune stevensonne  stenesone stewinsoune mstein and macstephane  my family and  as far as i can gather the majority of the inglorious clan  hailed from the borders of cunningham and renfrew and the upper  waters of the clyde  in the barony of bothwell was the seat of the  laird stevenson of stevenson but as of course you know there is  a parish in cunningham and places in peebles and haddington bearing  the same name  if you can at all help me you will render me a real service which  i wish i could think of some manner to repay  believe me yours  truly  robert louis stevenson  ps  i should have added that i have perfect evidence before me  that for some obscure reason stevenson was a favourite alias with  the mgregors    letter  to alison cunningham    vailima october 8th 1894  my dear cummy  so i hear you are ailing  think shame to  yourself  so you think there is nothing better to be done with  time than that and be sure we can all do much ourselves to decide  whether we are to be ill or well like a man on the gymnastic bars   we are all pretty well  as for me there is nothing the matter  with me in the world beyond the disgusting circumstance that i am  not so young as once i was  lloyd has a gymnastic machine and  practises upon it every morning for an hour  he is beginning to be  a kind of young samson  austin grows fat and brown and gets on  not so ill with his lessons and my mother is in great price  we  are having knockmedown weather for heat i never remember it so  hot before and i fancy it means we are to have a hurricane again  this year i think since we came here we have not had a single  gale of wind  the pacific is but a child to the north sea but  when she does get excited and gets up and girds herself she can  do something good  we have had a very interesting business here   i helped the chiefs who were in prison and when they were set  free what should they do but offer to make a part of my road for  me out of gratitude  well i was ashamed to refuse and the trumps  dug my road for me and put up this inscription on a board  considering the great love of his excellency tusitala in his  loving care of us in our tribulation in the prison we have made  this great gift it shall never be muddy it shall go on for ever  this road that we have dug  we had a great feast when it was  done and i read them a kind of lecture which i dare say auntie  will have and can let you see  weel guid bye to ye and joy be  wi ye  i hae nae time to say mair  they say im gettin fat  a  fact  your laddie with all love  robert louis stevenson    letter  to james payn    vailima samoa nov 4 1894  my dear james payn  i am asked to relate to you a little incident  of domestic life at vailima  i had read your gleams of memory no  1 it then went to my wife to osbourne to the cousin that is  within my gates and to my respected amanuensis mrs strong   sunday approached  in the course of the afternoon i was attracted  to the great all  the winders is by vanderputty which upon  entering i beheld a memorable scene  the floor was bestrewn with  the forms of midshipmen from the curacoa  boldly say a wilderness  of gunroom  and in the midst of this sat mrs strong throned on  the sofa and reading aloud gleams of memory  they had just come  the length of your immortal definition of boyhood in the concrete  and i had the pleasure to see the whole party dissolve under its  influence with inextinguishable laughter  i thought this was not  half bad for arthritic gout  depend upon it sir when i go into  the arthritic gout business i shall be done with literature or at  least with the funny business  it is quite true i have my  battlefields behind me  i have done perhaps as much work as  anybody else under the most deplorable conditions  but two things  fall to be noticed  in the first place i never was in actual  pain and in the second i was never funny  ill tell you the  worst day that i remember  i had a haemorrhage and was not  allowed to speak then induced by the devil or an errant doctor  i was led to partake of that bowl which neither cheers nor  inebriates  the castoroil bowl  now when castoroil goes right  it is one thing but when it goes wrong it is another  and it  went wrong with me that day  the waves of faintness and nausea  succeeded each other for twelve hours and i do feel a legitimate  pride in thinking that i stuck to my work all through and wrote a  good deal of admiral guinea which i might just as well not have  written for all the reward it ever brought me in spite of the  barbarous bad conditions  i think that is my great boast and it  seems a little thing alongside of your gleams of memory illustrated  by spasms of arthritic gout  we really should have an order of  merit in the trade of letters  for valour scott would have had  it pope too myself on the strength of that castoroil and james  payn would be a knight commander  the worst of it is though lang  tells me you exhibit the courage of huish that not even an order  can alleviate the wretched annoyance of the business  i have  always said that there is nothing like pain toothache dumbague  arthritic gout it does not matter what you call it if the screw  is put upon the nerves sufficiently strong there is nothing left  in heaven or in earth that can interest the sufferer  still even  to this there is the consolation that it cannot last for ever   either you will be relieved and have a good hour again before the  sun goes down or else you will be liberated  it is something  after all although not much to think that you are leaving a brave  example that other literary men love to remember as i am sure  they will love to remember everything about you  your sweetness  your brightness your helpfulness to all of us and in particular  those one or two really adequate and noble papers which you have  been privileged to write during these last years  with the  heartiest and kindest goodwill i remain yours ever  r l s    letter  to lieutenant eeles    vailima samoa november 24 1894  my dear eeles  the hand as you will perceive and also the  spelling is teuilas but the scrannel voice is what remains of  tusitalas  first of all for business  when you go to london you  are to charter a hansom cab and proceed to the museum  it is  particular fun to do this on sundays when the monument is shut up   your cabman expostulates with you you persist  the cabman drives  up in front of the closed gates and says i told you so sir   you breathe in the porters ears the mystic name of colvin and he  immediately unfolds the iron barrier  you drive in and doesnt  your cabman think youre a swell  a lord mayor is nothing to it   colvins door is the only one in the eastern gable of the building   send in your card to him with from r l s in the corner and  the machinery will do the rest  henry jamess address is 34 de  vere mansions west  i cannot remember where the place is i cannot  even remember on which side of the park  but its one of those big  cromwell roadlooking deserted thoroughfares out west in kensington  or bayswater or between the two and anyway colvin will be able  to put you on the direct track for henry james  i do not send  formal introductions as i have taken the liberty to prepare both  of them for seeing you already  hoskyn is staying with us  it is raining dismally  the curacoa track is hardly passable but  it must be trod tomorrow by the degenerate feet of their successor  the wallaroos  i think it a very good account of these last that  we dont think them either deformed or habitual criminals  they  seem to be a kindly lot  the doctor will give you all the gossip  i have preferred in this  letter to stick to the strictly solid and necessary  with kind  messages from all in the house to all in the wardroom all in the  gunroom and may we dare to breathe it to him who walks abaft  believe me my dear eeles yours ever  r l stevenson    letter  to sir herbert maxwell    vailima samoa december 1 1894  dear sir herbert  thank you very much for your long and kind  letter  i shall certainly take your advice and call my cousin the  lyon king into council  it is certainly a very interesting  subject though i dont suppose it can possibly lead to anything  this connection between the stevensons and mgregors  alas your  invitation is to me a mere derision  my chances of visiting heaven  are about as valid as my chances of visiting monreith  though i  should like well to see you shrunken into a cottage a literary  lord of ravenscraig  i suppose it is the inevitable doom of all  those who dabble in scotch soil but really your fate is the more  blessed  i cannot conceive anything more grateful to me or more  amusing or more picturesque than to live in a cottage outside your  own parkwalls  with renewed thanks believe me dear sir  herbert yours very truly  robert louis stevenson    letter  to andrew lang    vailima samoa december 1 1894  my dear lang  for the portrait of braxfield much thanks  it is  engraved from the same raeburn portrait that i saw in 76 or 77  with so extreme a gusto that i have ever since been braxfields  humble servant and am now trying as you know to stick him into a  novel  alas one might as well try to stick in napoleon  the  picture shall be framed and hung up in my study  not only as a  memento of you but as a perpetual encouragement to do better with  his lordship  i have not yet received the transcripts  they must  be very interesting  do you know i picked up the other day an old  longmans where i found an article of yours that i had missed  about christies  i read it with great delight  the year ends  with us pretty much as it began among wars and rumours of wars  and a vast and splendid exhibition of official incompetence   yours ever  r l stevenson    letter  to edmund gosse    vailima samoa december 1 1894  i am afraid my dear weg that this must be the result of bribery  and corruption  the volume to which the dedication stands as  preface seems to me to stand alone in your work it is so natural  so personal so sincere so articulate in substance and what you  always were sure of  so rich in adornment  let me speak first of the dedication  i thank you for it from the  heart  it is beautifully said beautifully and kindly felt and i  should be a churl indeed if i were not grateful and an ass if i  were not proud  i remember when symonds dedicated a book to me i  wrote and told him of the pang of gratified vanity with which i  had read it  the pang was present again but how much more sober  and autumnal  like your volume  let me tell you a story or  remind you of a story  in the year of grace something or other  anything between 76 and 78 i mentioned to you in my usual  autobiographical and inconsiderate manner that i was hard up  you  said promptly that you had a balance at your bankers and could  make it convenient to let me have a cheque and i accepted and got  the money  how much was it  twenty or perhaps thirty pounds  i  know not  but it was a great convenience  the same evening or  the next day i fell in conversation in my usual autobiographical  and    see above with a denizen of the savile club name now  gone from me only his figure and a dim threequarter view of his  face remaining  to him i mentioned that you had given me a loan  remarking easily that of course it didnt matter to you  whereupon  he read me a lecture and told me how it really stood with you  financially  he was pretty serious fearing as i could not help  perceiving that i should take too light a view of the  responsibility and the service i was always thought too light   the irresponsible jester  you remember  o quantum mutatus ab  illo  if i remember rightly the money was repaid before the end  of the week  or to be more exact and a trifle pedantic the  sennight  but the service has never been forgotten and i send you  back this piece of ancient history consule planco as a salute for  your dedication and propose that we should drink the health of the  nameless one who opened my eyes as to the true nature of what you  did for me on that occasion  but here comes my amanuensis so well get on more swimmingly now   you will understand perhaps that what so particularly pleased me in  the new volume what seems to me to have so personal and original a  note are the middleaged pieces in the beginning  the whole of  them i may say though i must own an especial liking to    i yearn not for the fighting fate that holds and hath achieved i live to watch and meditate and dream  and be deceived   you take the change gallantly  not i i must confess  it is all  very well to talk of renunciation and of course it has to be done   but for my part give me a roaring toothache  i do like to be  deceived and to dream but i have very little use for either  watching or meditation  i was not born for age  and curiously  enough i seem to see a contrary drift in my work from that which  is so remarkable in yours  you are going on sedately travelling  through your ages decently changing with the years to the proper  tune  and here am i quite out of my true course and with nothing  in my foolish elderly head but lovestories  this must repose upon  some curious distinction of temperaments  i gather from a phrase  boldly autobiographical that you are  well not precisely growing  thin  can that be the difference  it is rather funny that this matter should come up just now as i  am at present engaged in treating a severe case of middle age in  one of my stories  the justiceclerk  the case is that of a  woman and i think that i am doing her justice  you will be  interested i believe to see the difference in our treatments   secreta vitae comes nearer to the case of my poor kirstie  come  to think of it gosse i believe the main distinction is that you  have a family growing up around you and i am a childless rather  bitter very cleareyed blighted youth  i have in fact lost the  path that makes it easy and natural for you to descend the hill  i  am going at it straight  and where i have to go down it is a  precipice  i must not forget to give you a word of thanks for an english  village  it reminds me strongly of keats which is enough to say  and i was particularly pleased with the petulant sincerity of the  concluding sentiment  well my dear gosse heres wishing you all health and prosperity  as well as to the mistress and the bairns  may you live long  since it seems as if you would continue to enjoy life  may you  write many more books as good as this one  only theres one thing  impossible you can never write another dedication that can give  the same pleasure to the vanished  tusitala
