74030387	deep waters  by ww jacobs    family cares  mr jernshaw who was taking the opportunity of a lull in business to weigh out pound packets of sugar knocked his hands together and stood waiting for the order of the tall bronzed man who had just entered the shopa wellbuilt man of about fortywho was regarding him with blue eyes set in quizzical wrinkles  what harry exclaimed mr jernshaw in response to the wrinkles harry barrett  thats me said the other extending his hand  the rolling stone come home covered with moss  mr jernshaw somewhat excited shook hands and led the way into the little parlour behind the shop  fifteen years said mr barrett sinking into a chair and the old place hasnt altered a bit  smithson told me he had let that house in webb street to a barrett said the grocer regarding him but i never thought of you  i suppose youve done well then  mr barrett nodded  cant grumble he said modestly  ive got enough to live on  melbournes all right but i thought id come home for the evening of my life  evening repeated his friend  fortythree said mr barrett gravely  im getting on  you havent changed much said the grocer passing his hand through his spare grey whiskers  wait till you have a wife and seven youngsters why boots alone  mr barrett uttered a groan intended for sympathy  perhaps you could help me with the furnishing he said slowly  ive never had a place of my own before and i dont know much about it  anything i can do said his friend  better not get much yet you might marry and my taste mightnt be hers  mr barrett laughed  im not marrying he said with conviction  seen anything of miss prentice yet inquired mr jernshaw  no said the other with a slight flush  why  shes still single said the grocer  what of it  demanded mr barrett with warmth  what of it  nothing said mr jernshaw slowly  nothing only i  well  said the other as he paused  ithere was an idea that you went to australia toto better your condition murmured the grocer  thatthat you were not in a position to marrythat  boy and girl nonsense said mr barrett sharply  why its fifteen years ago  i dont suppose i should know her if i saw her  is her mother alive  rather said mr jernshaw with emphasis  louisa is something like what her mother was when you went away  mr barrett shivered  but youll see for yourself continued the other  youll have to go and see them  theyll wonder you havent been before  let em wonder said the embarrassed mr barrett  i shall go and see all my old friends in their turn casuallike  you might let em hear that ive been to see you before seeing them and then if theyre thinking any nonsense itll be a hint  im stopping in town while the house is being decorated next time i come down ill call and see somebody else  thatll be another hint assented mr jernshaw  not that hints are much good to mrs prentice  well see said mr barrett  in accordance with his plan his return to his native town was heralded by a few short visits at respectable intervals  a sort of human butterfly he streaked rapidly across one or two streets alighted for half an hour to resume an old friendship and then disappeared again  having given at least halfadozen hints of this kind he made a final return to ramsbury and entered into occupation of his new house  it does you credit jernshaw he said gratefully  i should have made a rare mess of it without your help  it looks very nice admitted his friend  too nice  thats all nonsense said the owner irritably  all right said mr jernshaw  i dont know the sex then thats all if you think that youre going to keep a nice house like this all to yourself youre mistaken  its a home and where theres a home a woman comes in somehow  mr barrett grunted his disbelief  i give you four days said mr jernshaw  as a matter of fact mrs prentice and her daughter came on the fifth mr barrett who was in an easychair wooing slumber with a handkerchief over his head heard their voices at the front door and the cordial invitation of his housekeeper  they entered the room as he sat hastily smoothing his rumpled hair  good afternoon he said shaking hands  mrs prentice returned the greeting in a level voice and accepting a chair gazed around the room  nice weather said mr barrett  very said mrs prentice  itsits quite a pleasure to see you again said mr barrett  we thought we should have seen you before said mrs prentice but i told louisa that no doubt you were busy and wanted to surprise her i like the carpet dont you louisa  miss prentice said she did  the room is nice and airy said mrs prentice but its a pity you didnt come to me before deciding  i could have told you of a better house for the same money  im very well satisfied with this said mr barrett  its all i want  its well enough conceded mrs prentice amiably  and how have you been all these years  mr barrett with some haste replied that his health and spirits had been excellent  you look well said mrs prentice  neither of you seem to have changed much she added looking from him to her daughter  and i think you did quite well not to write  i think it was much the best  mr barrett sought for a question a natural artless question that would neutralize the hideous suggestion conveyed by this remark but it eluded him  he sat and gazed in growing fear at mrs prentice  ii couldnt write he said at last in desperation my wife  your what exclaimed mrs prentice loudly  wife said mr barrett suddenly calm now that he had taken the plunge she wouldnt have liked it  mrs prentice tried to control her voice  i never heard you were married she gasped  why isnt she here  we couldnt agree said the veracious mr barrett  she was very difficult so i left the children with her and  chil said mrs prentice and paused unable to complete the word  five said mr barrett in tones of resignation  it was rather a wrench parting with them especially the baby  he got his first tooth the day i left  the information fell on deaf ears  mrs prentice for once in her life thoroughly at a loss sat trying to collect her scattered faculties  she had come out prepared for a hard job but not an impossible one  all things considered she took her defeat with admirable composure  i have no doubt it is much the best thing for the children to remain with their mother she said rising  much the best agreed mr barrett  whatever she is like continued the old lady  are you ready louisa  mr barrett followed them to the door and then returning to the room watched with glad eyes their progress up the street  wonder whether shell keep it to herself he muttered  his doubts were set at rest next day  all ramsbury knew by then of his matrimonial complications and seemed anxious to talk about them complications which tended to increase until mr barrett wrote out a list of his childrens names and ages and learnt it off by heart  relieved of the attentions of the prentice family he walked the streets a free man and it was counted to him for righteousness that he never said a hard word about his wife  she had her faults he said but they were many thousand miles away and he preferred to forget them  and he added with some truth that he owed her a good deal  for a few months he had no reason to alter his opinion  thanks to his presence of mind the prentice family had no terrors for him  heart whole and fancy free he led the easy life of a man of leisure a condition of things suddenly upset by the arrival of miss grace lindsay to take up a post at the elementary school  mr barrett succumbed almost at once and after a few encounters in the street and meetings at mutual friends went to unbosom himself to mr jernshaw  what has she got to do with you demanded that gentleman  iim rather struck with her said mr barrett  struck with her repeated his friend sharply  im surprised at you youve no business to think of such things  why not demanded mr barrett in tones that were sharper still  why not repeated the other  have you forgotten your wife and children  mr barrett who to do him justice had forgotten fell back in his chair and sat gazing at him openmouthed  youre in a false positionin a way said mr jernshaw sternly  false is no name for it said mr barrett huskily  what am i to do  do repeated the other staring at him  nothing  unless perhaps you send for your wife and children  i suppose in any case you would have to have the little ones if anything happened to her  mr barrett grinned ruefully  think it over said mr jernshaw  i will said the other heartily  he walked home deep in thought  he was a kindly man and he spent some time thinking out the easiest death for mrs barrett  he decided at last upon heartdisease and a fortnight later all ramsbury knew of the letter from australia conveying the mournful intelligence  it was generally agreed that the mourning and the general behaviour of the widower left nothing to be desired  shes at peace at last he said solemnly to jernshaw  i believe you killed her said his friend  mr barrett started violently  i mean your leaving broke her heart explained the other  mr barrett breathed easily again  its your duty to look after the children said jernshaw firmly  and im not the only one that thinks so  they are with their grandfather and grandmother said mr barrett  mr jernshaw sniffed  and four uncles and five aunts added mr barrett triumphantly  think how they would brighten up your house said mr jernshaw  his friend shook his head  it wouldnt be fair to their grandmother he said decidedly  besides australia wants population  he found to his annoyance that mr jernshaws statement that he was not alone in his views was correct  public opinion seemed to expect the arrival of the children and one citizen even went so far as to recommend a girl he knew as nurse  ramsbury understood at last that his decision was final and observing his attentions to the new schoolmistress flattered itself that it had discovered the reason  it is possible that miss lindsay shared their views but if so she made no sign and on the many occasions on which she met mr barrett on her way to and from school greeted him with frank cordiality  even when he referred to his loneliness which he did frequently she made no comment  he went into halfmourning at the end of two months and a month later bore no outward signs of his loss  added to that his step was springy and his manner youthful  miss lindsay was twentyeight and he persuaded himself that sexes considered there was no disparity worth mentioning  he was only restrained from proposing by a question of etiquette  even a shilling book on the science failed to state the interval that should elapse between the death of one wife and the negotiations for another it preferred instead to give minute instructions with regard to the eating of asparagus  in this dilemma he consulted jernshaw  dont know im sure said that gentleman besides it doesnt matter  doesnt matter  repeated mr barrett  why not  because i think tillett is paying her attentions was the reply  hes ten years younger than you are and a bachelor  a girl would naturally prefer him to a middleaged widower with five children  in australia the other reminded him  man for man bachelor for bachelor said mr jernshaw regarding him she might prefer you as things are  i shall ask her said mr barrett doggedly  i was going to wait a bit longer but if theres any chance of her wrecking her prospects for life by marrying that tailors dummy its my duty to risk itfor her sake  ive seen him talking to her twice myself but i never thought hed dream of such a thing  apprehension and indignation kept him awake half the night but when he arose next morning it was with the firm resolve to put his fortune to the test that day  at four oclock he changed his necktie for the third time and at ten past sallied out in the direction of the school  he met miss lindsay just coming out and after a welldeserved compliment to the weather turned and walked with her  i was hoping to meet you he said slowly  yes said the girl  ii have been feeling rather lonely today he continued  you often do said miss lindsay guardedly  it gets worse and worse said mr barrett sadly  i think i know what is the matter with you said the girl in a soft voice you have got nothing to do all day and you live alone except for your housekeeper  mr barrett assented with some eagerness and stole a hopeful glance at her  youyou miss something continued miss  lindsay in a faltering voice  i do said mr barrett with ardour  you missthe girl made an effortyou miss the footsteps and voices of your little children  mr barrett stopped suddenly in the street and then with a jerk went blindly on  ive never spoken of it before because its your business not mine continued the girl  i wouldnt have spoken now but when you referred to your loneliness i thought perhaps you didnt realize the cause of it  mr barrett walked on in silent misery  poor little motherless things said miss lindsay softly  motherless andfatherless  better for them said mr barrett finding his voice at last  it almost looks like it said miss lindsay with a sigh  mr barrett tried to think clearly but the circumstances were hardly favourable  suppose he said speaking very slowly suppose i wanted to get married  miss lindsay started  what again she said with an air of surprise  how could i ask a girl to come and take over five children  no woman that was worth having would let little children be sacrificed for her sake said miss lindsay decidedly  do you think anybody would marry me with five children demanded mr barrett  she might said the girl edging away from him a little  it depends on the woman  wouldyou for instance  said mr barrett desperately  miss lindsay shrank still farther away  i dont know it would depend upon circumstances she murmured  i will write and send for them said mr barrett significantly  miss lindsay made no reply  they had arrived at her gate by this time and with a hurried handshake she disappeared indoors  mr barrett somewhat troubled in mind went home to tea  he resolved after a little natural hesitation to drown the children and reproached himself bitterly for not having disposed of them at the same time as their mother  now he would have to go through another period of mourning and the consequent delay in pressing his suit moreover he would have to allow a decent interval between his conversation with miss lindsay and their untimely end  the news of the catastrophe arrived two or three days before the return of the girl from her summer holidays  she learnt it in the first half hour from her landlady and sat in a dazed condition listening to a description of the griefstricken father and the sympathy extended to him by his fellowcitizens  it appeared that nothing had passed his lips for two days  illustration she learnt the news in the first halfhoer from her landlady  shocking  said miss lindsay briefly  shocking   an instinctive feeling that the right and proper thing to do was to nurse his grief in solitude kept mr barrett out of her way for nearly a week when she did meet him she received a limp handshake and a greeting in a voice from which all hope seemed to have departed  i am very sorry she said with a sort of measured gentleness  mr barrett in his hushed voice thanked her  i am all alone now he said pathetically  there is nobody now to care whether i live or die  miss lindsay did not contradict him  how did it happen she inquired after they had gone some distance in silence  they were out in a sailingboat said mr barrett the boat capsized in a puff of wind and they were all drowned  who was in charge of them inquired the girl after a decent interval  boatman replied the other  how did you hear  i had a letter from one of my sistersinlaw charlotte said mr barrett  a most affecting letter  poor charlotte was like a second mother to them  shell never be the same woman again  never  i should like to see the letter said miss lindsay musingly  mr barrett suppressed a start  i should like to show it to you he said but im afraid i have destroyed it  it made me shudder every time i looked at it  its a pity said the girl dryly  i should have liked to see it ive got my own idea about the matter  are you sure she was very fond of them  she lived only for them said mr barrett in a rapt voice  exactly  i dont believe they are drowned at all said miss lindsay suddenly  i believe you have had all this terrible anguish for nothing its too cruel  mr barrett stared at her in anxious amazement  i see it all now continued the girl  their aunt charlotte was devoted to them  she always had the fear that some day you would return and claim them and to prevent that she invented the story of their death  charlotte is the most truthful woman that ever breathed said the distressed mr barrett  miss lindsay shook her head  you are like all other honourable truthful people she said looking at him gravely  you cant imagine anybody else telling a falsehood  i dont believe you could tell one if you tried  mr barrett gazed about him with the despairing look of a drowning mariner  im certain im right continued the girl  i can see charlotte exulting in her wickedness  why  whats the matter  inquired mr barrett greatly worried  ive just thought of it said miss lindsay  shes told you that your children are drowned and she has probably told them you are dead  a woman like that would stick at nothing to gain her ends  you dont know charlotte said mr barrett feebly  i think i do was the reply  however well make sure  i suppose youve got friends in melbourne  a few said mr barrett guardedly  come down to the postoffice and cable to one of them  mr barrett hesitated  ill write he said slowly  its an awkward thing to cable and theres no hurry  ill write to jack adams i think  its no good writing said miss lindsay firmly  you ought to know that  why not demanded the other  because you foolish man said the girl calmly before your letter got there there would be one from melbourne saying that he had been choked by a fishbone or died of measles or something of that sort  mr barrett hardly able to believe his ears stopped short and looked at her  the girls eyes were moist with mirth and her lips trembling  he put out his hand and took her wrist in a strong grip  thats all right he said with a great gasp of relief  phew  at one time i thought i had lost you  by heartdisease or drowning  inquired miss lindsay softly
