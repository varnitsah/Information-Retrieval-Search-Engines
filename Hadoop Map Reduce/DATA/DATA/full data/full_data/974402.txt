possession of gads hill and was able to turn workmen into it in april he stayed with his wife and sisterinlaw for a week or two at wates hotel gravesend to be at hand to superintend the beginning of his alterations of the house and from thence we give a letter to lord carlisle he removed his family for a summer residence in the house in june and he finished little dorrit there early in the summer one of his first visitors at gads hill was the famous writer hans christian andersen in january the frozen deep had been played at the tavistock house theatre with such great success that it was necessary to repeat it several times and the theatre was finally demolished at the end of that month in june charles dickens heard with great grief of the death of his dear friend douglas jerrold and as a testimony of admiration for his genius and affectionate regard for himself it was decided to organise under the management of charles dickens a series of entertainments in memory of the late douglas jerrold the fund produced by them a considerable sum to be presented to mr jerrolds family the amateur company including many of mr jerrolds colleagues on punch gave subscription performances of the frozen deep the gallery of illustration in regent street being engaged for the purpose charles dickens gave two readings at st martins hall of the christmas carol to such immense audiences and with such success that the idea of giving public readings for his own benefit first occurred to him at this time the professional actors among them the famous veteran actor mr t p cooke gave a performance of mr jerrolds plays of the rent day and blackeyed susan in which mr t p cooke sustained the character in which he had originally made such great success when the play was written a lecture was given by mr thackeray and another by mr w h russell finally the queen having expressed a desire to see the play which had been much talked of during that season there was another performance before her majesty and the prince consort at the gallery of illustration in july and at the end of that month charles dickens read his carol in the free trade hall at manchester and to wind up the memorial fund entertainments the frozen deep was played again at manchester also in the great free trade hall at the end of august for the business of these entertainments he secured the assistance of mr arthur smith of whom he writes to mr forster at this time i have got hold of arthur smith as the best man of business i know and go to work with him tomorrow morning and when he began his own public readings both in town and country he felt himself most fortunate in having the cooperation of this invaluable man of business and also of his zealous friendship and pleasant companionship  in july his second son walter landor went to india as a cadet in the companys service from which he was afterwards transferred to the 42nd royal highlanders his father and his elder brother went to see him off to southampton from this place charles dickens writes to mr edmund yates a young man in whom he had been interested from his boyhood both for the sake of his parents and for his own sake and for whom he had always an affectionate regard  in september he made a short tour in the north of england with mr wilkie collins out of which arose the lazy tour of two idle apprentices written by them jointly and published in household words some letters to his sisterinlaw during this expedition are given here parts of which as is the case with many letters to his eldest daughter and his sisterinlaw have been published in mr forsters book  the letters which follow are almost all on the various subjects mentioned in our notes and need little explanation  his letter to mr procter makes allusion to a legacy lately left to that friend  the letters to mr dilke the original and muchrespected editor of the athenæum and to mr forster on the subject of the literary fund refer as the letters indicate to a battle which they were carrying on together with that institution  a letter to mr frank stone is an instance of his kind patient and judicious criticism of a young writer and the letter which follows it shows how thoroughly it was understood and how perfectly appreciated by the authoress of the notes referred to another instance of the same kind criticism is given in a second letter this year to mr edmund yates   sidenote mr b w procter                                   tavistock house january 2nd 1857  my dear procter  i have to thank you for a delightful book which has given me unusual pleasure my delight in it has been a little dashed by certain farewell verses but i have made up my mind and you have no idea of the obstinacy of my character not to believe them  perhaps it is not taking a libertyperhaps it isto congratulate you on kenyons remembrance either way i cant help doing it with all my heart for i know no man in the world myself excepted to whom i would rather the money went                                              affectionately yours ever   sidenote sir james emerson tennent                                   tavistock house january 9th 1857  my dear tennent   i must thank you for your earnest and affectionate letter it has given me the greatest pleasure mixing the play in my mind confusedly and delightfully with pisa the valetta naples herculanæumgod knows what not  as to the play itself when it is made as good as my care can make it i derive a strange feeling out of it like writing a book in company a satisfaction of a most singular kind which has no exact parallel in my life a something that i suppose to belong to the life of a labourer in art alone and which has to me a conviction of its being actual truth without its pain that i never could adequately state if i were to try never so hard  you touch so kindly and feelingly on the pleasure such little pains give that i feel quite sorry you have never seen this drama in progress during the last ten weeks here every monday and friday evening during that time we have been at work upon it i assure you it has been a remarkable lesson to my young people in patience perseverance punctuality and order and best of all in that kind of humility which is got from the earned knowledge that whatever the right hand finds to do must be done with the heart in it and in a desperate earnest  when i changed my dress last night though i did it very quickly i was vexed to find you gone i wanted to have secured you for our greenroom supper which was very pleasant if by any accident you should be free next wednesday night our last pray come to that greenroom supper it would give me cordial pleasure to have you there                             ever my dear tennent very heartily yours   sidenote m de cerjat                       tavistock house monday night jan 17th 1857  my dear cerjat  so wonderfully do good epistolary intentions become confounded with bad execution that i assure you i laboured under a perfect and most comfortable conviction that i had answered your christmas eve letter of 1855 more than that in spite of your assertions to the contrary i still strenuously believe that i did so i have more than half a mind little dorrit and my other occupations notwithstanding to charge you with having forgotten my reply i have even a wild idea that townshend reproached me when the last old year was new with writing to you instead of to him we will argue it out as well as we can argue anything without poor dear haldimand when i come back to elysée in any case however dont discontinue your annual letter because it has become an expected and a delightful part of the season to me  with one of the prettiest houses in london and every conceivable and inconceivable luxury in it townshend is voluntarily undergoing his own sentence of transportation in nervi a beastly little place near genoa where you would as soon find a herd of wild elephants in any villa as comfort he has a notion that he must be out of england in the winter but i believe him to be altogether wrong as i have just told him in a letter unless he could just take his society with him  workmen are now battering and smashing down my theatre here where we have just been acting a new play of great merit done in what i may call modestly speaking of the gettingup and not of the acting an unprecedented way i believe that anything so complete has never been seen we had an act at the north pole where the slightest and greatest thing the eye beheld were equally taken from the books of the polar voyagers out of thirty people there were certainly not two who might not have gone straight to the north pole itself completely furnished for the winter it has been the talk of all london for these three weeks and now it is a mere chaos of scaffolding ladders beams canvases paintpots sawdust artificial snow gaspipes and ghastliness i have taken such pains with it for these ten weeks in all my leisure hours that i feel now shipwreckedas if i had never been without a play on my hands before a third topic comes up as this ceases  down at gads hill near rochester in kentshakespeares gads hill where falstaff engaged in the robberyis a quaint little countryhouse of queen annes time i happened to be walking past a year and a half or so ago with my subeditor of household words when i said to him you see that house it has always a curious interest for me because when i was a small boy down in these parts i thought it the most beautiful house i suppose because of its famous old cedartrees ever seen and my poor father used to bring me to look at it and used to say that if i ever grew up to be a clever man perhaps i might own that house or such another house in remembrance of which i have always in passing looked to see if it was to be sold or let and it has never been to me like any other house and it has never changed at all we came back to town and my friend went out to dinner next morning he came to me in great excitement and said it is written that you were to have that house at gads hill the lady i had allotted to me to take down to dinner yesterday began to speak of that neighbourhood you know it i said i have been there today o yes said she i know it very well i was a child there in the house they call gads hill place my father was the rector and lived there many years he has just died has left it to me and i want to sell it so says the subeditor you must buy it now or never i did and hope to pass next summer there though i may perhaps let it afterwards furnished from time to time  all about myself i find and the little sheet nearly full but i know my dear cerjat the subject will have its interest for you so i give it its swing mrs watson was to have been at the play but most unfortunately had three children sick of gastric fever and could not leave them she was here some three weeks before looking extremely well in the face but rather thin i have not heard of your friend mr percival skelton but i much misdoubt an amateur artists success in this vast place i hope you detected a remembrance of our happy visit to the great st bernard in a certain number of little dorrit tell mrs cerjat with my love that the opinions i have expressed to her on the subject of cows have become matured in my mind by experience and venerable age and that i denounce the race as humbugs who have been getting into poetry and all sorts of places without the smallest reason haldimands housekeeper is an awful woman to consider pray give him our kindest regards and remembrances if you ever find him in a mood to take it our means mrs dickenss georgies and mine we often often talk of our old days at lausanne and send loving regard to mrs cerjat and all your house                            adieu my dear fellow ever cordially yours   sidenote mr w c macready                                  tavistock house january 28th 1857  my dearest macready  your friend and servant is as calm as pecksniff saving for his knitted brows now turning into cordage over little dorrit the theatre has disappeared the house is restored to its usual conditions of order the family are tranquil and domestic doveeyed peace is enthroned in this study fireeyed radicalism in its masters breast  i am glad to hear that our poetess is at work again and shall be very much pleased to have some more contributions from her  love from all to your dear sister and to katie and to all the house  we dined yesterday at frederick pollocks i begged an amazing photograph of you and brought it away it strikes me as one of the most ludicrous things i ever saw in my life i think of taking a publichouse and having it copied larger for the size you may remember it very square and bigthe saracens head with its hair cut and in modern gear staring very hard as your particular friend i would not part with it on any consideration i will never get such a wooden head again                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote miss mary boyle                                  tavistock house february 7th 1857  my dear mary   halfadozen words on this my birthday to thank you for your kind and welcome remembrance and to assure you that your joseph is proud of it  for about ten minutes after his death on each occasion of that event occurring richard wardour was in a floored condition and one night to the great terror of devonshire the arctic regions and newfoundland all of which localities were afraid to speak to him as his ghost sat by the kitchen fire in its rags he very nearly did what he never did went and fainted off dead again but he always plucked up on the turn of ten minutes and became facetious  likewise he chipped great pieces out of all his limbs solely as i imagine from moral earnestness and concussion of passion for i never know him to hit himself in any way and terrified aldersley1 to that degree by lunging at him to carry him into the cave that the said aldersley always shook like a mould of jelly and muttered by g this is an awful thing                                                    ever affectionately  psi shall never cease to regret mrs watsons not having been there   sidenote rev james white                              tavistock house sunday feb 8th 1857  my dear white  i send these lines by mary and katey to report my love to all  your note about the golden mary gave me great pleasure though i dont believe in one part of it for i honestly believe that your story as really belonging to the rest of the narrative had been generally separated from the other stories and greatly liked i had not that particular shipwreck that you mention in my mind indeed i doubt if i know it and john steadiman merely came into my head as a staunch sort of name that suited the character the number has done household words great service and has decidedly told upon its circulation  you should have come to the play i much doubt if anything so complete will ever be seen again an incredible amount of pains and ingenuity was expended on it and the result was most remarkable even to me  when are you going to send something more to h w are you lazy lowspirited pining for paris                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mr c w dilke              office of household words thursday march 19th 1857  my dear mr dilke  forster has another notion about the literary fund will you name a day next weekthat day being neither thursday nor saturdaywhen we shall hold solemn council there at halfpast four  for myself i beg to report that i have my warpaint on that i have buried the pipe of peace and am whooping for committee scalps                                                  ever faithfully yours   sidenote the earl of carlisle                         gravesend kent wednesday april 15th 1857  my dear lord carlisle  i am writing by the riverside for a few days and at the end of last week  appeared here with your note of introduction i was not in the way but as  had come express from london with it mrs dickens opened it and gave her in the limited sense which was of no use to her an audience she did not quite seem to know what she wanted of me but she said she had understood at stafford house that i had a theatre in which she could read with a good deal of modesty and diffidence she at last got so far now my little theatre turns my house out of window costs fifty pounds to put up and is only two months taken down therefore is quite out of the question this mrs dickens explained and also my profound inability to do anything for  readings which they could not do for themselves she appeared fully to understand the explanation and indeed to have anticipated for herself how powerless i must be in such a case  she described herself as being consumptive and as being subject to an effusion of blood from the lungs about the last condition one would think poor woman for the exercise of public elocution as an art  between ourselves i think the whole idea a mistake and have thought so from its first announcement it has a fatal appearance of trading upon uncle tom and am i not a man and a brother which you may be by all means and still not have the smallest claim to my attention as a public reader the town is overread from all the white squares on the draughtboard it has been considerably harried from all the black squaresnow with the aid of old banjoes and now with the aid of exeter hall and i have a very strong impression that it is by no means to be laid hold of from this point of address i myself for example am the meekest of men and in abhorrence of slavery yield to no human creature and yet i dont admit the sequence that i want uncle tom or aunt tomasina to expound king lear to me and i believe my case to be the case of thousands  i trouble you with this much about it because i am naturally desirous you should understand that if i could possibly have been of any service or have suggested anything to this poor lady i would not have lost the opportunity but i cannot help her and i assure you that i cannot honestly encourage her to hope i fear her enterprise has no hope in it  in your absence i have always followed you through the papers and felt a personal interest and pleasure in the public affection in which you are held over there2 at the same time i must confess that i should prefer to have you here where good public men seem to me to be dismally wanted i have no sympathy with demagogues but am a grievous radical and think the political signs of the times to be just about as bad as the spirit of the people will admit of their being in all other respects i am as healthy sound and happy as your kindness can wish so you will set down my political despondency as my only disease  on the tiptop of gads hill between this and rochester on the very spot where falstaff ran away i have a pretty little oldfashioned house which i shall live in the hope of showing to you one day also i have a little story respecting the manner in which it became mine which i hope on the same occasion in the clouds to tell you until then and always i am dear lord carlisle                                      yours very faithfully and obliged   sidenote mr john forster                                      tavistock house may 13th 1857  my dear forster  i have gone over dilkes memoranda and i think it quite right and necessary that those points should be stated nor do i see the least difficulty in the way of their introduction into the pamphlet but i do not deem it possible to get the pamphlet written and published before the dinner i have so many matters pressing on my attention that i cannot turn to it immediately on my release from my book just finished it shall be done and distributed early next month  as to anything being lost by its not being in the hands of the people who dine as you seem to think i have not the least misgiving on that score they would say if it were issued just what they will say without it  lord granville is committed to taking the chair and will make the best speech he can in it the pious  will cram him with as many distortions of the truth as his stomach may be strong enough to receive  with bardolphian eloquence will cool his nose in the modest merits of the institution  will make a neat and appropriate speech on both sides round the corner and over the way and all this would be done exactly to the same purpose and in just the same strain if twenty thousand copies of the pamphlet had been circulated                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote rev james white                              tavistock house friday may 22nd 1857  my dear white  my emancipation having been effected on saturday the ninth of this month i take some shame to myself for not having sooner answered your note but the host of things to be done as soon as i was free and the tremendous number of ingenuities to be wrought out at gads hill have kept me in a whirl of their own ever since  we purpose going to gads hill for the summer on the 1st of june as apart from the masters eye being a necessary ornament to the spot i clearly see that the workmen yet lingering in the yard must be squeezed out by bodily pressure or they will never go how will this suit you and yours if you will come down we can take you all in on your way north that is to say we shall have that ample verge and room enough until about the eighth when hans christian andersen who has been coming for about three years will come for a fortnights stay in england i shall like you to see the little oldfashioned place it strikes me as being comfortable  so let me know your little game and with love to mrs white lotty and clara                                  believe me ever affectionately yours   sidenote mr frank stone ara                  office of household words monday june 1st 1857  my dear stone  i know that what i am going to say will not be agreeable but i rely on the authoresss good sense and say it knowing it to be the truth  these notes are destroyed by too much smartness it gives the appearance of perpetual effort stabs to the heart the nature that is in them and wearies by the manner and not by the matter it is the commonest fault in the world as i have constant occasion to observe here but it is a very great one just as you couldnt bear to have an épergne or a candlestick on your table supported by a light figure always on tiptoe and evidently in an impossible attitude for the sustainment of its weight so all readers would be more or less oppressed and worried by this presentation of everything in one smart point of view when they know it must have other and weightier and more solid properties airiness and good spirits are always delightful and are inseparable from notes of a cheerful trip but they should sympathise with many things as well as see them in a lively way it is but a word or a touch that expresses this humanity but without that little embellishment of good nature there is no such thing as humour in this little ms everything is too much patronised and condescended to whereas the slightest touch of feeling for the rustic who is of the earth earthy or of sisterhood with the homely servant who has made her face shine in her desire to please would make a difference that the writer can scarcely imagine without trying it the only relief in the twentyone slips is the little bit about the chimes it is a relief simply because it is an indication of some kind of sentiment you dont want any sentiment laboriously made out in such a thing you dont want any maudlin show of it but you do want a pervading suggestion that it is there it makes all the difference between being playful and being cruel again i must say above all thingsespecially to young people writing for the love of god dont condescend dont assume the attitude of saying see how clever i am and what fun everybody else is take any shape but that  i observe an excellent quality of observation throughout and think the boy at the shop and all about him particularly good i have no doubt whatever that the rest of the journal will be much better if the writer chooses to make it so if she considers for a moment within herself she will know that she derived pleasure from everything she saw because she saw it with innumerable lights and shades upon it and bound to humanity by innumerable fine links she cannot possibly communicate anything of that pleasure to another by showing it from one little limited point only and that point observe the one from which it is impossible to detach the exponent as the patroness of a whole universe of inferior souls this is what everybody would mean in objecting to these notes supposing them to be published that they are too smart and too flippant  as i understand this matter to be altogether between us three and as i think your confidence and hers imposes a duty of friendship on me i discharge it to the best of my ability perhaps i make more of it than you may have meant or expected if so it is because i am interested and wish to express it if there had been anything in my objection not perfectly easy of removal i might after all have hesitated to state it but that is not the case a very little indeed would make all this gaiety as sound and wholesome and goodnatured in the readers mind as it is in the writers                                                  affectionately always   sidenote anonymous                   gads hill place higham thursday june 4th 1857  my dear   coming home here last night from a days business in london i found your most excellent note awaiting me in which i have had a pleasure to be derived from none but good and natural things i can now honestly assure you that i believe you will write well and that i have a lively hope that i may be the means of showing you yourself in print one day your powers of graceful and lighthearted observation need nothing but the little touches on which we are both agreed and i am perfectly sure that they will be as pleasant to you as to anyone for nobody can see so well as you do without feeling kindly too  to confess the truth to you i was half sorry yesterday that i had been so unreserved but not half as sorry yesterday as i am glad today you must not mind my adding that there is a noble candour and modesty in your note which i shall never be able to separate from you henceforth                                            affectionately yours always   sidenote mr henry austin                                 gads

for the day and this morning very little water having been got into the cisterns it is dry again it is pretty clear to me that we must look the thing in the face and at once bore deeper dig or do some beastly thing or other to secure this necessary in abundance meanwhile i am in a most plaintive and forlorn condition without your presence and counsel i raise my voice in the wilderness and implore the same  wild legends are in circulation among the servants how that captain goldsmith on the knoll abovethe skipper in that crowsnest of a househas millions of gallons of water always flowing for him can he have damaged my well can we imitate him and have our millions of gallons goldsmith or i must fall so i conceive  if you get this send me a telegraph message informing me when i may expect comfort i am held by four of the family while i write this in case i should do myself a mischiefit certainly wont be taking to drinking water                                ever affectionately most

friday the 24th i have to repeat my reading at st martins hall on saturday the 25th to repeat the frozen deep at the gallery of illustration for the last time on thursday the 30th or friday the 31st i shall probably read at manchester deane the general manager of the exhibition is going down tonight and will arrange all the preliminaries for me if you and i went down to manchester together and were there on a sunday he would give us the whole exhibition to ourselves it is probable i think as he estimates the receipts of a night at about seven hundred pounds that we may in about a fortnight or so after the reading play the frozen deep at manchester but of this contingent engagement i at present know no more than you do  now will you upon this exposition of affairs choose your own time for coming to us and when you have made your choice write to me at gads hill i am going down this afternoon for rest which means violent cricket with the boys after last saturday night which was a teaser but triumphant the st martins hall audience was i must confess a very extraordinary thing the two thousand and odd people were like one and their enthusiasm was something awful  yet i have seen that before too your young remembrance cannot recall the man but he flourished in my daya great actor sira noble actorthorough artist i have seen him do wonders in that way he retired from the stage early

everybody felt i should feel it quite an impertinence to take myself out of the crowd therefore if i could by any means help doing so but i cant so i hope you will feel that you bring me on yourself and have only yourself to blame                                                always faithfully yours   sidenote mrs compton                          gads hill place higham by rochester                                         sunday night aug 2nd 1857  my dear mrs compton  we are going to play the frozen deep pursuant to requisition from town magnates etc at manchester at the new free trade hall on the nights of friday and saturday the 21st and 22nd august  the place is out of the question for my girls their action could not be seen and their voices could not be heard you and i have played there and elsewhere so sociably and happily that i am emboldened to ask you whether you would play my sisterinlaw georginas part compton and babies permitting  we shall go down in the old pleasant way and shall have the art treasures exhibition to ourselves on the sunday when even he as rogers always called every pretty womans husband might come and join us  what do you say what does he say and what does baby say when i use the term baby i use it in two tensespresent and future  answer me at this address like the juliet i saw at drury lanewhen was ityesterday and whatever your answer is if

movements in the jerrold matter  we are going to wind up by acting at manchester on solemn requisition on the evenings of friday and saturday the 21st and 22nd actresses substituted for the girls of course we shall have to leave here on the morning of the 20th you thought of coming on the 16th cant you make it a day or two earlier so as to be with us a whole week decide and pronounce again cannot you bring katey with you decide and pronounce thereupon also  i read at manchester last friday as many thousand people were there as you like to name the collection of pictures in the exhibition is wonderful and the power with which the modern english school asserts itself is a very gratifying and delightful thing to behold the care for the common people in the provision made for their comfort and refreshment is also admirable and worthy of all commendation but they want more amusement and particularly as it strikes me something in motion though it were only a twisting fountain the thing is too still after their lives of machinery and art flies over their heads in consequence  i hope you have seen my tussle with the edinburgh i saw the chance last friday week as i was going down to read the carol in st martins hall instantly turned to then and there and wrote half the article flew out of bed early next morning and finished it by noon went down to gallery of illustration we acted that night did the days business corrected the proofs in polar costume in dressingroom broke up two numbers of household words to get it out directly played in frozen deep and uncle john presided at supper of company made no end of speeches went home and gave in completely for four hours then got sound asleep and next day was as fresh as you used to be in the faroff days of your lusty youth  all here send kindest love to your dear good sister and all the house                                           ever and ever affectionately   sidenote mr frank stone ara                    tavistock house sunday afternoon aug 9th 1857  my dear stone  now here without any preface is a good confounding stunning question for youwould you like to play uncle john on the two nights at manchester  it is not a long part you could have a full rehearsal on the friday and i could sit in the wing at night and pull you through all the business perhaps you might not object to being in the thing in your own native place and the relief to me would be enormous  this is what has come into my head lying in bed today i have been in bed all day and this is just my plain reason for writing to you  its a capital part and you are a capital old man you know the play as we play it and the manchester people dont say the word and ill send you my own book by return of post  the agitation and exertion of richard wardour are so great to me that i cannot rally my spirits in the short space of time i get the strain is so great to make a show of doing it that i want to be helped out of uncle john if i can think of yourself far more than me but if you half think you are up to the joke and half doubt your being so then give me the benefit of the doubt and play the part  answer me at gads hill                                                    ever affectionately  psif you play i shall immediately announce it to all concerned if you dont i shall go on as if nothing had happened and shall say nothing to anyone   sidenote mr henry austin                          gads hill place saturday aug 15th 1857  my dear henry  at last i am happy to inform you we have got at a famous spring it rushed in this morning ten foot deep and our friends talk of its supplying a ton a minute for yourself and your family sir for nevermore  they ask leave to bore ten feet lower to prevent the possibility of what they call a choking with sullage likewise they are going to insert a roseheaded pipe at the mention of which implement i am secretly wellnigh distracted having no idea of what it means but i have said yes besides instantly standing a bottle of gin can you come back and can you get down on monday morning to advise and endeavour to decide on the mechanical force we shall use for raising the water i would return with you as i shall have to be in town until thursday and then to go to manchester until the following tuesday  i send this by hand to john to bring to you                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mr frank stone ara                            gads hill place monday aug 17th 1857  my dear stone  i received your kind note this morning and write this reply here to take to london with me and post in town being bound for that village and three days drill of the professional ladies who are to succeed the tavistock girls  my book i enclose there is a slight alteration which does not affect you at the end of the first act in order that the piece may be played through without having the drop curtain down you will not find the situations or business difficult with me on the spot to put you right  now as to the dress you will want a pair of pumps and a pair of white silk socks these you can get at manchester the extravagantly and ancientlyfrilled shirts that i have had got up for the part i will bring you down large white waistcoat i will bring you down large white hat i will bring you down dressinggown i will bring you down white gloves and ditto choker you can get at manchester there then remain only a pair of common nankeen tights to button below the calf and blue weddingcoat the nankeen tights you had best get made at once my uncle john coat i will send you down in a parcel by tomorrows train to have altered in manchester to your shape and figure you will then be quite independent of christian chance and jewish nathan which latter potentate is now at canterbury with the cricket amateurs and might fail  a thursdays rehearsal is unfortunately now impracticable the passes for the railway being all made out and the companys sailing orders issued but as i have already suggested with a careful rehearsal on friday morning and with me at the wing at night to put you right you will find yourself sliding through it easily there is nothing in the least complicated in the business as to the dance you have only to knock yourself up for a twelvemonth and it will go nobly  after all too if you should through any unlucky breakdown come to be afraid of it i am no worse off than i was before if i have to do it at last keep your pecker up with that  i am heartily obliged to you my dear old boy for your affectionate and considerate note and i wouldnt have you do it really and sincerelyimmense as the relief will be to meunless you are quite comfortable in it and able to enjoy it                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mr frank stone ara                office of household words tuesday aug 18th 1857  my dear stone  i sent you a telegraph message last night in total contradiction of the letter you received from me this morning  the reason was simply this arthur smith and the other business men both in manchester and here urged upon me in the strongest manner that they were afraid of the change that it was well known in manchester that i had done the part in london that there was a danger of its being considered disrespectful in me to give it up also that there was a danger that it might be thought that i did so at the last minute after an immense let whereas i might have done it at first etc etc etc having no desire but for the success of our object and a becoming recognition on my part of the kind manchester publics cordiality i gave way and thought it best to go on  i do so against the grain and against every inclination and against the strongest feeling of gratitude to you my people at home will be miserable too when they hear i am going to do it if i could have heard from you sooner and got the bill out sooner i should have been firmer in considering my own necessity of relief as it is i sneak under and i hope you will feel the reasons and approve                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mr henry austin                         gads hill place wednesday sept 2nd 1857  my dear henry  the second conspirator has been here this morning to ask whether you wish the windlass to be left in the yard and whether you will want him and his mate any more and if so when of course he says rolling something in the form of a fillet in at one broken tooth all the while and rolling it out at another that they could wish fur to have the windlass if it warnt any ways a hill conwenience fur to fetch her away i have told him that if he will come back on friday he shall have your reply will you therefore send it me by return of post he says hell look up as if he was an astronomer a friday arterdinner  on monday i am going away with collins for ten days or a fortnight on a tour in search of an article for household words we have not the least idea where we are going but he says lets look at the norfolk coast and i say lets look at the back of the atlantic i dont quite know what i mean by that but have a general impression that i mean something knowing  i am horribly used up after the jerrold business low spirits low pulse low voice intense reaction if i were not like mr micawber falling back for a spring on monday i think i should slink into a corner and cry                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote miss hogarth                allonby cumberland wednesday night sept 9th 1857  my dear georgy                                       think of collinss usual luck with me we went up a cumberland mountain yesterdaya huge black hill fifteen hundred feet high we took for a guide a capital innkeeper hard by it rained in torrentsas it only does rain in a hill countrythe whole time at the top there were black mists and the darkness of night it then came out that the innkeeper had not been up for twenty years and he lost his head and himself altogether and we couldnt get down again what wonders the inimitable performed with his compass until it broke with the heat and wet of his pocket no matter it did break and then we wandered about until it was clear to the inimitable that the night must be passed there and the enterprising travellers probably die of cold we took our own way about coming down struck and declared that the guide might wander where he would but we would follow a watercourse we lighted upon and which must come at last to the river this necessitated amazing gymnastics in the course of which performances collins fell into the said watercourse with his ankle sprained and the great ligament of the foot and leg swollen i dont know how big  how i enacted wardour over again in carrying him down and what a business it was to get him down i may say in gibbss words vi lascio a giudicare but he was got down somehow and we got off the mountain somehow and now i carry him to bed and into and out of carriages exactly like wardour in private life i dont believe he will stand for a month to come he has had a doctor and can wear neither shoe nor stocking and has his foot wrapped up in a flannel waistcoat and has a breakfast saucer of liniment and a horrible dabbling of lotion incessantly in progress we laugh at it all but i doubt very much whether he can go on to doncaster it will be a miserable blow to our h w scheme and i say nothing about it as yet but he is really so crippled that i doubt the getting him there we have resolved to fall to work tomorrow morning and begin our writing and there for the present that point rests  this is a little place with fifty houses five bathingmachines five girls in straw hats five men in straw hats and no other company the little houses are all in halfmourningyellow stone on white stone and black and it reminds me of what broadstairs might have been if it had not inherited a cliff and had been an irishman but this is a capital little homely inn looking out upon the sea and we are really very comfortably lodged i can just stand upright in my bedroom otherwise it is a good deal like one of ballards toprooms we have a very obliging and comfortable landlady and it is a clean nice place in a rough wild country we came here haphazard but could not have done better  we lay last night at a place called wigtonalso in halfmourningwith the wonderful peculiarity that it had no population no business no streets to speak of but five linendrapers within range of our small windows one linendrapers next door and five more linendrapers round the corner i ordered a nightlight in my bedroom a queer little old woman brought me one of the common childs nightlights and seeming to think that i looked at it with interest said its joost a vara keeyourious thing sir and joost new coom oop itll burn awt hoors a end an no gootther nor no waste nor ony sike a thing if you can creedit what i say seein the airticle  of course i shall go to doncaster whether or no please god and my postage directions to you remain unchanged love to mamey katey charley harry

received your letter at allonby yesterday and was delighted to get it we came back to carlisle last night to a capital inn kept by breachs brother and came on here today we are on our way to doncaster but sabbath observance throws all the trains out and although it is not a hundred miles from here we shall have as well as i can make out the complicated lists of trains to sleep at leedswhich i particularly detest as an odious placetomorrow night  accustomed as you are to the homage which men delight to render to the inimitable you would be scarcely prepared for the proportions it assumes in this northern country stationmasters assist him to alight from carriages deputations await him in hotel entries innkeepers bow down before him and put him into regal rooms the town goes down to the platform to see him off and collinss ankle goes into the newspapers  it is a great deal better than it was and he can get into new hotels and up the stairs with two thick sticks like an admiral in a farce his spirits have improved in a corresponding degree and he contemplates cheerfully the keeping house at doncaster i thought as i told you he would never have gone there but he seems quite up to the mark now of course he can never walk out or see anything of any place we have done our first paper for h w and sent it up to the printers  the landlady of the little inn at allonby lived at greta bridge in yorkshire when i went down there before nickleby and was smuggled into the room to see me when i was secretly found out she is an immensely fat woman now but i could tuck my arm round her waist then mr dickens the landlord said when she told me the story as i was going to bed the night before last and cant you do it now i said you insensible dog look at me heres a picture accordingly i got round as much of her as i could and this gallant action was the most successful i have ever performed on the whole i think it was the dullest little place i ever entered and what with the monotony of an idle sea and what with the monotony of another sea in the room occasioned by collinss perpetually holding his ankle over a pail of salt water and laving it with a milk jug i struck yesterday and came away  we are in a very remarkable old house here with genuine old rooms and an uncommonly quaint staircase i have a state bedroom with two enormous red fourposters in it each as big as charleys room at gads hill bellew is to preach here tomorrow and we know he is a friend of yours sir said the landlord when he presided over the serving of the dinner two little salmon trout a sirloin steak a brace of partridges seven dishes of sweets five dishes of dessert led off by a bowl of peaches and in the centre an enormous bridecakewe always have it here sir said the landlord custom of the house collins turned pale and estimated the dinner at half a guinea each  this is the stupidest of letters but all description is gone or going into the lazy tour of two idle apprentices  kiss the darling plorn who is often in my thoughts best love to charley mamey and katie i will write to you again from doncaster where i shall be rejoiced to find another letter from you                                 ever affectionately my dearest georgy   sidenote miss hogarth                    angel hotel doncaster tuesday sept 15th 1857  my dear georgy  i found your letter here on my arrival yesterday i had hoped that the wall would have been almost finished by this time and the additions to the house almost finished toobut patience patience  we have very good clean and quiet apartments here on the second floor looking down into the main street which is full of horse jockeys bettors drunkards and other blackguards from morning to nightand all night the races begin today and last till friday which is the cup day i am not going to the course this morning but have engaged a carriage open and pair for tomorrow and friday  the frozen deeps author gets on as well as could be expected he can hobble up and down stairs when absolutely necessary and limps to his bedroom on the same floor he talks of going to the theatre tonight in a cab which will be the first occasion of his going out except to travel since the accident he sends his kind regards and thanks for enquiries and condolence i am perpetually tidying the rooms after him and carrying all sorts of untidy things which belong to him into his bedroom which is a picture of disorder you will please to imagine mine airy and clean little dressingroom attached eight waterjugs i never saw such a supply capital spongebath perfect arrangement and exquisite neatness we breakfast at halfpast eight and fall to work for h w afterwards then i go out andhem look for subjects  the mayor called this morning to do the honours of the town whom it pleased the inimitable to receive with great courtesy and affability he propounded invitation to public déjeûner which it did not please the inimitable to receive and which he graciously rejected  thats all the news everything i can describe by hook or by crook i describe for h w so there is nothing of that sort left for letters  best love to dear mamey and katey and to charley and to harry any number of kisses to the noble plorn                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mr arthur ryland                   gads hill place saturday evening oct

birmingham and midland institute  allow me to assure you with much sincerity that i am highly gratified by having been elected one of the first honorary members of that establishment nothing could have enhanced my interest in so important an undertaking but the compliment is all the more welcome to me on that account  i accept it with a due sense of its worth with many acknowledgments and with all good wishes                          i am ever my dear sir very faithfully yours   sidenote mr edmund yates                       tavistock house monday night nov 16th 1857  my dear yates  i retain the story with pleasure and i need not tell you that you are not mistaken in the last lines of your note  excuse me on that ground if i say a word or two as to what i think i mention it with a view to the future might be better in the paper the opening is excellent but it passes too completely into the irishmans narrative does not light it up with the life about it or the circumstances under which it is delivered and does not carry through it as i think it should with a certain indefinable subtleness the thread with which you begin your weaving i will tell wills to send me the proof and will try to show you what i mean when i shall have gone over it carefully                                                faithfully yours always   sidenote mr frank stone ara                          tavistock house wednesday dec 13th 1857  my dear stone  i find on enquiry that the general theatrical fund has relieved nonmembers in one or two instances but that it is exceedingly unwilling to do so and would certainly not do so again saving on some very strong and exceptional case as its trustee i could not represent to it that i think it ought to sail into those open waters for i very much doubt the justice of such cruising with a reference to the interests of the patient people who support it out of their small earnings                                                    affectionately

through this year charles dickens was constantly moving about from place to place after much and careful consideration he had come to the determination of for the future giving readings for his own benefit and although in the spring of this year he gave one reading of his christmas carol for a charity all the other readings beginning from the 29th april and ever after were for himself in the autumn of this year he made reading tours in england scotland and ireland always accompanied by his friend and secretary mr arthur smith at newcastle charles dickens was joined by his daughters who accompanied him in his scotch tour the letters to his sisterinlaw and to his eldest daughter are all given here and will be given in all future reading tours as they form a complete diary of his life and movements at these times to avoid the constant repetition of the two names the beginning of the letters will be dispensed with in all cases where they follow each other in unbroken succession the mr frederick lehmann mentioned in the letter written from sheffield had married a daughter of mr robert chambers and niece of mrs wills coming to settle in london a short time after this date mr and mrs lehmann became intimately known to charles dickens and his familymore especially to his eldest daughter to whom they have been and are the kindest and truest of friends the pretty little boy mentioned as being under mrs willss care was their eldest son  we give the letter to mr thackeray not because it is one of very great interest but because being the only one we have we are glad to have the two names associated together in this work  the little speech alluded to in this first letter to mr macready was one made by charles dickens at a public dinner which was given in aid of the hospital for sick children in great ormond street he afterwards early in april gave a reading from his christmas carol for this same charity  the christmas number of household words mentioned in a

the other day which i think is a good deal in your way for introduction either into a long or short story dr sutherland and dr monro went over st lukes with me only last friday to show me some distinctly and remarkably developed types of insanity among other patients we passed a deaf and dumb man now afflicted with incurable madness too of whom they said that it was only when his madness began to develop itself in stronglymarked mad actions that it began to be suspected though it had been there no doubt some time this led me to consider suspiciously what employment he had been in and so to ask the question aye says dr sutherland that is the most remarkable thing of all mr dickens he was employed in the transmission of electrictelegraph messages and it is impossible to conceive what delirious despatches that man may have been sending about all over the world  rejoiced to hear such good report of the play                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote mr edmund yates                             tavistock house tuesday feb 2nd 1858  my dear yates  your quotation is as i supposed all wrong the text is not which his owls was organs when mr harris went into an empty dogkennel to spare his sensitive nature the anguish of overhearing mrs harriss exclamations on the occasion of the birth of her first child the princess royal of the harris family he never took his hands away from his ears or came out once till he was showed the baby on encountering that spectacle he was being of a weakly constitution took with fits for this distressing complaint he was medically treated the doctor collared him and laid him on his back upon the airy stonesplease to observe what followsand she was told to ease her mind his owls was organs  that is to say mrs harris lying exhausted on her bed in the first sweet relief of freedom from pain merely covered with the counterpane and not yet put comfortable hears a noise apparently proceeding from the backyard and says in a flushed and hysterical manner what owls are those who is aowling not my ugebond upon which the doctor looking round one of the bottom posts of the bed and taking mrs harriss pulse in a reassuring manner says with much admirable presence of mind howls my dear madamno no no what are we thinking of howls my dear mrs harris ha ha ha organs maam organs organs in the streets mrs harris no howls                                                       yours faithfully   sidenote mr w m thackeray                             tavistock house tuesday feb 2nd 1858  my dear thackeray  the wisdom of parliament in that expensive act of its greatness which constitutes the guild prohibits that corporation from doing anything until it shall have existed in a perfectly useless condition for seven years this clause introduced by some privatebill magnate of official might seemed so ridiculous that nobody could believe it to have this meaning but as i felt clear about it when we were on the very verge of granting an excellent literary annuity i referred the point to counsel and my construction was confirmed without a doubt  it is therefore needless to enquire whether an association in the nature of a provident society could address itself to such a case as you confide to me the prohibition has still two or three years of life in it  but assuming the gentlemans title to be considered as an author as established there is no question that it comes within the scope of the literary fund they would habitually lend money if they did what i consider to be their duty as it is they only give money but they give it in such instances  i have forwarded the envelope to the society of arts with a request that they will present it to prince albert approaching hrh in the siamese manner                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote mr john forster                     tavistock house wednesday night feb 3rd 1858  my dear forster  i beg to report two phenomena  1 an excellent little play in one act by marston at the lyceum title a hard struggle as good as la joie fait peur though not at all like it  2 capital acting in the same play by mr dillon real good acting in imitation of nobody and honestly made out by himself  i went at marstons request last night and cried till i sobbed again i have not seen a word about it from oxenford but it is as wholesome and manly a thing altogether as i have seen for many a day i would have given a hundred pounds to have played mr dillons part  love to mrs forster                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote dr westland marston                           tavistock house wednesday feb 3rd 1858  my dear marston  i most heartily and honestly congratulate you on your charming little piece it moved me more than i could easily tell you if i were to try except la joie fait peur i have seen nothing nearly so good and there is a subtlety in the comfortable presentation of the child who is to become a devoted woman for reubens sake which goes a long way beyond madame de girardin i am at a loss to let you know how much i admired it last night or how heartily i cried over it a touching idea most delicately conceived and wrought out by a true artist and poet in a spirit of noble manly generosity that no one should be able to study without great emotion  it is extremely well acted by all concerned but mr dillons performance is really admirable and deserving of the highest commendation it is good in these days to see an actor taking such pains and expressing such natural and vigorous sentiment there is only one thing i should have liked him to change i am much mistaken if any manleast of all any such manwould crush a letter written by the hand of the woman he loved hold it to his heart unconsciously and look about for it the while he might or he might do any other thing with it that expressed a habit of tenderness and affection in association with the idea of her but he would never crush it under any circumstances he would as soon crush her heart  you will see how closely i went with him by my minding so slight an incident in so fine a performance there is no one who could approach him in it and i am bound to add that he surprised me as much as he pleased me  i think it might be worth while to try the people at the français with the piece they are very good in oneact plays such plays take well there and this seems to me well suited to them if you would like samson or regnier to read the play in english i know them well and would be very glad indeed to tell them that i sent it with your sanction because i had been so much struck by it                                                faithfully yours always

of la joie fait pour it is now acting at the lyceum theatre here with very great success the author is mr westland marston a dramatic writer of reputation who wrote a very wellknown tragedy called the patricians daughter in which macready and miss faucit acted under macreadys management at drury lane some years ago  this little piece is so very powerful on the stage its interest is so simple and natural and the part of reuben is such a very fine one that i cannot help thinking you might make one grand coup with it if with your skilful hand you arranged it for the français i have communicated this idea of mine to the author et làdessus je vous écris i am anxious to know your opinion and shall expect with much interest to receive a little letter from you at your convenience  mrs dickens miss hogarth and all the house send a thousand kind loves and regards to madame regnier and the dear little boys you will bring them to london when you come with all the force of the françaiswill you

by your opinion and discretion  you need not return his letter my friend there is great excitement here this morning in consequence of the failure of the ministry last night to carry the bill they brought in to please your emperor and his troops i for one am extremely glad of their defeat  le vieux p i have no doubt will go staggering down the rue de la paix today with his stick in his hand and his hat on one side predicting the downfall of everything in consequence of this event his handwriting shakes more and more every quarter and i think he mixes a great deal of cognac with his ink he always gives me some astonishing piece of news which is never true or some suspicious public prophecy which is never verified and he always tells me he is dying which he never is  adieu my dear

strife and how little we do in the dream after all only last night in my sleep i was bent upon getting over a perspective of barriers with my hands and feet bound pretty much what we are all about

hogge  after the profoundest cogitation i come reluctantly to the conclusion that i do not know that orphan if you were the lady in want of him i should certainly offer myself but as you are not i

kensington boy in hand as if i had walked i wish to god i had out of a fairy tale but no i do not know that orphan he is crying somewhere by himself at this moment i cant dry his eyes he is being neglected by some ogress of a nurse i cant rescue him  i will make a point of going to the athenæum on monday night and if i had five hundred votes to give mr macdonald should have them all for your sake  i grieve to hear that you have been ill but i hope that the spring when it comes will find you blooming with the rest of the flowers                                                  very

the 2nd of august i am going away on a tour of some four months in england ireland and scotland i shall read during that time not fewer than four or five times a week it will be sharp work but probably a certain musical clinking will come of it which will mitigate the hardship  at this present moment i am on my little kentish freehold not in topboots and not particularly prejudiced that i know of looking on as pretty a view out of my study window as you will find in a long days english ride my little place is a grave red brick house time of george the first i suppose which i have added to and stuck bits upon in all manner of ways so that it is as pleasantly irregular and as violently opposed to all architectural ideas as the most hopeful man could possibly desire it is on the summit

london bridge to get to the railroad when i come down here and i can certify that the offensive smells even in that short whiff have been of a most headandstomachdistending nature nobody knows what is

pleasure and read it with the utmost interest in all its domestic details  we had a most wonderful night at exeter it is to be regretted that we cannot take the place again on our way back it was a prodigious cram and we turned away no end of people but not only that i think they were the finest audience i have ever read to i dont think i ever read in some respects so well and i never beheld anything like the personal affection which they poured out upon me at the end it was really a very remarkable sight and i shall always look back upon it with pleasure  last night here was not so bright there are quarrels of the strangest kind between the plymouth people and the stonehouse people the room is at stonehouse tracy says the wrong room there being a plymouth room in this hotel and he being a plymouthite we had a fair house but not at all a great one all the notabilities come this morning to little dombey for which we have let one hundred and thirty stalls which local admiration of local greatness considers very large for mrs gamp and the boots tonight we have also a very promising let but the races are on and there are two public balls tonight and the yacht squadron are all at cherbourg to boot arthur is of opinion that two sixties will do very well for us i doubt the two sixties myself mais nous verrons  the room is a very handsome one but it is on the top of a windy and muddy hill leading literally to nowhere and it looks except that it is new and mortary as if the subsidence of the waters after the deluge might have left it where it is i have to go right through the company to get to the platform big doors slam and resound when anybody comes in and all the company seem afraid of one another nevertheless they were a sensible audience last night and much impressed and pleased  tracy is in the room wandering about and never finishing a sentence and sends all manner of sealoves to you and the dear girls i send all manner of landloves to you from myself out of my heart of hearts and also to my dear plorn and the boys  arthur sends his kindest love he knows only two characters he is either always corresponding like a secretary of state or he is transformed into a routfurniture dealer of rathbone place and drags forms about with the greatest violence without his coat  i have no time to add another word                           ever dearest

morning there was exceedingly good too you will be glad to hear that at clifton last night a torrent of five hundred shillings bore arthur away pounded him against the wall flowed on to the seats over his body scratched him and damaged his best dress suit all to his unspeakable joy  this is a very short letter but i am going to the burlington arcade desperately resolved to have all those wonderful instruments put into operation on my head with a view to refreshing it  kindest love to georgy and to all                                                 ever your affectionate   sidenote miss dickens

i had in edinburgh they were so wonderfully good and were so much on the alert this morning by nine oclock for another reading that we are going back there at about our bradford time i never saw such people and the local agent would take no money and charge no expenses of his own  this place looks what plorn would call ortily dull local agent predicts however great satisfaction to mr dickens and excellent attendance i have just been to look at the hall where everything was wrong and where i have left arthur making a platform for me out of diningtables  if he comes back in time i am not quite sure but that he is himself going to write to gads hill we talk of coming up from chester in the night tomorrow after the reading and of showing our precious selves at an apparently impossibly early hour in the gads hill breakfastroom on saturday morning  i have not felt the fatigue to any extent worth mentioning though i get every night into the most violent heats we are going to dine at three oclock it wants a quarter now and have not been here two hours so i have seen nothing of clement  tell georgy with my love that i read in the same room in which we acted but at the end opposite to that where our stage was we are not at the inn where the amateur company put up but at the lion where the fair miss mitchell was lodged alone we have the strangest little rooms sittingroom and two bedrooms all together the ceilings of which i can touch with my hand the windows bulge out over the street as if they were little sternwindows in a ship and a door opens out of the sittingroom on to a little open gallery with plants in it where one leans over a queer old rail and looks all downhill and slantwise at the crookedest black and yellow old houses all manner of shapes except straight shapes to get into this room we come through a china closet and the man in laying the cloth has actually knocked down in that repository two geraniums and napoleon bonaparte  i think thats all i have to say except that at the wolverhampton theatre they played oliver twist last night mr toole the artful dodger in consequence of the illustrious author honouring the town with his presence we heard that the device succeeded very well and that they got a good many people  johns spirits have been equable and good since we rejoined him berry has always got something the matter with his digestionseems to me the male gender of maria jolly and ought to take nothing but revalenta arabica bottled ale is not to be got in these parts and arthur is thrown upon draught  my dearest love to

the reading and you will take the will for the deed under these trying circumstances i know  we have had a tremendous night the largest house i have ever had since i first begantwo thousand three hundred people tomorrow afternoon at three i read again  my cold has been oppressive and is not yet gone i have been very hard to sleep too and last night i was all but sleepless this morning i was very dull and seedy but i got a good walk and picked up again it has been blowing all day and i fear we shall have a sick passage over to dublin tomorrow night  tell mamie with my dear love to her and katie that i will write to her from dublinprobably on sunday tell her too that the stories she told me in her letter were not only capital stories in themselves but excellently told too  what arthurs state has been tonighthe john berry and boylett all taking money and going mad togetheryou cannot imagine they turned away hundreds sold all the books rolled on the ground of my room kneedeep in checks and made a perfect pantomime of the whole thing he has kept quite well i am happy to say and sends a hundred loves  in great haste and fatigue                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote miss dickens                    morrisons hotel dublin monday aug 23rd 1858  we had a nasty crossing here we left holyhead at one in the morning and got here at six arthur was incessantly sick the whole way i was not sick at all but was in as healthy a condition otherwise as humanity need be we are in a beautiful hotel our sittingroom is exactly like the drawingroom at the peschiere in all its dimensions i never saw two rooms so exactly resembling one another in their proportions our bedrooms too are excellent and there are baths and all sorts of comforts  the lord lieutenant is away and the place looks to me as if its professional life were away too nevertheless there are numbers of people in the streets somehow i hardly seem to think we are going to do enormously here but i have scarcely any reason for supposing so except that a good many houses are shut up and i know nothing about it for arthur is now gone to the agent and to the room the men came by boat direct from liverpool they had a rough passage were all ill and did not get here till noon yesterday donnybrook fair or what remains of it is going on within two or three miles of dublin they went out there yesterday in a jauntingcar and john described it to us at dinnertime with his eyebrows lifted up and his legs well asunder as johnny brookss fair at which arthur who was drinking bitter ale nearly laughed himself to death berry is always unfortunate and when i asked what had happened to berry on board the steamboat it appeared that an irish gentleman which was drunk and fancied himself the captain wanted to knock berry down  i am surprised by finding this place very much larger than i had supposed it to be its byeparts are bad enough but cleaner too than i had supposed them to be and certainly very much cleaner than the old town of edinburgh the man who drove our jauntingcar yesterday hadnt a piece in his coat as big as a penny roll and had had his hat on apparently without brushing it ever since he was grown up but he was remarkably intelligent and agreeable with something to say about everything for instance when i asked him what a certain building was he didnt say courts of law and nothing else but av you plase sir its the foor coorts o looyers where misther oconnell stood his trial wunst yell remimber sir afore i tell ye of it when we got into the phoenix park he looked round him as if it were his own and said thats a park sir av yer plase i complimented it and he said gintlemen tills me as theyr bin sir over europe and never see a park aqualling ov it tis eight mile roond sir ten mile and a half long and in the month of may the hawthorn trees are as beautiful as brides with their white jewels on yonders the viceregal lodge sir in

should have heard john in my bedroom this morning endeavouring to imitate a bathman who had resented his interference and had said as to the showerbath yerll not be touching that young man divil a touch yerll touch o that insthrument young man it was more ridiculously unlike the reality than i can express to you yet he was so delighted with his powers that he went off in the absurdest little gingerbeery giggle backing into my portmanteau all the time  my dear love to katie and to georgy also to the noble plorn and all the boys i shall write to katie next and then to aunty my cold i am happy to report is very much better i lay in the wet all night on deck on board the boat but am not as yet any the worse for it arthur was quite insensible when we got to dublin and stared at our luggage without in the least offering to claim it he left his kindest love for all before he went out i will keep the envelope open until he comes in                               ever my dearest mamie                                         your most affectionate father   sidenote miss hogarth                 morrisons hotel dublin wednesday aug 25th 1858  i begin my letter to you today though i dont know when i may send it off we had a very good house last night after all that is to say a great rush of shillings and good halfcrowns though the stalls were comparatively few for little dombey this morning we have an immense stall letalready more than two hundredand people are now fighting in the agents shop to take more through some mistake of our printers the evening reading for this present wednesday was dropped in a great part of the announcements and the agent opened no plan for it i have therefore resolved not to have it at all arthur smith has waylaid me in all manner of ways but i remain obdurate i am frightfully tired and really relieved by the prospect of an eveningoverjoyed  they were a highly excitable audience last night but they certainly did not comprehendinternally and intellectually comprehendthe chimes as a london audience do i am quite sure of it i very much doubt the irish capacity of receiving the pathetic but of their quickness as to the humorous there can be no doubt i shall see how they go along with little paul in his death presently  while i was at breakfast this morning a general officer was announced with great statehaving a staff at the doorand came in booted and plumed and covered with crimean decorations it was cunninghame whom we knew in genoathen a captain he was very hearty indeed and came to ask me to dinner of course i couldnt go olliffe has a brother at cork who has just now noon written to me proposing dinners and excursions in that neighbourhood which would fill about a week i being there a day and a half and reading three times the work will be very severe here and i begin to feel depressed by it by here i mean ireland generally please to observe  we meant as i said in a letter to katie to go to queenstown yesterday and bask on the seashore but there is always so much to do that we couldnt manage it after all we expect a tremendous house tomorrow night as well as today and arthur is at the present instant up to his eyes in business and seats and between his regret at losing tonight and his desire to make the room hold twice as many as it will hold is half distracted i have become a wonderful irishmanmust play an irish part some dayand his only relaxation is when i enact john and the boots which i consequently do enact all day long the papers are full of remarks upon my white tie and describe it as being of enormous size which is a wonderful delusion because as you very well know it is a small tie generally i am happy to report the emerald press is in favour of my appearance and likes my eyes but one gentleman comes out with a letter at cork wherein he says that although only fortysix i look like an old man he is a rum customer i think  the rutherfords are living here and wanted me to dine with them which i neednt say could not be done all manner of people have called but i have seen only two john has given it up altogether as to rivalry with the boots and did not come into my room this morning at all boots appeared triumphant and alone he was waiting for me at the hoteldoor last night whaat sart of a hoose sur he asked me capital the lard be praised fur the onor o dooblin  arthur buys bad apples in the streets and brings them home and doesnt eat them and then i am obliged to put them in the balcony because they make the room smell faint also he meets countrymen with honeycomb on their heads and leads them by the buttonhole when they have one to this gorgeous establishment and requests the bar to buy honeycomb for his breakfast then it stands upon the sideboard uncovered and the flies fall into it he buys owls too and castles and other horrible objects made in bogoak that material which is not appreciated at gads hill and he is perpetually snipping pieces out of newspapers and sending them all over the world while i am reading he conducts the correspondence and his great delight is to show me seventeen or eighteen letters when i come exhausted into the retiringplace berry has not got into any particular trouble for fortyeight hours except that he is all over boils i have prescribed the yeast but ineffectually it is indeed a sight to see him and john sitting in payboxes and surveying ireland out of pigeonholes                                         same evening before bedtime  everybody was at little dombey today and although i had some little difficulty to work them up in consequence of the excessive crowding of the place and the difficulty of shaking the people into their seats the effect was unmistakable and profound the crying was universal and they were extraordinarily affected there is no doubt we could stay here a week with that one reading and fill the place every night hundreds of people have been there tonight under the impression that it would come off again it was a most decided and complete success  arthur has been imploring me to stop here on the friday after limerick and read little dombey again but i have positively said no the work is too hard it is not like doing it in one easy room and always the same room with a different place every night and a different audience with its own peculiarity every night it is a tremendous strain i was sick of it today before i began then got myself into wonderful train  here follows a dialogue but it requires imitation which i had yesterday morning with a little boy of the houselandlords son i supposeabout plorns age i am sitting on the sofa writing and find him sitting beside me          inimitable holloa old chap          young ireland halloo

nothing like them snigger hold idiots snigger they bow and walk backwards before the grandees and our men hustle them while they are doing it  we walked out last night with the intention of going to the theatre but the piccolomini establishment they were doing the lucia looked so horribly like a very bad jail and the queens looked so blackguardly that we came back again and went to bed i seem to be always either in a railway carriage or reading or going to bed i get so knocked up whenever i have a minute to remember it that then i go to bed as a matter of course  i send my love to the noble plorn and to all the boys to dear mamie and katie and to yourself of course in the first degree i am looking forward to the last irish reading on thursday with great impatience but when we shall have turned this week once knocked off belfast i shall see land and shall like poor timber in the days of old keep up a good heart i get so wonderfully hot every night in my dress clothes that they positively wont dry in the short interval they get and i have been obliged to write to doudneys to make me another suit that i may have a constant change                           ever my dearest georgy most affectionately   sidenote miss dickens                                   belfast saturday aug 28th 1858  when i went down to the rotunda at dublin on thursday night i said to arthur who came rushing at me you neednt tell me i know all about it the moment i had come out of the door of the hotel a mile off i had come against the stream of people turned away i had struggled against it to the room there the crowd in all the lobbies and passages was so great that i had a difficulty in getting in they had broken all the glass in the payboxes they had offered frantic prices for stalls eleven banknotes were thrust into that paybox arthur saw them at one time for eleven stalls our men were flattened against walls and squeezed against beams ladies stood all night with their chins against my platform other ladies sat all night upon my steps you never saw such a sight and the reading went tremendously it is much to be regretted that we troubled ourselves to go anywhere else in ireland we turned away people enough to make immense houses for a week  we arrived here yesterday at two the room will not hold more than from eighty to ninety pounds the same scene was repeated with the additional feature that the people are much rougher here than in dublin and that there was a very great uproar at the opening of the doors which the police in attendance being quite inefficient and only looking on it was impossible to check arthur was in the deepest misery because shillings got into stalls and halfcrowns got into shillings and stalls got nowhere and there was immense confusion it ceased however the moment i showed myself and all went most brilliantly in spite of a great piece of the cornice of the ceiling falling with a great crash within four or five inches of the head of a young lady on my platform i was obliged to have people there and in spite of my gas suddenly going out at the time of the game of forfeits at scrooges nephews through some belfastian gentleman accidentally treading on the flexible pipe and needing to be relighted  we shall not get to cork before midday on monday it being difficult to get from here on a sunday we hope to be able to start away tomorrow morning to see the giants causeway some sixteen miles off and in that case we shall sleep at dublin tomorrow night leaving here by the train at halfpast three in the afternoon dublin you must understand is on the way to cork this is a fine place surrounded by lofty hills the streets are very wide and the place is very prosperous the whole ride from dublin here is through a very picturesque and various country and the amazing thing is that it is all particularly neat and orderly and that the houses outside at all events are all brightly whitewashed and remarkably clean i want to climb one of the neighbouring hills before this mornings dombey i am now waiting for arthur who has gone to the bank to remit his last accumulation of treasure to london  our men are rather indignant with the irish crowds because in the struggle they dont sell books and because in the pressure they cant force a way into the room afterwards to sell them they are deeply interested in the success however and are as zealous and ardent as possible i shall write to katie next give her my best love and kiss the darling plorn for me and give my love to all the boys                         ever my dearest mamie                                         your most affectionate father   sidenote miss hogarth              morrisons hotel dublin sunday night aug 29th 1858  i am so delighted to find your letter here tonight eleven oclock and so afraid that in the wear and tear of this strange life i have written to gads hill in the wrong order and have not written to you as i should that i resolve to write this before going to bed you will find it a wretchedly stupid letter but you may imagine my dearest girl that i am tired  the success at belfast has been equal to the success here enormous we turned away half the town i think them a better audience on the whole than dublin and the personal affection there was something overwhelming i wish you and the dear girls could have seen the people look at me in the street or heard them ask me as i hurried to the hotel after reading last night to do me the honour to shake hands misther dickens and god bless you sir not ounly for the light youve been to me this night but for the light youve been in mee house sir and god love your face this many a year every night bythebye since i have been in ireland the ladies have beguiled john out of the bouquet from my coat and yesterday morning as i had showered the leaves from my geranium in reading little dombey they mounted the platform after i was gone and picked them all up as keepsakes  i have never seen men go in to cry so undisguisedly as they did at that reading yesterday afternoon they made no attempt whatever to hide it and certainly cried more than the women as to the boots at night and mrs gamp too it was just one roar with me and them for they made me laugh so that sometimes i could not compose my face to go on  you must not let the new idea of poor dear landor efface the former image of the fine old man i wouldnt blot him out in his tender gallantry as he sat upon that bed at forsters that night for a million of wild mistakes at eighty years of age  i hope to be at tavistock house before five oclock next saturday morning and to lie in bed half the day and come home by the 1050 on sunday  tell the girls that arthur and i have each ordered at belfast a trim sparkling slapup irish jauntingcar i flatter myself we shall astonish the kentish people it is the oddest carriage in the world and you are always falling off but it is gay and bright in the highest degree wonderfully neapolitan  what with a sixteen mile ride before we left belfast and a seabeach walk and a two oclock dinner and a seven hours railway ride since i amas we say herea thrifle weary but i really am in wonderful force considering the work for which i am as i ought to be very thankful  arthur was exceedingly unwell last nightcould not cheer up at all he was so very unwell that he left the hall and became invisible after my five minutes rest i found him at the hotel in a jacket and slippers and with a hot bath just ready he was in the last stage of prostration the local agent was with me and proposed that he the wretched arthur should go to his office and balance the accounts then and there he went in the jacket and slippers and came back in twenty minutes perfectly well in consequence of the admirable balance he is now sitting opposite to me on the bag of silver forty pounds it must be dreadfully hard writing to boulogne  i suppose it is clear that the next letter i write is katies either from cork or from limerick it shall report further at limerick i read in the theatre there being no other place  best love to mamie and katie and dear plorn and all the boys left when this comes to gads hill also to my dear good anne and her little woman                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mr w wilkie collins

eightandforty hours i come last and directa pretty hard journey from limerick the success in ireland has been immense  the work is very hard sometimes overpowering but i am none the worse for it and arrived here quite fresh  secondly will you let me recommend the enclosed letter from wigan as the groundwork of a capital article in your way for h w there is not the least objection to a plain reference to him or to phelps to whom the same thing happened a year or two ago near islington in the case of a clever and capital little daughter of his i think it a capital opportunity for a discourse on gentility with a glance at those other schools which advertise that the sons of gentlemen only are admitted and a just recognition of the greater liberality of our public schools there are tradesmens sons at eton and charles kean was at eton and macready also an actors son was at rugby some such title as scholastic flunkeydom or anything infinitely contemptuous would help out the meaning surely such a schoolmaster must swallow all the silver forks that the pupils are expected to take when they come and are not expected to take away with them when they go and of course he could not exist unless he had flunkey customers by the dozen  secondlyno this is thirdly nowabout the christmas number i have arranged so to stop my readings as to be available for it on the 15th of november which will leave me time to write a good article if i clear my way to one do you see your way to our making a christmas number of this idea that i am going very briefly to hint some disappointed person man or woman prematurely disgusted with the world for some reason or no reason the person should be young i think retires to an old lonely house or an old lonely mill or anything you like with one attendant resolved to shut out the world and hold no communion with it the one attendant sees the absurdity of the idea pretends to humour it but really thus to slaughter it everything that happens everybody that comes near every breath of human interest that floats into the old place from the village or the heath or the four crossroads near which it stands and from which belated travellers stray into it shows beyond mistake that you cant shut out the world that you are in it to be of it that you get into a false position the moment you try to sever yourself from it and that you must mingle with it and make the best of it and make the best of yourself into the bargain  if we could plot out a way of doing this together i would not be afraid to take my part if we could not could we plot out a way of doing it and taking in stories by other hands if we could not do either but i think we could shall we fall back upon a round of stories again that i would rather not do if possible will you think about it  and can you come and dine at tavistock house on monday the 20th september at halfpast five i purpose being at home there with the girls that day  answer this according to my printed list for the week i am off to huddersfield on wednesday morning  i think i will now leave off merely adding that i have got a splendid brogue it really is exactly like the people and that i think of coming out as the only legitimate successor of poor power                             ever my dear wilkie affectionately yours   sidenote miss mary boyle                        station hotel york friday sept 10th 1858  dearest meery  first let me tell you that all the magicians and spirits in your employ have fulfilled the instructions of their wondrous mistress to admiration flowers have fallen in my path wherever i have trod and when they rained upon me at cork i was more amazed than you ever saw me  secondly receive my hearty and loving thanks for that same excuse a little irish in the turn of that sentence but i cant help it  thirdly i have written direct to mr boddington explaining that i am bound to be in edinburgh on the day when he courteously proposes to do me honour  i really cannot tell you how truly and tenderly i feel your letter and how gratified i am by its contents your truth and attachment are always so precious to me that i cannot get my heart out on my sleeve to show it you it is like a child and at the sound of some familiar voices goes and hides  you know what an affection i have for mrs watson and how happy it made me to see her againyounger much than when i first knew her in switzerland  god bless you always                                              ever affectionately yours   sidenote miss hogarth                   royal hotel scarborough sunday sept 11th 1858  my dearest georgy  we had a very fine house indeed at york all kinds of applications have been made for another reading there and no doubt it would be exceedingly productive but it cannot be done at harrogate yesterday the queerest place with the strangest people in it leading the oddest lives of dancing newspaper reading and tables dhôte the piety of york obliging us to leave that place for this at six this morning and there being no night train from harrogate we had to engage a special engine we got to bed at one and were up again before five which after yesterdays fatigues leaves me a little worn out at this present  i have no accounts of this place as yet nor have i received any letter here but the post of this morning is not yet delivered i believe we have a charming room overlooking the sea leech is here living within a few doors with the partner of his bosom and his young family i write at ten in the morning having been here two hours and you will readily suppose that i have not seen him  of news i have not the faintest breath i seem to have been doing nothing all my life but riding in railwaycarriages and reading the railway of the morning brought us through castle howard and under the woods of easthorpe and then just below malton abbey where i went to poor smithsons funeral it was a most lovely morning and tired as i was i couldnt sleep for looking out of window  yesterday at harrogate two circumstances occurred which gave arthur great delight firstly he chafed his legs sore with his black bag of silver secondly the landlord asked him as a favour if he could oblige him with a little silver he obliged him directly with some forty pounds worth and i suspect the landlord to have repented of having approached the subject after the reading last night we walked over the moor to the railway three miles leaving our men to follow with the luggage in a light cart they passed us just short of the railway and john was making the night hideous and terrifying the sleeping country by playing the horn in prodigiously horrible and unmusical blasts  my dearest love of course to the dear girls and to the noble plorn apropos of children there was one gentleman at the little dombey yesterday morning who exhibited or rather concealed the profoundest grief after crying a good deal without hiding it he covered his face with both his hands and laid it down on the back of the seat before him and really shook with emotion he was not in mourning but i supposed him to have lost some child in old time there was a remarkably good fellow of thirty or so too who found something so very ludicrous in toots that he could not compose himself at all but laughed until he sat wiping his eyes with his handkerchief and whenever he felt toots coming again he began to laugh and wipe his eyes afresh and when he came he gave a kind of cry as if it were too much for him it was uncommonly droll and made me laugh heartily                              ever dear georgy your most affectionate   sidenote miss dickens                 scarborough arms leeds wednesday sept 15th 1858  my dearest mamie  i have added a pound to the cheque i would recommend your seeing the poor railway man again and giving him ten shillings and telling him to let you see him again in about a week if he be then still unable to lift weights and handle heavy things i would then give him another ten shillings and so on  since i wrote to georgy from scarborough we have had thank god nothing but success the hull people not generally considered excitable even on their own showing were so enthusiastic that we were obliged to promise to go back there for two readings i have positively resolved not to lengthen out the time of my tour so we are now arranging to drop some small places and substitute hull again and york again but you will perhaps have heard this in the main from arthur i know he wrote to you after the reading last night this place i have always doubted knowing that we should come here when it was recovering from the double excitement of the festival and the queen but there is a very large hall let indeed and the prospect of tonight consequently looks bright  arthur told you i suppose that he had his shirtfront and waistcoat torn off last night he was perfectly enraptured in consequence our men got so knocked about that he gave them five shillings apiece on the spot john passed several minutes upside down against a wall with his head amongst the peoples boots he came out of the difficulty in an exceedingly touzled condition and with his face much flushed for all this and their being packed as you may conceive they would be packed they settled down the instant i went in and never wavered in the closest attention for an instant it was a very high room and required a great effort  oddly enough i slept in this house three days last year with wilkie arthur has the bedroom i occupied then and i have one two doors from it and gordon has the one between not only is he still with us but he has talked of going on to manchester going on to london and coming back with us to darlington next tuesday  these streets look like a great circus with the season just finished all sorts of garish triumphal arches were put up for the queen and they have got smoky and have been looked out of countenance by the sun and are blistered and patchy and half up and half down and are hideous to behold spiritless men evidently drunk for some time in the royal honour are slowly removing them and on the whole it is more like the clearing away of the frozen deep at tavistock house than anything within your knowledgewith the exception that we are not in the least sorry as we were then vague ideas are in arthurs head that when we come back to hull we are to come here and are to have the town hall a beautiful building and read to the million i cant say yet that depends i remember that when i was here before i came from rockingham to make a speech i thought them a dull and slow audience i hope i may have been mistaken i never saw better audiences than the yorkshire audiences generally  i am so perpetually at work or asleep that i have not a scrap of news i saw the leech family at scarboro both in my own house that is to say hotel and in theirs they were not at either reading scarboro is gay and pretty and i think gordon had an idea that we were always at some such place  kiss the darling plorn for me and give him my love dear katie too giving her the same i feel sorry that i cannot get down to gads hill this next time but i shall look forward to our being there with georgy after scotland tell the servants that i remember them and hope they will live with us many years                                ever my dearest mamie                                         your most affectionate father   sidenote miss hogarth                     kings head sheffield friday sept 17th 1858  i write you a few lines to tavistock house thinking you may not be sorry to find a note from me there on your arrival from gads hill  halifax was too small for us i never saw such an audience though they were really worth reading to for nothing though i didnt do exactly that it is as horrible a place as i ever saw i think  the run upon the tickets here is so immense that arthur is obliged to get great bills out signifying that no more can be sold it will be by no means easy to get into the place the numbers who have already paid it is the hall we acted in crammed to the roof and the passages we must come back here towards the end of october and are again altering the list and striking out small places  the trains are so strange and unintelligible in this part of the country that we were obliged to leave halifax at eight this morning and breakfast on the roadat huddersfield again where we had an hours wait wills was in attendance on the platform and took me here at sheffield i mean out to frederick lehmanns house to see mrs wills she looked pretty much the same as ever i thought and was taking care of a very pretty little boy the house and grounds are as nice as anything can be in this smoke a heavy thunderstorm is passing over the town and it is raining hard too  this is a stupid letter my dearest georgy but i write in a hurry and in the thunder and lightning and with the crowd of tonight before me                                               ever most affectionately   sidenote miss hogarth                                 station hotel newcastleontyne

in very fresh condition they persisted in going to the room last night though i had arranged for their remaining quiet  we have done a vast deal here i suppose you know that we are going to berwick and that we mean to sleep there and go on to edinburgh on monday morning arriving there before noon if it be as fine tomorrow as it is today the girls will see the coast piece of railway between berwick and edinburgh to great advantage i was anxious that they should because that kind of pleasure is really almost the only one they are likely to have in their present trip  stanfield and roberts are in edinburgh and the scottish royal academy gave them a dinner on wednesday to which i was very pressingly invited but of course my going was impossible i read twice that day  remembering what you do of sunderland you will be surprised that our profit there was very considerable i read in a beautiful new theatre and i thought to myself quite wonderfully such an audience i never beheld for rapidity and enthusiasm the room in which we acted converted into a theatre afterwards was burnt to the ground a year or two ago we found the hotel so bad in our time really good i walked from durham to sunderland and from sunderland to newcastle  dont you think as we shall be at home at eleven in the forenoon this day fortnight that it will be best for you and plornish to come to tavistock house for that sunday and for us all to go down to gads hill next day my best love to the noble plornish if he is quite reconciled to the postponement of his trousers i should like to behold his first appearance in them but if not as he is such a good fellow i think it would be a pity to disappoint and try him  and now my dearest georgy i think i have said all i have to say before i go out for a little air i had a very hard day yesterday and am tired                                            ever your most affectionate   sidenote mr john forster                         tavistock house tavistock square london                                             sunday oct 10th 1858  my dear forster  as to the truth of the readings i cannot tell you what the demonstrations of personal regard and respect are how the densest and most uncomfortablypacked crowd will be hushed in an instant when i show my face how the youth of colleges and the old men of business in the town seem equally unable to get near enough to me when they cheer me away at night how common people and gentlefolks will stop me in the streets and say mr dickens will you let me touch the hand that has filled my home with so many friends and if you saw the mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers in mourning who invariably come to little dombey and if you studied the wonderful expression of comfort and reliance with which they hang about me as if i had been with them all kindness and delicacy at their own little deathbed you would think it one of the strangest things in the world  as to the mere effect of course i dont go on doing the thing so often without carefully observing myself and the people too in every little thing and without in consequence greatly improving in it  at aberdeen we were crammed to the street twice in one day at perth where i thought when i arrived there literally could be nobody to come the nobility came posting in from thirty miles round and the whole town came and filled an immense hall as to the effect if you had seen them after lilian died in the chimes or when scrooge woke and talked to the boy outside the window i doubt if you would ever have forgotten it and at the end of dombey yesterday afternoon in the cold light of day they all got up after a short pause gentle and simple and thundered and waved their hats with that astonishing heartiness and fondness for me that for the first time in all my public career they took me completely off my legs and i saw the whole eighteen hundred of them reel on one side as if a shock from without had shaken the hall  the dear girls have enjoyed themselves immensely and their trip has been a great success i hope i told you but i forget whether i did or no how splendidly newcastle4 came out i am reminded of newcastle at the moment because they joined me there  i am anxious to get to the end of my readings and to be at home again and able to sit down and think in my own study but the fatigue though sometimes very great indeed hardly tells upon me at all and although all our people from smith downwards have given in more or less at times i have never been in the least unequal to the work though sometimes sufficiently disinclined for it my kindest and best love to mrs forster                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote miss dickens                          royal hotel derby friday oct 22nd 1858  my dearest mamie  i am writing in a very poor condition i have a bad cold all over me pains in my back and limbs and a very sensitive and uncomfortable throat there was a great draught up some stone steps near me last night and i daresay that caused it  the weather on my first two nights at birmingham was so intolerably badit blew hard and never left off raining for one single momentthat the houses were not what they otherwise would have been on the last night the weather cleared and we had a grand house  last night at nottingham was almost if not quite the most amazing we have had it is not a very large place and the room is by no means a very large one but three hundred and twenty stalls were let and all the other tickets were sold  here we have two hundred and twenty stalls let for tonight and the other tickets are gone in proportion it is a pretty room but not large  i have just been saying to arthur that if there is not a large let for york i would rather give it up and get monday at gads hill we have telegraphed to know if the answer comes as i suppose it will before post time i will tell you in a postscript what we decide to do coming to london in the night of tomorrow saturday and having to see mr ouvry on sunday and having to start for york early on monday i fear i should not be able to get to gads hill at all you wont expect me till you see me  arthur and i have considered plornishs joke in all the immense number of aspects in which it presents itself to reflective minds we have come to the conclusion that it is the best joke ever made give the dear boy my love and the same to georgy and the same to katey and take the same yourself arthur excessively low and inarticulate mutters that he unites  we knocked up boylett berry and john so frightfully yesterday by tearing the room to pieces and altogether reversing it as late as four oclock that we gave them a supper last night they shine all over today as if it had been entirely composed of grease                            ever my dearest mamie                                         your most affectionate father   sidenote miss hogarth

worst of audiences i found them very good indeed even in the morning  there awaited me at the hotel a letter from the rev mr young wentworth watsons tutor saying that mrs watson wished her boy to shake hands with me and that he would bring him in the evening i expected him at the hotel before the readings but he did not come he spoke to john about it in the room at night the crowd and confusion however were very great and i saw nothing of him in his letter he said that mrs watson was at paris on her way home and would be at brighton at the end of this week i suppose i shall see her there at the end of next week  we find a let of two hundred stalls here which is very large for this place the evening being fine too and blue being to be seen in the sky beyond the smoke we expect to have a very full hall tell mamey and katey that if they had been with us on the railway today between leamington and this place they would have seen though it is only an hour and ten minutes by the express fires and smoke indeed we came through a part of the black country that you know and it looked at its blackest all the furnaces seemed in full blast and all the coalpits to be working  it is marketday here and the ironmasters are standing out in the street where they always hold high change making such an iron hum and buzz that they confuse me horribly in addition there is a bellman announcing somethingnot the readings i beg to sayand there is an excavation being made in the centre of the open place for a statue or a pump or a lamppost or something or other round which all the wolverhampton boys are yelling and struggling  and here is arthur begging to have dinner at halfpast three instead of four because he foresees a wiry evening in store for him under which complication of distractions to which a waitress with a tray at this moment adds herself i sink and leave off  my best love to the dear girls and to the noble plorn and to you marguerite and ellen stone not forgotten all yesterday and today i have been doing everything to the tune of          and the day is dark and dreary                       ever dearest georgy                                   your

my name for his proffered hospitality and further to explain to him that since my readings began i have known them to be incompatible with all social enjoyments and have neither set foot in a friends house nor sat down to a friends table in any one of all the many places i have been to but have rigidly kept myself to my hotels to this resolution i must hold until the last there is not the least virtue in it it is a matter of stern necessity and i submit with the worst grace possible  will you let me know either at southampton or portsmouth whether any of you and how many of you if any are

as expressing what many men have felt and thought otherwise not specially remarkable they have one fatal mistake which is a canker at the foot of their ever being widely useful half the misery and hypocrisy of the christian world arises as i take it from a stubborn determination to refuse the new testament as a sufficient guide in itself and to force the old testament into alliance with itwhereof comes all manner of camelswallowing and of gnatstraining but so to resent this miserable error or to by any implication depreciate the divine goodness and beauty of the new testament is to commit even a worse error and to class jesus christ with mahomet is simply audacity and folly i might as well hoist myself on to a high platform to inform my disciples that the lives of king george the fourth and of king alfred the great belonged to one and the same category                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mr b w procter                             tavistock house sunday dec 18th 1858  my dear procter  a thousand thanks for the little song i am charmed with it and shall be delighted to brighten household words with such a wise and genial light i no more believe that your poetical faculty has gone by than i believe that you have yourself passed to the better land you and it will travel thither in company rely upon it so i still hope to hear more of the tradesongs and to learn that the blacksmith has hammered out no end of iron into good fashion of verse like a cunning workman as i know him of old to be                                 very faithfully yours my dear procter  footnotes  3 niece to the rev w harness  4 the birthplace of mr forster     1859  narrative   during the winter charles dickens was living at tavistock house removing to gads hill for the summer early in june and returning to london in november at this time a change was made in his weekly journal household words became absolutely his ownmr wills being his partner and editor as beforeand was incorporated with all the year round under which title it was known thenceforth the office was still in wellington street but in a different house the first number with the new name appeared on the 30th april and it contained the opening of a tale of two cities  the first letter which follows shows that a proposal for a series of readings in america had already been made to him it was carefully considered and abandoned for the time but the proposal was constantly renewed and the idea never wholly relinquished for many years before he actually decided on making so distant a reading tour  mr procter contributed to the early numbers of all the year round some very spirited songs of the trades we give notes from charles dickens to the veteran poet both in the last year and in this year expressing his strong approval of them  the letter and two notes to mr afterwards sir antonio panizzi for which we are indebted to mr louis fagan one of sir a panizzis executors show the warm sympathy and interest which he always felt for the cause of italian liberty and for the sufferings of the state prisoners who at this time took refuge in england  we give a little note to the dear friend and companion of charles dickenss daughters lotty white because it is a pretty specimen of his writing and because the young girl who is playfully commanded to get well and strong died early in july of this year she was at the time this note was written first attacked with the illness which was fatal to all her sisters mamie and kate dickens went from gads hill to bonchurch to pay a last visit to their friend and he writes to his eldest daughter there also we give notes of loving sympathy and condolence to the bereaved father and mother  in the course of this summer charles dickens was not well and went for a week to his old favourite broadstairswhere mr wilkie collins and his brother mr charles allston collins were stayingfor seaair and change preparatory to another reading tour in england only his letter from peterborough to mr frank stone giving him an account of a reading at manchester mr stones native town was one of the last ever addressed to that affectionate friend who died very suddenly to the great grief of charles dickens in november the letter to mr thomas longman which closes this year was one of introduction to that gentleman of young marcus stone then just beginning his career as an artist and to whom the premature death of his father made it doubly desirable that he should have powerful helping hands  charles dickens refers in a letter to mrs watson to his portrait by mr frith which was finished at the end of 1858 it was painted for mr forster and is now in the forster collection at south kensington museum  the christmas number of this year again written by several hands as well as his own was the haunted house in november his story of a tale of two cities was finished in all the year round and in december was published complete with dedication to lord john russell   sidenote mr arthur smith               tavistock house tavistock square london wc                                          wednesday jan 26th 1859  my dear arthur  will you first read the enclosed letters having previously welcomed with all possible cordiality the bearer mr thomas c evans from new york  you having read them let me explain that mr fields is a highly respectable and influential man one of the heads of the most classical and most respected publishing house in america that mr richard grant white is a man of high reputation and that felton is the greek professor in their cambridge university perhaps the most distinguished scholar in the states  the address to myself referred to in one of the letters being on its way it is quite clear that i must give some decided and definite answer to the american proposal now will you carefully discuss it with mr evans before i enter on it at all then will you dine here with him on sundaywhich i will propose to himand arrange to meet at halfpast four for an hours discussion  the points are these  first i have a very grave question within myself whether i could go to america at all  secondly if i did go i could not possibly go before the autumn  thirdly if i did go how long must i stay  fourthly if the stay were a short one could you go  fifthly what is his project what could i make what occurs to you upon his proposal  i have told him that the business arrangements of the readings have been from the first so entirely in your hands that i enter upon nothing connected with them without previous reference to you                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote m de cerjat                             tavistock house tuesday feb 1st 1859  my dear cerjat  i received your always welcome annual with even more interest than usual this year being in common with my two girls and their aunt much excited and pleased by your account of your daughters engagement apart from the high sense i have of the affectionate confidence with which you tell me what lies so tenderly on your own heart i have followed the little history with a lively sympathy and regard for her i hope with you that it is full of promise and that you will all be happy in it the separation even in the present condition of travel and no man can say how much the discovery of a day may advance it is nothing and so god bless her and all of you and may the rosy summer bring her all the fulness of joy that we all wish her  to pass from the altar to townshend which is a long way let me report him severely treated by bully who rules him with a paw of iron and complaining moreover of indigestion he drives here every sunday but at all other times is mostly shut up in his beautiful house where i occasionally go and dine with him têteàtête and where we always talk of you and drink to you that is a rule with us from which we never depart he is seeing a volume of poems through the press rather an expensive amusement he has not been out at night except to this house save last friday when he went to hear me read the poor traveller mrs gamp and the trial from pickwick he came into my room at st martins hall and i fortified him with weak brandyandwater you will be glad to hear that the said readings are a greater furore than they ever have been and that every night on which they now take placeonce a weekhundreds go away unable to get in though the hall holds thirteen hundred people i dine with  today bythebye along with his agent concerning whom i observe him to be always divided between an unbounded confidence and a little latent suspicion he always tells me that he is a gem of the first water oh yes the best of business men and then says that he did not quite like his conduct respecting that farmtenant and those hayricks  there is a general impression here among the bestinformed that war in italy to begin with is inevitable and will break out before april i know a gentleman at genoa swiss by birth deeply in with the authorities at turin who is already sending children home  in england we are quiet enough there is a world of talk as you know about reform bills but i dont believe there is any general strong feeling on the subject according to my perceptions it is undeniable that the public has fallen into a state of indifference about public affairs mainly referable as i think to the people who administer themand there i mean the people of all partieswhich is a very bad sign of the times the general mind seems weary of debates and honourable members and to have taken laissezaller for its motto  my affairs domestic which i know are not without their interest for you flow peacefully my eldest daughter is a capital housekeeper heads the table gracefully delegates certain appropriate duties to her sister and her aunt and they are all three devotedly attached charley my eldest boy remains in barings house your present correspondent is more popular than he ever has been i rather think that the readings in the country have opened up a new public who were outside before but however that may be his books have a wider range than they ever had and his public welcomes are prodigious said correspondent is at present overwhelmed with proposals to go and read in america will never go unless a small fortune be first paid down in money on this side of the atlantic stated the figure of such payment between ourselves only yesterday expects to hear no more of it and assuredly will never go for less you dont say my dear cerjat when you are coming to england somehow i feel that this marriage ought to bring you over though i dont know why you shall have a bed here and a bed at gads hill and we will go and see strange sights together when i was in ireland i ordered the brightest jauntingcar that ever was seen it has just this minute arrived per steamer from belfast say you are coming and you shall be the first man turned over by it somebody must be for my daughter mary drives anything that can be harnessed and i know of no english horse that would understand a jauntingcar coming down a kentish hill and you shall be that somebody if you will they turned the basketphaeton over last summer in a byeroadmary and the other twoand had to get it up again which they did and came home as if nothing had happened they send their loves to mrs cerjat and to you and to all and particularly to the dear fiancée so do i with all my heart and am ever your attached and affectionate friend   sidenote mr antonio panizzi                      tavistock house monday night march 14th 1859  my dear panizzi  if you should feel no delicacy in mentioning or should see no objection to mentioning to signor poerio or any of the wronged neapolitan gentlemen to whom it is your happiness and honour to be a friend on their arrival in this country an idea that has occurred to me i should regard it as a great kindness in you if you would be my exponent i think you will have no difficulty in believing that i would not on any consideration obtrude my name or projects upon any one of those noble souls if there were any reason of the slightest kind against it and if you see any such reason i pray you instantly to banish my letter from your thoughts  it seems to me probable that some narrative of their ten years suffering will somehow or other sooner or later be by some of them laid before the english people the just interest and indignation alive here will i suppose elicit it false narratives and garbled stories will in any case of a certainty get about if the true history of the matter is to be told i have that sympathy with them and respect for them which would all other considerations apart render it unspeakably gratifying to me to be the means of its diffusion what i desire to lay before them is simply this if for my new successor to household words a narrative of their ten years trial could be written i would take any conceivable pains to have it rendered into english and presented in the sincerest and best way to a very large and comprehensive audience it should be published exactly as you might think best for them and remunerated in any way that you might think generous and right they want no mouthpiece and no introducer but perhaps they might have no objection to be associated with an english writer who is possibly not unknown to them by some general reputation and who certainly would be animated by a strong public and private respect for their honour spirit and unmerited misfortunes this is the whole matter assuming that such a thing is to be done i long for the privilege of helping to do it these gentlemen might consider it an independent means of making money and i should be delighted to pay the money  in my absence from town my friend and subeditor mr wills to whom i had expressed my feeling on the subject has seen i think three of the gentlemen together but as i hear returning home tonight that they are in your good hands and as nobody can be a better judge than you of anything that concerns them i at once decide to write to you and to take no other step whatever forgive me for the trouble i have occasioned you in the reading of this letter and never think of it again if you think that by pursuing it you would cause them an instants uneasiness                                      believe me very faithfully yours   sidenote mr antonio panizzi                           tavistock house tuesday march

serve on the committee                                                always faithfully yours   sidenote mr b w procter                          tavistock house saturday march 19th 1859  my dear procter  i think the songs are simply admirable and i have no doubt of this being a popular feature in all the year round i would not omit the sexton and i would not omit the spinners and weavers and i would omit the hackwriters and i think the alderman but i am not so clear about the chorister the pastoral i a little doubt finding audience for but i am not at all sure yet that my doubt is well founded  had i not better send them all to the printer and let you have proofs kept by you for publishing i shall not have to make up the first number of all the year round until early in april i dont like to send the manuscript back and i never do like to do so when i get anything that i know to be thoroughly soundly and unquestionably good i am hard at work upon my story and expect a magnificent

by all sorts and conditions of men on the bold high road and the house altogether is the great landmark of the whole neighbourhood captain goldsmiths house is up a lane considerably off the high road but he has a garden wall abutting on the road itself  2 the picnic papers were originally sold to colburn for the benefit of the widow of mr macrone of st jamess square publisher deceased two volumes

that volume i didnt know and dont know anything the other two i edited gratuitously as aforesaid and wrote the lamplighters story in it was all done many years ago there was a preface originally

panizzi               all the year round office thursday april 7th 1859  my dear panizzi  if you dont know i think you should know that a number of letters are passing through the postoffice purporting to be addressed to the charitable by italian exiles in london asking for aid to raise a fund for a tribute to londons lord mayor in grateful recognition of the reception of the neapolitan exiles i know this to be the case and have no doubt in my own mind that the whole thing is an imposture and a do the letters are signed gratitudine italiana

undersigned lamb apart from this singular delusion of yours and wholly unaccountable departure from your usual accuracy in all things your satisfaction with the portrait is a great pleasure to me it has received every conceivable pains at friths hands and ought on his account to be good it is a little too much to my thinking as if my nextdoor neighbour were my deadly foe uninsured and i had just received tidings of his house being afire otherwise very good  i cannot tell you how delighted we shall be if you would come to gads hill you should see some charming woods and a rare old castle and you should have such a snug room looking over a kentish prospect with every facility in it for pondering on the beauties of its masters beard do come but you positively must not come and go on the same day  we retreat there on monday and shall be there all the summer  my small boy is perfectly happy at southsea and likes the school very much i had the finest letter two or three days ago from another of my boysfrank jeffreyat hamburg in this wonderful epistle he says dear papa i write to tell you that i have given up all thoughts of being a doctor my conviction that i shall never get over my stammering is the cause all professions are barred against me the only thing i should like to be is a gentleman farmer either at the cape in canada or australia with my passage paid fifteen pounds a horse and a rifle i could go two or three hundred miles up country sow grain buy cattle and in time be very comfortable  considering the consequences of executing the little commission by the next steamer i perceived that the first consequence of the fifteen pounds would be that he would be robbed of itof the horse that it would throw himand of the rifle that it would blow his head off which probabilities i took the liberty of mentioning as being against the scheme with best love from all                    ever believe me my dear mrs watson                                        your

june 11th 1859  my dearest mamie  on saturday night i found very much to my surprise and pleasure the photograph on my table at tavistock house it is not a very pleasant or cheerful presentation of my daughters but it is wonderfully like for all that and in some details remarkably good when i came home here yesterday i tried it in the large townshend stereoscope in which it shows to great advantage it is in the little stereoscope at present on the drawingroom table one of the balustrades of the destroyed old rochester bridge has been very nicely presented to me by the contractor for the works and has been duly stonemasoned and set up on the lawn behind the house i have ordered a sundial for the top of it and it will be a very good object indeed the plorn is highly excited today by reason of an institution which he tells me after questioning george is called the cobb or bodderin holding a festival at the falstaff he is possessed of some vague information that they go to higham church in pursuance of some old usage and attend service there and afterwards march round the village it so far looks probable that they certainly started off at eleven very spare in numbers and came back considerably recruited which looks to me like the difference between going to church and coming to dinner they bore no end of bright banners and broad sashes and had a band with a terrific drum and are now at halfpast two dining at the falstaff partly in the side room on the groundfloor and partly in a tent improvised this morning the drum is hung up to a tree in the falstaff garden and looks like a tropical sort of gourd i have presented the band with five shillings which munificence has been highly appreciated ices dont seem to be provided for the ladies in the galleryi mean the garden they are prowling about there endeavouring to peep in at the beef and mutton through the holes in the tent on the whole in a debased and degraded manner  turk somehow cut his foot in cobham lanes yesterday and linda hers they are both lame and looking at each other fancy mr townshend not intending to go for another three weeks and designing to come down here for a few dayswith henri and bullyon wednesday i wish you could have seen him alone with me on saturday he was so extraordinarily earnest and affectionate on my belongings and affairs in general and not least of all on you and katie that he cried in a most pathetic manner and was so affected that i was obliged to leave him among the flowerpots in the long passage at the end of the diningroom it was a very good piece of truthfulness and sincerity especially in one of his years able to take life so easily  mr and mrs wills are here now but i daresay you know it from your aunt and return to town with me tomorrow morning we are now going on to the castle mrs wills was very droll last night and told me some good stories my dear i wish particularly to impress upon you and dear katie to whom i send my other best love that i hope your stay will not be very long i dont think it very good for either of you though of course i know that lotty will be and must be and should be the first consideration with you both i am very anxious to know how you found her and how you are yourself  best love to dear lotty and mrs white the same to mr white and clara we are always talking about you all

 my dear white  i send my heartiest and most affectionate love to mrs white and you and to clara you know all that i could add you have felt it all let it be unspoken and unwrittenit is expressed within us  do you not think that you could all three come here and stay with us you and mrs white should have your own large room and your own ways and should be among us when you felt disposed and never otherwise i do hope you would find peace here can it not be done  we have talked very much about it among ourselves and the girls are strong upon it think of itdo                                                 ever your affectionate   sidenote mr john forster                          gads hill thursday night aug 25th 1859  my dear forster  heartily glad to get your letter this morning  i cannot easily tell you how much interested i am by what you tell me of our brave and excellent friend the chief baron in connection with that ruffian i followed the case with so much interest and have followed the miserable knaves and asses who have perverted it since with so much indignation that i have often had more than half a mind to write and thank the upright judge who tried him i declare to god that i believe such a service one of the greatest that a man of intellect and courage can render to society of course i saw the beast of a prisoner with my minds eye delivering his cutanddried speech and read in every word of it that no one but the murderer could have delivered or conceived it of course i have been driving the girls out of their wits here by incessantly proclaiming that there needed no medical evidence either way and that the case was plain without it lastly of course though a merciful manbecause a merciful man i mean i would hang any home secretary whig tory radical or otherwise who should step in between that black scoundrel and the gallows i cannot believeand my belief in all wrong as to public matters is enormousthat such a thing will be done  i am reminded of tennyson by thinking that king arthur would have made short work of the amiable  whom the newspapers strangely delight to make a sort of gentleman of how fine the idylls are lord what a blessed thing it is to read a man who can write i thought nothing could be grander than the first poem till i came to the third but when i had read the last it seemed to be absolutely unapproached and unapproachable  to come to myself i have written and begged the all the year round publisher to send you directly four weeks proofs beyond the current number that are in type i hope you will like them nothing but the interest of the subject and the pleasure of striving with the difficulty of the forms of treatment nothing in the mere way of money i mean could also repay the time and trouble of the incessant condensation but i set myself the little task of making a picturesque story rising in every chapter with characters true to nature but whom the story itself should express more than they should express themselves by dialogue i mean in other words that i fancied a story of incident might be written in place of the bestiality that is written under that pretence pounding the characters out in its own mortar and beating their own interests out of them if you could have read the story all at once i hope you wouldnt have stopped halfway  as to coming to your retreat my dear forster think how helpless i am i am not well yet i have an instinctive feeling that nothing but the sea will restore me and i am planning to go and work at ballards at broadstairs from next wednesday to monday i generally go to town on monday afternoon all tuesday i am at the office on wednesday i come back here and go to work again i dont leave off till monday comes round once more i am fighting to get my story done by the first week in october on the 10th of october i am going away to read for a fortnight at ipswich norwich oxford cambridge and a few other places judge what my spare time is just now  i am very much surprised and very sorry to find from the enclosed that elliotson has been ill i never heard a word of it  georgy sends best love to you and to mrs forster so do i so does plorn so does frank the girls are for five days with the whites at ramsgate it is raining intensely hot and stormy eighteen creatures like little tortoises have dashed in at the window and fallen on the paper since i began this paragraph illustration inkblot that was one i am a wretched sort of creature in my way but it is a way that gets on somehow and all ways have the same fingerpost at the head of them and at every turning in them                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote miss dickens and miss katie dickens                         albion broadstairs friday sept 2nd 1859  my dearest mamie and katie  i have been moved here and am now ballard having added to the hotel a house we lived in three years in our old diningroom and sittingroom and our old drawingroom as a bedroom my cold is so bad both in my throat and in my chest that i cant bathe in the sea tom collin dissuaded methought it badbut i get a heavy showerbath at mrs cramptons every morning the baths are still hers and her husbands but they have retired and live in nuckellsare going to give a stainedglass window value three hundred pounds to st peters church tom collin is of opinion that the miss dickenses has growed two fine young womenleastwise asking pardon ladies an evangelical family of most disagreeable girls prowl about here and trip people up with tracts which they put in the paths with stones upon them to keep them from blowing away charles collins and i having seen a bill yesterdayabout a mesmeric young lady who did feats one of which was set forth in the bill in a line by itself as                              the rigid legs  were overpowered with curiosity and resolved to go it came off in the assembly room now more exquisitely desolate than words can describe eighteen shillings was the take behind a screen among the company we heard mysterious gurglings of water before the entertainment began and then a slippery sound which occasioned me to whisper c c who laughed in the most ridiculous manner soap it proved to be the young lady washing herself she must have been wonderfully dirty for she took a world of trouble and didnt come out clean after allin a wretched dirty muslin frock with blue ribbons she was the alleged mesmeriser and a boy who distributed bills the alleged mesmerised it was a most preposterous imposition but more ludicrous than any poor sight i ever saw the boy is clearly out of pantomime and when he pretended to be in the mesmeric state made the company back by going in among them head over heels backwards halfadozen times in a most insupportable way the pianist had struck and the manner in which the lecturer implored some lady to play a polker and the manner in which no lady would and in which the few ladies who were there sat with their hats on and the elastic under their chins as if it were going to blow is never to be forgotten i have been writing all the morning and am going for a walk to

journal and that will be published in a complete volume about the middle of november nobody but forster has yet seen the latter portions of it or will see them until they are published i want you to read it for two reasons firstly because i hope it is the best story i have written secondly because it treats of a very remarkable time in france and i should very much like to know what you think of its being dramatised for a french theatre if you should think it likely to be done i should be glad to take some steps towards having it well done the story is an extraordinary success here and i think the end of it is certain to make a still greater sensation  dont trouble yourself to write to me mon ami until you shall have had time to read the proofs remember they are proofs and private the latter chapters will not be before the public for five or six weeks to come  with kind regards to madame regnier in which my daughters and their aunt unite                                      believe

1859  my dear stone  we had a splendid rush last nightexactly as we supposed with the pressure on the two shillings of whom we turned a crowd away they were a far finer audience than on the previous night i think the finest i have ever read to they took every word of the dombey in quite an amazing manner and after the childs death paused a little and then set up a shout that it did one good to hear mrs gamp then set in with a roar which lasted until i had done i think everybody for the time forgot everything but the matter in hand it was as fine an instance of thorough absorption in a fiction as any of us are likely to see ever again   in an exquisite red mantle accompanied by her sister in another exquisite red mantle and by the deaf lady who leaned a black headdress exactly like an oldfashioned teaurn without the top against the wall was charming he couldnt get at her on account of the pressure he tried to peep at her from the side door but she ha ha ha was unconscious of his presence i read to her and goaded him to madness he is just sane enough to send his kindest regards  this is a place whichexcept the cathedral with the loveliest front i ever sawis like the back door to some other place it is i should hope the deadest and most utterly inert little town in the british dominions the magnates have taken places and the bookseller is of opinion that such is the determination to do honour to mr dickens that the doors must be opened half an hour before the appointed time you will picture to yourself arthurs quiet indignation at this and the manner in which he remarked to me at dinner that he turned away twice peterborough last night  a very pretty roomthough a corn exchangeand a room we should have been glad of at cambridge as it is large bright and cheerful and wonderfully well lighted  the difficulty of getting to bradford from here tomorrow at any time convenient to us turned out to be so great that we are all going in for leeds only threequarters of an hour from bradford tonight after the reading at a quarterpast eleven we are due at leeds a quarter before three  so no more at present from

judgment must go by default i have not a word to plead against dodson and fogg i am without any defence to the action and therefore as law goes ought to win it  seriously the date of your hospitable note disturbs my soul but i have been incessantly writing in kent and reading in all sorts of places and have done nothing in my own personal character these many months and now i come to town and our friend5 is away let me take that defaulting miscreant into council when he comes back                                                       faithfully yours   sidenote monsieur regnier                 tavistock house tavistock square london wc                                          wednesday nov 16th 1859  my dear regnier  i send you ten thousand thanks for your kind and explicit letter what i particularly wished to ascertain from you was whether it is likely the censor would allow such a piece to be played in paris in the case of its being likely then i wished to have the piece as well done as possible and would even have proposed to come to paris to see it rehearsed but i very much doubted whether the general subject would not be objectionable to the government and what you write with so much sagacity and with such care convinces me at once that its representation would be prohibited therefore i altogether abandon and relinquish the idea but i am just as heartily and cordially obliged to you for your interest and friendship as if the book had been turned into a play five hundred times i again thank you ten thousand times and am quite sure that you are right i only hope you will forgive my causing you so much trouble after your hard work  my girls and georgina send their kindest regards to madame regnier and to you my gads hill house i think i omitted to tell you in reply to your enquiry is on the very scene of falstaffs robbery there is a little cabaret at the roadside still called the sir john falstaff and the country in all its general features is at this time what it was in shakespeares i hope you will see the house before long it is really a pretty place and a good residence for an english writer is it not  macready we are all happy to hear from himself is going to leave the dreary tomb in which he lives at sherborne and to remove to cheltenham a large and handsome place about four or five hours railway journey from london where his poor girls will at least see and hear some life madame céleste was with me yesterday wishing to dramatise a tale of two cities for the lyceum after bringing out the christmas pantomime i gave her my permission and the book but i fear that her company troupe is a very poor one  this is all the news i have except which is no news at all that i feel as if i had not seen you for fifty years and that                            i am ever your attached and faithful friend   sidenote mr t longman                             tavistock house monday nov 28th 1859  my dear longman  i am very anxious to present to you with the earnest hope that you will hold him in your remembrance young mr marcus stone son of poor frank stone who died suddenly but a little week ago you know i daresay what a start this young man made in the last exhibition and what a favourable notice his picture attracted he wishes to make an additional opening for himself in the illustration of books he is an admirable draughtsman has a most dexterous hand a charming sense of grace and beauty and a capital power of observation these qualities in him i know well of my own knowledge he is in all things modest punctual and right and i would answer for him if it were needful with my head  if you will put anything in his way you will do it a second time i am certain                                                faithfully yours always  footnotes  5 mr edmund yates     1860  narrative   this winter was the last spent at tavistock house charles dickens had for some time been inclining to the idea of making his home altogether at gads hill giving up his london house and taking a furnished house for the sake of his daughters for a few months of the london season and as his daughter kate was to be married this summer to mr charles collins this intention was confirmed and carried out he made arrangements for the sale of tavistock house to mr davis a jewish gentleman and he gave up possession of it in september up to this time gads hill had been furnished merely as a temporary summer residencepictures library and all best furniture being left in the london house he now set about beautifying and making gads hill thoroughly comfortable and homelike and there was not a year afterwards up to the year of his death that he did not make some addition or improvement to it he also furnished as a private residence a sittingroom and some bedrooms at his office in wellington street to be used when there was no house in london as occasional town quarters by himself his daughter and sisterinlaw  he began in this summer his occasional papers for all the year round which he called the uncommercial traveller and which were continued at intervals in his journal until 1869  in the autumn of this year he began another story to be published weekly in all the year round the letter to mr forster which we give tells him of this beginning and gives him the name of the book the first number of great expectations appeared on the 1st december the christmas number this time was written jointly by himself and mr wilkie collins the scene was laid at clovelly and they made a journey together into devonshire and cornwall for the purpose of this story in november  the letter to sir edward bulwer lytton is unfortunately the only one we have as yet been able to procure the present lord lytton the viceroy of india has kindly endeavoured to help us even during his absence from england but it was found to be impossible without his own assistance to make the necessary search among his fathers papers and he has promised us that on his return he will find and lend to us many letters from charles dickens which are certainly in existence to his distinguished fellowwriter and great friend we hope therefore it may be possible for us at some future time to be able to publish these letters as well as those addressed to the present lord lytton when he was mr robert lytton otherwise owen meredith and frequent contributor to household words and all the year round we have the same hope with regard to letters addressed to sir henry layard at present ambassador at constantinople which of course for the same reason cannot be lent to us at the present time  we give a letter to mr forster on one of his books on the commonwealth the impeachment of the five members which as with other letters which we are glad to publish on the subject of mr forsters own works was not used by himself for obvious reasons  a letter to his daughter mamie who after her sisters marriage paid a visit with her dear friends the white family to scotland where she had a serious illness introduces a recent addition to the family who became an important member of it and one to whom charles dickens was very tenderly attachedher little white pomeranian dog mrs bouncer so called after the celebrated lady of that name in box and cox it is quite necessary to make this formal introduction of the little pet animal who lived to be a very old dog and died in 1874 because future letters to his daughter contain constant references and messages to mrs bouncer which would be quite unintelligible without this explanation boy also referred to in this letter was his daughters horse the little dog and the horse were gifts to mamie dickens from her friends mr and mrs arthur smith and the sister of the latter miss craufurd   sidenote mr w c macready                              tavistock house monday jan 2nd 1860  my dearest macready  a happy new year to you and many happy years i cannot tell you how delighted i was to receive your christmas letter or with what pleasure i have received forsters emphatic accounts of your health and spirits but when was i ever wrong and when did i not tell you that you were an impostor in pretending to grow older as the rest of us do and that you had a secret of your own for reversing the usual process it happened that i read at cheltenham a couple of months ago and that i have rarely seen a place that so attracted my fancy i had never seen it before also i believe the character of its people to have greatly changed for the better all sorts of longvisaged prophets had told me that they were dull stolid slow and i dont know what more that is disagreeable i found them exactly the reverse in all respects and i saw an amount of beauty therewellthat is not to be more specifically mentioned to you young fellows  katie dined with us yesterday looking wonderfully well and singing excelsior with a certain dramatic fire in her whereof i seem to remember having seen sparks afore now etc etc etc          with kindest love from all at home to all with you                        ever my dear macready your most affectionate   sidenote mr w wilkie collins                   tavistock house tavistock square london wc                                      saturday night jan 7th 1860  my dear wilkie  i have read this book with great care and attention there cannot be a doubt that it is a very great advance on all your former writing and most especially in respect of tenderness in character it is excellent mr fairlie as good as the lawyer and the lawyer as good as he mr vesey and miss halcombe in their different ways equally meritorious sir percival also is most skilfully shown though i doubt you see what small points i come to whether any man ever showed uneasiness by hand or foot without being forced by nature to show it in his face too the story is very interesting and the writing of it admirable  i seem to have noticed here and there that the great pains you take express themselves a trifle too much and you know that i always contest your disposition to give an audience credit for nothing which necessarily involves the forcing of points on their attention and which i have always observed them to resent when they find it outas they always will and do but on turning to the book again i find it difficult to take out an instance of this it rather belongs to your habit of thought and manner of going about the work perhaps i express my meaning best when i say that the three people who write the narratives in these proofs have a dissective property in common which is essentially not theirs but yours and that my own effort would be to strike more of what is got that way out of them by collision with one another and by the working of the story  you know what an interest i have felt in your powers from the beginning of our friendship and how very high i rate them i know that this is an admirable book and that it grips the difficulties of the weekly portion and throws them in masterly style no one else could do it half so well i have stopped in every chapter to notice some instance of ingenuity or some happy turn of writing and i am absolutely certain that you never did half so well yourself  so go on and prosper and let me see some more when you have enough for your own satisfaction to show me i think of coming in to back you up if i can get an idea for my series of gossiping papers one of those days please god we may do a story together i have very odd halfformed notions in a mist of something that might be done that way                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mr john forster                11 wellington street north strand london wc                                            wednesday may 2nd 1860  my dear forster  it did not occur to me in reading your most excellent interesting and remarkable book that it could with any reason be called onesided if clarendon had never written his history of the rebellion then i can understand that it might be but just as it would be impossible to answer an advocate who had misstated the merits of a case for his own purpose without in the interests of truth and not of the other side merely restating the merits and showing them in their real form so i cannot see the practicability of telling what you had to tell without in some sort championing the misrepresented side and i think that you dont do that as an advocate but as a judge  the evidence has been suppressed and coloured and the judge goes through it and puts it straight it is not his fault if it all goes one way and tends to one plain conclusion nor is it his fault that it goes the further when it is laid out straight or seems to do so because it was so knotted and twisted up before  i can understand any mans and particularly carlyles having a lingering respect that does not like to be disturbed for those in the best sense of the word loyal gentlemen of the country who went with the king and were so true to him but i dont think carlyle sufficiently considers that the great mass of those gentlemen didnt know the truth that it was a part of their loyalty to believe what they were told on the kings behalf and that it is reasonable to suppose that the king was too artful to make known to them especially after failure what were very acceptable designs to the desperate soldiers of fortune about whitehall and it was to me a curious point of adventitious interest arising out of your book to reflect on the probability of their having been as ignorant of the real scheme in charless head as their descendants and followers down to this time and to think with pity and admiration that they believed the cause to be so much better than it was this is a notion i was anxious to have expressed in our account of the book in these pages for i dont suppose clarendon or any other such man to sit down and tell posterity something that he has not tried on in his own time do you  in the whole narrative i saw nothing anywhere to which i demurred i admired it all went with it all and was proud of my friends having written it all i felt it to be all square and sound and right and to be of enormous importance in these times firstly to the people who like myself are so sick of the shortcomings of representative government as to have no interest in it secondly to the humbugs at westminster who have come downa long long wayfrom those men as you know when the great remonstrance came out i was in the thick of my story and was always busy with it but i am very glad i didnt read it then as i shall read it now to much better purpose all the time i was at work on the two cities i read no books but such as had the air of the time in them  to return for a final word to the five members i thought the marginal references overdone here and there they had a comical look to me for that reason and reminded me of shows and plays where everything is in the bill  lastly i should have written to youas i had a strong inclination to do and ought to have done immediately after reading the bookbut for a weak reason of all things in the world i have lost heart in onei hope no otheri cannot times out of calculation make up my mind to write a letter                            ever my dear forster affectionately yours   sidenote m de cerjat                             tavistock house thursday may 3rd 1860  my dear cerjat  the date of this letter would make me horribly ashamed of myself if i didnt know that you know how difficult letterwriting is to one whose trade it is to write  you asked me on christmas eve about my children my second daughter is going to be married in the course of the summer to charles collins the brother of wilkie collins the novelist the father was one of the most famous painters of english green lanes and coast pieces he was bred an artist is a writer too and does the eye witness in all the year round he is a gentleman accomplished and amiable my eldest daughter has not yet started any conveyance on the road to matrimony that i know of but it is likely enough that she will as she is very agreeable and intelligent they are both very pretty my eldest boy charley has been in barings house for three or four years and is now going to hong kong strongly backed up by barings to buy tea on his own account as a means of forming a connection and seeing more of the practical part of a merchants calling before starting in london for himself his brother frank jeffreys godson i have just recalled from france and germany to come and learn business and qualify himself to join his brother on his return from the celestial empire the next boy sydney smith is designed for the navy and is in training at portsmouth awaiting his nomination he is about three foot high with the biggest eyes ever seen and is known in the portsmouth parts as young dickens who can do everything  another boy is at school in france the youngest of all has a private tutor at home i have forgotten the second in order who is in india he went out as ensign of a nonexistent native regiment got attached to the 42nd highlanders one of the finest regiments in the queens service has remained with them ever since and got made a lieutenant by the chances of the rebellious campaign before he was eighteen miss hogarth always miss hogarth is the guide philosopher and friend of all the party and a very close affection exists between her and the girls i doubt if she will ever marry i dont know whether to be glad of it or sorry for it  i have laid down my pen and taken a long breath after writing this family history i have also considered whether there are any more children and i dont think there are if i should remember two or three others presently i will mention them in a postscript  we think townshend looking a little the worse for the winter and we perceive bully to be decidedly old upon his legs and of a most diabolical turn of mind when they first arrived the weather was very dark and cold and kept them indoors it has since turned very warm and bright but with a dusty and sharp east wind they are still kept indoors by this change and i begin to wonder what change will let them out townshend dines with us every sunday you may be sure that we always talk of you and yours and drink to you heartily  public matters here are thought to be rather improving the deep mistrust of the gentleman in paris being counteracted by the vigorous state of preparation into which the nation is getting you will have observed of course that we establish a new defaulter in respect of some great trust about once a quarter the last one the cashier of a city bank is considered to have distinguished himself greatly a quarter of a million of money being high game  no my friend i have not shouldered my rifle yet but i should do so on more pressing occasion every other man in the row of men i knowif they were all put in a rowis a volunteer though there is a tendency rather to overdo the wearing of the uniform but that is natural enough in the case of the youngest men the turnout is generally very creditable indeed at the ball they had in a perfectly unventilated building their new leather belts and pouches smelt so fearfully that it was as my eldest daughter said like shoemaking in a great prison she consequently distinguished herself by fainting away in the most inaccessible place in the whole structure and being brought out horizontally by a file of volunteers like some slain daughter of albion whom they were carrying into the street to rouse the indignant valour of the populace  lord my dear cerjat when i turn to that page of your letter where you write like an ancient sage in whom the fire has paled into a meekeyed state of coolness and virtue i half laugh and half cry you old you a sort of hermit boh get out  with this comes my love and all our loves to you and mrs cerjat and your daughter i add my special and particular to the sweet singing cousin when shall you and i meet and where must i come to see townshend i begin to think so                   ever my dear cerjat your affectionate and faithful   sidenote sir edward bulwer lytton                                  gads hill tuesday june 5th 1860  my dear bulwer lytton  i am very much interested and gratified by your letter concerning a tale of two cities i do not quite agree with you on two points but that is no deduction from my pleasure  in the first place although the surrender of the feudal privileges on a motion seconded by a nobleman of great rank was the occasion of a sentimental scene i see no reason to doubt but on the contrary many reasons to believe that some of these privileges had been used to the frightful oppression of the peasant quite as near to the time of the revolution as the doctors narrative which you will remember dates long before the terror and surely when the new philosophy was the talk of the salons and the slang of the hour it is not unreasonable or unallowable to suppose a nobleman wedded to the old cruel ideas and representing the time going out as his nephew represents the time coming in as to the condition of the peasant in france generally at that day i take it that if anything be certain on earth it is certain that it was intolerable no ex post facto enquiries and provings by figures will hold water surely against the tremendous testimony of men living at the time  there is a curious book printed at amsterdam written to make out no case whatever and tiresome enough in its literal dictionarylike minuteness scattered up and down the pages of which is full authority for my marquis this is merciers tableau de paris rousseau is the authority for the peasants shutting up his house when he had a bit of meat the taxtaker was the authority for the wretched creatures impoverishment  i am not clear and i never have been clear respecting that canon of fiction which forbids the interposition of accident in such a case as madame defarges death where the accident is inseparable from the passion and emotion of the character where it is strictly consistent with the whole design and arises out of some culminating proceeding on the part of the character which the whole story has led up to it seems to me to become as it were an act of divine justice and when i use miss pross though this is quite another question to bring about that catastrophe i have the positive intention of making that halfcomic intervention a part of the desperate womans failure and of opposing that mean deathinstead of a desperate one in the streets which she wouldnt have mindedto the dignity of cartons wrong or right this was the design and seemed to be in the fitness of things  now as to the reading i am sorry to say that it is out of the question this season i have had an attack of rheumatismquite a stranger to mewhich remains hovering about my left side after having doubled me up in the back and which would disable me from standing for two hours i have given up all dinners and town engagements and come to my little falstaff house here sensible of the necessity of country training all through the summer smith would have proposed any appointment to see you on the subject but he has been dreadfully ill with tic whenever i read in london i will gladly put a night aside for your purpose and we will plot to connect your name with it and give it some speciality but this could not be before christmas time as i should not be able to read sooner for in the hot weather it would be useless let me hear from you about this when you have considered it it would greatly diminish the expenses remember                                     ever

kind and cordial letter lying on my table i heartily thank you for it and highly esteem it i understand that the article on the spirits to which you refer was written by  he played an irish porter in

coffee house over the way in york street have an earthy and as i may say a landlubberly aspect cape horn to the best of my belief is a tremendous way off and there are more bricks and cabbageleaves between this office and that dismal point of land than you can possibly imagine  coming here from the station this morning i met coming from the execution of the wentworth murderer such a tide of ruffians as never could have flowed from any point but the gallows without any figure of speech it turned one white and sick to behold them  tavistock house is cleared today and possession delivered up i must say that in all things the purchaser has behaved thoroughly well and that i cannot call to mind any occasion when i have had money dealings with a christian that have been so satisfactory considerate and trusting  i am ornamented at present with one of my most intensely preposterous and utterly indescribable colds if you were to make a voyage from cape horn to wellington street you would scarcely recognise in the bowed form weeping eyes rasped nose and snivelling wretch whom you would encounter here the once gay and sparkling etc etc  everything else here is as quiet as possible

genie when he got out of the casket on the seashore and as it was an exquisite day when i began and rained very heavily when i finished i suspect my correspondence of having overcast the face of the heavens                                                        ever faithfully  pskind regard to mr and mrs novelli6  i have just sent out for the globe no news  hullahs daughter an artist tells me

lose no time in answering your letter and first as to business the school in the high town at boulogne was excellent the boys all english the two proprietors an old eton master and one of the protestant clergymen of the town the teaching unusually sound and good the manner and conduct developed in the boys quite admirable but i have never seen a gentleman so perfectly acquainted with boynature as the eton master there was a perfect understanding between him and his charges nothing pedantic on his part nothing slavish on their parts the result was that either with him or away from him the boys combined an ease and frankness with a modesty and sense of responsibility that was really above all praise alfred went from there to a great school at wimbledon where they train for india and the artillery and engineers sydney went from there to mr barrow at southsea in both instances the new masters wrote to me of their own accord bearing quite unsolicited testimony to the merits of the old and expressing their high recognition of what they had done these things speak for themselves  sydney has just passed his examination as a naval cadet and come home all eyes and gold buttons he has twelve days leave before going on board the trainingship katie and her husband are in france and seem likely to remain there for an indefinite period mary is on a months visit in scotland georgina frank and plorn are at home here and we all want mary and her little dog back again i have sold tavistock house am making this rather complete in its way and am on the restless eve of beginning a new big book but mean to have a furnished house in town in some accessible quarter from february or so to june may we meet there  your handwriting is always so full of pleasant memories to me that when i took it out of the postoffice at rochester this afternoon it quite stirred my heart but we must not think of old times as sad times or regard them as anything but the fathers and mothers of the present we must all climb steadily up the mountain after the talking bird the singing tree and the yellow water and must all bear in mind that the previous climbers who were scared into looking back got turned into black stone  mary boyle was here a little while ago as affectionate at heart as ever as young and as pleasant of course we talked often of you so let me know when you are established in halfmoon street and i shall be truly delighted to come and see you  for my attachments are strong attachments and never weaken in right of bygones i feel as if all northamptonshire belonged to me as all northumberland did to lord bateman in the ballad in memory of your warming your feet at the fire in that waste of a waitingroom when i read at brighton i have ever since taken that wateringplace to my bosom as i never did before and you and switzerland are always one to me and always inseparable  charley was heard of yesterday from shanghai going to japan intending to meet his brother walter at calcutta and having an idea of beguiling the time between whiles by asking to be taken as an amateur with the english chinese forces everybody caressed him and asked him everywhere and he seemed to go with kind regards my dear mrs watson                                              ever affectionately yours   sidenote mr edmund yates                      gads hill

bereavement because i knew that the girls had written to you and because i instinctively shrunk from making a form of what was so real you knew what a loving and faithful remembrance i always had of your mother as a part of my youthno more capable of restoration than my youth itself all the womanly goodness grace and beauty of my drama went out with her to the last i never could hear her voice without emotion i think of her as of a beautiful part of my own youth and this dream that we are all dreaming seems to darken  but it is not to say this that i write now it comes to the point of my pen in spite of me  holding up the mirror is in next weeks number i have taken out all this funeral part of it not because i disliked it for indeed i thought it the best part of the paper but because it rather grated on me going over the proof at that time as a remembrance that would be better reserved a little while also because it made rather a mixture of yourself as an individual with something that does not belong or attach to you as an individual you can have the ms and as a part of a paper describing your own juvenile remembrances of a theatre there it is needing no change or adaption

sunday sept 23rd 1860  my dearest mamie  if you had been away from us and ill with anybody in the world but our dear mrs white i should have been in a state of the greatest anxiety and uneasiness about you but as i know it to be impossible that you could be in kinder or better hands i was not in the least restless about you otherwise than as it grieved me to hear of my poor dear girls suffering such pain i hope it is over now for many a long day and that you will come back to us a thousand times better in health than you left us  dont come back too soon take time and get well restored there is no hurry the house is not near torights yet and though we all want you and though boy wants you we all including boy deprecate a fatiguing journey being taken too soon  as to the carpenters they are absolutely maddening they are always at work yet never seem to do anything lillie was down on friday and said his eye fixed on maidstone and rubbing his hand to conciliate his moody employer that he didnt think there would be very much left to do after saturday the 29th  i didnt throw him out of the window your aunt tells you all the news and leaves me no chance of distinguishing myself i know you have been told all about my brackets in the drawingroom all about the glass rescued from the famous stagewreck of tavistock house all about everything here and at the office the office is really a success as comfortable cheerful and private as anything of the kind can possibly be  i took the admiral but this you know too no doubt to dollonds the mathematical instrument makers last monday to buy that part of his outfit his sextant which is about the size and shape of a cocked hat on being applied to his eye entirely concealed him not the faintest vestige of the distinguished officer behind it was perceptible to the human vision all through the city people turned round and stared at him with the sort of pleasure people take in a little model we went on to chatham this day week in search of some big manofwarsman who should be under obligation to salute himunfortunately found none but this no doubt you know too and all my news falls flat  i am driven out of my room by paint and am writing in the best spare room the whole prospect is excessively wet it does not rain now but yesterday it did tremendously and it rained very heavily in the night we are even muddy and that is saying a great deal in this dry country of chalk and sand everywhere the corn is lying out and saturated with wet the hops nearly everywhere look as if they had been burnt  in my minds eye i behold mrs bouncer still with some traces of her late anxiety on her faithful countenance balancing herself a little unequally on her bow forelegs pricking up her ears with her head on one side and slightly opening her intellectual nostrils i send my loving and respectful duty to her  to dear mrs white and to white and to clara say anything from me that is loving and grateful

himself to me who had his cadet son with him a friend of sydneys we went down together and the boys were in the closest alliance bromley being accountantgeneral of the navy and having influence on board got their hammocks changed so that they would be serving side by side at which they were greatly pleased the moment we stepped on board the hullo heres dickens was repeated on all sides and the admiral evidently highly popular shook hands with about fifty of his messmates taking bromley for my model with whom i fraternised in the most pathetic manner i gave sydney a sovereign before stepping over the side he was as little overcome as it was possible for a boy to be and stood waving the goldbanded cap as we came ashore in a boat  there is no denying that he looks very small aboard a great ship and that a boy must have a strong and decided speciality for the sea to take to such a life captain harris was not on board but the other chief officers were and were highly obliging we went over the ship i should say that there can be little or no individuality of address to any particular boy but that they all tumble through their education in a crowded way the admirals servant i mean our admirals had an idiotic appearance but perhaps it did him injustice a mahoganyfaced marine by station the admirals washing apparatus is about the size of a muffinplate and he could easily live in his chest the meeting with bromley was a piece of great good fortune and the dear old chap could not have been left more happily                        ever my dearest georgy your most affectionate

and think the translations admirablespirited fresh bold and evidently faithful i will get the paper into the next number i make up no 78 i will send a proof to you for your correction either next monday or this day week or would you like to come here next monday and dine with us at five and go over to madame célestes opening then you could correct your paper on the premises as they drink their beer at the beershops  some of the introductory remarks on french literature i propose to strike out as a little too essayical for this purpose and likely to throw out a large portion of the large

              thursday oct 4th 1860  my dear forster  it would be a great pleasure to me to come to you an immense pleasure and to sniff the sea i love from the shore but i fear i must come down one morning and come back at night i will tell you why  last week i got to work on a new story i called a council of war at the office on tuesday it was perfectly clear that the one thing to be done was for me to strike in i have therefore decided to begin a story the length of the tale of two cities on the 1st of decemberbegin publishing that is i must make the most i can out of the book when i come down i will bring you the first two or three weekly parts the name is great expectations i think a good name  now the preparations to get ahead combined with the absolute necessity of my giving a good deal of time to the christmas number will tie me to the grindstone pretty tightly it will be just as much as i can hope to do therefore what i had hoped would be a few days at eastbourne diminish to a few hours  i took the admiral down to portsmouth every maritime person in the town knew him he seemed to know every boy on board the britannia and was a tremendous favourite evidently it was very characteristic of him that they goodnaturedly helped him he being so very small into his hammock at night but he couldnt rest in it on these terms and got out again to learn the right way of getting in independently official report stated that after a few spills he succeeded perfectly and went to sleep he is perfectly happy on board takes tea with the captain leads choruses on saturday nights and has an immense marine for a servant  i saw edmund yates at the office and he told me that during all his mothers wanderings of mind which were almost incessant at last she never once went back to the old adelphi days until she was just dying when he heard her say in great perplexity i can not get the words  best love to mrs forster                                  ever my dear forster

been down to brighton to see forster and found your letter there on arriving by express this morning i also found a letter from georgina describing that marys horse went down suddenly on a stone and how mary was thrown and had her ridinghabit torn to pieces and has a deep cut just above the kneefortunately not in the knee itself which is doing exceedingly well but which will probably incapacitate her from walking for days and days to come it is well it was no worse the accident occurred at milton near gravesend and they found mary in a publichouse there wonderfully taken care of and looked after  i propose that we start on thursday morning the 1st of november the train for penzance leaves the great western terminus at a quarterpast nine in the morning it is a twelve hours journey shall we meet at the terminus at nine i shall be here all the previous day and shall dine here  your account of your passage goes to my heart through my stomach what a pity i was not there on board to present that greenvisaged but sweettempered and uncomplaining spectacle of imbecility at which i am so expert under stormy circumstances in the poets phrase          as i sweep         through the deep         when the stormy winds do blow  what a pity i am not there at meurices to sleep the sleep of infancy through the long plays where the gentlemen stand with their backs to the mantelpieces what a pity i am not with you to make a third at the trois frères and drink no end of bottles of bordeaux without ever getting a touch of redness in my poets phrase again innocent nose but i must go down to gads tonight and get to work again four weekly numbers have been ground off the wheel and at least another must be turned before we meet they shall be yours in the slumberous railwaycarriage  i dont think forster is at all in good health he was tremendously hospitable and hearty i walked six hours and a half on the downs yesterday and never stopped or sat early in the morning before breakfast i went to the nearest baths to get a showerbath they kept me waiting longer than i thought reasonable and seeing a man in a cap in the passage i went to him and said i really must request that youll be good enough to see about this showerbath and it was hullah waiting for another bath  rumours were brought into the house on saturday night that there was a ghost up at larkinss monument plorn was frightened to death and i was apprehensive of the ghosts spreading and coming there and causing warning and desertion among the servants frank was at home and andrew gordon was with us time nine oclock village talk and credulity amazing i armed the two boys with a short stick apiece and shouldered my doublebarrelled gun well loaded with shot now observe says i to the domestics if anybody is playing tricks and has got a head ill blow it off immense impression new groom evidently convinced that he has entered the service of a bloodthirsty demon we ascend to the monument stop at the gate moon is rising heavy shadows now look out from the bloodthirsty demon in a loud distinct voice if the ghost is here and i see him so help me god ill fire at him suddenly as we enter the field a most

damnable we advance towards the sound something white comes lumbering through the darkness an asthmatic sheep dead as i judge by this time leaving frank to guard him i took andrew with me and went all round the monument and down into the ditch and examined the field well thinking it likely that somebody might be taking advantage of the sheep to frighten the village drama ends with discovery of no one and triumphant return to rumandwater                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote miss hogarth                bideford north devon thursday night nov 1st 1860

good and warmhearted it looked when i opened it at gads hill besides which it is a cigarcase and will hold cigars two crowning merits that i never yet knew to be possessed by any article claiming the same name for all of these reasons but more than all because it comes from you i love it and send you eighteen hundred and sixty kisses with one in for the new year  both excellent stories and perfectly new your joe swears that he never heard eithernever a word or syllable of eitherafter he laughed at em this blessed day  i have no news except that i am not quite well and am being doctored pray read great expectations i think it is very droll it is a very great success and seems universally liked i suppose because it opens funnily and with an interest too  i pass my time here i am staying here alone in working taking physic and taking a stall at a theatre every night on boxing night i was at covent garden a dull pantomime was worked as we say better than i ever saw a heavy piece worked on a first night until suddenly and without a moments warning every scene on that immense stage fell over on its face and disclosed chaos by gaslight behind there never was such a business about sixty people who were on the stage being extinguished in the most remarkable manner not a soul was hurt in the uproar some mooncalf rescued a porter pot six feet high out of which the clown had been drinking when the accident happened and stood it on the cushion of the lowest proscenium box ps beside a lady and gentleman who were dreadfully ashamed of it the moment the house knew that nobody was injured they directed their whole attention to this gigantic porter pot in its genteel position the lady and gentleman trying to hide behind it and roared with laughter when a modest footman came from behind the curtain to clear it and took it up in his arms like a brobdingnagian baby we all laughed more than ever we had laughed in our lives i dont know why  we have had a fire here but our people put it out before the parishengine arrived like a drivelling perambulator with the beadle in it like an imbecile baby popular opinion disappointed in the fire having been put out snowballed the beadle god bless it  over the way at the lyceum there is a very fair christmas piece with one or two uncommonly welldone nigger songsone remarkably gay and mad done in the finale to a

coming cut round drury lane to face me and come up towards me near this door in the freshest and most accidental way as if i was the last person he expected to see on the surface of this globe the other day there thus appeared before me simultaneously with a scent of rum in the air one aged and greasy man with a pair of pumps under his arm he said he thought if he could get down to somewhere i

aberystwith     narrative  1861   this as far as his movements were concerned was again a very unsettled year with charles dickens he hired a furnished house in the regents park which he with his household occupied for some months during the season he gave several readings at st jamess hall after a short summer holiday at gads hill he started in the autumn on a reading tour in the english provinces mr arthur smith being seriously ill could not accompany him in this tour and mr headland who was formerly in office at the st martins hall was engaged as businessmanager of these readings mr arthur smith died in october and charles dickenss distress at the loss of this loved friend and companion is touchingly expressed in many of his letters of this year  there are also sorrowful allusions to the death of his brotherinlaw mr henry austin which sad event likewise happened in october and the letter we give to mrs austin letitia has reference to her sad affliction  in june of this year he paid a short visit to sir e b lytton at knebworth accompanied by his daughter and sisterinlaw who also during his autumn tour joined him in edinburgh but this course of readings was brought rather suddenly to an end on account of the death of the prince consort  besides being constantly occupied with the business of these readings charles dickens was still at work on his story of great expectations which was appearing weekly in all the year round the story closed on the 3rd of august when it was published as a whole in three volumes and inscribed to mr chauncey hare townshend the christmas number of all the year round was called tom tiddlers ground to which charles dickens contributed three stories  our second letter in this year is given more as a specimen of the claims which were constantly being made upon charles dickenss time and patience than because we consider the letter itself to contain much public interest excepting indeed as showing his always considerate and courteous replies to such constant applications  the fire mentioned in the letter to mr forster was the great fire in tooley street the morgan was an american seacaptain well known in those days and greatly liked and respected it may interest our readers to know that the character of captain jorgan in the christmas number of the previous year was suggested by this pleasant sailor for whom charles dickens had a hearty liking young mr morgan was during the years he passed in england a constant visitor at gads hill the elwin mentioned in the letter written from bury st edmunds was the rev whitwell elwin a norfolk gentleman well known in the literary world and who was for many years editor of the quarterly review  the explanation of the letter to mr john agate of dover we give in that gentlemans own words  there are few public men with the strain upon their time and energies which he had particularly and which i know better now that i have read his life who would have spared the time to have written such a long courteous letter  i wrote to him rather in anger and left the letter myself at the lord warden as i and my family were very much disappointed after having purchased

letter as yours in its plain and true light when you suppose it would have cost mr thackeray but a word to use his influence to obtain you some curatorship or the like you fill me with the sense of impossibility of leading you to a more charitable judgment of mr dickens  nevertheless i will put the truth before you scarcely a day of my life passes or has passed for many years without bringing me some letters similar to yours often they will come by dozensscoreshundreds my time and attention would be pretty well occupied without them and the claims upon me some very near home for all the influence and means of help that i do and do not possess are not commonly heavy i have no power to aid you towards the attainment of your object it is the simple exact truth and nothing can alter it so great is the disquietude i constantly undergo from having to write to some new correspondent in this strain that god knows i would resort to another relief if i could  your studies from nature appear to me to express an excellent observation of nature in a loving and healthy spirit but what then the dealers and dealers prices of which you complain will not be influenced by that honest opinion nor will it have the least effect upon the president of the royal academy or the directors of the school of design assuming your supposition to be correct that these authorities are adverse to you i have no more power than you have to render them favourable and assuming them to be quite disinterested and dispassionate towards you i have no voice or weight in any appointment that any of them make  i will retain your packet over tomorrow and will then cause it to be sent to your house i write under the pressure of occupation and business and therefore write briefly

frost at gads hill it was so intensely cold that in our warm diningroom on christmas day we could hardly sit at the table in my study on that morning long after a great fire of coal and wood had been lighted the thermometer was i dont know where below freezing the bath froze and all the pipes froze and remained in a stony state for five or six weeks the water in the bedroomjugs froze and blew up the crockery the snow on the top of the house froze and was imperfectly removed with axes my beard froze as i walked about and i couldnt detach my cravat and coat from it until i was thawed at the fire my boys and half the officers stationed at chatham skated away without a check to gravesendfive miles offand repeated the performance for three or four weeks at last the thaw came and then everything split blew up dripped poured perspired and got spoilt since then we have had a small visitation of the plague of servants the cook in a ridinghabit and the groom in a dresscoat and jewels having mounted marys horse and mine in our absence and scoured the neighbouring country at a rattling pace and when i went home last saturday i innocently wondered how the horses came to be out of condition and gravely consulted the said groom on the subject who gave it as his opinion which they wanted reglar work we are now coming to town until midsummer having sold my own house to be more free and independent i have taken a very pretty furnished house no 3 hanover terrace regents park this of course on my daughters account for i have very good and cheerful bachelor rooms here with an old servant in charge who is the cleverest man of his kind in the world and can do anything from excellent carpentery to excellent cookery and has been with me threeandtwenty years  the american business is the greatest english sensation at present i venture to predict that the struggle of violence will be a very short one and will be soon succeeded by some new compact between the northern and southern states meantime the lancashire millowners are getting very uneasy  the italian state of things is not regarded as looking very cheerful what from ones natural sympathies with a people so oppressed as the italians and ones natural antagonism to a pope and a bourbon both of which superstitions i do suppose the world to have had more than enough of i agree with you concerning victor emmanuel and greatly fear that the southern italians are much degraded still an united italy would be of vast importance to the peace of the world and would be a rock in louis napoleons way as he very well knows therefore the idea must be championed however much against hope  my eldest boy just home from china was descried by townshends henri the moment he landed at marseilles and was by him borne in triumph to townshends rooms the weather was snowy slushy beastly and marseilles was as it usually is to my thinking wellnigh intolerable my boy could not stay with townshend as he was coming on by express train but he says i sat with him and saw him dine he had a leg of lamb and a tremendous cold that is the whole description i have been able to extract from him  this journal is doing gloriously and great expectations is a great success i have taken my third boy frank jeffreys godson into this office if i am not mistaken he has a natural literary taste and capacity and may do very well with a chance so congenial to his mind and being also entered at the bar  dear me when i have to show you about london and we dine en garçon at odd places i shall scarcely know where to begin only yesterday i walked out from here in the afternoon and thought i would go down by the houses of parliament when i got there the day was so beautifully bright and warm that i thought i would walk on by millbank to see the river i walked straight on for three miles on a splendid broad esplanade overhanging the thames with immense factories railway works and whatnot erected on it and with the strangest beginnings and ends of wealthy streets pushing themselves into the very thames when i was a rower on that river it was all broken ground and ditch with here and there a publichouse or two an old mill and a tall chimney i had never seen it in any state of transition though i suppose myself to know this rather large city as well as anyone in it

sentiments on this head with modesty but i think there is scarcely a doubt of my seeing you then  i have just finished my book of great expectations and am the worse for wear neuralgic pains in the face have troubled me a good deal and the work has been pretty close but i hope that the book is a good book and i have no doubt of very soon throwing off the little damage it has done me  what with blondin at the crystal palace and léotard at leicester square we seem to be going back to barbaric excitements i have not seen and dont intend to see the hero of niagara as the posters call him but i have been beguiled into seeing léotard and it is at once the most fearful and most graceful thing i have ever seen done  clara white grown pretty has been staying with us  i am sore afraid that the times by playing fast and loose with the american question has very seriously compromised this country the americans northward are perfectly furious on the subject and motley the historian a very sensible man strongly english in his sympathies assured me the other day that he thought the harm done very serious indeed and the dangerous nature of the daily widening breach scarcely calculable

return to joes and finding his little likeness there  bulwer who has been as i think i told you extraordinarily taken by the book so strongly urged it upon me after reading the proofs and supported his views with such good reasons that i resolved to make the change you shall have it when you come back to town i have put in a very pretty piece of writing and i have no doubt the story will be more acceptable through the alteration  i have not seen bulwers changed story i brought back the first month with me and i know the nature of his changes throughout but i have not yet had the revised proofs he was in a better state at knebworth than i have ever seen him in all these years a little weird occasionally regarding magic and spirits but perfectly fair and frank under opposition he was talkative anecdotical and droll looked young and well laughed heartily and enjoyed some games we played with great zest in his artist character and talk he was full of interest and matter but that he always is socially he seemed to me almost a new man i thoroughly enjoyed myself and so did georgina and mary  the fire i did not see until the monday morning but it was blazing fiercely then and was blazing hardly less furiously when i came down here again last friday i was here on the night of its breaking out if i had been in london i should have been on the scene pretty surely  you will be perhaps surprised to hear that it is morgans conviction his son was here yesterday that the north will put down the south and that speedily in his management of his large business he is proceeding steadily on that conviction he says that the south has no money and no credit and that it is impossible for it to make a successful stand he may be all wrong but he is certainly a very shrewd man and he has never been as to the united states an enthusiast of any class  poor lord campbells seems to me as easy and good a death as one could desire there must be a sweep of these men very soon and one feels as if it must fall out like the breaking of an archone stone goes from a prominent place and then the rest begin to drop so one looks towards brougham and lyndhurst and pollock  i will add no more to this or i know i shall not send it for i am in the first desperate laziness of having done my book and think of offering myself to the village school as a live example of that vice for the

the handwriting of your old friend will undeceive you if you have and will put that right  during the progress of my last story i have been working so hard that very very little correspondenceexcept enforced correspondence on businesshas passed this pen and now that i am free again i devote a few of my first leisure moments to this note  you seemed in your last to think that i had forgotten you in respect of the christmas number not so at all i discussed with them here where you were how you were to be addressed and the like finally left the number in a blank envelope and did not add the address to it until it would have been absurd to send you such stale bread this was my fault but this was all and i should be so pained at heart if you supposed me capable of failing in my truth and cordiality or in the warm remembrance of the time we have passed together that perhaps i make more of it than you meant to do  my sailorboy is at homei was going to write for the holidays but i suppose i must substitute on leave under the new regulations he must not pass out of the britannia before december the younger boys are all at school and coming home this week for the holidays mary keeps house of course and katie and her husband surprised us yesterday and are here now charley is holidaymaking at guernsey and jersey he has been for some time seeking a partnership in business and has not yet found one the matter is in the hands of mr bates the managing partner in barings house and seems as slow a matter to adjust itself as ever i looked on at georgina is as usual the general friend and confidante and factotum of the whole party  your present correspondent read at st jamess hall in the beginning of the season to perfectly astounding audiences but finding that fatigue and excitement very difficult to manage in conjunction with a story deemed it prudent to leave off reading in high tide and midcareer the rather by reason of something like neuralgia in the face at the end of october i begin again and if you are at brighton in november i shall try to see you there i deliver myself up to mr arthur smith and i know it is one of the places for which he has put me down  this is all about me and mine and next i want to know why you never come to gads hill and whether you are never coming the stress i lay on these questions you will infer from the size of the following

every english shire incessantly and getting in a harvest of laurels all the year round cavendish i have not seen for a long time but when i did see him last it was at tavistock house and we dined together jovially mention of that locality reminds me that when you do come here you will see the pictures looking wonderfully better and more precious than they ever did in town brought together in country light and air they really are quite a baby collection and very pretty  i direct this to rockingham supposing you to be there in this summer time if you are as leafy in northamptonshire as we are in kent you are greener than you have been for some years i hope you may have seen a largeheaded photograph with little legs representing the undersigned pen in hand tapping his forehead to knock an idea out it has just sprung up so abundantly in all the shops that i am ashamed to go about town looking in at the picturewindows which is my delight it seems to me extraordinarily ludicrous and much more like than the grave portrait done in earnest it made me laugh when i first came upon it until i shook again in open sunlighted piccadilly  pray be a good christian to me and dont be

a better one as soon as you can possibly give it  if you go away dont you think in the main you would be better here than anywhere you know how well you would be nursed what care we should take of you and how perfectly quiet and at home you would be until you become strong enough to take to the medway moreover i think you would be less anxious about the tour here than away from such association i would come to worthing to fetch you i neednt say and would take the most careful charge of you i will write no more about this because i wish to avoid giving you more to read than can be helped but i do sincerely believe it would be at once your wisest and least anxious course as to a long journey into wales or any long journey it would never do nice is not to be thought of its dust and its sharp

sept 28th 1861  dear mr watkins  in reply to your kind letter i must explain that i have not yet brought down any of your large photographs of myself and therefore cannot report upon their effect here i think the cartes are all liked  a general howl of horror greeted the appearance of no 18 and a riotous attempt was made to throw it out of window i calmed the popular fury by promising that it should never again be beheld within these walls i think i mentioned to you when you showed it to me that i felt persuaded it would not be liked it has a grim and wasted aspect and perhaps might be made useful as a portrait of the ancient mariner  i feel that i owe you an apology for being innocently a difficult subject when i once excused myself to ary scheffer while sitting to him he received the apology as strictly his due and said with a vexed air at this moment mon cher dickens you look more like an energetic dutch admiral than anything else for which i apologised again  in the hope that the pains you have bestowed upon me will not be thrown away but that your success will prove of some use to you believe me                                                       faithfully yours

in my mind on the many times fast approaching when i shall sorely miss the familiar face that i am hardly steady enough yet to refer to the readings like a man but your kind reference to them makes me desirous to tell you that i took headland formerly of st martins hall who has always been with us in london to conduct the business when i knew that our poor dear fellow could never do it even if he had recovered strength to go and that i consulted with himself about it when i saw him for the last time on earth and that it seemed to please him and he said we couldnt do better  write to me before

arthur smith has caused me great distress and anxiety i had a great regard for him and he made the reading part of my life as light and pleasant as it could be made i had hoped to bring him to see you and had pictured to myself how amused and interested you would have been with his wonderful tact and consummate mastery of arrangement but its all over  i begin at norwich on the 28th and am going north in the middle of november i am going to do copperfield and shall be curious to test its effect on the edinburgh people it has been quite a job so to piece portions of the long book together as to make something continuous out of it but i hope i have got something varied and dramatic i am also not to slight your book going to do nickleby at mr squeerss it is clear that both must be trotted

letter and i hasten to report having very little time that we had a splendid hall last night and that i think nickleby tops all the readings somehow it seems to have got in it by accident exactly the qualities best suited to the purpose and it went last night not only with roars but with a general hilarity and pleasure that i have never seen surpassed  we are full here for tonight  fancy this last night at about six who should walk in but elwin he was exactly in his usual state only more demonstrative than ever and had been driven in by some neighbours who were coming to the reading i had tea up for him and he went down at seven with me to the dismal den where i dressed and sat by the fire while i dressed and was childishly happy in that great privilege during the reading he sat on a corner of the platform and roared incessantly he brought in a lady and gentleman to introduce while i was undressing and went away in a perfect and absolute rapture   sidenote miss hogarth

strangeness i felt in being without arthur and i was not at all myself we have a large let for tonight i think two hundred and fifty stalls which is very large and i hope that both they and i will go better i could have done perfectly last night if the audience had been bright but they were an intent and staring audience they laughed though very well and the storm made them shake themselves again but they were not magnetic and the great big place was out of sorts somehow  tomorrow i will write you another short note however short it is nickleby and the trial tonight copperfield again tomorrow

secure places for them the answer returned by telegraph was no boxseats left but on the fourth row if they prefer to sit on the stage for i read in the theatre there being no other large public room

they are to dine with me  plorns admission that he likes the school very much indeed is the great social triumph of modern times  i am looking forward to sundays rest at gads and shall be down by the ten oclock train from town i miss poor arthur dreadfully it is scarcely possible to imagine how much it is not only that his loss to me socially is quite irreparable but that the sense i used to have of compactness and comfort about me while i was reading is quite gone and when i come out for the ten minutes when i used to find him always ready for me with something cheerful to say it is forlorn i cannot but fancy too that the audience must miss the old speciality of a pervading gentleman  nobody i know has turned up yet except elwin i have had many invitations to all sorts of houses in all sorts of places and have of course accepted them every one  love to mamie if she has come home and to bouncer if she has come also marguerite who i hope is by this time much better

excluded from my reading here last night it will now and then unfortunately happen when the place of reading is small as in this case that some confusion and inconvenience arise from the local agents overestimating in perfect good faith and sincerity the capacity of the room such a mistake i am assured was made last night and thus all the available space was filled before the people in charge were at all prepared for that circumstance  you may readily suppose that i can have no personal knowledge of the proceedings of the people in my employment at such a time but i wish to assure you very earnestly that they are all old servants well acquainted with my principles and wishes and that they are under the strongest injunction to avoid any approach to mercenary dealing and to behave to all comers equally with as much consideration and politeness as they know i should myself display the recent death of a muchregretted friend of mine who managed this business for me and on whom these men were accustomed to rely in any little difficulty caused them i have no doubt to feel rather at a loss in your case do me the favour to understand that under any other circumstances you would as a matter of course have been provided with any places whatever that could be found without the smallest reference to what you had originally paid this is scanty satisfaction to you but it is so strictly the truth that yours is the first complaint of the kind i have ever received  i hope to read in dover again but it is quite impossible that i can make any present arrangement for that purpose whenever i may return here you may be sure i shall not fail to remember that i owe you a recompense for a disappointment in the meanwhile i very sincerely regret it

tonight to copperfield the bad weather has not in the least touched us and beyond all doubt a great deal of money has been left untaken at each place  the storm was most magnificent at dover all the great side of the lord warden next the sea had to be emptied the break of the sea was so prodigious and the noise was so utterly confounding the sea came in like a great sky of immense clouds for ever breaking suddenly into furious rain all kinds of wreck were washed in miss birmingham and i saw among other things a very pretty brassbound chest being thrown about like a feather on tuesday night the unhappy ostend packet could not get in neither could she go back and she beat about the channel until noon yesterday i saw her come in then with five men at the wheel such a picture of misery as to the crew of passengers there were no signs as you can scarcely imagine  tho effect at hastings and at dover really seems to have outdone the best usual impression and at dover they wouldnt go but sat applauding like mad the most delicate audience i have seen in any provincial place is canterbury the audience with the greatest sense of humour certainly is dover the people in the stalls set the example of laughing in the most curiously unreserved way and they really laughed when squeers read the boys letters with such cordial enjoyment that the contagion extended to me for one couldnt hear them without laughing too  so thank god all goes well and the recompense for the trouble is in every way great there is rather an alarming breakdown at newcastle in respect of all the bills having been in some inscrutable way lost on the road i have resolved to send berry there with full powers to do all manner of things early next week  the amended routelist is not printed yet because i am trying to get off manchester and liverpool both of which i strongly doubt in the present state of american affairs therefore i cant send it for marguerite but i can and do send her my love and

affectionate and faithful                                                                   joe   sidenote miss hogarth                     queens head newcastle friday nov 22nd 1861  i received your letter this morning and grieve to report that the unlucky headland has broken down most awfully  first as perhaps you remember this is the place where the bills were lost for a week or two the consequence has been that the agent could not announce all through the jenny lind time the most important for announcing and could but stand still and stare when people came to ask what i was going to read last night i read copperfield to the most enthusiastic and appreciative audience imaginable but in numbers about half what they might have been tonight we shall have a famous house but we might have had it last night too tomorrow knowing by this time what can of a certainty be done with copperfield i had of course given out copperfield to be read again conceive my amazement and dismay when i find the printer to have announced little dombey this i declare i had no more intention of reading than i had of reading an account of the solar system and this after a sensation last night of a really extraordinary nature in its intensity and delight  says the unlucky headland to this first head of misery johnsons mistake johnson being the printer  second i read at edinburgh for the first timeobserve the daynext wednesday jenny linds concert at edinburgh is tonight this morning comes a frantic letter from the edinburgh agent i have no bills no tickets i lose all the announcement i would have made to hundreds upon hundreds of people tonight all of the most desirable class to be well informed beforehand i cant announce what mr dickens is going to read i can answer no question i have upon my responsibility put a dreary advertisement into the papers announcing that he is going to read so many times and that particulars will shortly be ready and i stand bound hand and foot johnsons mistake says the unlucky headland  of course i know that the man who never made a mistake in poor arthurs time is not likely to be always making mistakes now but i have written by this post to wills to go to him and investigate i have also detached berry from here and have sent him on by train at a few minutes notice to edinburgh and then to glasgow where i have no doubt everything is wrong too glasgow we may save edinburgh i hold to be irretrievably damaged if it can be picked up at all it can only be at the loss of the two first nights and by the expenditure of no end of spirits and force and this is the harder because it is impossible not to see that the last readings polished and prepared the audiences in general and that i have not to work them up in any place where i have been before but that they start with a london intelligence and with a respect and preparation for what they are going to hear  i hope by the time you and mamie come to me we shall have got into some good method i must take the thing more into my own hands and look after it from hour to hour if such a thing as this edinburgh business could have happened under poor arthur i really believe he would have fallen into a fit or gone distracted no one can ever know what he was but i who have been with him and without him headland is so anxious and so goodtempered that i cannot be very stormy with him but it is the simple fact that he has no notion of the requirements of such work as this without him and with a larger salary to berry though there are objections to the latter as first man i could have done a hundred times better  as forster will have a strong interest in knowing all about the proceedings perhaps you will send him this letter to read there is no very tremendous harm indeed done as yet at edinburgh i know what i can do with copperfield i think it is not too much to say that for every one who does come to hear it on the first night i can get back fifty on the second and whatever can be worked up there will tell on glasgow berry i shall continue to send on ahead and i shall take nothing on trust and more as being done  on sunday morning at six i have to start for berwick from berwick in the course of that day i will write again to mamie next time  with best love to her and mrs b   sidenote miss dickens                                  queens head newcastleontyne                                           saturday nov 23rd 1861  a most tremendous hall here last night something almost terrible in the cram a fearful thing might have happened suddenly when they were all very still over smike my gas batten came down and it looked as if the room was falling there were three great galleries crammed to the roof and a high steep flight of stairs and a panic must have destroyed numbers of people a lady in the front row of stalls screamed and ran out wildly towards me and for one instant there was a terrible wave in the crowd i addressed that lady laughing for i knew she was in sight of everybody there and called out as if it happened every night theres nothing the matter i assure you dont be alarmed pray sit down and she sat down directly and there was a thunder of applause it took some few minutes to mend and i looked on with my hands in my pockets for i think if i had turned my back for a moment there might still have been a move my people were dreadfully alarmed boylett in particular who i suppose had some notion that the whole place might have taken fire  but there stood the master he did me the honour to say afterwards in addressing the rest as cool as ever i see him alounging at a railway station  a telegram from berry at edinburgh yesterday evening to say that he had got the bills and that they would all be up and dispersed yesterday evening under his own eyes so no time was lost in setting things as right as they can be set he has now gone on to glasgow  psduty to mrs bouncer   sidenote miss hogarth                            berwickontweed monday nov 25th 1861  i write in a gale of wind with a high sea running to let you know that we go on to edinburgh at halfpast eight tomorrow morning  a most ridiculous room was designed for me in this odd outoftheway place an immense corn exchange made of glass and iron round dometopped lofty utterly absurd for any such purpose and full of thundering echoes with a little lofty crowsnest of a stone gallery breast high deep in the wall into which it was designed to put me i instantly struck of course and said i would either read in a room attached to this house a very snug one capable of holding five hundred people or not at all terrified local agents glowered but fell prostrate  berry has this moment come back from edinburgh and glasgow with hopeful accounts he seems to have done the business extremely well and he says that it was quite curious and cheering to see how the glasgow people assembled round the bills the instant they were posted and evidently with a great interest in them  we left newcastle yesterday morning in the dark when it was intensely cold and froze very hard so it did here but towards night the wind went round to the sw and all night it has been blowing very hard indeed so it is now  tell mamie that i have the same sittingroom as we had when we came here with poor arthur and that my bedroom is the room out of it which she and katie had surely it is the oddest town to read in but it is taken on poor arthurs principle that a place in the way pays the expenses of a through journey and the people would seem to be coming up to the scratch gallantly it was a dull sunday though o it was a dull sunday without a book for i had forgotten to buy one at newcastle until it was too late so after dark i made a jug of whiskypunch and drowned the unlucky headlands remembrance of his failures  i shall hope to hear very soon that the workmen have broken through and that you have been in the state apartments and that upholstery measurements have come off  there has been a horrible accident in edinburgh one of the sevenstorey old houses in the high street fell when it was full of people berry was at the billposters house a few doors off waiting for him to come home when he heard what seemed like thunder and then the air was darkened with dust as if an immense quantity of steam had been blown off and then all that dismal quarter set up shrieks which he says were most dreadful   sidenote miss dickens                waterloo hotel edinburgh wednesday nov 27th 1861  mrs bouncer must decidedly come with you to carlisle she shall be received with open arms apropos of carlisle let me know when you purpose coming there we shall be there please god on the saturday in good time as i finish at glasgow on the friday night  i have very little notion of the state of affairs here as headland brought no more decisive information from the agents yesterday he never can get decisive information from any agents than the teeckets air joost moving reecht and left i hope this may be taken as satisfactory jenny lind carried off a world of money from here miss glyn or mrs dallas is playing lady macbeth at the theatre and mr shirley brooks is giving two lectures at the philosophical society on the house of commons and horace walpole grisis farewell benefits are i think on my last two nights here  gordon dined with me yesterday he is if anything rather better i think than when we last saw him in town he was immensely pleased to be with me i went with him as his office goes anywhere right into and among the ruins of the fallen building yesterday they were still at work trying to find two men brothers a young girl and an old woman known to be all lying there on the walls two or three common clocks are still hanging one of them judging from the time at which it stopped would seem to have gone for an hour or so after the fall great interest had been taken in a poor linnet in a cage hanging in the wind and rain high up against the broken wall a fireman got it down alive and great exultation had been raised over it one woman who was dug out unhurt staggered into the street stared all round her instantly ran away and has never been heard of since it is a most extraordinary sight and of course makes a great sensation   sidenote miss dickens                   waterloo hotel edinburgh friday nov 29th 1861  i think it is my turn to write to you and i therefore send a brief despatch like a telegram to let you know that in a gale of wind and a fierce rain last night we turned away a thousand people there was no getting into the hall no getting near the hall no stirring among the people no getting out no possibility of getting rid of them and yet in spite of all that and of their being steaming wet they never flagged for an instant never made a complaint and took up the trial upon their very shoulders to the last word in a triumphant roar  the talk about copperfield rings through the whole place it is done again tomorrow night tomorrow morning i read dombey tomorrow morning is grisis farewell morning concert and last night was her farewell evening concert neither she nor jenny lind nor anything nor anybody seems to make the least effect on the draw of the readings  i lunch with blackwood today he was at the reading last night a capital audience young blackwood has also called here a very good young fellow i think   sidenote miss hogarth              carricks royal hotel glasgow tuesday dec 3rd 1861  i send you by this post another scotsman from a paragraph in it a letter and an advertisement you may be able to form some dim guess of the scene at edinburgh last night such a pouring of hundreds into a place already full to the throat such indescribable confusion such a rending and tearing of dresses and yet such a scene of good humour on the whole i never saw the faintest approach to it while i addressed the crowd in the room gordon addressed the crowd in the street fifty frantic men got up in all parts of the hall and addressed me all at once other frantic men made speeches to the walls the whole blackwood family were borne in on the top of a wave and landed with their faces against the front of the platform i read with the platform crammed with people i got them to lie down upon it and it was like some impossible tableau or gigantic picnic one pretty girl in full dress lying on her side all night holding on to one of the legs of my table it was the most extraordinary sight and yet from the moment i began to the moment of my leaving off they never missed a point and they ended with a burst of cheers  the confusion was decidedly owing to the local agents but i think it may have been a little heightened by headlands way of sending them the tickets to sell in the first instance  now as i must read again in edinburgh on saturday night your travelling arrangements are affected so observe carefully you and mamie all that i am going to say it appears to me that the best course will be for you to come to edinburgh on saturday taking the fast train from the great northern station at nine in the morning this would bring you to the waterloo at edinburgh at about nine or so at night and i should be home at ten we could then have a quiet sunday in edinburgh and go over to carlisle on the monday morning  the expenditure of lungs and spirits was as you may suppose rather great last night and to sleep well was out of the question i am therefore rather fagged today and as the hall in which i read tonight is a large one i must make my letter a short one  my people were torn to ribbons last night they have not a hat among them and scarcely a coat  give my love to mamie to her question will there be war with america i answer yes i fear the north to be utterly mad and war to be unavoidable   sidenote mr w h wills                     victoria hotel preston friday dec 13th 1861  my dear wills  the news of the christmas number is indeed glorious and nothing can look brighter or better than the prospects of the illustrious publication  both carlisle and lancaster have come out admirably though i doubted both as you did but unlike you i always doubted this place i do so still it is a poor place at the best you remember and the mills are working half time and trade is very bad the expenses however will be a mere nothing the accounts from manchester for tomorrow and from liverpool for the readings generally are very cheering indeed  the young lady who sells the papers at the station is just the same as ever has orders for tonight and is coming with a person the person said i never you mind said she  i was so charmed with robert chamberss traditions of edinburgh which i read in edinburgh that i was obliged to write to him and say so  glasgow finished nobly and the last night in edinburgh was signally successful and positively splendid  will you give my small admiral on his personal application one sovereign i have told him to

mayor recommends closing tomorrow and going on on tuesday and wednesday so does the town clerk so do the agents but i have a misgiving that they hardly understand what the public general sympathy with the queen will be further i feel personally that the queen has always been very considerate and gracious to me and i would on no account do anything that might seem unfeeling or disrespectful i shall attach great weight in this state of indecision to your telegram  a capital audience at preston not a capacious room but full great appreciation  the scene at manchester last night was really magnificent i had had the platform carried forward to our frozen deep point and my table and screen built in with a proscenium and room scenery when i went in there was a very fine hall they applauded in the most tremendous manner and the extent to which they were taken aback and taken by storm by copperfield was really a thing to see  the post closes early here on a sunday and i shall close this

year charles dickens resumed the reading tour which he had commenced at the close of the previous year and continued up to christmas the first letter which follows to mr wills a new years greeting is written from a railway station between one town and another on this journey mr macready who had married for the second time not very long before this was now settled at cheltenham charles dickens had arranged to give readings there chiefly for the pleasure of visiting him and of having him as one of his audience  this reading tour went on until the beginning of february one of the last of the series was in his favourite beautiful room the st georges hall at liverpool in february he made an exchange of houses with his friends mr and mrs hogge they going to gads hill and he and his family to mr hogges house in hyde park gate south in march he commenced a series of readings at st jamess hall which went on until the middle of june when he very gladly returned to his country home  a letter beginning my dear girls addressed to some american ladies who happened to be at colchester in the same inn with him when he was reading there was published by one of them under the name of our letter in the st nicholas magazine new york in 1877 we think it best to explain it in the young ladys own words which are therefore appended to the letter  mr walter thornbury was one of charles dickenss most valuable contributors to all the year round his letters to him about the subjects of his articles for that journal are specimens of the minute and careful attention and personal supervision never neglected or distracted by any other work on which he might be engaged were it ever so hard or engrossing  the letter addressed to mr baylis we give chiefly because it has since mr bayliss death been added to the collection of mss in the british museum he was a very intimate and confidential friend of the late lord lytton and accompanied him on a visit to gads hill in that year  we give an extract from another letter from charles dickens to his sister as a beautiful specimen of a letter of condolence and encouragement to one who was striving very bravely but by very slow degrees to recover from the overwhelming grief of her bereavement mr wilkie collins was at this time engaged on his novel of no name which appeared in all the year round and was threatened with a very serious breakdown in health charles dickens wrote the letter which we give to relieve mr collinss mind as to his work happily he recovered sufficiently to make an end to his own story without any help but the true friendship and kindness which suggested the offer were none the less appreciated and may very likely by lessening his anxiety have helped to restore his health at the end of october in this year charles dickens accompanied by his daughter and sisterinlaw went to reside for a couple of months in paris taking an apartment in the rue du faubourg st honoré from thence he writes to m charles fechter he had been greatly interested in this fine artist from the time of his first appearance in england and was always one of his warmest friends and supporters during his stay in this country m fechter was at this time preparing for the opening of the lyceum theatre under his own management at the beginning of the following year  just before christmas charles dickens returned to gads hill

years to come as we have gone on through many years that are gone and i think we can say that we doubt whether any two men can have gone on more happily and smoothly or with greater trust and confidence in one another  a little packet will come to you from hunt and roskells almost at the same time i think as this note  the packet will contain a claretjug i hope it is a pretty thing in itself for your table and i know that you and mrs wills will like it none the worse because it comes from me  it is not made of a perishable material and is so far expressive of our friendship i have had your name and mine set upon it in token of our many years of mutual reliance and trustfulness it will never be so full of wine as it is today of affectionate regard

know all about macready decidedly much older and infirm very much changed his old force has gone out of him strangely i dont think i left off talking a minute from the time of my entering the house to my going to bed last night and he was as much amused and interested as ever i saw him still he was and is unquestionably aged  and even now i am obliged to cut this letter short by having to go and look after headland it would never do to be away from the rest of them i have no idea what we are doing here no notion whether things are right or wrong no conception where the room is no hold of the

that i was very averse to going to plymouth and would not have gone there again but for poor arthur but on the last night i read copperfield and positively enthralled the people it was a most overpowering effect and poor andrew7 came behind the screen after the storm and cried in the best and manliest manner also there were two or three lines of his shipmates and other sailors and they were extraordinarily affected but its culminating effect was on macready at cheltenham when i got home after copperfield i found him quite unable to speak and able to do nothing but square his dear old jaw all on one side and roll his eyes half closed like jacksons picture of him and when i said something light about it he returned noerdickens i swear to heaven that as a piece of passion and

very pretty placea compound of hastings tunbridge wells and little bits of the hills about naples but i met four respirators as i came up from the station and three pale curates without them who

extraordinary merit by far the most coherent consistent and intelligible hamlet i ever saw some of the delicacies with which he rendered his conception clear were extremely subtle and in particular he avoided that brutality towards ophelia which with a greater or less amount of coarseness i have seen in all other hamlets as a mere tour de force it would have been very remarkable in its disclosure of a perfectly wonderful knowledge of the force of the english language but its merit was far beyond and above this foreign accent of course but not at all a disagreeable one and he was so obviously safe and at ease that you were never in pain for him as a foreigner add to this a perfectly picturesque and romantic make up and a remorseless destruction of all conventionalities and you have the leading virtues of the impersonation in othello he did not succeed in iago he is very good he is an admirable artist and far beyond anyone on our stage a real artist and a gentleman  last thursday i began reading again in londona condensation of copperfield and mr bob sawyers party from pickwick to finish merrily the success of copperfield is astounding it made an impression that i must not describe i may only remark that i was half dead when i had done and that although i had looked forward all through the summer when i was carefully getting it up to its being a london sensation and that although macready hearing it at cheltenham told me to be prepared for a great effect it even went beyond my hopes i read again next thursday and the rush for places is quite furious tell

carefully crossexamining my daughter i do not believe her to be worthy of the fernery last autumn we transplanted into the shrubbery a quantity of evergreens previously clustered close to the front of the house and trained more ivy about the wall and the like when i ask her where she would have the fernery and what she would do with it the witness falters turns pale becomes confused and says perhaps it would be better not to have it at all i am quite confident that the constancy of the young person is not to be trusted and that she had better attach her fernery to one of her châteaux in spain or one of her english castles in the air none the less do i thank you for your more than kind proposal  we have been in great anxiety respecting miss hogarth the sudden decline of whose health and spirits has greatly distressed us although she is better than she was and the doctors are on the whole cheerful she requires great care and fills us with apprehension the necessity of providing change for her will probably take us across the water very early in the autumn and this again unsettles home schemes here and withers many kinds of fern if they knew by they i mean my daughter and miss hogarth that i was writing to you they would charge me with many messages of regard but as i am shut up in my room in a ferocious and unapproachable condition owing to the great accumulation of letters i have to answer i will tell them at lunch that i have anticipated their wish as i know they have bills for me to pay and are at present shy of producing them i wish to preserve a gloomy and repellent reputation                            my dear mr baylis faithfully yours always   sidenote mrs henry austin                                  gads hill tuesday oct 7th 1862                                       i do not preach consolation because i am unwilling to preach at any time and know my own weakness too well but in this world there is no stay but the hope of a better and no reliance but on the mercy and goodness of god through those two harbours of a shipwrecked heart i fully believe that you will in time find a peaceful restingplace even on this careworn earth heaven speed the time and do you try hard to help it on it is impossible to say but that our prolonged grief for the beloved dead may grieve them in their unknown abidingplace and give them trouble the one influencing consideration in all you do as to your disposition of yourself coupled of course with a real earnest strenuous endeavour to recover the lost tone of spirit is that you think and feel you can do i do not in the least regard your change of course in going to havre as any evidence of instability but i rather hope it is likely that through such restlessness you will come to a far quieter frame of mind the disturbed mind and affections like the tossed sea seldom calm without an intervening time of confusion and trouble  but nothing is to be attained without striving in a determined effort to settle the thoughts to parcel out the day to find occupation regularly or to make it to be up and doing something are chiefly to be found the mere mechanical means which must come to the aid of the best mental efforts  it is a wilderness of a day here in the way of blowing and raining and as darkly dismal at four oclock as need be my head is but just now raised from a days writing but i will not lose the post without sending you a word  katie was here yesterday just come back from clara whites that was in scotland in the midst of her brilliant fortune it is too clear to me that she is already beckoned away to follow her dead sisters macready was here from saturday evening to yesterday morning older but looking wonderfully well and what is very rare in these times with the old thick sweep of hair upon his head georgina being left alone here the other day was done no good to by a great consternation among the servants on going downstairs she found marsh the stableman seated with great dignity and anguish in an armchair and incessantly crying out i am dead to which the women servants said with great pathos and with some appearance of reason no you aint marsh and to which he persisted in replying yes i am i am dead some neighbouring vagabond was impressed to drive a cart over to rochester and fetch the doctor who said the patient and his consolers being all very

tuesday night oct 14th 1862  my dear wilkie  frank beard has been here this evening of course since i posted my this days letter to you and has told me that you are not at all well and how he has given you something which he hopes and believes will bring you round it is not to convey this insignificant piece of intelligence or to tell you how anxious i am that you should come up with a wet sheet and a flowing sail as we say at sea when we are not sick that i write it is simply to say what follows which i hope may save you some mental uneasiness for i was stricken ill when i was doing bleak house and i shall not easily forget what i suffered under the fear of not being able to come up to time  dismiss that fear if you have it altogether from your mind write to me at paris at any moment and say you are unequal to your work and want me and i will come to london straight and do your work i am quite confident that with your notes and a few words of explanation i could take it up at any time and do it absurdly unnecessary to say that it would be a makeshift but i could do it at a pinch so like you as that no one should find out the difference dont make much of this offer in your mind it is nothing except to ease it if you should want help i am as safe as the bank the trouble would be nothing to me and the triumph of overcoming a difficulty great think it a christmas

there i am and i hope that the knowledge may be a comfort to you call me and i come  as beard always has a sense of medical responsibility and says anything important about a patient in confidence i

charmed to know him and that i shall feel the strongest interest in making his acquaintance it almost puts me out of humour with paris and it takes a great deal to do that to think that i was not at

your note of your lyceum preparations i trust they are all going on well there is a fine opening for you i am sure with a good beginning but the importance of a good beginning is very great if you

fechter  i have read the white rose attentively and think it an extremely good play it is vigorously written with a great knowledge of the stage and presents many striking situations i think the close particularly fine impressive bold and new  but i greatly doubt the expediency of your doing any historical play early in your management by the words historical play i mean a play founded on any incident in english history our public are accustomed to associate historical plays with shakespeare in any other hands i believe they care very little for crowns and dukedoms what you want is something with an interest of a more domestic and general naturean interest as romantic as you please but having a more general and wider response than a disputed succession to the throne can have for englishmen at this time of day such interest culminated in the last stuart and has worn itself out it would be uphill work to evoke an interest in perkin warbeck  i do not doubt the plays being well received but my fear is that these people would be looked upon as mere abstractions and would have but a cold welcome in consequence and would not lay hold of your audience now when you have laid hold of your audience and have accustomed them to your theatre you may produce the white rose with far greater justice to the author and to the manager also wait feel your way perkin warbeck is too far removed from analogy with the sympathies and lives of the people for a beginning                                 my dear fechter ever faithfully yours   sidenote miss mary boyle

persuade my legs for whose judgment i have the highest respect to go to an evening party but i could not induce them to pass leicester square the faltering presentiment under which they laboured so

beginning of february staying with his servant john at the hôtel du helder there was a series of readings in london this season at the hanover square rooms the christmas number of all the year round was entitled mrs lirripers lodgings to which charles dickens contributed the first and last chapter  the lyceum theatre under the management of m fechter was opened in january with the dukes motto and the letter given here has reference to this first night  we regret very much having no letters to lady molesworth who was an old and dear friend of charles dickens but this lady explains to us that she has long ceased to preserve any letters addressed to her  the mr and mrs humphery now sir william and lady humphery mentioned in the first letter for this year were dear and intimate friends of his eldest daughter and were frequent guests in her fathers house mrs humphery and her sister lady olliffe were daughters of the late mr william cubitt mp  we have in this year the first letter of charles dickens to mr percy fitzgerald this gentleman had been a valuable contributor to his journal before he became personally known to charles dickens the acquaintance once made soon ripened into friendship and for the future mr fitzgerald was a constant and always a welcome visitor to gads hill  the letter to mr charles reade alludes to his story hard cash which was then appearing in all the year round as a writer and as a friend he was held by charles dickens in the highest estimation  charles dickenss correspondence with his solicitor and excellent friend mr frederic ouvry now a vicepresident of the society of antiquaries was almost entirely of a business character but we are glad to give one or two notes to that gentleman although of little public interest in order to have the name in our book of one of the kindest of our own friends   sidenote miss dickens                            paris hÔtel du helder rue du helder                                             friday

preserve it carefully as a most noble tribute from a great and real artist  i wished you had been at the embassy on friday evening the audience was a fine one and the carol is particularly well adapted to the purpose it is an uncommon pleasure to me to learn that i am to meet you on tuesday for there are not many men whom i meet with greater pleasure than you heaven how the years roll by we are quite old friends now in counting by years if we add sympathies we have been friends at least a thousand years                                              affectionately yours ever   sidenote

last friday night at the embassy such audiences and such enthusiasm i have never seen but the thing culminated on friday night in a two hours storm of excitement and pleasure they actually recommenced and applauded right away into their carriages and down the street  you know your parents horror of being lionised and will not be surprised to hear that i am half dead of it i cannot leave here until thursday though i am every hour in danger of running away because i have to dine out to say nothing of breakfastingthink of me breakfastingevery intervening day but my project is to send john home on thursday and then to go on a little perfectly quiet tour for about ten days touching the sea at boulogne when i get there i will write to your aunt in case you should not be at home saying when i shall arrive at the office i must go to the office instead of gads because i have much to do with forster about elliotson  i enclose a short note for each of the little boys give harry ten shillings

hurried note to mamie you will get some faint general idea of a new stars having arisen in paris but of its brightness you can have no adequate conception  john has locked me up and gone out and the little bell at the door is ringing demoniacally while i write  you have never heard me read yet i have been twice goaded and lifted out of myself into a state that astonished me almost as much as the audience i have a cold but no neuralgia and am as well as can be expected  i forgot to tell mamie that i went with lady molesworth to hear faust last night it is a splendid work in which that noble and sad story is most nobly and sadly rendered and perfectly delighted me but i think it requires too much of the audience to do for a london opera house the composer must be a very remarkable man indeed some management of light throughout the story is also very poetical and fine we had carvalhos box i could hardly bear the thing it affected me so  but as a certain frenchman said no weakness danton so i leave off   sidenote m charles fechter                                     paris wednesday feb 4th 1863  my dear fechter  a thousand congratulations on your great success never mind what they say or do pour vous écraser you have the game in your hands the romantic drama thoroughly well done with a touch of shakespeare now and then is the speciality of your theatre give the public the picturesque romantic drama with yourself in it and as i told you in the beginning you may throw down your gauntlet in defiance of all comers  it is a most brilliant success indeed and it thoroughly rejoices my heart  unfortunately i cannot now hope to see maquet because i am packing up and going out to dinner it is late in the afternoon and i leave tomorrow morning when all sensible people except myself are in bed and i do not come back to paris or near it i had hoped to see him at breakfast last monday but he was not there paul féval was there and i found him a capital fellow if i can do anything to help you on with maquet8 when i come back i will most gladly do it  my readings here have had the finest possible reception and have achieved a most noble success i never before read to such fine audiences so very quick of perception and so enthusiastically responsive  i shall be heartily pleased to see you again my dear fechter and to share your triumphs with the real earnestness of

carol and trialhave made a sensation which modesty my natural modesty renders it impossible for me to describe you know what a noble audience the paris audience is they were at their very noblest with

and nurses and can afford to be ill now and then for the happiness of being so brought through it but dont do it again yet awhile for all that  legouvé whom you remember in paris as writing for the ristori was anxious that i should bring you the enclosed a manly and generous effort i think regnier desired to be warmly remembered to you he looks just as of yore  paris generally is about as wicked

picturesque french drama miss kate terry in a small part in it perfectly charming you may remember her making a noise years ago doing a boy at an inn in the courier of lyons she has a tender lovescene in this piece which is a really beautiful and artistic thing i saw her do it at about three in the morning of the day when the theatre opened surrounded by shavings and carpenters and of course with that inevitable hammer going and i told fechter that is the very best piece of womanly tenderness i have ever seen on the stage and youll find that no audience can miss it it is a comfort to add that it was instantly seized upon and is much talked of  stanfield was very ill for some months then suddenly picked up and is really rosy and jovial again going to see him when he was very despondent i told him the story of fechters piece then in rehearsal with appropriate action fighting a duel with the washingstand defying the bedstead and saving the life of the sofacushion this so kindled his old

having seen nothing whatever the wretched van turned up in the course of the next morning and the best of it was that at rochester here they illuminated the fine old castle and really made a very

would think and feel about it when we saw him in paris on his way out i was struck by his extreme nervousness and derived from it an uneasy foreboding of his state what a large piece of a good many years he seems to have taken with him how often have i thought since the news of his death came of his putting his part in the saucepan with the cover on when we rehearsed the lighthouse of his falling out of the hammock when we rehearsed the frozen deep of his learning italian numbers when he ate the garlic in the carriage of the thousands i was going to say of dark mornings when i apostrophised him as kernel of his losing my invaluable knife in that beastly stagecoach of his posting up that mysterious book11 every night i hardly know why but i have always associated that volume most with venice in my memory of the dear gentle little fellow he will be as since those days he always has been eternally posting up that book at the large table in the middle of our venice sittingroom incidentally asking the name of an hotel three weeks back and his pretty house is to be laid waste and sold if there be a sale on the spot i shall try to buy something in loving remembrance of him good dear little fellow think what a great frozen deep lay close under those boards we acted on my brother alfred luard arthur albert austin egg even among the audience prince albert and poor stone i heard thei forget what it was i used to saycome up from the great deep and it rings in my ears now like a sort of mad prophecy  however this wont do we must close up the ranks

i want to discover  one of my boys the youngest now is at wimbledon school he is a docile amiable boy of fair abilities but sensitive and shy and he writes me so very earnestly that he feels the school to be confusingly large for him and that he is sure he could do better with some gentleman who gave his own personal attention to the education of halfadozen or a dozen boys as to impress me with the belief that i ought to heed his conviction  has any such phenomenon as a good and reliable man in this wise ever come in your way forgive my troubling you and believe me

1863  my dear brookfield  i am most truly obliged to you for your kind and ready help  when i am in town next week i will call upon the bishop of natal more to thank him than with the hope of profiting by that gentleman of whom he writes as the limitation to little boys seems to stop the way i want to find someone with whom this particular boy could remain if there were a mutual interest and liking that would be a great point gained  why did the kings in the fairy tales want children i suppose in the weakness of the royal intellect  concerning nickleby i am so much of your mind comparing it with copperfield that it was a long time before i could take a pleasure in reading it but i got better as i found the audience always taking to it i have been trying alone by myself the

mind to a french hamlet but i assure you that fechters is a very remarkable performance perfectly consistent with itself whether it be my particular hamlet or your particular hamlet or no a coherent and intelligent whole and done by a true artist i have never seen i think an intelligent and clear view of the whole character so well sustained throughout and there is a very captivating air of romance and picturesqueness added which is quite new rely upon it the public were right the thing could not have been sustained by oddity it would have perished upon that very soon as to the mere accent there is far less drawback in that than you would suppose for this reason he obviously knows english so thoroughly that you feel he is safe you are never in pain for him this sense of ease is gained directly and then you think very little more about it  the colenso and jowett matter is a more difficult question but here again i dont go with you the position of the writers of essays and reviews is that certain parts of the old testament have done their intended function in the education of the world as it was but that mankind like the individual man is designed by the almighty to have an infancy and a maturity and that as it advances the machinery of its education must advance too for example inasmuch as ever since there was a sun and there was vapour there must have been a rainbow under certain conditions so surely it would be better now to recognise that indisputable fact similarly joshua might command the sun to stand still under the impression that it moved round the earth but he could not possibly have inverted the relations of the earth and the sun whatever his impressions were again it is contended that the science of geology is quite as much a revelation to man as books of an immense age and of at the best doubtful origin and that your consideration of the latter must reasonably be influenced by the former as i understand the importance of timely suggestions such as these it is that the church should not gradually shock and lose the more thoughtful and logical of human minds but should be so gently and considerately yielding as to retain them and through them hundreds of thousands this seems to me as i understand the temper and tendency of the time whether for good or evil to be a very wise and necessary position and as i understand the danger it is not chargeable on those who take this ground but on those who in reply call names and argue nothing what these bishops and suchlike say about revelation in assuming it to be finished and done with i cant in the least understand nothing is discovered without gods intention and assistance and i suppose every new knowledge of his works that is conceded to man to be distinctly a revelation by which men are to guide themselves lastly in the mere matter of religious doctrine and dogmas these men protestantsprotestorssuccessors of the men who protested against human judgment being set aside talk and write as if they were all settled by the direct act of heaven not as if they had been as we know they were a matter of temporary accommodation and adjustment among disputing mortals as fallible as you or i  coming nearer home i hope that georgina is almost quite well she has no attack of pain or flurry now and is in all respects immensely better mary is neither married

hope you will excuse this tardy reply to your letter it is often impossible for me by any means to keep pace with my correspondents i must take leave to say that if there be any general feeling on the part of the intelligent jewish people that i have done them what you describe as a great wrong they are a far less sensible a far less just and a far less goodtempered people than i have always supposed them to be fagin in oliver twist is a jew because it unfortunately was true of the time to which that story refers that that class of criminal almost invariably was a jew but surely no sensible man or woman of your persuasion can fail to observefirstly that all the rest of the wicked dramatis personæ are christians and secondly that he is called the jew not because of his religion but because of his race if i were to write a story in which i described a frenchman or a spaniard as the roman catholic i should do a very indecent and unjustifiable thing but i make mention of fagin as the jew because he is one of the jewish people and because it conveys that kind of idea of him which i should give my readers of a chinaman by calling him a chinese  the enclosed is quite a nominal subscription towards the good object in which you are interested but i hope it may serve to show you that i have no feeling towards the jewish people but a friendly one i always speak well of them whether in public or in private and bear my testimony as i ought to do to their perfect good faith in such transactions as i have ever had with them and in my childs history of england i have lost no opportunity of setting forth their cruel persecution in old times                                           dear madam faithfully yours   in reply to this the jewish lady thanks him for his kind letter and its enclosure still remonstrating and pointing out that though as he observes all the other criminal characters were christians they are at least contrasted with characters of good christians this wretched fagin stands alone as the jew  the reply to this letter afterwards was the character of riah in our mutual friend and some favourable sketches of jewish character in the lower

enquire whether the servants felt it i thought it was the voice of the cook that answered me but that was nearly half an hour later i am strongly inclined to think that there is a peculiar

me still  will you tell mrs linton that in looking over her admirable account most admirable of mrs gordons book i have taken out the references to lockhart not because i in the least doubt their justice but because i knew him and he liked me and because one bright day in rome i walked about with him for some hours when he was dying fast and all the old faults had faded out of him and the now ghost of the handsome man i had first known when scotts daughter was at the head of his house had little more to do with this world than she in her grave or scott in his or small hugh littlejohn in

this year and had been much shocked and distressed by the news of the sudden death of mr thackeray brought to him by friends arriving from london on the christmas eve of 1863 the day on which the sad event happened he writes of it in the first letter of the year to mr wilkie collins who was passing the winter in italy he tells him also of his having got well to work upon a new serial story the first number of which our mutual friend was published on the 1st of may  the year began very sadly for charles dickens on the 7th of february his own birthday he received the mournful announcement of the death of his second son walter landor a lieutenant in the 42nd royal highlanders who had died quite suddenly at calcutta on the last night of the year of 1863 at the age of twentythree his third son francis jeffrey had started for india at the end of january  his annual letter to m de cerjat contains an allusion to another generation beginning to peep above the tablethe children of his son charles who had been married three years before to miss bessie evans  in the middle of february he removed to a house in london 57 gloucester place hyde park where he made a stay of the usual duration up to the middle of june all the time being hard at work upon our mutual friend and all the year round mr marcus stone was the illustrator of the new monthly work and we give a specimen of one of many letters which he wrote to him about his subjects  his old friend mr charles knight with whom for many years charles dickens had dined on his birthday was staying this spring in the isle of wight to him he writes of the death of walter and of another sad death which happened at this time and which affected him almost as much clara the last surviving daughter of mr and mrs white who had been happily married to mr gordon of cluny not more than two years had just died at bonchurch her father as will be seen by the touching allusion to him in this letter had died a short time after this daughters marriage  a letter to mr edmund ollier has reference to certain additions which charles dickens wished him to make to an article by mr ollier on working mens clubs published in all the year round  we are glad to have one letter to the lord chief baron sir frederick pollock which shows the great friendship and regard charles dickens had for him and his admiration of his qualities in his judicial capacity  we give a pleasant letter to mrs storrar for whom and for her husband dr storrar charles dickens had affectionate regard because we are glad to have their names in our book the letter speaks for itself and needs no explanation  the latter part of the year was uneventful hard at work he passed the summer and autumn at gads hill taking holidays by receiving visitors at home among them this year sir j emerson tennent his wife and daughter who were kindly urgent for his paying them a return visit in ireland and occasional runs into france the last letters we give are his

horribly behindhand in answering your welcome letter but i have been so busy and have had the house so full for christmas and the new year and have had so much to see to in getting frank out to india that i have not been able to settle down to a regular long letter which i mean this to be but which it may not turn out to be after all  first i will answer your enquiries about the christmas number and the new book the christmas number has been the greatest success of all has shot ahead of last year has sold about two hundred and twenty thousand and has made the name of mrs lirriper so swiftly and domestically famous as never was i had a very strong belief in her when i wrote about her finding that she made a great effect upon me but she certainly has gone beyond my hopes probably you know nothing about her which is a very unpleasant consideration of the new book i have done the two first numbers and am now beginning the third it is a combination of drollery with romance which requires a great deal of pains and a perfect throwing away of points that might be amplified but i hope it is very good i confess in short that i think it is strange to say i felt at first quite dazed in getting back to the large canvas and the big brushes and even now i have a sensation as of acting at the san carlo after tavistock house which i could hardly have supposed would have come upon so old a stager  you will have read about poor thackerays deathsudden and yet not sudden for he had long been alarmingly ill at the solicitation of mr smith and some of his friends i have done what i would most gladly have excused myself from doing if i felt i couldwritten a couple of pages about him in what was his own magazine  concerning the italian experiment de la rue is more hopeful than you he and his bank are closely leagued with the powers at turin and he has long been devoted to cavour but he gave me the strongest assurances with illustrations of the fusion between place and place and of the blending of small mutually antagonistic characters into one national character progressing cheeringly and certainly of course there must be discouragements and discrepancies in the first struggles of a country previously so degraded and enslaved and the time as yet has been very short  i should like to have a day with you at the coliseum and on the appian way and among the tombs and with the orvieto but rome and i are wide asunder physically as well as morally i wonder whether the dramatic stable where we saw the marionettes still receives the roman public and lord when i think of you in

its coming out to perfection the slight alteration i am going to suggest originates in a business consideration not to be overlooked  the word our in the title must be out in the open like mutual friend making the title three distinct large linesour as big as mutual friend this would give you too much design at the bottom i would therefore take out the dustman and put the wegg and boffin composition which is capital in its place i dont want mr inspector or the murder reward bill because these points are sufficiently indicated in the river at the top therefore you can have an indication of the dustman in mr inspectors place note that the dustmans face should be droll and not horrible twemlows elbow will still go out of the frame as it does now and the same with lizzies skirts on the opposite side with these changes work away  mrs boffin as i judge of her from the sketch very good indeed i want boffins oddity without being at all blinked to be an oddity of a very

effort  also emphatically to show that trustfulness is at the bottom of all social institutions and that to trust a man as one of a body of men is to place him under a wholesome restraint of social opinion and is a very much better thing than to make a baby of him  also to point out that the rejection of beer in this club tobacco in that club dancing or whatnot in another club are instances that such clubs are founded on mere whims and therefore cannot successfully address human nature in the general and hope to last  also again to urge that patronage is the curse and blight of all such endeavours and to impress upon the working men that they must originate and manage for themselves and to ask them the question can they possibly show their detestation of drunkenness better or better strive to get rid of it from among them than to make it a hopeless disqualification in all their clubs and a reason for expulsion  also to encourage them to declare to themselves and their fellow working men that they want social rest and social recreation for themselves and their families and that these clubs are intended for that laudable and necessary purpose and do not need educational

tuesday march 29th 1864  my dear forster  i meant to write to you last night but to enable wills to get away i had to read a book of fitzgeralds through before i went to bed  concerning eliot i sat down as i told you and read the book through with the strangest interest and the highest admiration i believe it to be as honest spirited patient reliable and gallant a piece of biography as ever was written the care and pains of it astonishing the completeness of it masterly and what i particularly feel about it is that the dignity of the man and the dignity of the book that tells about the man always go together and fit each other this same quality has always impressed me as the great leading speciality of the goldsmith and enjoins sympathy with the subject knowledge of it and pursuit of it in its own spirit but i think it even more remarkable here i declare that apart from the interest of having been so put into the time and enabled to understand it i personally feel quite as much the credit and honour done to literature by such a book it quite clears out of the remembrance a thousand pitiful things and sets one up in heart again i am not surprised in the least by bulwers enthusiasm i was as confident about the effect of the book when i closed the first volume as i was when i closed the second with a full heart no man less in earnest than eliot himself could have done it and i make bold to add that it never could have been done by a man who was so distinctly born to do the work as eliot was to do his  saturday at hastings i must give up i have wavered and considered and considered and wavered but if i take that sort of holiday i must have a day to spare after it and at this critical time i have not if i were to lose a page of the five numbers i have purposed to myself to be ready by the publication day i should feel that i had fallen short i have grown hard to satisfy and write very slowly and i have so much bad fiction that will be thought of

together mary and georgina acknowledge the condition of imbecility to which we have become reduced in reference to your kind reminder they say when i stare at them in a forlorn way with your note in my hand what can you do to which i can only reply implicating them see what you have brought me to  with our united kind regard to yourself and dr storrar i entreat your pity and compassion for an unfortunate wretch whom a tooconfiding disposition has brought to this pass if i had not allowed my cheeild to pledge me to all manner of fellowcreatures i and my digestion might have been in a state of honourable independence this day                                        faithfully and penitently yours   sidenote mr percy fitzgerald                    office of all the year round etc etc etc                                          wednesday july 27th 1864  my dear mr fitzgerald  first let me assure you that it gave us all real pleasure to see your sister and you at gads hill and that we all hope you will both come and stay a day or two with us when you are next in england  next let me convey to you the intelligence that i resolve to launch miss manuel fully confiding in your conviction of the power of the story on all business points wills will communicate with you i purpose beginning its publication in our first september number therefore there is no time to be lost  the only suggestion i have to make as to the ms in hand and type is that captain fermor wants relief it is a disagreeable character as you mean it to be and i should be afraid to do so much with him if the case were mine without taking the taste of him here and there out of the readers mouth it is remarkable that if you do not administer a disagreeable character carefully the public have a decided tendency to think that the story is disagreeable and not merely the fictitious person  what do you think of the title                                never forgotten  it is a good one in itself would express the eldest sisters pursuit and glanced at now and then in the text would hold the reader in suspense i would propose to add the line                         by the author of bella donna  let me know your opinion as to the title i need not assure you that the greatest care will be taken of you here and that we shall make you as thoroughly well and widely known as we possibly can                                                  very faithfully yours   sidenote sir james emerson tennent                      gads hill place higham by rochester kent                                             friday aug 26th 1864  my dear tennent  believe me i fully intended to come to youdid not doubt that i should comeand have greatly disappointed mary and her aunt as well as myself by not coming but i do not feel safe in going out for a visit the mere knowledge that i had such a thing before me would put me out it is not the length of time consumed or the distance traversed but it is the departure from a settled habit and a continuous sacrifice of pleasures that comes in question this is an old story with me i have never divided a book of my writing with anything else but have always wrought at it to the exclusion of everything else and it is now too late to change  after receiving your kind note i resolved to make another trial but the hot weather and a few other drawbacks did not mend the matter for i have dropped astern this month instead of going ahead so i have seen forster and shown him my chains and am reduced to taking exercise in them like baron trenck  i am heartily pleased that you set so much store by the dedication you may be sure that it does not make me the less anxious to take pains and to work out well what i have in my mind  mary and georgina unite with me in kindest regards to lady tennent and miss tennent and wish me to report that while they are seriously disappointed they still feel there is no help for it i can testify that they had great pleasure in the anticipation of the visit and that their faces were very long and blank indeed when i began to hint my doubts they fought against them valiantly as long as there was a chance but they see my difficulty as well as anyone not myself can                    believe me my dear tennent ever faithfully yours   sidenote mr clarkson stanfield ra                            the athenÆum wednesday sept 21st 1864  my dear stanny  i met george in the street a few days ago and he gave me a wonderful account of the effect of your natural element upon you at ramsgate i expect you to come back looking about twentynine and feeling about nineteen  this morning i have looked in here to put down fechter as a candidate on the chance of the committees electing him some day or other he is a most devoted worshipper of yours and would take it as a great honour if you would second him supposing you to have not the least objection of course if you should have any i can in a moment provide a substitute will you write your name in the candidates book as his seconder when you are next in town and passing this way  lastly if you should be in town on his opening night a saturday and in all probability the 22nd of october will you come and dine at the office and see his new piece you have not yet pronounced in the matter of that new french stage of his on which calcott for the said new piece has built up all manner of villages camps versailles gardens etc etc etc etc with no wings no flies no looking off in any direction if you tell me that you are to be in town by that time i will not fail to refresh your memory as to the precise day          with kind regard to mrs stanfield                 believe me my dear old boy ever your affectionate

here is a limping brute of a reply to your alwayswelcome christmas letter but as usual when i have done my days work i jump up from my desk and rush into air and exercise and find letterwriting the most difficult thing in my daily life  i hope that your asthmatic tendencies may not be strong just now but townshends account of the premature winter at lausanne is not encouraging and with us here in england all such disorders have been aggravated this autumn however a man of your dignity must have either asthma or gout and i hope you have got the better of the two  in london there is as you see by the papers extraordinarily little news at present the apprehension rather less than it was thought of a commercial crisis and the trial of müller next thursday are the two chief sensations i hope that gentleman will be hanged and have hardly a doubt of it though croakers contrariwise are not wanting it is difficult to conceive any other line of defence than that the circumstances proved taken separately are slight but a sound judge will immediately charge the jury that the strength of the circumstances lies in their being put together and will thread them together on a fatal rope  as to the church my friend i am sick of it the spectacle presented by the indecent squabbles of priests of most denominations and the exemplary unfairness and rancour with which they conduct their differences utterly repel me and the idea of the protestant establishment in the face of its own history seeking to trample out discussion and private judgment is an enormity so cool that i wonder the right reverends very reverends and all other reverends who commit it can look in one anothers faces without laughing as the old soothsayers did perhaps they cant and dont how our sublime and sodifferent christian religion is to be administered in the future i cannot pretend to say but that the churchs hand is at its own throat i am fully convinced here more popery there more methodismas many forms of consignment to eternal damnation as there are articles and all in one forever quarrelling bodythe master of the new testament put out of sight and the rage and fury almost always turning on the letter of obscure parts of the old testament which itself has been the subject of accommodation adaptation varying interpretation without endthese things cannot last the church that is to have its part in the coming time must be a more christian one with less arbitrary pretensions and a stronger hold upon the mantle of our saviour as he walked and talked upon this earth  of family intelligence i have very little charles collins continuing in a very poor way and showing no signs of amendment he and my daughter katie went to wiesbaden and thence to nice where they are now i have strong apprehensions that he will never recover and that she will be left a young widow all the rest are as they were mary neither married nor going to be georgina holding them all together and perpetually corresponding with the distant ones occasional rallyings coming off here in which another generation begins to peep above the table i once used to think what a horrible thing it was to be a grandfather finding that the calamity falls upon me without my perceiving any other change in myself i bear it like a man  mrs watson has bought a house in town to which she repairs in the season for the bringing out of her daughter she is now at rockingham her eldest son is said to be as good an eldest son as ever was and to make her position there a perfectly independent and happy one i have not seen him for some years her i often see but he ought to be a good fellow and is very popular in his neighbourhood  i have altered this place very much since you were here and have made a pretty i think an unusually pretty drawingroom i wish you would come back and see it my being on the dover line and my being very fond of france occasion me to cross the channel perpetually whenever i feel that i have worked too much or am on the eve of overdoing it and want a change away i go by the mailtrain and turn up in paris or anywhere else that suits my humour next morning so i come back as fresh as a daisy and preserve as ruddy a face as though i never leant over a sheet of paper when i retire from a literary life i think of setting up as a channel pilot  pray give my love to mrs cerjat and tell her that i should like to go up the great st bernard again and shall be glad to know if she is open to another ascent old days in switzerland are ever fresh to me and sometimes i walk with you again after dark outside the hotel at martigny while lady mary taylour wasnt it sang within very prettily lord how the time goes how many years ago                                                   affectionately yours                                        wednesday nov 16th 186413  dear madam  i have received your letter with great pleasure and hope to be as i have always been at heart the best of friends with the jewish people the error you point out to me had occurred to me as most errors do to most people when it was too late to correct it but it will do no harm the peculiarities of dress and manner are fused together for the sake of picturesqueness                                           dear madam faithfully yours   sidenote mr b w procter                      gads hill place

all this year until today in order that i might send most heartily and affectionately all seasonable good wishes to you and to mrs procter and to those who are nearest and dearest to you take them from an old friend who loves you  mamie returns the tender compliments and georgina does what the americans call endorse them mrs lirriper is proud to be so remembered and says over and over again that its worth twenty times the trouble she has taken with the narrative since barry cornwall esquire is pleased to like it  i got rid of a touch of neuralgia in france as i always do there but i found no old friends in my voyages of discovery on that side such as i have left on this                                my dear procter ever your affectionate   footnotes  13 in answer to another letter from the jewish lady in which she gives her reasons for still being dissatisfied with the character of riah     1865  narrative   for this spring a furnished house in somers place hyde park had been taken which charles dickens occupied with his sisterinlaw and daughter from the beginning of march until june  during the year he paid two short visits to france  he was still at work upon our mutual friend two numbers of which had been issued in january and february when the first volume was published with dedication to sir james emerson tennent the remaining numbers were issued between march and november when the complete work was published in two volumes  the christmas number to which charles dickens contributed three stories was called doctor marigolds prescriptions  being out of health and much overworked charles dickens at the end of may took his first short holiday trip into france and on his way home and on a day afterwards so fatal to him the 9th of june he was in that most terrible railway accident at staplehurst many of our letters for this year have reference to this awful experiencean experience from the effects of which his nerves never wholly recovered his letters to mr thomas mitton and to mrs hulkes an esteemed friend and neighbour are graphic descriptions of this disaster but they do not tell of the wonderful presence of mind and energy shown by charles dickens when most of the terrified passengers were incapable of thought or action or of his gentleness and goodness to the dead and dying the mr dickenson14 mentioned in the letter to mrs hulkes soon recovered he always considers that he owes his life to charles dickens the latter having discovered and extricated him from beneath a carriage before it was too late  our first letter to mr kent is one of congratulation upon his having become the proprietor of the sun newspaper  professor owen has been so kind as to give us some notes which we publish for the sake of his great name charles dickens had not much correspondence with professor owen but there was a firm friendship and great mutual admiration between them  the letter to mrs procter is in answer to one from her asking charles dickens to write a memoir of her daughter adelaide as a preface to a collected edition of her poems   sidenote mr william charles kent                      gads hill place higham by rochester kent                                            tuesday jan 17th 1865  my dear kent  i meant to have written instantly on the appearance of your paper in its beautiful freshness to congratulate you on its handsome appearance and to send you my heartiest good wishes for its thriving and prosperous career through a mistake of the postmans that remarkable letter has been tesselated into the infernal pavement instead of being delivered in the strand  we have been looking and waiting for your being well enough to propose yourself for a mouthful of fresh air are you well enough to come on sunday we shall be coming down from charing cross on sunday morning and i shall be going up again at nine on monday morning  it amuses me to find that you dont see your way with a certain mutual friend of ours i have a horrible suspicion that you may begin to be fearfully knowing at somewhere about no 12 or 13 but you shant if i can help it  your note delighted me because it dwelt upon the places in the number that i dwell on not that that is anything new in your case but it is always new to me in the pleasure i derive from it which is truly inexpressible

course i will do it and of course i will do it for the love of you and procter you can give me my brief and we can speak about its details once again of course i will do it and with all my heart  i have registered a vow in which there is not the least merit for i couldnt help it that when i am as i am now very hard at work upon a book i never will dine out more than one day in a week why didnt you ask me for the wednesday before i stood engaged to lady molesworth for the tuesday  it is so delightful to me to sit by your side anywhere and be brightened up that i lay a handsome sacrifice upon the altar of our mutual friend in writing this note very much against my will but for as many years as can be made consistent with my present juvenility i always have given my work the first place in my life and what can i do now at 35or at least at the two figures never mind their order  i send my love to procter hoping you may appropriate a little of it by the way

dearest macready  i have been laid up here with a frostbitten foot from hard walking in the snow or you would have heard from me sooner  my reply to professor agassiz is short but conclusive daily seeing improper uses made of confidential letters in the addressing of them to a public audience that have no business with them i made not long ago a great fire in my field at gads hill and burnt every letter i possessed and now i always destroy every letter i receive not on absolute business and my mind is so far at ease poor dear feltons letters went up into the air with the rest or his highly distinguished representative should have had them most willingly  we never fail to drink old ps health on his birthday or to make him the subject of a thousand loving remembrances with best

frostbitten foot after causing me great inconvenience and much pain has begun to conduct itself amiably i can now again walk my ten miles in the morning without inconvenience but am absurdly obliged to sit shoeless all the eveninga very slight penalty as i detest going out to dinner which killed the original old parr bythebye  i am working like a dragon at my book and am a terror to the household likewise to all the organs and brass bands in this quarter gads hill is being gorgeously painted and we are here until the 1st of june i wish i might hope you would be there any time this summer i really have made the place comfortable and pretty by this time  it is delightful to us to hear such good news of butty she made so deep an impression on fechter that he always asks me what ceylon has done for her and always beams when i tell him how thoroughly well it has made her as to you you are the youngest man worth mentioning as a thorough man that i know oh let me be as young when i am asdid you think i was going to write old no sirwithdrawn from the wear and tear of busy life is my expression  poole still holds out at kentish town and says he is dying of solitude his memory is astoundingly good i see him about once in two or three months and in the meantime he makes notes of questions to ask me when i come having fallen in arrear of the time these generally refer to unknown words he has encountered in the newspapers his three last he always reads them with tremendous difficulty through an enormous magnifyingglass were as follows          1 whats croquet         2 whats an albert chain         3 let me know the state of mind of the queen  when i had delivered a neat exposition on these heads he turned back to his memoranda and came to something that the utmost power of the enormous magnifyingglass couldnt render legible after a quarter of an hour or so he said o yes i know and then rose and clasped his hands above his head and said thank god i am not a dramdrinker  do think of coming to gads in the summer and do give my love to mrs macready and tell her i know she can make you come if she will mary and georgy send best and dearest loves to her to you and to katie and to baby johnny we suppose to be climbing the tree of knowledge elsewhere                    my dearest macready ever yours most affectionately   sidenote mr w c macready

hand because i am too much shaken to write many notes not by the beating and dragging of the carriage in which i wasit did not go over but was caught on the turn among the ruins of the bridgebut by the work afterwards to get out the dying and dead which was terrible                     the rest in his own writing                                          ever your affectionate friend  psmy love

have written to you yesterday or the day before if i had been quite up to writing  i was in the only carriage that did not go over into the stream it was caught upon the turn by some of the ruin of the bridge and hung suspended and balanced in an apparently impossible manner two ladies were my fellowpassengers an old one and a young one this is exactly what passed you may judge from it the precise length of the suspense suddenly we were off the rail and beating the ground as the car of a halfemptied balloon might the old lady cried out my god and the young one screamed i caught hold of them both the old lady sat opposite and the young one on my left and said we cant help ourselves but we can be quiet and composed pray dont cry out the old lady immediately answered thank you rely upon me upon my soul i will be quiet we were then all tilted down together in a corner of the carriage and stopped i said to them thereupon you may be sure nothing worse can happen our danger must be over will you remain here without stirring while i get out of the window they both answered quite collectedly yes and i got out without the least notion what had happened fortunately i got out with great caution and stood upon the step looking down i saw the bridge gone and nothing below me but the line of rail some people in the two other compartments were madly trying to plunge out at window and had no idea that there was an open swampy field fifteen feet down below them and nothing else the two guards one with his face cut were running up and down on the down side of the bridge which was not torn up quite wildly i called out to them look at me do stop an instant and look at me and tell me whether you dont know me one of them answered we know you very well mr dickens then i said my good fellow for gods sake give me your key and send one of those labourers here and ill empty this carriage we did it quite safely by means of a plank or two and when it was done i saw all the rest of the train except the two baggage vans down in the stream i got into the carriage again for my brandy flask took off my travelling hat for a basin climbed down the brickwork and filled my hat with water  suddenly i came upon a staggering man covered with blood i think he must have been flung clean out of his carriage with such a frightful cut across the skull that i couldnt bear to look at him i poured some water over his face and gave him some to drink then gave him some brandy and laid him down on the grass and he said i am gone and died afterwards then i stumbled over a lady lying on her back against a little pollardtree with the blood streaming over her face which was lead colour in a number of distinct little streams from the head i asked her if she could swallow a little brandy and she just nodded and i gave her some and left her for somebody else the next time i passed her she was dead then a man examined at the inquest yesterday who evidently had not the least remembrance of what really passed came running up to me and implored me to help him find his wife who was afterwards found dead no imagination can conceive the ruin of the carriages or the extraordinary weights under which the people were lying or the complications into which they were twisted up among iron and wood and mud and water  i dont want to be examined at the inquest and i dont want to write about it i could do no good either way and i could only seem to speak about myself which of course i would rather not do i am keeping very quiet here i have ai dont know what to call itconstitutional i suppose presence of mind and was not in the least fluttered at the time i instantly remembered that i had the ms of a number with me and clambered back into the carriage for it but in writing these scanty words of recollection i feel the shake and am obliged to stop                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote mr walter jones                      gads hill

have been deeply affected by their special remembrance of me in my late escape from death or mutilation and that i thank them with my whole heart                                            faithfully

had brandy by an extraordinary chance i had a bottle and a half with me i slung the halfbottle round my neck and carried my hat full of water in my hands but i can understand the describer whoever he is making the mistake in perfect good faith and supposing that i called for brandy when i really called to the others who were helping i have brandy here the mr dickenson mentioned had changed places with a frenchman who did not like the window down a few minutes before the accident the frenchman was killed and a labourer and i got mr dickenson out of a most extraordinary heap of dark ruins in which he was jammed upside down he was bleeding at the eyes ears nose and mouth but he didnt seem to know that afterwards and of course i didnt tell him in the moment of going over the viaduct the whole of his pockets were shaken empty he had no watch no chain no money no pocketbook no handkerchief when we got him out he had been choking a quarter of an hour when i heard him groaning if i had not had the brandy to give him at the moment i think he would have been done for as it was i brought him up to london in the carriage with me and couldnt make him believe he was hurt he was the first person whom the brandy saved as i ran back to the carriage for the whole full bottle i saw the first two people i had helped lying dead a bit of shade from the hot sun into which we got the unhurt ladies soon had as many dead in it as living                                                faithfully yours always   sidenote mr arthur ryland                      gads hill place higham by rochester

that i feel the strongest interest in the occasion and the strongest wish to associate myself with it  but after careful consideration i most unwillingly come to the conclusion that i must decline at the time in question i shall please god either have just finished or be just finishing my present book country rest and reflection will then be invaluable to me before casting about for christmas i am a little shaken in my nervous system by the terrible and affecting incidents of the late railway accident from which i bodily escaped i am withdrawing myself from engagements of all kinds in order that i may pursue my story with the comfortable sense of being perfectly free while it is adoing and when it is done the consciousness of having made this engagement would if i were to make it render such sense incomplete and so open the way to others this is the real state of the case and the whole reason for my declining                                                faithfully yours always

either of the days you name and you will be heartily welcomed by the humble youth who now addresses you and will then cast himself at your feet  i am quite right again i thank god and have even got my voice back i most unaccountably brought somebody elses out of that terrible scene the directors have sent me a resolution of thanks for assistance to the unhappy passengers

a candidate for the scotch professional chair left vacant by aytouns death has asked me if i would object to introduce to you the first volume of a book he has in the press with my publishers on the gay science of art and criticism i have replied i would not object as i have read as many of the sheets as i could get with extreme pleasure and as i know you will find it a very winning and brilliant piece of writing therefore he will send the proofs of the volume to you as soon as he can get them from the printer at about the end of this week i take it and if you read them you will not be hard upon me for bearing the responsibility of his doing so i feel assured  i suppose mr dallas to have some impression that his pleasing you with his book might advance his scottish suit but all i know is that he is a gentleman of great attainments and erudition much distinguished as the writer of the best critical literary pieces in the times and thoroughly versed in the subjects which professor aytoun represented officially  i beg to send my regard to lady russell and all the house and am ever my dear lord russell                                              your faithful and obliged  psi am

can know about the subjects you take for illustration the better as i can then fill the list of illustrations to the second volume for the printer and enable him to make up his last sheet necessarily that list is now left blank as i cannot give him the titles of the subjects not knowing them myself  it has been fearfully hot on this side but is something cooler

temporarily  your hint that you were getting on with your story and liked it was more than golden intelligence to me in foreign parts the intensity of the heat both in paris and the provinces was such

i know you will reply but as my poor father who was asthmatic too and the jolliest of men used philosophically to say one must have something wrong i suppose and i like to know what it is  in england we are groaning under the brigandage of the butcher which is being carried to that height that i think i foresee resistance on the part of the middleclass and some combination in perspective for abolishing the middleman whensoever he turns up which is everywhere between producer and consumer the cattle plague is the butchers stalkinghorse and it is unquestionably worse than it was but seeing that the great majority of creatures lost or destroyed have been cows and likewise that the rise in butchers meat bears no reasonable proportion to the market prices of the beasts one comes to the conclusion that the public is done the commission has ended very weakly and ineffectually as such things in england rather frequently do and everybody writes to the times and nobody does anything else  if the americans dont embroil us in a war before long it will not be their fault what with their swagger and bombast what with their claims for indemnification what with ireland and fenianism and what with canada i have strong apprehensions with a settled animosity towards the french usurper i believe him to have always been sound in his desire to divide the states against themselves and that we were unsound and wrong in letting i dare not wait upon i would the jamaica insurrection is another hopeful piece of business that platformsympathy with the blackor the native or the devilafar off and that platform indifference to our own countrymen at enormous odds in the midst of bloodshed and savagery makes me stark wild only the other day here was a meeting of jawbones of asses at manchester to censure the jamaica governor for his manner of putting down the insurrection so we are badgered about new zealanders and hottentots as if they were identical with men in clean shirts at camberwell and were to be bound by pen and ink accordingly so exeter hall holds us in mortal submission to missionaries who livingstone always excepted are perfect nuisances and leave every place worse than they found it  of all the many evidences that are visible of our being illgoverned no one is so remarkable to me as our ignorance of what is going on under our government what will future generations think of that enormous indian mutiny being ripened without suspicion until whole regiments arose and killed their officers a week ago red tape halfbouncing and half poohpoohing what it bounced at would have scouted the idea of a dublin jail not being able to hold a political prisoner but for the blacks in jamaica being overimpatient and before their time the whites might have been exterminated without a previous hint or suspicion that there was anything amiss laissez aller and britons never never never  meantime if your honour were in london you would see a great embankment rising high and dry out of the thames on the middlesex shore from westminster bridge to blackfriars a really fine work and really getting on moreover a great system of drainage another really fine work and likewise really getting on lastly a muddle of railways in all directions possible and impossible with no general public scheme no general public supervision enormous waste of money no fixable responsibility no accountability but under lord campbells act i think of that accident in which i was preserved before the most furious and notable train in the fourandtwenty hours the head of a gang of workmen takes up the rails that train changes its time every day as the tide changes and that head workman is not provided by the railway company with any clock or watch lord shaftesbury wrote to me to ask me what i thought of an obligation on railway companies to put strong walls to all bridges and viaducts i told him of course that the force of such a shock would carry away anything that any company could set up and i added ask the minister what he thinks about the votes of the railway interest in the house of commons and about his being afraid to lay a finger on it with an eye to his majority  i seem to be grumbling but i am in the best of humours all goes well with me and mine thank god  last night my gardener came upon a man in the garden and fired the man returned the compliment by kicking him in the groin and causing him great pain i set off with a great mastiffbloodhound i have in pursuit couldnt find the evildoer but had the greatest difficulty in preventing the dog from tearing two policemen down they were coming towards us with professional mystery and he was in the air on his way to the throat of an eminently respectable constable when i caught him  my

views of the sphinx here they are but i have only seen it once and it is so extraordinarily well done that it ought to be observed closely several times  anyone who attentively notices the flower trick will see that the two little high tables hung with drapery cover each a trap each of those tables during that trick hides a confederate who changes the paper cone twice when the cone has been changed as often as is required the trap is closed and the table can be moved  when the curtain is removed for the performance of the sphinx trick there is a covered that is draped table on the stage which is never seen before or afterwards in front of the middle of it and between it and the audience stands one of those little draped tables covering a trap this is a third trap in the centre of the stage the box for the head is then upon it and the conjuror takes it off and shows it the man whose head is afterwards shown in that box is i conceive in the table that is to say is lying on his chest in the thickness of the table in an extremely constrained attitude to get him into the table and to enable him to use the trap in the table through which his head comes into the box the two hands of a confederate are necessary that confederate comes up a trap and stands in the space afforded by the interval below the stage and the height of the little draped table his back is towards the audience the moment he has assisted the hidden man sufficiently he closes the trap and the conjuror then immediately removes the little draped table and also the drapery of the larger table when he places the box on the lastnamed table with the slide on for the head to come into it he stands with his back to the audience and his face to the box and masks the box considerably to facilitate the insertion of the head as soon as he knows the head to be in its place he undraws the slide when the verses have been spoken and the trick is done he loses no time in replacing the slide the curtain is then immediately dropped because the man cannot otherwise be got out of the table and has no doubt had quite enough of it with kindest regards to all at penton

furnished house hired by charles dickens in the spring of this year was in southwick place hyde park  having entered into negotiations with the messrs chappell for a series of readings to be given in london in the english provinces in scotland and ireland charles dickens had no leisure for more than his usual editorial work for all the year round he contributed four parts to the christmas number which was entitled mugby junction  for the future all his english readings were given in connection with the messrs chappell and never in all his career had he more satisfactory or more pleasant business relations than those connected with these gentlemen moreover out of this connection sprang a sincere friendship on both sides  mr dolby is so constantly mentioned in future letters that they themselves will tell of the cordial companionship which existed between charles dickens and this able and most obliging manager  the letter to lily was in answer to a childs letter from miss lily benzon inviting him to a birthday party  the play alluded to in the letter to m fechter was called a long strike and was performed at the lyceum theatre  the sultan mentioned in the letter to mr

never answer your letter unless i answer it at once i got it this morning here goes  i did not dramatise the master of ravenswood though i did a good deal towards and about the piece having an earnest desire to put scott for once upon the stage in his own gallant manner it is an enormous success and increases in attraction nightly i have never seen the people in all parts of the house so leaning forward in lines sloping towards the stage earnestly and intently attractive as while the story gradually unfolds itself but the astonishing circumstance of all is that miss leclercq never thought of for lucy till all other lucies had failed is marvellously good highly pathetic and almost unrecognisable in person what note it touches in her always dumb until now i do not pretend to say but there is no one on the stage who could play the contract scene better or more simply and naturally and i find it impossible to see it without crying almost everyone plays well the whole is exceedingly picturesque and there is scarcely a movement throughout or a look that is not indicated by scott so you get a life romance with beautiful illustrations and i do not expect ever again to see a book take up its bed and walk in like manner  i am charmed to learn that you have had a freeze out of my ghost story it rather did give me a shiver up the back in the writing dr marigold has just now

patient tone however and the hopefulness and forbearance of fergusons course gives us some reassurance apropos of which latter reference i dined with ferguson at the lord mayors last tuesday and had a grimly distracted impulse upon me to defy the toastmaster and rush into a speech about him and his noble art when i sat pining under the imbecility of constitutional and corporational idiots i did seize him for a moment by the hair of his head in proposing the lady mayoress and derived some faint consolation from the companys response to the reference o no man will ever know under what provocation to contradiction and a savage yell of repudiation i suffered at the hands of  feebly complacent in the uniform of madame tussauds own military waxers and almost the worst speaker i ever

concerning childhood  let me tell you now that i have not in the least cooled after all either as to the graceful sympathetic book or as to the part in it with which i am honoured it has become a matter of real feeling with me and i postponed its expression because i couldnt satisfactorily get it out of myself and at last i came to the conclusion that it must be left in

wednesday evening and was extremely glad to get it  frank beard wrote me word that with such a pulse as i described an examination of the heart was absolutely necessary and that i had better make an appointment with him alone for the purpose this i did i was not at all disconcerted for i knew well beforehand that the effect could not possibly be without that one cause at the bottom of it there seems to be degeneration of some functions of the heart it does not contract as it should so i have got a prescription of iron quinine and digitalis to set it agoing and send the blood more quickly through the system if it should not seem to succeed on a reasonable trial i will then propose a consultation with someone else of course i am not so foolish as to suppose that all my work can have been achieved without some penalty and i have noticed for some time a decided change in my buoyancy and hopefulnessin other words in my usual tone  i shall wait to see beard again on monday and shall

                                  tuesday feb 20th 1866  my dear mrs brookfield  having gone through your ms which i should have done sooner but that i have not been very well i write these few following words about it firstly with a limited reference to its unsuitability to these pages secondly with a more enlarged reference to the merits of the story itself  if you will take any part of it and cut it up in fancy into the small portions into which it would have to be divided here for only a months supply you will i think at once discover the impossibility of publishing it in weekly parts the scheme of the chapters the manner of introducing the people the progress of the interest the places in which the principal places fall are all hopelessly against it it would seem as though the story were never coming and hardly ever moving there must be a special design to overcome that specially trying mode of publication and i cannot better express the difficulty and labour of it than by asking you to turn over any two weekly numbers of a tale of two cities or great expectations or bulwers story or wilkie collinss or reades or at the bar and notice how patiently and expressly the thing has to be planned for presentation in these fragments and yet for afterwards fusing together as an uninterrupted whole  of the story itself i honestly say that i think highly the style is particularly easy and agreeable infinitely above ordinary writing and sometimes reminds me of mrs inchbald at her best the characters are remarkably well observed and with a rare mixture of delicacy and truthfulness i observe this particularly in the brother and sister and in mrs neville but it strikes me that you constantly hurry your narrative and yet without getting on by telling it in a sort of impetuous breathless way in your own person when the people should tell it and act it for themselves my notion always is that when i have made the people to play out the play it is as it were their business to do it and not mine then unless you really have led up to a great situation like basils death you are bound in art to make more of it such a scene should form a chapter of itself impressed upon the readers memory it would go far to make the fortune of the book suppose yourself telling that affecting incident in a letter to a friend wouldnt you describe how you went through the life and stir of the streets and roads to the sickroom wouldnt you say what kind of room it was what time of day it was whether it was sunlight starlight or moonlight wouldnt you have a strong impression on your mind of how you were received when you first met the look of the dying man what strange contrasts were about you and struck you i dont want you in a novel to present yourself to tell such things but i want the things to be there you make no more of the situation than the index might or a descriptive playbill might in giving a summary of the tragedy under representation  as a mere piece of mechanical workmanship i think all your chapters should be shorter that is to say that they should be subdivided also when you change from narrative to dialogue or vice versâ you should make the transition more carefully also taking the pains to sit down and recall the principal landmarks in your story you should then make them far more elaborate and conspicuous than the rest even with these changes i do not believe that the story would attract the attention due to it if it were published even in such monthly portions as the space of fraser would admit of even so brightened it would not to the best of my judgment express itself piecemeal it seems to me to be so constituted as to require to be read off the reel as a book in two volumes i think it would have good claims to success and good chances of obtaining success but i suppose the polishing i have hinted at not a meretricious adornment but positively necessary to good work and good art to have been first thoroughly administered  now dont hate me if you can help it i can afford to be hated by some people but i am not rich enough to put you in possession of that luxury

papers this morning showing to my satisfaction  that they really had through the local agent some cause of complaint nevertheless the shilling tickets are sold for tomorrow and it seems to be out of the question to take any money at the doors the call for all parts is so enormous the thundering of applause last night was quite staggering and my people checked off my reception by the minute hand of a watch and stared at one another thinking i should never begin i keep quite well have happily taken to sleeping these last three nights and feel all things considered very little conscious of

remarkably intelligent and the reading went brilliantly i have not sent up any newspapers as they are generally so poorly written that you may know beforehand all the commonplaces that they will write

and a double staff everywhere did the rest and nothing could be bettertempered or more orderly tremendous enthusiasm with the carol and trial i was dead beat afterwards that reading being twenty minutes longer than usual but plucked up again had some supper slept well and am quite right today it is a bright day and the express ride over from glasgow was very pleasant  everything is gone here for tonight but it is difficult to describe what the readings have grown to be the let at st jamess hall is not only immense for next tuesday but so large for the next reading afterwards that chappell

a letter from glasgow saying your little emily has been wood and married and a since you last saw her and describing her house within a mile or two of the city and asking me to stay there i wrote the usual refusal and supposed mrs  to be some romantic girl whom i had joked with perhaps at allisons or where not on the first night at glasgow i received a bouquet from  and wore one of the flowers

poor travellers meant the kind of man to which it refers chaucer certainly meant the pardonere to be a humbug living on the credulity of the people after describing the sham reliques he carried he says          but with these relikes whawne that he found         a poure personne dwelling up on lond         upon a day he gat him more monnie         than that the personne got in monthes time

and i have since read it twice  i clearly see the ground of mr boucicaults two objections but i do not see their force  first as to the writing if the characters did not speak in a terse and homely way their idea and language would be inconsistent with their dress and station and they would lose as characters before the audience the dialogue seems to be exactly what is wanted its simplicity particularly in mr boucicaults part is often very effective and throughout there is an honest straighttothepurpose ruggedness in it like the real life and the real people  secondly as to the absence of the comic element i really do not see how more of it could be got into the story and i think mr boucicault underrates the pleasant effect of his own part the very notion of a sailor whose life is not among those little courts and streets and whose business does not lie with the monotonous machinery but with the four wild winds is a relief to me in reading the play i am quite confident of its being an immense relief to the audience when they see the sailor before them with an entirely different bearing action dress complexion even from the rest of the men i would make him the freshest and airiest sailor that ever was seen and through him i can distinctly see my way out of the black country into clearer air i speak as one of the audience mind i should like something of this contrast to be expressed in the dialogue between the sailor and jew in the second scene of the second act again i feel widdicombs part which is charming and ought to make the whole house cry most agreeable and welcome much better than any amount in such a story of mere comicality  it is unnecessary to say that the play is done with a masters hand its closeness and movement are quite surprising its construction is admirable i have the strongest belief in its making a great success but i must add this proviso i never saw a play so dangerously depending in critical places on strict natural propriety in the manner and perfection in the shaping of the small parts those small parts cannot take the play up but they can let it down i would not leave a hair on the head of one of them to the chance of the first night but i would see to the minutest particular the makeup of every one of them at a night rehearsal  of course you are free to show this note to mr boucicault and i suppose you will do so let me throw out this suggestion to him and you might it not ease the way with the lord chamberlains office and still more with the audience when there are manchester champions in it if instead of manchester you used a fictitious name when i did hard times i called the scene coketown everybody knew what was meant but every cottonspinning town said it was the other cottonspinning town

subjects as i am of the ariosto enquiry which should be highly interesting but if you have so got the matter in your mind as that its execution would be incomplete and unsatisfactory to you unless you write all the three papers then by all means write the three and i will most gladly take them for some years i have had so much pleasure in reading you that i can honestly warrant myself as what actors call a good audience  the idea of old stories retold is decidedly a good one i greatly like the notion of that series of course you know de quinceys paper on the ratcliffe highway murderer do you know also the illustration i have it at gads hill representing the horrible creature as his dead body lay on a cart with a piece of wood for a pillow and a stake lying by ready to be driven through him  i dont quite like the title the social history of london i should better like some title to the effect the history of londons social changes in so many years such a title would promise more and better express your intention what do you think of taking for a first title londons changes you could then add the second title being a history etc  i dont at all desire to fix a limit to the series of old stories retold i would state the general intention at the beginning of the first paper and go on like banquos line  dont let your london title remind people by so much as the place of the word civilisation of buckle it seems a ridiculous caution but the indolent part of the public a large part on such points tumble into extraordinary mistakes

knowledge of their being in embryo really i do not see a chance of my settling myself to such work until after i have accomplished fortytwo readings to which i stand pledged  i hope to begin this

in  your mention of the late sultan touches me nearly he was the finest dog i ever saw and between him and me there was a perfect understanding but to adopt the popular phrase it was so very confidential that it went no further he would fly at anybody else with the greatest enthusiasm for destruction i saw him muzzled pound into the heart of a regiment of the line and i have frequently seen him muzzled hold a great dog down with his chest and feet he has broken loose muzzled and come home covered with blood again and again and yet he never disobeyed me unless he had first laid hold of a dog  you heard of his going to execution evidently supposing the procession to be a party detached in pursuit of something to kill or eat it was very affecting and also of his bolting a blueeyed kitten and making me acquainted with the circumstance by his agonies of remorse or indigestion  i cannot find out that there is anyone in rochester a sleepy old city who has anything to tell about garrick except what is not true his brother the wine merchant would be more in rochester way i think how on earth do you find time to do all these books  you make my hair stand on end an agreeable

leaving every flag on a six hundred yards course as neat as they found it when the gates were opened at ten in the morning surely this is a bright sign in the neighbourhood of such a place as chatham

been ill of low nervous fever was brought here yesterday from london she bore the journey much better than i expected and so i hope will soon recover this is my little stock of news  i begin to discover in your riper years that you have been secretly vain of your handwriting all your life for i swear i see no change in it what it always was since i first knew it a year or two it is this i

and continued until the end of march charles dickens took no house in london this spring he came to his office quarters at intervals for the series in town usually starting off again on his country tour the day after a london reading from some passages in his letters to his daughter and sisterinlaw during this country course it will be seen that though he made very light of the fact the great exertion of the readings combined with incessant railway travelling was beginning to tell upon his health and he was frequently heavily beaten after reading at his best to an enthusiastic audience in a large hall  during the short intervals between his journeys he was as constantly and carefully at work upon the business of all the year round as if he had no other work on hand a proof of this is given in a letter dated 5th february it is written to a young man the son of a friend who wrote a long novel when far too juvenile for such a task and had submitted it to charles dickens for his opinion with a view to publication in the midst of his own hard and engrossing occupation he read the book and the letter which he wrote on the subject needs no remark beyond this that the young writer received the adverse criticism with the best possible sense and has since in his literary profession profited by the advice so kindly given  at this time the proposals to charles dickens for reading in america which had been perpetually renewed from the time of his first abandoning the idea became so urgent and so tempting that he found at last he must at all events give the subject his most serious consideration he took counsel with his two most confidential friends and advisers mr john forster and mr w h wills they were both at first strongly opposed to the undertaking chiefly on the ground of the trial to his health and strength which it would involve but they could not deny the counterbalancing advantages and after much deliberation it was resolved that mr george dolby should be sent out by the messrs chappell to take an impression on the spot as to the feeling of the united states about the readings his report as to the undoubted enthusiasm and urgency on the other side of the atlantic it was impossible to resist even his friends withdrew their opposition though still with misgivings as to the effect upon his health which were but too well founded and on the 30th september he telegraphed yes to america  the alfred alluded to in a letter from glasgow was charles dickenss fourth son alfred tennyson who had gone to australia two years previously  we give in april the last letter to one of the friends for whom charles dickens had always a most tender lovemr stanfield he was then in failing health and in may he died  another death which affected him very deeply happened this summer miss marguerite power died in july she had long been very ill but until it became impossible for her to travel she was a frequent and beloved guest at gads hill the mrs henderson to whom he writes was miss powers youngest sister  before he started for america it was proposed to wish him godspeed by giving him a public dinner at the freemasons hall the proposal was most warmly and fully responded to his zealous friend mr charles kent willingly undertook the whole work of arrangement of this banquet it took place on the 2nd november and lord lytton presided  on the 8th he left london for liverpool accompanied by his daughters his sisterinlaw his eldest son mr arthur chappell mr charles collins mr wilkie collins mr kent and mr wills the next morning the whole party took a final leave of charles dickens on board the cuba which sailed that day  we give a letter which he wrote to mr j l toole on the morning of the dinner thanking him for a parting gift and an earnest letter that excellent comedian was one of his most appreciative admirers and in return he had for mr toole the greatest admiration and respect  the christmas number for this year no thoroughfare was written by charles dickens and mr wilkie collins it was dramatised by mr collins chiefly but in the midst of all the work of preparation for departure charles dickens gave minute

be beforehand with the middle of next summer your penitent friend and remorseful correspondent thus addresses you  the big dog on a day last autumn having seized a little girl sister to one of the servants whom he knew and was bound to respect was flogged by his master and then sentenced to be shot at seven next morning he went out very cheerfully with the halfdozen men told off for the purpose evidently thinking that they were going to be the death of somebody unknown but observing in the procession an empty wheelbarrow and a doublebarrelled gun he became meditative and fixed the bearer of the gun with his eyes a stone deftly thrown across him by the village blackguard chief mourner caused him to look round for an instant and he then fell dead shot through the heart two posthumous children are at this moment rolling on the lawn one will evidently inherit his ferocity and will probably inherit the gun the pheasant was a little ailing towards christmas day and was found dead

working hard getting up barbox and the boy at mugby with which i begin a new series of readings in london on the fifteenth next morning i believe i start into the country when i read i dont write i only edit and have the proofsheets sent me for the purpose here are your questions answered  as to the reform question it should have been and could have been perfectly known to any honest man in england that the more intelligent part of the great masses were deeply dissatisfied with the state of representation but were in a very moderate and patient condition awaiting the better intellectual cultivation of numbers of their fellows the old insolent resource of assailing them and making the most audaciously wicked statements that they are politically indifferent has borne the inevitable fruit the perpetual taunt where are they has called them out with the answer well then if you must know here we are the intolerable injustice of vituperating the bribed to an assembly of bribers has goaded their sense of justice beyond endurance and now what they would have taken they wont take and whatever they are steadily bent upon having they will get rely upon it this is the real state of the case as to your friend punch you will find him begin to turn at the very selfsame instant when the new game shall manifestly become the losing one you may notice his shoes pinching him a little already  my dear fellow i have no more power to stop that mutilation of my books than you have it is as certain as that every inventor of anything designed for the public good and offered to the english government becomes ipso facto a criminal to have his heart broken on the circumlocutional wheel it is as certain as that the whole crimean story will be retold whenever this country again goes to war and to tell the truth i have such a very small opinion of what the great genteel have done for us that i am very philosophical indeed concerning what the great vulgar may do having a decided opinion that they cant do worse  this is the time of year when the theatres do best there being still numbers of people who make it a sort of religion to see christmas pantomimes having my annual houseful i have as yet seen nothing fechter has neither pantomime nor burlesque but is doing a new version of the old trente ans de la vie dun joueur i am afraid he will not find his account in it on the whole the theatres except in the articles of scenery and pictorial effect are poor enough but in some of the smaller houses there are actors who if there were any dramatic headquarters as a school might become very good the most hopeless feature is that they have the smallest possible idea of an effective and harmonious whole each going in for himself or herself the musichalls attract an immense public and dont refine the general taste but such things as they do are well done of their kind and always briskly and punctually  the american yacht race is the last sensation i hope the general interest felt in it on this side will have a wholesome interest on that it will be a woeful day when john and jonathan throw their caps into the ring the french emperor is indubitably in a

myself  the readings have produced such an immense effect here that we are coming back for two more in the middle of february marigold and the trial on friday night and the carol on saturday afternoon were a perfect furore and the surprise about barbox has been amusingly great it is a most extraordinary thing after the enormous sale of that christmas number that the provincial public seems to have combined to believe that it wont make a reading from wolverhampton and leeds we have exactly the same expression of feelings beforehand exactly as i made copperfieldalways to the poorest houses i had with headland and against that luminarys entreatyso i should have to make this if i hadnt marigold always in demand  it being next to impossible for people to come out at night with horses we have felt the weather in the stalls and expect to do so through this week the halfcrown and shilling publics have crushed to their places most splendidly the enthusiasm has been unbounded on friday night i quite astonished myself but i was taken so faint afterwards that they laid me on a sofa at the hall for half an hour i attribute it to my distressing inability to sleep at night and to nothing worse  scott does very well indeed as a dresser he is perfect in a quarter of an hour after i go into the retiringroom where all my clothes are airing and everything is set out neatly in its own allotted space i am ready and he then goes softly out and sits outside the door in the morning he is equally punctual quiet and quick he has his needles and thread buttons and so forth always at hand and in travelling he is very systematic with the luggage what with dolby and what with this skilful valet everything is made as easy to me as it possibly can be and dolby would do anything to lighten the work and does everything  there is great distress here among the poor four thousand people relieved last saturday at one workhouse and there is great anxiety concerning seven mailsteamers some days

know that a hundred and twenty stalls have made up their minds to the undertaking of getting to the hall this seems to be a very nice hotel but it is an extraordinarily cold one our reading for

only a ride of forty minutes and it was as much as i could do to hold out the journey but i was not faint as at liverpool i was only exhausted i am all right this morning and tonight as you know i

saw it and the gasman and dolby saw it and stood at that side of the platform in agonies we all three calculated that there would be just time to finish and save it when the gas was turned out the

your novel and have pursued the more difficult points of the story through the other two volumes  you will of course receive my opinion as that of an individual writer and student of art who by no means claims to be infallible  i think you are too ambitious and that you have not sufficient knowledge of life or character to venture on so comprehensive an attempt evidences of inexperience in every way and of your power being far below the situations that you imagine present themselves to me in almost every page i have read it would greatly surprise me if you found a publisher for this story on trying your fortune in that line or derived anything from it but weariness and bitterness of spirit  on the evidence thus put before me i cannot even entirely satisfy myself that you have the faculty of authorship latent within you if you have not and yet pursue a vocation towards which you have no call you cannot choose but be a wretched man let me counsel you to have the patience to form yourself carefully and the courage to renounce the endeavour if you cannot establish your case on a very much smaller scale you see around you every day how many outlets there are for short pieces of fiction in all kinds try if you can achieve any success within these modest limits i have practised in my time what i preach to you and in the meantime put your three volumes away

on the sands at new brighton all the morning i am not quite right but believe it to be an effect of the railway shaking there is no doubt of the fact that after the staplehurst experience it tells more and more instead of as one might have expected less and less  the charming room here greatly lessens the fatigue of this fatiguing week i read last night with no more exertion than if i had been

splendid spectacle they cheered to that extent after it was over that i was obliged to huddle on my clothes for i was undressing to prepare for the journey and go back again  after so heavy a week it was rather stiff to start on this long journey at a quarter to two in the morning but i got more sleep than i ever got in a railwaycarriage before and it really was not tedious the travelling was admirable and a wonderful contrast to my friend the midland  i am not by any means knocked up though i have as i had in the last series of readings a curious feeling of soreness all round the body which i suppose to arise from the great exertion of voice it is a mercy that we were not both made really ill at liverpool on friday morning i was taken so faint and sick that i was obliged to leave the table on the same afternoon the same thing happened to dolby we then found that a part of the hotel close to us was dismantled for painting and that they were at that moment painting a green passage leading to our rooms with a most horrible mixture of white lead and arsenic on pursuing the enquiry i found that the four lady bookkeepers in the bar were all suffering from the poison

atmosphere is so very heavy that yesterday we escaped to tynemouth for a two hours sea walk there was a high north wind blowing and a magnificent sea running large vessels were being towed in and out over the stormy bar with prodigious waves breaking on it and spanning the restless uproar of the waters was a quiet rainbow of transcendent beauty the scene was quite wonderful we were in the full enjoyment of it when a heavy sea caught us knocked us over and in a moment drenched us and filled even our pockets we had nothing for it but to shake ourselves together like doctor marigold and dry ourselves as well as we could by hard walking in the wind and sunshine but we were wet through for all that when we came back here to dinner after half an hours railway ride  i am wonderfully well and

prevails here this hotel is constantly filling and emptying as families leave the country and set in a current to the steamers there is apprehension of some disturbance between tomorrow night and monday night both inclusive and i learn this morning that all the drinkingshops are to be closed from tonight until tuesday it is rumoured here that the liverpool people are very uneasy about some apprehended disturbance there at the same time very likely you will know more about this than i do and very likely it may be nothing there is no doubt whatever that alarm prevails and the manager of

as need be but we did very well last night after all  there is considerable alarm here beyond all question and great depression in all kinds of trade and commerce tomorrow being st patricks day there are apprehensions of some disturbance and croakers predict that it will come off between tonight and monday night of course there are preparations on all sides and large musters of soldiers and police though they are kept carefully out of sight one would not suppose walking about the streets that any disturbance was impending and yet there is no doubt that the materials of one lie smouldering up

quite sure that your venerable parent will take good care of himself if any riot were to break out i should immediately stop the readings here should all remain quiet i begin to think they will be

critical time but in view of the enormous preparations i should say that the chances are at least one hundred to one against any disturbance  i cannot make sure whether i wrote to you yesterday and told you that we had done very well at the first reading after all even in money the reception was prodigious and the readings are the town talk but i rather think i did actually write this to you my doubt on the subject arises from my having deliberated about writing on a saturday  the most curious and for facilities of mere destruction such as firing houses in different quarters the most

monday april 1st 1867  my dear thornbury  i am very doubtful indeed about vaux and have kept it out of the number in consequence the mere details of such a rascals proceedings whether recorded by himself or set down by the reverend ordinary are not wholesome for a large audience and are scarcely justifiable i think as claiming to be a piece of literature i can understand barrington to be a good subject as involving the representation of a period a style of manners an order of dress certain habits of street life assemblyroom life and coffeeroom life etc but there is a very broad distinction between this and mere newgate calendar the latter would assuredly damage your book and be protested against to me i have a conviction of it founded on constant observation and experience here  your kind invitation is extremely welcome and acceptable to me but i am sorry to add that i must not go avisiting for this reason so incessantly have i been reading that i have not once been at home at gads hill since last january and am little likely to get there before the middle of may judge how the masters eye must be kept on the place when it does at length get a look at it after so long an absence i hope you will descry in this a reason for coming to me again instead of my coming to you  the extinct prizefighters as a body i take to be a good subject for much the same reason as george barrington their patrons were a class of men now extinct too and the whole ring of those days not to mention jacksons rooms in bond street is a piece of social history now vaux is not nor is he

hope you have not thought me unmindful of you in the meanwhile i have been almost constantly travelling and reading england ireland and scotland have laid hold of me by turns and i have had no rest as soon as i had finished this kind of work last year i had to fall to work upon all the year round and the christmas number i was no sooner quit of that task and the christmas season was but run out to its last day when i was tempted into another course of fifty readings that are not yet over i am here now for two days and have not seen the place since twelfth night when a reading in london has been done i have been brought up for it from some great distance and have next morning been carried back again but the fifty will be paid out as we say at sea by the middle of may and then i hope to see you  reading at cheltenham the other day i saw macready who sent his love to you his face was much more massive and as it used to be than when i saw him previous to his illness his wife takes admirable care of him and is on the happiest terms with his daughter katie his boy by the second marriage is a jolly little fellow and leads a far easier life than the children you and i remember who used to come in at dessert and have each a biscuit and a glass of water in which last refreshment i was always convinced that they drank with the gloomiest malignity destruction to the gormandising grownup company  i hope to look up your latest triumphs on the day of the academy dinner of course as yet i have had no opportunity of even hearing of what anyone has done i have been in a general way snowed up for four months the locomotive with which i was going to ireland was dug out of the snow at midnight in wales both passages across were made in a furious snowstorm the snow lay ankledeep in dublin and froze hard at belfast in scotland it slanted before a perpetual east wind in yorkshire it derived novelty from thunder and lightning whirlwinds everywhere i dont mention  god bless you and

as if she were sailing direct for heaven i was so enchanted by the scene that i became oblivious of a few thousand tons of water coming on in an enormous roller and was knocked down and beaten by its

i appreciate the affection and regard in which it originates i thank you for it with all my heart  you will not suppose that i make light of any of your misgivings if i present the other side of the question every objection that you make strongly impresses me and will be revolved in my mind again and again  when i went to america in 42 i was so much younger but i think very much weaker too i had had a painful surgical operation performed shortly before going out and had had the labour from week to week of master humphreys clock my life in the states was a life of continual speechmaking quite as laborious as reading and i was less patient and more irritable then than i am now my idea of a course of readings in america is that it would involve far less travelling than you suppose that the large firstclass rooms would absorb the whole course and that the receipts would be very much larger than your estimate unless the demand for the readings is enormously exaggerated on all hands there is considerable reason for this view of the case and i can hardly think that all the speculators who beset and all the private correspondents who urge me are in a conspiracy or under a common delusion                                       i shall never rest much while my faculties last and if i know myself have a certain something in me that would still be active in rusting and corroding me if i flattered myself that i was in repose on the other hand i think that my habit of easy selfabstraction and withdrawal into fancies has always refreshed and strengthened me in short intervals wonderfully i always seem to myself to have rested far more than i have worked and i do really believe that i have some exceptional faculty of accumulating young feelings in short pauses which obliterates a quantity of wear and tear  my worldly circumstances such a large family considered are very good i dont want money all my possessions are free and in the best order still at fiftyfive or fiftysix the likelihood of making a very great addition to ones capital in half a year is an immense consideration i repeat the phrase because there should be something large to set against the objections  i dine with forster today to talk it over i have no doubt he will urge most of your objections and particularly the last though american friends and correspondents he has have undoubtedly staggered him more than i ever knew him to be staggered on the money question be assured that no one can present any argument to me which will weigh more heartily with me than your kind words and that

story this morning and have gone minutely through the plot of the rest to the last line it gives a series of narratives but it is a very curious story wild and yet domestic with excellent character in it and great mystery it is prepared with extraordinary care and has every chance of being a hit it is in many respects much better than anything he has done the question is how shall we fill up the blank between mabels progress and wilkie what do you think of proposing to fitzgerald to do a story three months long i daresay he has some unfinished or projected something by him  i have an impression that it was not silvester who tried eliza fenning but knowles one can hardly suppose thornbury to make such a mistake but i wish you would look into the annual register i have added a final paragraph about the unfairness of the judge whoever he was i distinctly recollect to have read of his putting down of eliza fennings father when the old man made some miserable suggestion in his daughters behalf this is not noticed by thornbury and he also stopped some suggestion that a knife thrust into a loaf adulterated with alum would present the appearance that these knives presented but i may have got both these points from looking up some pamphlets in upcotts collection which i once had  your account of your journey reminds me of one of the latest american stories how a traveller by

left foot and consequently am here under difficulties my foot is occasionally painful but not very i dont think it worth while consulting anybody about it as yet i make out so many reasons against supposing it to be gouty that i really do not think it is  dolby begs me to send all manner of apologetic messages for his going to america he is very cheerful and hopeful but evidently feels the separation from his wife and child very much his sister17 was at euston square this morning looking very well sainton too very light and jovial  with the view of keeping myself and my foot quiet i

discovery burst upon me on friday though unlike you i never could believe in  solely i think because often as i have tried him i never found him standing by my desk when i was writing a letter without trying to read it  i fear there is no doubt that since s discharge he  has stolen money at the readings a case of an abstracted shilling seems to have been clearly brought home to him by chappells people and they know very well what that means i supposed a very clear keeping off from annes husband whom i recommended for employment to chappell to have been referable only to  but now i see how hopeless and unjust it would be to expect belief from him with two such cases within his knowledge  but dont let the thing spoil your holiday if we try to do our duty by people we employ by exacting their proper service from them on the one hand and treating them with all possible consistency gentleness and consideration on the other we know that we do right their doing wrong cannot change our doing right and that should be enough for us  so i have given my feathers a shake and am all right again give your feathers a shake and take a cheery flutter into the air of hertfordshire  great reports from dolby and also from fields but i keep myself quite calm and hold my decision in abeyance until i shall have book chapter and verse before me dolby hoped he could leave uncle sam on the 11th of this month  sydney has passed as a lieutenant and appeared at home yesterday all of a sudden with the consequent golden garniture on his sleeve which i god forgive me stared at without the least idea that it meant promotion  i am glad you see a certain unlikeness to anything in the american story upon myself it has made the strangest impression of reality and originality and i feel as if i had read something by somebody else which i should never get out of my mind the main idea of the narrators position towards the other people was the idea that i had for my next novel in a y r but it is very curious that i did not in the least see how to begin his state of mind until i walked into hoghton towers one bright april day with dolby

fortune thy bright image etc etc  the last figure has been again and again quoted is identified with the play is fine in itself and above all i know that lytton would not let it go in writing to him today fully explaining the changes in detail and saying that i disapprove of nothing else i have told him that i notice this change and that i immediately let you know that it must not be made  there

me there is nothing that so breaks down my determination or shows me what an iron force i put upon myself and how weak it is as a touch of true affection from a tried friend  all that you so earnestly say about the goodwill and devotion of all engaged i perceived and deeply felt last night it moved me even more than the demonstration itself though i do suppose it was the most brilliant ever seen when i got up to speak but for taking a desperate hold of myself i should have lost my sight and voice and sat down again  god bless you my dear fellow i am ever and ever

are instructed from their tenderest months only to know me as wenerables which they sincerely believe to be my name and a kind of title that i have received from a grateful country  alas i cannot have

                                 sunday nov 10th 1867  my dearest mamie  we arrived here at seven this morning and shall probably remain awaiting our mail until four or five this afternoon the weather in the passage here was delightful and we had scarcely any motion beyond that of the screw  we are nearly but not quite full of passengers at table i sit next the captain on his right on the outside of the table and close to the door my little cabin is big enough for everything but getting up in and going to bed in as it has a good window which i can leave open all night and a door which i can set open too it suits my chief requirements of itplenty of airadmirably on a writingslab in it which pulls out when wanted i now write in a majestic manner  many of the passengers are american and i am already on the best terms with nearly all the ship  we began our voyage yesterday a very little while after you left us which was a great relief the wind is se this morning and if it would keep so we should go along nobly my dearest love to your aunt and also to katie and all the rest i am in very good health thank god and as well as possible   sidenote miss hogarth

ship will let me  we are very nearly halfway today the weather was favourable for us until yesterday morning when we got a headwind which still stands by us we have rolled and pitched of course but on the whole have been wonderfully well off i have had headache and have felt faint once or twice but have not been sick at all my spacious cabin is very noisy at night as the most important working of the ship goes on outside my window and over my head but it is very airy and if the weather be bad and i cant open the window i can open the door all night if the weather be fine as it is now i can open both door and window and write between them last night i got a footbath under the dignified circumstances of sitting on a campstool in my cabin and having the bath and my feet in the passage outside the officers quarters are close to me and as i know them all i get reports of the weather and the way we are making when the watch is changed and i am as i usually am lying awake the motion of the screw is at its slightest vibration in my particular part of the ship the silent captain reported gruff is a very good fellow and an honest fellow kelly has been ill all the time and not of the slightest use and is ill now scott always cheerful and useful and ready a better servant for the kind of work there never can have been young lowndes has been fearfully sick until midday yesterday his cabin is pitch dark and full of blackbeetles he shares mine until nine oclock at night when scott carries him off to bed he also dines with me in my magnificent chamber this passage in winter time cannot be said to be an enjoyable excursion but i certainly am making it under the best circumstances i find dolby to have been enormously popular on board and to have known everybody and gone everywhere  so much for my news except that i have been constantly reading and find that pierra that mrs hogge sent me by katie to be a very remarkable book not only for its grim and horrible story but for its suggestion of wheels within wheels and sad human mysteries bakers second book not nearly so good as his first but his first anticipated it  we hope to get to halifax either on sunday or monday and to boston either on tuesday or wednesday the glass is rising high today and everybody on board is hopeful of an easterly wind   sidenote miss hogarth                                                       saturday 16th  last thursday afternoon a heavy gale of wind sprang up and blew hard until dark when it seemed to lull but it then came on again with great violence and blew tremendously all night the noise and the rolling and plunging of the ship were awful nobody on board could get any sleep and numbers of passengers were rolled out of their berths having a sideboard to mine to keep me in like a baby i lay still but it was a dismal night indeed and it was curious to see the change it had made in the faces of all the passengers yesterday it cannot be denied that these winter crossings are very trying and startling while the personal discomfort of not being able to wash and the miseries of getting up and going to bed with what small means there are all sliding and sloping and slopping about are really in their way distressing  this forenoon we made cape race and are now running along at full speed with the land beside us kelly still useless and positively declining to show on deck scott with an eightdayold moustache more super like than ever my foot i hope from walking on the boarded deck in a very shy condition today and rather painful i shaved this morning for the first time since liverpool dodging at the glass very much like fechters imitation of  the white cat that came off with us in the tender a general favourite she belongs to the daughter of a southerner returning with his wife and family from a twoyears tour in europe                                                          sunday 17th  at four oclock this morning we got into bad weather again and the state of things at breakfasttime was unutterably miserable nearly all the passengers in their berthsno possibility of standing on decksickness and groansimpracticable to pass a cup of tea from one pair of hands to another it has slightly moderated since between two and three in the afternoon i write and the sun is shining but the rolling of the ship surpasses all imagination or description  we expect to be at halifax about an hour after midnight and this letter shall be posted there to make certain of catching the return mail on wednesday boston is only thirty hours from halifax  best love to mamie and to katie and charley i know you will report me and my love to forster and mrs forster i write with great difficulty wedged up in a corner and having my heels on the paper as often as the pen kelly worse than ever and scott better than ever  my desk and i have just arisen from the floor   sidenote miss dickens                      parker house boston thursday nov 21st 1867  i arrived here on tuesday night after a very slow passage from halifax against headwinds all the tickets for the first four readings here all yet announced were sold immediately on their being issued  you know that i begin on the 2nd of december with carol and trial shall be heartily glad to begin to count the readings off  this is an immense hotel with all manner of white marble public passages and public rooms i live in a corner high up and have a hot and cold bath in my bedroom communicating with the sittingroom and comforts not in existence when i was here before the cost of living is enormous but happily we can afford it i dine today with longfellow emerson holmes and agassiz longfellow was here yesterday perfectly white in hair and beard but a remarkably handsome and notablelooking man the city has increased enormously in fiveandtwenty years it has grown more mercantileis like leeds mixed with preston and flavoured with new brighton but for smoke and fog you substitute an exquisitely bright light air i found my rooms beautifully decorated by mrs fields with choice flowers and set off by a number of good books i am not much persecuted by people in general as dolby has happily made up his mind that the less i am exhibited for nothing the better so our men sit outside the room door and wrestle with mankind  we had speechmaking and singing in the saloon of the cuba after the last dinner of the voyage i think i have acquired a higher reputation from drawing out the captain and getting him to take the second in alls well and likewise in theres not in the wide world your parent taking first than from anything previously known of me on these shores i hope the effect of these achievements may not dim the lustre of the readings we also sang with a chicago lady and a strongminded woman from i dont know where auld lang syne with a tender melancholy expressive of having all four been united from our cradles the more dismal we were the more delighted the company were once when we paddled i the burn the captain took a little cruise round the compass on his own account touching at the canadian boat song and taking in supplies at jubilate seas between us braid ha roared and roared like the seas themselves finally i proposed the ladies in a speech that convulsed the stewards and we closed with a brilliant success but when you dine with mr forster ask him to read to you how we got on at church in a heavy sea hillard has just been in and sent his love to those dear girls he has grown much older he is now district attorney of the state of massachusetts which is a very good office best love to your aunt and katie and charley and all his house and all friends   sidenote miss hogarth                        parker house boston monday nov 25th 1867  i cannot remember to whom i wrote last but it will not much matter if i make a mistake this being generally to report myself so well that i am constantly chafing at not having begun tonight instead of this night week  the tickets being all sold for next week and no other announcement being yet made there is nothing new in that way to tell of dolby is over at new york where we are at our wits end how to keep tickets out of the hands of speculators morgan is staying with me came yesterday to breakfast and goes home tomorrow fields and mrs fields also dined yesterday she is a very nice woman with a rare relish for humour and a most contagious laugh the bostonians having been duly informed that i wish to be quiet really leave me as much so as i should be in manchester or liverpool this i cannot expect to last elsewhere but it is a most welcome relief here as i have all the readings to get up the people are perfectly kind and perfectly agreeable if i stop to look in at a shopwindow a score of passersby stop and after i begin to read i cannot expect in the natural course of things to get off so easily but i every day take from seven to ten miles in peace  communications about readings incessantly come in from all parts of the country we take no offer whatever lying by with our plans until after the first series in new york and designing if we make a furore there to travel as little as possible i fear i shall have to take canada at the end of the whole tour they make such strong representations from montreal and toronto and from nova scotiarepresented by st johns and halifaxof the slight it would be to them if i wound up with the states that i am shaken  it is sad to see longfellows house the house in which his wife was burnt with his young daughters in it and the shadow of that terrible story the young undergraduates of cambridge he is a professor there have made a representation to him that they are five hundred strong and cannot get one ticket i dont know what is to be done for them i suppose i must read there somehow we are all in the clouds until i shall have broken ground in new york as to where readings will be possible and where impossible  agassiz is one of the most natural and jovial of men i go out avisiting as little as i can but still have to dine and what is worse sup pretty often socially i am as i was here before wonderfully reminded of edinburgh when i had many friends in it  your account and mamies of the return journey to london gave me great pleasure i was delighted with your report of wilkie and not surprised by chappells coming out gallantly  my anxiety to get to work is greater than i can express because time seems to be making no movement towards home until i shall be reading hard then i shall begin to count and count and count the upward steps to may  if ever you should be in a position to advise a traveller going on a sea voyage remember that there is some mysterious service done to the bilious system when it is shaken by baked apples noticing that they were produced on board the cuba every day at lunch and dinner i thought i would make the experiment of always eating them freely i am confident that they did wonders not only at the time but in stopping the imaginary pitching and rolling after the voyage is over from which many good amateur sailors suffer i have hardly had the sensation at all except in washing of a morning at that time i still hold on with one knee to the washingstand and could swear that it rolls from left to right the cuba does not return until wednesday the 4th december you may suppose that every officer on board is coming on monday and that dolby has provided extra stools for them his work is very hard indeed cards are brought to him every minute in the day his correspondence is immense and he is jerked off to new york and i dont know where else on the shortest notice and the most unreasonable times moreover he has to be at the bar every night and to liquor up with all creation in the small hours he does it all with the greatest good humour and flies at everybody who waylays the chief furiously we have divided our men into watches so that one always sits outside the drawingroom door dolby knows the whole cunard line and as we could not get good english gin went out in a steamer yesterday and got two cases twentyfour bottles out of cunard officers osgood and he were detached together last evening for new york whence they telegraph every other hour about some new point in this precious sale of tickets so distracted a telegram arrived at three that i have telegraphed back explain yourselves and am now waiting for the explanation i think you know that osgood is a partner in ticknor and fields  tuesday morningdolby has come back from new york where the prospects seem immense we sell tickets there next friday and saturday and a tremendous rush is expected   sidenote mr charles dickens                parker house boston us saturday nov 30th 1867  my dear charley  you will have heard before now how fortunate i was on my voyage and how i was not sick for a moment these screws are tremendous ships for carrying on and for rolling and their vibration is rather distressing but my little cabin being forard of the machinery was in the best part of the vessel and i had as much air in it night and day as i chose the saloon being kept absolutely without air i mostly dined in my own den in spite of my being allotted the post of honour on the right hand of the captain  the tickets for the first four readings here the only readings announced were all sold immediately and many are now reselling at a large premium the tickets for the first four readings in new york the only readings announced there also were on sale yesterday and were all sold in a few hours the receipts are very large indeed but engagements of any kind and every kind i steadily refuse being resolved to take what is to be taken myself dolby is nearly worked off his legs is now at new york and goes backwards and forwards between this place and that about the distance from london to liverpool though they take nine hours to do it incessantly nothing can exceed his energy and good humour and he is extremely popular everywhere my great desire is to avoid much travelling and to try to get the people to come to me instead of my going to them if i can effect this to any moderate extent i shall be saved a great deal of knocking about my original purpose was not to go to canada at all but canada is so up in arms on the subject that i think i shall be obliged to take it at last in that case i should work round to halifax nova scotia and then take the packet for home  as they dont seem americans who have heard me on their travels excepted to have the least idea here of what the readings are like and as they are accustomed to mere readings out of a book i am inclined to think the excitement will increase when i shall have begun everybody is very kind and considerate and i have a number of old friends here at the bar and connected with the university i am now negotiating to bring out the dramatic version of no thoroughfare at new york it is quite upon the cards that it may turn up trumps  i was interrupted in that place by a call from my old secretary in the states mr putnam it was quite affecting to see his delight in meeting his old master again and when i told him that anne was married and that i had unacknowledged grandchildren he laughed and cried together i suppose you dont remember longfellow though he remembers you in a black velvet frock very well he is now whitehaired and whitebearded but remarkably handsome he still lives in his old house where his beautiful wife was burnt to death i dined with him the other day and could not get the terrific scene out of my imagination she was in a blaze in an instant rushed into his arms with a wild cry and never spoke afterwards  my love to bessie and to mekitty and all the babbies i will lay this by until tuesday morning and then add a final line to it                        ever my dear charley your affectionate father

more brilliant   sidenote miss dickens                         parker house boston sunday dec 1st 1867  i received yours of the 18th november yesterday as i left halifax in the cuba that very day you probably saw us telegraphed in the times on the 19th  dolby came back from another run to new york this morning the receipts are very large indeed far exceeding our careful estimate made at gads i think you had best in future unless i give you intimation to the contrary address your letters to me at the westminster hotel irving place new york city it is a more central position than this and we are likely to be much more there than here i am going to set up a brougham in new york and keep my rooms at that hotel the account of matilda is a very melancholy one and really distresses me what she must sink into it is sad to consider however there was nothing for it but to send her away that is quite clear  they are said to be a very quiet audience here appreciative but not demonstrative i shall try to change their character a little  i have been going on very well a horrible custom obtains in these parts of asking you to dinner somewhere at halfpast two and to supper somewhere else about eight i have run this gauntlet more than once and its effect is that there is no day for any useful purpose and that the length of the evening is multiplied by a hundred yesterday i dined with a

oclock this morning there were two thousand people in waiting and they had begun to assemble in the bitter cold as early as two oclock all night long dolby and our man have been stamping tickets immediately over my head bythebye and keeping me awake this hotel is quite as quiet as mivarts in brook street it is not very much larger there are american hotels close by with five hundred bedrooms and i dont know how many boarders but this is conducted on what is called the european principle and is an admirable mixture of a firstclass french and english house i keep a very smart carriage and pair and if you were to behold me driving out furred up to the moustache with furs on the coachboy and on the driver and with an immense white red and yellow striped rug for a covering you would suppose me to be of hungarian or polish nationality  will you report the success here to mr forster with my love and tell him he shall hear from me by next mail  dolby sends his kindest regards he is just come in from our ticket sales and has put such an immense untidy heap of paper money on the table that it looks like a family wash he hardly ever dines and is always tearing about at unreasonable hours he works very hard  my best love to your aunt to whom i will write next and to katie and to both the charleys and all the christmas circle not forgetting chorley to whom give my special

retarded thus we have received no letters by the cunard steamer that came in last wednesday and are in a grim state of mind on that subject  last night i was getting into bed just at twelve oclock when dolby came to my door to inform me that the house was on fire i had previously smelt fire for two hours i got scott up directly told him to pack the books and clothes for the readings first dressed and pocketed my jewels and papers while dolby stuffed himself out with money meanwhile the police and firemen were in the house endeavouring to find where the fire was for some time it baffled their endeavours but at last bursting out through some stairs they cut the stairs away and traced it to its source in a certain firegrate by this time the hose was laid all through the house from a great tank on the roof and everybody turned out to help it was the oddest sight and people had put the strangest things on after a little chopping and cutting with axes and handing about of water the fire was confined to a diningroom in which it had originated and then everybody talked to everybody else the ladies being particularly loquacious and cheerful and so we got to bed again at about two  the excitement of the readings continues unabated the tickets for readings are sold as soon as they are ready and the public pay treble prices to the speculators who buy them up they are a wonderfully fine audience even better than edinburgh and almost if not quite as good as paris  dolby continues to be the most unpopular man in america mainly because he cant get four thousand people into a room that holds two thousand and is reviled in print daily yesterday morning a newspaper proclaims of him surely it is time that the puddingheaded dolby retired into the native gloom from which he has emerged he takes it very coolly and does his best mrs morgan sent me the other night i suppose the finest and costliest basket of flowers ever seen made of white camellias yellow roses pink roses and i dont know what else it is a yard and a half round at its smallest part  i must bring this to a close as i have to go to the hall to try an enlarged background   sidenote miss hogarth

the greatest interest and pleasure and then we talked of home till we went to bed  our tour is now being made out and i hope to be able to send it in my next letter home which will be to mamie from whom i have not heard as you thought i had by the mail that brought out yours after very careful consideration i have reversed dolbys original plan and have decided on taking baltimore washington cincinnati chicago  st louis and a few other places nearer here instead of staying in new york my reason is that we are doing immensely both at new york and here and that i am sure it is in the peculiar character of the people to prize a thing the more the less easily attainable it is made therefore i want by absence to get the greatest rush and pressure upon the five farewell readings in new york in april all our announced readings are already crammed  when we got here last saturday night we found that mrs fields had not only garnished the rooms with flowers but also with holly with real red berries and festoons of moss dependent from the lookingglasses and picture frames she is one of the dearest little women in the world the homely christmas look of the place quite affected us yesterday we dined at her house and there was a plumpudding brought on blazing and not to be surpassed in any house in england there is a certain captain dolliver belonging to the boston custom house who came off in the little steamer that brought me ashore from the cuba he took it into his head that he would have a piece of english mistletoe brought out in this weeks cunard which should be laid upon my breakfasttable and there it was this morning in such affectionate touches as this these new england people are especially amiable  as a general rule you may lay it down that whatever you see about me in the papers is not true but although my voyage out was of that highly hilarious description that you first made known to me you may generally lend a more believing ear to the philadelphia correspondent of the times i dont know him but i know the source from which he derives his information and it is a very respectable one  did i tell you in a former letter from here to tell anne with her old masters love that i had seen putnam my old secretary grey and with several front teeth out but i would have known him anywhere he is coming to copperfield tonight accompanied by his wife and daughter and is in the seventh heaven at having his tickets given him  our hotel in new york was on fire again the other night but fires in this country are quite matters of course there was a large one there at four this morning and i dont think a single night has passed since i have been under the protection of the eagle but i have heard the fire bells dolefully clanging all over the city  dolby sends his kindest regard his hair has become quite white the effect i suppose of the climate he is so universally hauled over the coals for no reason on earth that i fully expect to hear him one of these nights assailed with a howl when he precedes me to the platform steps you may conceive what the low newspapers are here when one of them yesterday morning had as an item of news the intelligence dickenss readings the chap calling himself dolby got drunk last night and was locked up in a policestation for fighting an irishman i dont find that anybody is shocked by this liveliness  my love to all and to mrs hulkes and the boy bythebye when we left new york for this place dolby called my amazed attention to the circumstance that scott was leaning his head against the side of the carriage and weeping bitterly i asked him what was the matter and he replied the owdacious treatment of the luggage which was more outrageous than a man could bear i told him not to make a fool of himself but they do knock it about cruelly i think every trunk we have is already broken  i must leave off as i am going out for a walk in a bright sunlight and a complete breakup of the frost and snow i am much better than i have been during the last week but have a cold   sidenote miss dickens                   westminster hotel irving place new york city                                           thursday dec 26th 1867  i got your aunts last letter at boston yesterday christmas day morning when i was starting at eleven oclock to come back to this place i wanted it very much for i had a frightful cold english colds are nothing to those of this country and was exceedingly depressed and miserable not that i had any reason but illness for being so since the bostonians had been quite astounding in their demonstrations i never saw anything like them on christmas eve but it is a bad country to be unwell and travelling in you are one of say a hundred people in a heated car with a great stove in it and all the little windows closed and the hurrying and banging about are indescribable the atmosphere is detestable and the motion often all but intolerable however we got our dinner here at eight oclock and plucked up a little and i made some hot gin punch to drink a merry christmas to all at home in but it must be confessed that we were both very dull i have been in bed all day until two oclock and here i am now at three oclock a little better but i am not fit to read and i must read tonight after watching the general character pretty closely i became quite sure that dolby was wrong on the length of the stay and the number of readings we had proposed in this place i am quite certain that it is one of the national peculiarities that what they want must be difficult of attainment i therefore a few days ago made a coup détat and altered the whole scheme we shall go to philadelphia baltimore washington also some new england towns between boston and this place away to the falls of niagara and off far west to chicago and st louis before coming back for ten farewell readings here preceded by farewells at boston leaving canada altogether this will not prolong the list beyond eightyfour readings the exact original number and will please god work it all out in april in my next i daresay i shall be able to send the exact list so that you may know every day where we are there has been a great storm here for a few days and the streets though wet are becoming passable again dolby and osgood are out in it today on a variety of business and left in grave and solemn state scott and the gasman are stricken with dumb concern not having received one single letter from home since they left what their wives can have done with the letters they take it for granted they have written is their stormy speculation at the door of my hall dressingroom every night  if i do not send a letter to katie by this mail it will be because i shall probably be obliged to go across the water to brooklyn tomorrow to see a church in which it is proposed that i shall read horrible visions of being put in the pulpit already beset me and whether the audience will be in pews is another consideration which greatly disturbs my mind no paper ever comes out without a leader on dolby who of course reads them all and never can understand why i dont in which he is called all the bad names in and not in the language  we always call him p h dolby now in consequence of one of these graceful specimens of literature describing him as the puddingheaded  i fear that when we travel he will have to be always before me so that i may not see him six times in as many weeks however i shall have done a fourth of the whole this very next week  best love to your aunt and the boys and

indeed who soon turned out to be an old friend of olliffes19 he has set me on my legs and taken his leave professionally though he means to give me a call now and then  in the library at gads is a bound book remarkable criminal trials translated by lady duff gordon from the original by fauerbach i want that book and a copy of praeds poems to be sent out to boston care of ticknor and fields if you will give the criminal trials to wills and explain my wish and ask him to buy a copy of praeds poems and add it to the parcel he will know how to send the packet out i think the criminal trials book is in the corner bookcase by the window opposite the door  no news here all going on in the regular way i read in that church i told you of about the middle of january it is wonderfully seated for two thousand people and is as easy to speak in as if they were two hundred the people are seated in pews and we let the pews i stood on a small platform from which the pulpit will be removed for the occasion i emerge from the vestry philadelphia baltimore and another two nights in boston will follow this coming month of january on friday next i shall have read a fourth of my whole list besides having had twelve days holiday when i first came out so please god i shall soon get to the half and so begin to work hopefully round  i suppose you were at the adelphi on thursday night last they are pirating the bill as well as the play here everywhere i have registered the play as the property of an american citizen but the law is by no means clear that i established a right in it by so doing and of course the pirates knew very well that i could not under existing circumstances try the question with them in an american court of law nothing is being played here scarcely that is not founded on my bookscricket oliver twist our mutual friend and i dont know what else every night i cant get down broadway for my own portrait and yet i live almost as quietly in this hotel as if i were at the office and go in and out by a side door just as i might there  i go back to boston on saturday to read there on monday and tuesday then i am back here and keep within six or seven hours journey of hereabouts till february my further movements shall be duly reported as the details are arranged  i shall be curious to know who were at gads hill on christmas day and how you as they say in this country got along it is exceedingly cold here again after two or three quite spring days  footnotes  17 madame sainton dolby  18 the nearest neighbour at higham and intimate friends  19 dr fordyce barker     1868  narrative   charles dickens remained in america through the winter returning home from new york in the russia on the 19th of april his letters show how entirely he gave himself up to the business of the readings how severely his health suffered from the climate and from the perpetual travelling and hard work and yet how he was able to battle through to the end these letters are also full of allusions to the many kind and dear friends who contributed so largely to the pleasure of this american visit and whose love and attention gave a touch of home to his private life and left such affection and gratitude in his heart as he could never forget many of these friends paid visits to gads hill the first to come during this summer being mr longfellow his daughters and mr appleton brotherinlaw of mr longfellow and mr and mrs charles eliot norton of cambridge  for the future there were to be no more christmas numbers of all the year round observing the extent to which they were now copied in all directions charles dickens supposed them likely to become tiresome to the public and so determined that in his journal they should be discontinued  while still in america he made an agreement with the messrs chappell to give a series of farewell readings in england to commence in the autumn of this year so in october charles dickens started off again for a tour in the provinces he had for some time been planning by way of a novelty for this series a reading from the murder in oliver twist but finding it so very horrible he was fearful of trying its effect for the first time on a public audience it was therefore resolved that a trial of it should be made to a limited private audience in st jamess hall on the evening of the 18th of november this trial proved eminently successful and the murder from oliver twist became one of the most popular of his selections but the physical exertion it involved was far greater than that of any of his previous readings and added immensely to the excitement and exhaustion which they caused him  one of the first letters of the year from america is addressed to mr samuel cartwright of surgical and artistic reputation and greatly esteemed by charles dickens both in his professional capacity and as a private friend  the letter written to mrs cattermole in may tells of the illness of mr george cattermole this dear old friend so associated with charles dickens and his works died soon afterwards and the letter to his widow shows that charles dickens was exerting himself in her behalf  the play of no thoroughfare having been translated into french under the title of labîme charles dickens went over to paris to be present at the first night of its production  on the 26th of september his youngest son edward bulwer lytton the plorn so often mentioned started for australia to join his brother alfred tennyson who was already established there it will be seen by his own words how deeply and how sadly charles dickens felt this parting in october of this year his son henry fielding entered trinity hall cambridge as an undergraduate  the miss forster mentioned in the letter to his sisterinlaw and for whom the kind and considerate arrangements were suggested was a sister of mr john forster and a lady highly esteemed by charles dickens the illness from which she was then suffering was a fatal one she died in this same year a few days before christmas  mr j c parkinson to whom a letter is addressed was a gentleman holding a government appointment and contributing largely to journalism and periodical literature  as our last letter for this year we give one which charles dickens wrote to his youngest son on his departure for australia   sidenote miss hogarth

here tonight and go back to boston tomorrow to read there monday and tuesday  tonight i read out the first quarter of my list our houses have been very fine here but have never quite recovered the dolby uproar it seems impossible to devise any scheme for getting the tickets into the peoples hands without the intervention of speculators the people will not help themselves and of course the speculators and all other such prowlers throw as great obstacles in dolbys way an englishmans as they possibly can he may be a little injudicious into the bargain last night for instance he met one of the ushers who show people to their seats coming in with kelly it is against orders that anyone employed in front should go out during the readings and he took this man to task in the british manner instantly the free and independent usher put on his hat and walked off seeing which all the other free and independent ushers some twenty in number put on their hats and walked off leaving us absolutely devoid and destitute of a staff for tonight one has since been improvised but it was a small matter to raise a stir and ill will about especially as one of our men was equally in fault  we have a regular clerk a bostonian whose name is wild he osgood dolby kelly scott george the gasman and perhaps a boy or two constitute my bodyguard it seems a large number of people but the business cannot be done with fewer the speculators buying the front seats to sell at a premium and we have found instances of this being done by merchants in good position and the public perpetually pitching into dolby for selling them back seats the result is that they wont have the back seats send back their tickets write and print volumes on the subject and deter others from coming  you may get an idea of the staffs work by what is in hand now they are preparing numbering and stamping six thousand tickets for philadelphia and eight thousand tickets for brooklyn the moment those are done another eight thousand tickets will be wanted for baltimore and probably another six thousand for washington this in addition to the correspondence advertisements accounts travellings and the mighty business of the reading four times a week  the cunard steamers being now removed from halifax i have decided not to go there or to st johns new brunswick and as there would be a perfect uproar if i picked out such a place in canada as quebec or montreal and excluded those two places which would guarantee three hundred pounds a night and further as i dont want places having more than enough for my list of eightyfour i have finally resolved not to go to canada either this will enable me to embark for home in april instead of may  tell plorn with my love that i think he will find himself much interested at that college20 and that it is very likely he may make some acquaintances there that will thereafter be pleasant and useful to him sir sydney dacres is the best of friends i have a letter from mrs hulkes by this post wherein the boy encloses a violet now lying on the table before me let her know that it arrived safely and retaining its colour i took it for granted that mary would have asked chorley for christmas day and am very glad she ultimately did so i am sorry that harry lost his prize but believe it was not his fault let him know that with my love i would have written to him by this mail in answer to his but for other occupation did i tell you that my landlord made me a drink brandy rum and snow the principal ingredients called a rocky mountain sneezer or that the favourite drink before you get up is an eyeopener or that roberts second landlord no sooner saw me on the night of the first fire than with his property blazing he insisted on taking me down into a roomful of hot smoke to drink brandy and water with him we have not been on fire again bythebye more than once  there has been another fall of snow succeeded by a heavy thaw i have laid down my sledge and taken

jan 4th 1868  i write to you by this opportunity though i really have nothing to tell you the work is hard and the climate is hard we made a tremendous hit last night with nickleby and boots which the bostonians certainly on the whole appreciate more than copperfield dolby is always going about with an immense bundle that looks like a sofa cushion but it is in reality paper money and always works like a trojan his business at night is a mere nothing for these people are so accustomed to take care of themselves that one of these immense audiences will fall into their places with an ease amazing to a frequenter of st jamess hall and the certainty with which they are all in before i go on is a very acceptable mark of respect i must add too that although there is a conventional familiarity in the use of ones name in the newspapers as dickens charlie and what not i do not in the least see that familiarity in the writers themselves an inscrutable tone obtains in journalism which a stranger cannot understand if i say in common courtesy to one of them when dolby introduces i am much obliged to you for your interest in me or so forth he seems quite shocked and has a bearing of perfect modesty and propriety i am rather inclined to think that they suppose their printed tone to be the publics love of smartness but it is immensely difficult to make out all i can as yet make out is that my perfect freedom from bondage and at any moment to go on or leave off or otherwise do as i like is the only safe position to occupy  again there are two apparently irreconcilable contrasts here down below in this hotel every night are the bar loungers dram drinkers drunkards swaggerers loafers that one might find in a boucicault play within half an hour is cambridge where a delightful domestic lifesimple selfrespectful cordial and affectionateis seen in an admirable aspect all new england is primitive and puritanical all about and around it is a puddle of mixed human mud with no such quality in it perhaps i may in time sift out some tolerably intelligible whole but i certainly have not done so yet it is a good sign may be that it all seems immensely more difficult to understand than it was when i was here before  felton left two daughters i have only seen the eldest a very sensible frank pleasant girl of eightandtwenty perhaps rather like him in the face a strikinglooking daughter of hawthorns who is also dead came into my room last night the day has slipped on to three oclock and i must get up dombey for tonight hence this sudden break off best love to mamie and to katie and charley collins   sidenote mr w wilkie collins                 westminster hotel new york sunday jan 12th 1868  my dear wilkie  first of the play21 i am truly delighted to learn that it made so great a success and i hope i may yet see it on the adelphi boards you have had a world of trouble and work with it but i hope will be repaid in some degree by the pleasure of a triumph even for the alteration at the end of the fourth act of which you tell me in your letter received yesterday i was fully prepared for i could not see the original effect in the reading of the play and could not make it go i agree with webster in thinking it best that obenreizer should die on the stage but no doubt that point is disposed of in reading the play before the representation i felt that it was too long and that there was a good deal of unnecessary explanation those points are no doubt disposed of too by this time  we shall do nothing with it on this side pirates are producing their own wretched versions in all directions thus as wills would say anticipating and glutting the market i registered one play as the property of ticknor and fields american citizens but besides that the law on the point is extremely doubtful the manager of the museum theatre boston instantly announced his version you may suppose what it is and how it is done when i tell you that it was playing within ten days of the arrival out of the christmas number thereupon ticknor and fields gave him notice that he mustnt play it unto which he replied that he meant to play it and would play it of course he knew very well that if an injunction were applied for against him there would be an immediate howl against my persecution of an innocent and he played it then the noble host of pirates rushed in and it is being done in some mangled form or other everywhere  it touches me to read what you write of your poor mother but of course at her age each winter counts heavily do give her my love and tell her that i asked you about her  i am going on here at the same great rate but am always counting the days that lie between me and home i got through the first fourth of my readings on friday january 3rd i leave for two readings at philadelphia this evening  being at boston last sunday i took it into my head to go over the medical school and survey the holes and corners in which that extraordinary murder was done by webster there was the furnacestinking horribly as if the dismembered pieces were still inside itand there are all the grim spouts and sinks and chemical appliances and what not at dinner afterwards longfellow told me a terrific story he dined with webster within a year of the murder one of a party of ten or twelve as they sat at their wine webster suddenly ordered the lights to be turned out and a bowl of some burning mineral to be placed on the table that the guests might see how ghostly it made them look as each man stared at all the rest in the weird light all were horrified to see webster with a rope round his neck holding it up over the bowl with his head jerked on one side and his tongue lolled out representing a man being hanged  poking into his life and character i find what i would have staked my head upon that he was always a cruel man  so no more at present from          my dear wilkie yours ever affectionately   sidenote miss hogarth                 westminster hotel new york sunday jan 12th 1868  as i am off to philadelphia this evening i may as well post my letter here i have scarcely a word of news my cold steadily refuses to leave me but otherwise i am as right as one can hope to be under this heavy work my new york readings are over except four farewell nights in april and i look forward to the relief of being out of my hardest hall last friday night though it was only nickleby and boots i was again dead beat at the end and was once more laid upon a sofa but the faintness went off after a little while we have now cold bright frosty weather without snowthe best weather for me  having been in great trepidation about the play i am correspondingly elated by the belief that it really is a success no doubt the unnecessary explanations will have been taken out and the flatness of the last act fetched up at some points i could have done wonders to it in the way of screwing it up sharply and picturesquely if i could have rehearsed it your account of the first night interested me immensely but i was afraid to open the letter until dolby rushed in with the opened times  on wednesday i come back here for my four church readings at brooklyn each evening an enormous ferryboat will convey me and my state carriage not to mention halfadozen waggons and any number of people and a few score of horses across the river and will bring me back again the sale of tickets there was an amazing scene the noble army of speculators are now furnished this is literally true and i am quite serious each man with a straw mattress a little bag of bread and meat two blankets and a bottle of whisky with this outfit they lie down in line on the pavement the whole night before the tickets are sold generally taking up their position at about ten it being severely cold at brooklyn they made an immense bonfire in the streeta narrow street of wooden houseswhich the police turned out to extinguish a general fight then took place out of which the people farthest off in the line rushed bleeding when they saw a chance of displacing others near the door and put their mattresses in those places and then held on by the iron rails at eight in the morning dolby appeared with the tickets in a portmanteau he was immediately saluted with a roar of halloa dolby so charley has let you have the carriage has he dolby how is he dolby dont drop the tickets dolby look alive dolby etc etc etc in the midst of which he proceeded to business and concluded as usual by giving universal dissatisfaction  he is now going off upon a little journey to look over the ground and cut back again this little journey to chicago is fifteen hundred miles on end by railway and back again  we have an excellent gasman who is well up to that department we have enlarged the large staff by another clerk yet even now the preparation of such an immense number of new tickets constantly and the keeping and checking of the accounts keep them hard at it and they get so oddly divided kelly is at philadelphia another man at baltimore two others are stamping tickets at the top of this house another is cruising over new england and osgood will come on duty tomorrow when dolby starts off to pick me up after the reading and take me to the hotel and mount guard over me and bring me back here you see that even such wretched domesticity as dolby and self by a fireside is broken up under these conditions  dolby has been twice poisoned and osgood once morgans sharpness has discovered the cause when the snow is deep upon the ground and the partridges cannot get their usual food they eat something i dont know what if anybody does which does not poison them but which poisons the people who eat them the symptoms which last some twelve hours are violent sickness cold perspiration and the formation of some detestable mucus in the stomach you may infer that partridges have been banished from our bill of fare the appearance of our sufferers was lamentable in the extreme  did i tell you that the severity of the weather and the heat of the intolerable furnaces dry the hair and break the nails of strangers there is not a complete nail in the whole british suite and my hair cracks again when i brush it i am losing my hair with great rapidity and what i dont lose is getting very grey  the cuba will bring this she has a jolly new captainmoody of the javaand her people rushed into the reading the other night captainheaded as if i were their peculiar property please god i shall come home in her in my old cabin leaving here on the 22nd of april and finishing my eightyfourth reading on the previous night it is likely enough that i shall read and go straight on board  i think this is all my poor stock of intelligence bythebye

we arrived here last night towards twelve oclock more than an hour after our time this is one of the immense american hotels it is called the continental but i find myself just as quiet here as elsewhere everything is very good indeed the waiter is german and the greater part of the house servants seem to be coloured people the town is very clean and the day as blue and bright as a fine italian day but it freezes very hard all the tickets being sold here for six nights three visits of two nights each the suite complain of want of excitement already having been here ten hours mr and mrs barney williams with a couple of servants and a pretty little childdaughter were in the train each night and i talked with them a good deal they are reported to have made an enormous fortune by acting among the californian golddiggers my cold is no better for the cars are so intolerably hot that i was often obliged to go and stand upon the break outside and then the frosty air was biting indeed the great man of this place is one mr childs a newspaper proprietor and he is so exactly like mr esse in all conceivable respects except being an inch or so taller that i was quite confounded when i saw him waiting for me at the station always called depôt here with his carriage during the last two or three days dolby and i have been making up accounts which are excellently kept by mr osgood and i find them amazing quite in their results  i was very much interested in the home accounts of christmas day i think i have already mentioned that we were in very low spirits on that day i began to be unwell with my cold that morning and a long days travel did not mend the matter we scarcely spoke except when we ate our lunch and sat dolefully staring out of window i had a few affectionate words from chorley dated from my room on christmas morning and will write him probably by this mail a brief acknowledgment i find it necessary so oppressed am i with this american catarrh as they call it to dine at three oclock instead of four that i may have more time to get voice so that the days are cut short and letterwriting is not easy  my best love to katie and to charley and to

return from philadelphia where i have been reading two nights i take advantage of a spare halfhour in which to answer it at once though it will not leave here until saturday i had previously heard of the play and had the times it was a great relief and delight to me for i had no confidence in its success being reduced to the confines of despair by its length if i could have rehearsed it i should have taken the best part of an hour out of it fechter must be very fine and i should greatly like to see him play the part  i have not been very well generally and am oppressed and i begin to think that i probably shall be until i leave by a true american cold which i hope for the comfort of human nature may be peculiar to only one of the four quarters of the world the work too is very severe but i am going on at the same tremendous rate everywhere the staff too has had to be enlarged dolby was at baltimore yesterday is at washington today and will come back in the night and start away again on friday we find it absolutely necessary for him to go on ahead we have not printed or posted a single bill here and have just sold ninety pounds worth of paper we had got ready for bills in such a rush a short newspaper advertisement is all we want doctor marigold made a great hit here and is looked forward to at boston with especial interest i go to boston for another fortnight on end the 24th of february the railway journeys distress me greatly i get out into the open air upon the break and it snows and blows and the train bumps and the steam flies at me until i am driven in again  i have finished here except four farewell nights in april and begin four nights at brooklyn on the opposite side of the river tonight and thus oscillate between philadelphia baltimore and washington and then cut into new england and so work my way back to boston for a fortnight after which come chicago cincinnati detroit and cleveland and buffalo and then philadelphia boston and new york farewells i will not pass my original bound of eightyfour readings in all my mind was made up as to that long ago it will be quite enough chicago is some fifteen hundred miles from here what with travelling and getting ready for reading and reading the days are pretty fully occupied not the less so because i rest very indifferently at night  the people are exceedingly kind and considerate and desire to be most hospitable besides but i cannot accept hospitality and never go out except at boston or i should not be fit for the labour if dolby holds out well to the last it will be a triumph for he has to see everybody drink with everybody sell all the tickets take all the blame and go beforehand to all the places on the list i shall not see him after tonight for ten days or a fortnight and he will be perpetually on the road during the interval when he leaves me osgood a partner in ticknor and fields publishing firm mounts guard over me and has to go into the hall from the platform door every night and see how the public are seating themselves it is very odd to see how hard he finds it to look a couple of thousand people in the face on which head bythebye i notice the papers to take mr dickenss extraordinary composure their great phrase rather ill and on the whole to imply that it would be taken as a suitable compliment if i would stagger on to the platform and instantly drop overpowered by the spectacle before me  dinner is announced by scott with a stiff neck and a sore throat and i must break off with love to bessie and the incipient wenerableses you will be glad

report as i must get out for a little exercise before dinner  my true american catarrh the people seem to have a national pride in it sticks to me but i am otherwise well i began my church readings last night and it was very odd to see the pews crammed full of people all in a broad roar at the carol and trial  best love to all i have written charley a few lines by this mail and also chorley

enormously full last night marigold and trial but it scarcely required an effort mr ward beecher mrs stowes brothers name being present in his pew i sent to invite him to come round before he left and i found him to be an unostentatious straightforward and agreeable fellow  my cold sticks to me and i can scarcely exaggerate what i sometimes undergo from sleeplessness the day before yesterday i could get no rest until morning and could not get up before twelve this morning the same i rarely take any breakfast but an egg and a cup of tea not even toast or breadandbutter my dinner at three and a little quail or some such light thing when i come home at night is my daily fare at the hall i have established the custom of taking an egg beaten up in sherry before going in and another between the parts i think that pulls me up at all events i have since had no return of faintness  as the men work very hard and always with their hearts cheerfully in the business i cram them into and outside of the carriage to bring them back from brooklyn with me the other night scott with a portmanteau across his knees and a wideawake hat low down upon his nose told me that he had presented himself for admission in the circus as good as franconis bythebye and had been refused the only theayter he said in a melancholy way as i was ever in my life turned from the door of says kelly there must have been some mistake scott because george and me went and we said mr dickenss staff and they passed us to the best seats in the house go again scott no i thank you kelly says scott more melancholy than before im not agoing to put myself in the position of being refused again its the only theayter as i was ever turned from the door of and it shant be done twice but its a beastly country scott interposed majesty dont you express your opinions about the country no sir says scott i never do please sir but when you are turned from the door of the only theayter you was ever turned from sir and when the beasts in railway cars spits tobacco over your boots you privately find yourself in a beastly country  i expect shortly to get myself snowed up on some railway or other for it is snowing hard now and i begin to move tomorrow there is so much floating ice in the river that we are obliged to leave a pretty wide margin of time for getting over the ferry to read the dinner is coming in and i

helping anne so i will begin in this present writing with reference to her sad position i think it will be best for you to be guided by an exact knowledge of her wants try to ascertain from herself what means she has whether her sick husband gets what he ought to have whether she is pinched in the articles of necessary clothing bedding or the like of that add to this intelligence your own observation of the state of things about her and supply what she most wants and help her where you find the greatest need the question in the case of so old and faithful a servant is not one of so much or so little money on my side but how most efficiently to ease her mind and help her to do this at once kindly and sensibly is the only consideration by which you have to be guided take carte blanche from me for all the rest  my washington week is the first week in february beginning on monday 3rd the tickets are sold and the president is coming and the chief members of the cabinet and the leaders of parties and so forth are coming and as the holly tree boots says thats where it is dont you see  in my washington doubts i recalled dolby for conference and he joined me yesterday afternoon and we have been in great discussion ever since on the possibility of giving up the far west and avoiding such immense distances and fatigues as would be involved in travelling to chicago and cincinnati we have sketched another tour for the last half of march which would be infinitely easier for me though on the other hand less profitable the places and the halls being smaller the worst of it is that everybody one advises with has a monomania respecting chicago good heaven sir the great philadelphian authority said to me this morning if you dont read in chicago the people will go into fits in reference to fatigue i answered well i would rather they went into fits than i did but he didnt seem to see it at all  alone constantly writes me dont go to the west you can get what you want so much more easily how we shall finally decide i dont yet know my brooklyn church has been an immense success and i found its minister was a bachelor a clever unparsonic and straightforward man and a man with a good knowledge of art into the bargain  we are not a bit too soon here for the whole country is beginning to be stirred and shaken by the presidential election and trade is exceedingly depressed and will be more so fanny kemble lives near this place but had gone away a day before my first visit here she is going to read in february or march du chaillu has been lecturing out west about the gorilla and has been to see me i saw the cunard steamer persia out in the stream yesterday beautifully smart her flags flying all her steam up and she only waiting for her mails to slip away she gave me a horrible touch of homesickness  when the 1st of march arrives and i can say next month i shall begin to grow brighter a fortnights reading in boston too last week of february and first week of march will help me on gaily i hope the work so far off tells it is impossible for the people to be more affectionately attached to a third i really believe than fields and his wife are to me and they are a landmark in the prospect  dolby sends kindest regards and wishes it to be known that he has not been bullied lately we do not go west at all but take the easier plan   sidenote miss

fourandtwenty hours though this place is as far south as valentia in spain and dolby being on his way to new york has a good chance of being snowed up somewhere  they are a bright responsive people here and very pleasant to read to i have rarely seen so many fine faces in an audience i read here in a charming little operahouse built by a society of germans quite a delightful place for the purpose i stand on the stage with a drop curtain down and my screen before it the whole scene is very pretty and complete and the audience have a ring in them that sounds in the ear i go from here to philadelphia to read tomorrow night and friday come through here again on saturday on my way to washington come back here on saturday week for two finishing nights then go to philadelphia for two farewells and so turn my back on the southern part of the country distances and travelling have obliged us to reduce the list of readings by two leaving eightytwo in all of course we afterwards discovered that we had finally settled the list on a friday i shall be halfway through it at washington of course on a friday also and my birthday  dolby and osgood who do the most ridiculous things to keep me in spirits i am often very heavy and rarely sleep much have decided to have a walkingmatch at boston on saturday february 29th beginning this design in joke they have become tremendously in earnest and dolby has actually sent home much to his opponents terror for a pair of seamless socks to walk in our men are hugely excited on the subject and continually make bets on the men fields and i are to walk out six miles and the men are to turn and walk round us neither of them has the least idea what twelve miles at a pace is being requested by both to give them a breather yesterday i gave them a stiff one of five miles over a bad road in the snow half the distance uphill i took them at a pace of four miles and a half an hour and you never beheld such objects as they were when we got back both smoking like factories and both obliged to change everything before they could come to dinner they have the absurdest ideas of what are tests of walking power and continually get up in the maddest manner and see how high they can kick the wall the wainscot here in one place is scored all over with their pencilmarks to see them doing thisdolby a big man and osgood a very little one is ridiculous beyond description                                              philadelphia same night  we came on here through a snowstorm all the way but up to time fanny kemble who begins to read shortly is coming to marigold and trial tomorrow night i have written her a note telling her that if it will at all assist her movements to know mine my list is at her service probably i shall see her tomorrow tell mamie to whom i will write next with my love that i found her letter of the 10th of this month awaiting me here the siberia that brought it is a new cunarder and made an unusually slow passage out probably because it would be dangerous to work new machinery too fast on the atlantic                                                        thursday 30th  my cold still sticks to me the heat of the railway cars and their unventilated condition invariably brings it back when i think it going this morning my head is as stuffed and heavy as ever a superb sledge and four horses have been offered me for a ride but i am afraid to take it lest i should make the true american catarrh worse and should get hoarse so i am going to give osgood another breather on foot instead  the communication with new york is not interrupted so we consider the zealous dolby all right you may imagine what his work is when you hear that he goes three times to every place we visit firstly to look at the hall arrange the numberings and make five hundred acquaintances whom he immediately calls by their christiannames secondly to sell the ticketsa very nice business requiring great tact and temper thirdly with me he will probably turn up at washington next sunday but only for a little while for as soon as i am on the platform on monday night he will start away again probably to be seen no more until we pass through new york in the middle of february   sidenote mr samuel cartwright                                baltimore wednesday jan 29th 1868  my dear cartwright  as i promised to report myself to you from this side of the atlantic and as i have some leisure this morning i am going to lighten my conscience by keeping my word  i am going on at a great pace and with immense success next week at washington i shall please god have got through half my readings the remaining half are all arranged and they will carry me into the third week of april it is very hard work but it is brilliantly paid the changes that i find in the country generally this place is the least changed of any i have yet seen exceed my utmost expectations i had been in new york a couple of days before i began to recognise it at all and the handsomest part of boston was a black swamp when i saw it fiveandtwenty years ago considerable advances too have been made socially strange to say the railways and railway arrangements both exceedingly defective seem to have stood still while all other things have been moving  one of the most comical spectacles i have ever seen in my life was church with a heavy sea on in the saloon of the cunard steamer coming out the officiating minister an extremely modest young man was brought in between two big stewards exactly as if he were coming up to the scratch in a prizefight the ship was rolling and pitching so that the two big stewards had to stop and watch their opportunity of making a dart at the readingdesk with their reverend charge during which pause he held on now by one steward and now by the other with the feeblest expression of countenance and no legs whatever at length they made a dart at the wrong moment and one steward was immediately beheld alone in the extreme perspective while the other and the reverend gentleman held on by the mast in the middle of the saloonwhich the latter embraced with both arms as if it were his wife all this time the congregation was breaking up into sects and sliding away every sect as in nature pounding the other sect and when at last the reverend gentleman had been tumbled into his place the desk a loose one put upon the diningtable deserted from the church bodily and went over to the purser the scene was so extraordinarily ridiculous and was made so much more so by the exemplary gravity of all concerned in it that i was obliged to leave before the service began  this is one of the places where butler carried it with so high a hand in the war and where the ladies used to spit when they passed a northern soldier it still wears i fancy a look of sullen remembrance the ladies are remarkably handsome with an eastern look upon them dress with a strong sense of colour and make a brilliant audience the ghost of slavery haunts the houses and the old untidy incapable lounging shambling black serves you as a free man free of course he ought to be but the stupendous absurdity of making him a voter glares out of every roll of his eye stretch of his mouth and bump of his head i have a strong impression that the race must fade out of the states very fast it never can hold its own against a striving restless shifty people in the penitentiary here the other day in a room full of all blacks too dull to be taught any of the work in hand was one young brooding fellow very like a black rhinoceros he sat glowering at life as if it were just endurable at dinner time until four of his fellows began to sing most unmelodiously a part song he then set up a dismal howl and pounded his face on a form i took him to have been rendered quite desperate by having learnt anything i send my kind regard to mrs cartwright and sincerely hope that she and you have no new family distresses or anxieties my standing address is the westminster hotel irving place new york city and i am always my dear cartwright                                                        cordially yours

desire to pledge himself as strongly as possible you may receive it in that better spirit or i am much mistaken tell your aunt with my best love that i wrote to chauncey weeks ago in answer to a letter from him i am now going out in a sleigh and four with unconceivable dignity and grandeur mentioning which reminds me that i am informed by trusty scouts that  intends to waylay me at washington

last night with great success the hall being small the prices were raised to three dollars each ticket the audience was a superior one composed of the foremost public men and their families at the end of the carol they gave a great break out and applauded i really believe for five minutes you would suppose them to be manchester shillings instead of washington halfsovereigns immense enthusiasm  a devoted adherent in this place an englishman had represented to dolby that if i were taken to an hotel here it would be impossible to secure me a minutes rest and he undertook to get one wheleker a german who keeps a little véreys to furnish his private diningrooms for the illustrious travellers reception accordingly here we are on the first and second floor of a small house with no one else in it but our people a french waiter and a very good french cuisine perfectly private in the city of all the world i should say where the hotels are intolerable and privacy the least possible and quite comfortable whelekers restaurant is our rather undignified address for the present week  i dined against my rules with charles sumner on sunday he having been an old friend of mine mr secretary staunton war minister was there he is a man of a very remarkable memory and famous for his acquaintance with the minutest details of my books give him any passage anywhere and he will instantly cap it and go on with the context he was commanderinchief of all the northern forces concentrated here and never went to sleep at night without first reading something from my books which were always with him i put him through a pretty severe examination but he was better up than i was  the gas was very defective indeed last night and i began with a small speech to the effect that i must trust to the brightness of their faces for the illumination of mine this was taken greatly in the carol a most ridiculous incident occurred all of a sudden i saw a dog look out from among the seats into the centre aisle and look very intently at me the general attention being fixed on me i dont think anybody saw the dog but i felt so sure of his turning up again and barking that i kept my eye wandering about in search of him he was a very comic dog and it was well for me that i was reading a very comic part of the book but when he bounced out into the centre aisle again in an entirely new place still looking intently at me and tried the effect of a bark upon my proceedings i was seized with such a paroxysm of laughter that it communicated itself to the audience and we roared at one another loud and long  the president has sent to me twice and i am going to see him tomorrow he has a whole row for his family every night dolby rejoined his chief yesterday morning and will probably remain in the august presence until sunday night he and osgood training for the match are ludicrous beyond belief i saw them just now coming up a street each trying to pass the other and immediately fled since i have been writing this they have burst in at the door and sat down on the floor to blow dolby is now writing at a neighbouring table with his bald head smoking as if he were on fire kelly his great adherent asked me when he was last away whether it was quite fair that i should take mr osgood out for breathers when mr dolby had no such advantage i begin to expect that half boston will turn out on the 29th

my own appointment and i did so a man of very remarkable appearance indeed of tremendous firmness of purpose not to be turned or trifled with  as i mention my colds being so bad i will add that i have never had anything the matter with me since i came here but the cold it is now in my throat and slightly on my chest it occasions me great discomfort and you would suppose seeing me in the morning that i could not possibly read at night but i have always come up to the scratch have not yet missed one night and have gradually got used to that i had got much the better of it but the dressingroom at the hall here is singularly cold and draughty and so i have slid back again  the papers here having written about this being my birthday the most exquisite flowers came pouring in at breakfast time from all sorts of people the room is covered with them made up into beautiful bouquets and arranged in all manner of green baskets probably i shall find plenty more at the hall tonight this is considered the dullest and most apathetic place in america my audiences have been superb  i mentioned the dog on the first night here next night i thought i heard in copperfield a suddenly suppressed bark it happened in this wise osgood standing just within the door felt his leg touched and looking down beheld the dog staring intently at me and evidently just about to bark in a transport of presence of mind and fury he instantly caught him up in both hands and threw him over his own head out into the entry where the checktakers received him like a game at ball last night he came again with another dog but our people were so sharply on the lookout for him that he didnt get in he had evidently promised to pass the other dog free   sidenote miss dickens

though i were a little boy flowers and garlands of the most exquisite kind bloomed all over the room letters radiant with good wishes poured in a shirt pin a handsome silver travelling bottle a set of gold shirt studs and a set of gold sleeve links were on the dinnertable after boots at night the whole audience rose and remained secretaries of state presidents family judges of supreme court and so forth standing and cheering until i went back to the table and made them a little speech on the same august day of the year i was received by the president a man with a very remarkable and determined face each of us looked at each other very hard and each of us managed the interview i think to the satisfaction of the other in the outer room was sitting a certain sunburnt general blair with many evidences of the war upon him he got up to shake hands with me and then i found he had been out in the prairie with me fiveandtwenty years ago that afternoon my catarrh was in such a state that charles sumner coming in at five oclock and finding me covered with mustard poultice and apparently voiceless turned to dolby and said surely mr dolby it is impossible that he can read tonight says dolby sir i have told the dear chief so four times today and i have been very anxious but you have no idea how he will change when he gets to the little table after five minutes of the little table i was not for the time even hoarse the frequent experience of this return of force when it is wanted saves me a vast amount of anxiety  i wish you would get from homan and report to me as near as he can make an approximate estimate is the right term in the trade i believe of the following work  1 to recover with red leather all the diningroom chairs  2 to ditto with green leather all the library chairs and the couch  3 to provide and lay down new brussels carpets in the front spare and the two top spares quality of carpet quality of yours and mine  i have some doubts about the state of the hall floorcloth and also the floorcloth in the diningroom will you and your aunt carefully examine both calling in homan too if necessary and report to me  it would seem that no thoroughfare has really developed as a drama into an amazing success i begin to think that i shall see it dolby is away this morning to conquer or die in a terrific struggle with the mayor of newhaven where i am to

might be larger richer and better say that you think that more of the neighbouring gentlemen could be got to be playing members that you submit to them that it would be better to have a captain who could correspond with them and talk to them and in some sort manage them and that being perfectly acquainted with the game and having long played it at a great public school you propose yourself as captain for the foregoing reasons that you propose to them to make the subscription of the gentlemen members at least double that of the working men for no other reason than that the gentlemen can afford it better but that both classes of members shall have exactly the same right of voting equally in all that concerns the club say that you have consulted me upon the matter and that i am of these opinions and am ready to become chairman of the club and to preside at their meetings and to overlook its business affairs and to give it five pounds a year payable at the commencement of each season then having brought them to this point draw up the clubs rules and regulations amending them where they want amendment  discreetly done i see no difficulty in this but it can only be honourably and hopefully done by having the men together and i would not have them at the falstaff but in the hall or diningroomthe servants hall an excellent place whatever you do let the men ratify and let them feel their little importance and at once perceive how much better the business begins to be done  i am very glad to hear of the success of your reading and still more glad that you went at it in downright earnest i should never have made my success in life if i had been shy of taking pains or if i had not bestowed upon the least thing i have ever undertaken exactly the same attention and care that i have bestowed upon the greatest do everything at your best it was but this last year that i set to and learned every word of my readings and from ten years ago to last night i have never read to an audience but i have watched for an opportunity of striking out something better somewhere look at such of my manuscripts as are in the library at gads and think of the patient hours devoted year after year to single lines                                       the weather is very severe here and the work is very hard dolby having been violently pitched into by the mayor of newhaven a town at which i am to read next week has gone bodily this morning with defiant written instructions from me to inform the said mayor that if he fail to make out his case he dolby is to return all the money taken and to tell him that i will not set foot in his jurisdiction whereupon the newhaven people will probably fall upon the mayor in his turn and lead him a pleasant life                          ever my dear harry your affectionate father   sidenote miss hogarth                              philadelphia thursday feb 13th 1868  we have got into an immense difficulty with the people of newhaven i have a strong suspicion that one of our men who sold there has been speculating all this while and that he must have put front seats in his pockets and sold back ones he denies what the mayor charges but the mayor holds on grimly dolby set off from baltimore as soon as we found out what was amiss to examine and report but some new feature of difficulty must have come out for this morning he telegraphs from new york where he had to sleep last night on his way to newhaven that he is coming back for further consultation with the chief it will certainly hurt us and will of course be distorted by the papers into all manner of shapes my suspicion may not be correct but i have an instinctive belief that it is we shall probably have the old new york row and loss over again unless i can catch this mayor tripping in an assertion  in this very place we are halfdistracted by the speculators they have been holding out for such high prices that the public have held out too and now frightened at what they have done the speculators are trying to sell their worst seats at half the cost price so that we are in the ridiculous situation of having sold the room out and yet not knowing what empty seats there may be we could sell at our boxoffice to any extent but we cant buy back of the speculators because we informed the public that all the tickets were gone and if we bought under our own price and sold at our own price we should at once be in treaty with the speculators and should be making money by it dolby the much bullied will come back here presently half bereft of his senses and i should be half bereft of mine if the situation were not comically disagreeable  nothing will induce the people to believe in the farewells at baltimore on tuesday night a very brilliant night indeed they asked as they came out when will mr dickens read here again never nonsense not come back after such houses as these come say when hell read again just the same here we could as soon persuade them that i am the president as that i am going to read here for the last time tomorrow night  there is a child of the barney williamss in this housea little girlto whom i presented a black doll when i was here last i have seen her eye at the keyhole since i began writing this and i think she and the doll are outside still when you sent it up to me by the coloured boy she said after receiving it coloured boy is the term for black waiter i gave such a cream that ma came running in and creamed too cos she fort id hurt myself but i creamed a cream of joy she had a friend to play with her that day and brought the friend with her to my infinite confusion a friend all stockings and much too tall who sat on the sofa very far back with her stockings sticking stiffly out in front of her and glared at me and never spake word dolby found us confronted in a sort of fascination like serpent and bird   sidenote miss hogarth                                    new york monday feb 17th 1868  i got your letter of the 3rd of february here this morning as i am off at seven tomorrow morning i answer it at once though indeed i have nothing to say  true american still sticking to me but i am always ready for my work and therefore dont much mind dolby and the mayor of newhaven alternately embrace and exchange mortal defiances in writing out some advertisements towards midnight last night he made a very good mistake the reading will be comprised within two minutes and the audience are earnestly entreated to be seated ten hours before its commencement  the weather has been finer lately but the streets are in a horrible condition through halfmelted snow and it is now snowing again the walkingmatch next saturday week is already in the boston papers i suppose half boston will turn out on the occasion as a sure way of not being conspicuous the men are going to walk in flannel they are in a mingled state of comicality and gravity about it that is highly ridiculous yesterday being a bright cool day i took dolby for a buster of eight miles as everybody here knows me the spectacle of our splitting up the fashionable avenue the only way out of town excited the greatest amazement no doubt that will be in the papers tomorrow i give a gorgeous banquet to eighteen ladies and gentlemen after the match mr and mrs fields do ticknor longfellow and his daughter lowell holmes and his wife etc etc sporting speeches to be made and the stakes four hats to be handed over to the winner  my ship will not be the cuba after all she is to go into dock and the russia a

washington february 24th 1868  my dear fechter  your letter reached me here yesterday i have sent you a telegram addressed to the theatre this morning and i write this by the earliest return mail  my dear fellow consider yourself my representative whatever you do or desire to do about the play i fully authorise beforehand tell webster with my regard that i think his proposal honest and fair that i think it in a word like himself and that i have perfect confidence in his good faith and liberality  as to making money of the play in the united states here boucicault has filled wilkies head with golden dreams that have nothing in them he makes no account of the fact that wherever i go the theatres with my name in big letters instantly begin playing versions of my books and that the moment the christmas number came over here they pirated it and played no thoroughfare now i have enquired into the law and am extremely doubtful whether i could have prevented this why should they pay for the piece as you act it when they have no actors and when all they want is my name and they can get that for nothing  wilkie has uniformly written of you enthusiastically in a letter i had from him dated the 10th of january he described your conception and execution of the part in the most glowing terms here fechter is magnificent here his superb playing brings the house down i should call even his exit in the last act one of the subtlest and finest things he does in the piece you can hardly imagine what he gets out of the part or what he makes of his passionate love for marguerite these expressions and many others like them crowded his letter  i never did so want to see a character played on the stage as i want to see you play obenreizer as the play was going when i last heard of it i have some hopes that i may see it yet please god your adelphi dressingroom will be irradiated with the noble presence of never wrong if you are acting about the evening of monday the 4th of may  i am doing enormous business it is a wearying life away from all i love but i hope that the time will soon begin to spin away among the many changes that i find here is the comfortable change that the people are in general extremely considerate and very observant of my privacy even in this place i am really almost as much my own master as if i were in an english country town generally they are very good audiences indeed they do not i think perceive touches of art to be art but they are responsive to the broad results of such touches doctor marigold is a great favourite and they laugh so unrestrainedly at the trial from pickwick which you never heard that it has grown about half as long again as it used to be  if i could send you a brandy cocktail by post i would it is a highly meritorious dram which i hope to present to you at gads my new york landlord made me a rocky mountain sneezer which appeared to me to be compounded of all the spirits ever heard of in the world with bitters lemon sugar and snow you can only make a true sneezer when the snow is lying on the ground  there my dear boy my paper is out and i am going to read copperfield count always on my fidelity and true attachment and look out as i have already said for a distinguished visitor about monday the 4th of may                      ever my dear fechter                                  your cordial and

political excitement may take next and it may so easily and so soon swallow up all other things that i think i shall suppress my next weeks readings here by good fortune not yet announced and watch the course of events dolbys sudden desponding under these circumstances is so acute that it is actually swelling his head as i glance at him in the glass while writing  the catarrh is no better and no worse the weather is intensely cold the walkingmatch of which i will send particulars is to come off on sunday mrs fields is more delightful than ever and fields more hospitable my room is always radiant with brilliant flowers of their sending i dont know whether i told you that the walkingmatch is to celebrate the extinction of february and the coming of the day when i can say next month   sidenote miss hogarth                                    boston thursday feb 27th 1868  this morning at breakfast i received yours of the 11th from palace gate house i have very little news to give you in return for your budget the walkingmatch is to come off on saturday and fields and i went over the ground yesterday to measure the miles we went at a tremendous pace the condition of the ground is something indescribable from halfmelted snow running water and sheets and blocks of ice the two performers have not the faintest notion of the weight of the task they have undertaken i give a dinner afterwards and have just now been settling the bill of fare and selecting the wines  in the first excitement of the presidential impeachment our houses instantly went down after carefully considering the subject i decided to take advantage of the fact that next weeks four readings here have not yet been announced and to abolish them altogether nothing in this country lasts long and i think the public may be heartily tired of the presidents name by the 9th of march when i read at a considerable distance from here so behold me with a whole weeks holiday in view the boston audiences have come to regard the readings and the reader as their peculiar property and you would be at once amused and pleased if you could see the curious way in which they seem to plume themselves on both they have taken to applauding too whenever they laugh or cry and the result is very inspiriting i shall remain here until saturday the 7th but shall not read here after tomorrow night until the 1st of april when i begin my boston farewells six in number                                                          friday 28th  it has been snowing all night and the city is in a miserable condition we had a fine house last night for carol and trial and such an enthusiastic one that they persisted in a call after the carol and while i was out covered the little table with flowers the true american has taken a fresh start as if it were quite a novelty and is on the whole rather worse than ever today the cunard packet the australasian a poor ship is some days overdue and dolby is anxiously looking out for her there is a lull in the excitement about the president but the articles of impeachment are to be produced this afternoon and then it may set in again osgood came into camp last night from selling in remote places and reports that at rochester and buffalo both places near the frontier canada people bought tickets who had struggled across the frozen river and clambered over all sorts of obstructions to get them some of those halls turn out to be smaller than represented but i have no doubt to use an american expression that we shall get along  tomorrow fortnight we purpose being at the falls of niagara and then we shall turn back and really begin to wind up i have got to know the carol so well that i cant remember it and occasionally go dodging about in the wildest manner to pick up lost pieces they took it so tremendously last night that i was stopped every five minutes one poor young girl in mourning burst into a passion of grief about tiny tim and was taken out this is all my news  each of the pedestrians is endeavouring to persuade the other to take something unwholesome before starting   sidenote miss dickens                                      boston monday march 2nd 1868  a heavy gale of wind and a snowstorm oblige me to write suddenly for the cunard steamer a day earlier than usual the railroad between this and new york will probably be stopped somewhere after all the hard weather we have had this is the worst day we have seen  the walkingmatch came off on saturday over tremendously difficult ground against a biting wind and through deep snowwreaths it was so cold too that our hair beards eyelashes eyebrows were frozen hard and hung with icicles the course was thirteen miles they were close together at the turningpoint when osgood went ahead at a splitting pace and with extraordinary endurance and won by half a mile dolby did very well indeed and begs that he may not be despised in the evening i gave a very splendid dinner eighteen covers most magnificent flowers such table decoration as was never seen in these parts the whole thing was a great success and everybody was delighted  i am holidaymaking until friday when we start on the round of travel that is to bring us back here for the 1st of april my holidaymaking is simply thorough resting except on wednesday when i dine with longfellow there is still great political excitement but i hope it may not hurt us very much my fear is that it may damage the farewell dolby is not of my mind as to this and i hope he may be right we are not quite determined whether mrs fields did not desert our colours by coming on the ground in a carriage and having bread soaked in brandy put into the winning mans mouth as he steamed along she pleaded that she would have done as much for dolby if he had been ahead so we are inclined to forgive her as she had done so much for me in the way of flowers i thought i would show her a sight in that line at the dinner you never saw anything like it two immense crowns the base of the choicest exotics and the loops oval masses of violets in the centre of the table an immense basket overflowing with enormous bellmouthed lilies all round the table a bright green border of wreathed creeper with clustering roses at intervals a rose for every buttonhole and a bouquet for every lady they made an exhibition of the table before dinner to numbers of people  p h has just come in with a newspaper containing a reference in good taste to the walkingmatch he posts it to you by this post  it is telegraphed that the

surprisingly bad quite a triumph in that way we stood out for an hour in the melting snow and came in again having to change completely then we sat down by the stove no fireplace and there we are now

all that work be done including the curtains  as to the hall i have my doubts whether one of the parqueted floors made by aaron smiths of bond street ought not to be better than tiles for the reason that perhaps the nature of the houses construction might render the bed necessary for wooden flooring more easy to be made than the bed necessary for tiles i dont think you can do better than call in

sidenote mr w c macready                       springfield mass saturday march 21st 1868  my dearest macready  what with perpetual reading and travelling what with a true american catarrh on which i am complimented almost boastfully and what with one of the severest winters ever known your coals of fire received by the last mail did not burn my head so much as they might have done under less excusatory circumstances but they scorched it too  you would find the general aspect of america and americans decidedly much improved you would find immeasurably greater consideration and respect for your privacy than of old you would find a steady change for the better everywhere except oddly enough in the railroads generally which seem to have stood still while everything else has moved but there is an exception westward there the express trains have now a very delightful carriage called a drawingroom car literally a series of little private drawingrooms with sofas and a table in each opening out of a little corridor in each too is a large plateglass window with which you can do as you like as you pay extra for this luxury it may be regarded as the first move towards two classes of passengers when the railroad straight away to san francisco in six days shall be opened through it will not only have these drawingrooms but sleepingrooms too a bell in every little apartment communicating with a stewards pantry a restaurant a staff of servants marble washingstands and a barbers shop i looked into one of these cars a day or two ago and it was very ingeniously arranged and quite complete  i left niagara last sunday and travelled on to albany through three hundred miles of flood villages deserted bridges broken fences drifting away nothing but tearing water floating ice and absolute wreck and ruin the train gave in altogether at utica and the passengers were let loose there for the night as i was due at albany a very active superintendent of works did all he could to get mr dickens along and in the morning we resumed our journey through the water with a hundred men in sevenleague boots pushing the ice from before us with long poles how we got to albany i cant say but we got there somehow just in time for a triumphal carol and trial all the tickets had been sold and we found the albanians in a state of great excitement you may imagine what the flood was when i tell you that we took the passengers out of two trains that had their fires put out by the water fourandtwenty hours before and cattle from trucks that had been in the water i dont know how long but so long that the sheep had begun to eat each other it was a horrible spectacle and the haggard human misery of their faces was quite a new study there was a fine breath of spring in the air concurrently with the great thaw but lo and behold last night it began to snow again with a strong wind and today a snowdrift covers this place with all the desolation of winter once more i never was so tired of the sight of snow as to sleighing i have been sleighing about to that extent that i am sick of the sound of a sleighbell  i have seen all our boston friends except curtis ticknor is dead the rest are very little changed except that longfellow has a perfectly white flowing beard and long white hair but he does not otherwise look old and is infinitely handsomer than he was i have been constantly with them all and they have always talked much of you it is the established joke that boston is my native place and we hold all sorts of hearty foregatherings they all come to every reading and are always in a most delightful state of enthusiasm they give me a parting dinner at the club on the thursday before good friday to pass from boston personal to new york theatrical i will mention here that one of the proprietors of my new york hotel is one of the proprietors of niblos and the most active consequently i have seen the black crook and the white fawn in majesty from an armchair in the first entrance ps more than once of these astonishing dramas i beg to report seriously that i have found no human creature behind who has the slightest idea what they are about upon my honour my dearest macready and that having some amiable small talk with a neat little spanish woman who is the première danseuse i asked her in joke to let me measure her skirt with my dress glove holding the glove by the tip of the forefinger i found the skirt to be just three gloves long and yet its length was much in excess of the skirts of two hundred other ladies whom the carpenters were at that moment getting into their places for a transformation scene on revolving columns on wires and travellers in iron cradles up in the flies down in the cellars on every description of float that wilmot gone distracted could imagine  i have taken my passage for liverpool from new york in the cunarder russia on the 22nd of april i had the second officers cabin on deck coming out and i have the chief stewards cabin on deck going home because it will be on the sunny side of the ship i have experienced nothing here but good humour and cordiality in the autumn and winter i have arranged with chappells to take my farewell of reading in the united kingdom for ever and ever  i am delighted to hear of benvenutas marriage and i think her husband a very lucky man johnnie has my profound sympathy under his examinatorial woes the noble boy will give me gavazzi revised and enlarged i expect when i next come to cheltenham i will give you and mrs macready all my american experiences when you come to london or better still to gads meanwhile i send my hearty love to all not forgetting dear katie  niagara is not at all spoiled by a very dizzylooking suspension bridge is to have another still nearer to the horseshoe opened in july my last sight of that scene last sunday was thus we went up to the rapids above the horseshoesay two miles from itand through the great cloud of spray everything in the magnificent valleybuildings forest high banks air water everythingwas made of rainbow turners most imaginative drawing in his finest day has nothing in it so ethereal so gorgeous in

unwell to do it the writing day was last friday when i ought to have left boston for new bedford fiftyfive miles before eleven in the morning but i was so exhausted that i could not be got up and had to take my chance of an evenings train producing me in time to read which it just did with the return of snow nine days ago the true american which had lulled came back as bad as ever i have coughed from two or three in the morning until five or six and have been absolutely sleepless i have had no appetite besides and no taste last night here i took some laudanum and it is the only thing that has done me good but the life in this climate is so very hard when i did manage to get from boston to new bedford i read with my utmost force and vigour next morning well or ill i must turn out at seven to get back to boston on my way here  i dine at boston at three and at five must come on here a hundred and thirty miles or so for tomorrow night there being no sunday train tomorrow night i read here in a very large place and tuesday morning at six i must start again to get back to boston once more but after tomorrow night i have only the boston and new york farewells thank god i am most grateful to think that when we came to devise the details of the tour i foresaw that it could never be done as dolby and osgood proposed by one unassisted man as if he were a machine if i had not cut out the work and cut out canada i could never have gone there i am quite sure even as it is i have just now written to dolby who is in new york to see my doctor there and ask him to send me some composing medicine that i can take at night inasmuch as without sleep i cannot get through however sympathetic and devoted the people are about me they can not be got to comprehend that ones being able to do the two hours with spirit when the time comes round may be coexistent with the consciousness of great depression and fatigue i dont mind saying all this now that the labour is so nearly over you shall have a brighter account of me please god when i close this at boston                                                    monday march 30th  without any artificial aid i got a splendid nights rest last night and consequently am very much freshened up today yesterday i had a fine walk by the sea and today i have had another on the heights overlooking it                                                 boston tuesday 31st  i have safely arrived here just in time to add a line to that effect and get this off by tomorrows english mail from new york catarrh rather better everything triumphant last night except no sleep again i suppose dolby to be now on his way back to join me here i am much mistaken if the political crisis do not damage the farewells by almost one half  i hope that i am certainly better altogether  my room well decorated with flowers of course and mr and mrs fields coming to dinner they are the most devoted of friends and never in the way and never out of it   sidenote miss hogarth                                   boston wednesday april 1st 1868  i received your letter of from the 14th to the 17th of march here last night my new york doctor has prescribed for me promptly and i hope i am better i am certainly no worse we shall do to the best of my belief very well with the farewells here and at new york but not greatly everything is at a standstill pending the impeachment and the next presidential election i forgot whether i told you that the new york press are going to give me a public dinner on saturday the 18th  i hear but not from himself that wills has had a bad fall in hunting and is or has been laid up i am supposed i take it not to know this until i hear it from himself   thursday  my notion of the farewells is pretty certain now to turn out right it is not at all probable that we shall do anything enormous every pulpit in massachusetts will resound to violent politics today and tonight you remember the hutchinson family24 i have had a grateful letter from john hutchinson he speaks of my sister abby as living in new york the immediate object of his note is to invite me to the marriage of his daughter twentyone years of age  you will see by the evidence of this piece of paper that i am using up my stationery scott has just been making anxious calculations as to our powers of holding out in the articles of toothpowder etc the calculations encourage him to believe that we shall just hold out and no more i think i am still better today than i was yesterday but i am far from strong and have no appetite to see me at my little table at night you would think me the freshest of the fresh and this is the marvel of fields life  i dont forget that this is forsters birthday                                                 friday afternoon 3rd  catarrh worse than ever and we dont know at four whether i can read tonight or must stop otherwise all well   sidenote miss dickens                                     boston tuesday april 7th 1868  i not only read last friday when i was doubtful of being able to do so but read as i never did before and astonished the audience quite as much as myself you never saw or heard such a scene of excitement  longfellow and all the cambridge men urged me to give in i have been very near doing so but feel stronger today i cannot tell whether the catarrh may have done me any lasting injury in the lungs or other breathing organs until i shall have rested and got home i hope and believe not consider the weather there have been two snowstorms since i wrote last and today the town is blotted out in a ceaseless whirl of snow and wind  i cannot eat to anything like the ordinary extent and have established this system at seven in the morning in bed a tumbler of new cream and two tablespoonsful of rum at twelve a sherry cobbler and a biscuit at three dinner time a pint of champagne at five minutes to eight an egg beaten up with a glass of sherry between the parts the strongest beef tea that can be made drunk hot at a quarterpast ten soup and anything to drink that i can fancy i dont eat more than half a pound of solid food in the whole fourandtwenty hours if so much  if i hold out as i hope to do i shall be greatly pressed in leaving here and getting over to new york before next saturdays mail from there do not therefore if all be well expect to hear from me by saturdays mail but look for my last letter from america by the mail of the following wednesday the 15th be sure that you shall hear however by saturdays mail if i should knock up as to reading i am tremendously beat but i feel really and unaffectedly so much stronger today both in my body and hopes that i am much encouraged i have a fancy that i turned my worst time last night  dolby is as tender as a woman and as watchful as a doctor he never leaves me during the reading now but sits at the side of the platform and keeps his eye upon me all the time ditto george the gasman steadiest and most reliable man i ever employed i am the more hopeful of my not having to relinquish a reading because last night was copperfield and bobby a quarter of an hour the longest and in consideration of the storm by very much the most trying yet i was far fresher afterwards than i have been these three weeks  i have dombey to do tonight and must go through it carefully so here ends my report the

delighted to have your letter it comes to me like a faithful voice from dear old rockingham and awakens many memories  the work in america has been so very hard and the winter there has been so excessively severe that i really have been very unwell for some months but i had not been at sea three days on the passage home when i became myself again  if you will arrange with mary boyle any time for coming here we shall be charmed to see you and i will adapt my arrangements accordingly i make this suggestion because she generally comes here early in the summer season but if you will propose yourself anyhow giving me a margin of a few days in case of my being preengaged for this day or that we will as my american friends say fix it  what with travelling reading night after night and speechmaking day after day i feel the peace of the country beyond all expression on board ship coming home a deputation two in number of whom only one could get into my cabin while the other looked in

1868  my dear mrs cattermole  on my return from america just now i accidentally heard that george had been ill my sisterinlaw had heard it from forster but vaguely until i received your letter of wednesdays date i had no idea that he had been very ill and should have been greatly shocked by knowing it were it not for the hopeful and bright assurance you give me that he is greatly better  my old affection for him has never cooled the last time he dined with me i asked him to come again that day ten years for i was perfectly certain this was my small joke that i should not set eyes upon him sooner the time being fully up i hope you will remind him with my love that he is due his hand is upon these walls here so i should like him to see for himself and you to see for yourself and in this hope i shall pursue his complete recovery  i heartily sympathise with you in your terrible anxiety and in your vast relief and with many thanks for your letter am ever my dear mrs cattermole

america i have been so overwhelmed with business that i have not had time even to write to you you may imagine what six months of arrear are to dispose of added to this wills has received a concussion of the brain from an accident in the huntingfield and is sent away by the doctors and strictly prohibited from even writing a note consequently all the business and money details of all the year round devolve upon me and i have had to get them up for i have never had experience of them then i am suddenly entreated to go to paris to look after the french version of no thoroughfare on the stage and i go and come back leaving it a great success  i hope mrs macready and you have not abandoned the idea of coming here the expression of this hope is the principal if not the only object of this present note may the amiable secretary vouchsafe a satisfactory reply  katie mary and georgina send their very best love to your katie and mrs macready the undersigned is in his usual brilliant condition and indeed has greatly disappointed them at home here by coming back so brown and looking so well they expected a wreck and were at first much mortified but they are getting over it now  to my particular

austin25  my dear letitia  you will have had a telegram from me today i received your sad news by this mornings post they never without express explanation mind immediate on a letter addressed to the office because half the people who write there on business that does not press or on no business at all so mark their letters  on thursday i have people to see and matters to attend to both at the office and at coutts which in willss absence i cannot forego or depute to another but between ourselves i must add something else i have the greatest objection to attend a funeral in which my affections are not strongly and immediately concerned i have no notion of a funeral as a matter of form or ceremony and just as i should expressly prohibit the summoning to my own burial of anybody who was not very near or dear to me so i revolt from myself appearing at that solemn rite unless the deceased were very near or dear to me i cannot endure being dressed up by an undertaker as part of his trade show i was not in this poor good fellows house in his lifetime and i feel that i have no business there when he lies dead in it my mind is penetrated with sympathy and compassion for the young widow but that feeling is a real thing and my attendance as a mourner would not beto myself it would be to you i know but it would not be to myself i know full well that you cannot delegate to me your memories of and your associations with the deceased and the more true and tender they are the more invincible is my objection to become a form in the midst of the most awful realities  with

representation would do anything for george i sounded him having the opportunity of meeting him at dinner at cartwrights                                              ever yours affectionately

so i write today  i am very unwilling to abandon the christmas number though even in the case of my little christmas books which were immensely profitable i let the idea go when i thought it was wearing out ever since i came home i have hammered at it more or less and have been uneasy about it i have begun something which is very droll but it manifestly shapes itself towards a book and could not in the least admit of even that shadowy approach to a congruous whole on the part of other contributors which they have ever achieved at the best i have begun something else aboard the american mailsteamer but i dont like it because the stories must come limping in after the old fashion though of course what i have done will be good for a y r in short i have cast about with the greatest pains and patience and i have been wholly unable to find what i want  and yet i cannot quite make up my mind to give in without another fight for it i offered one hundred pounds reward at gads to anybody who could suggest a notion to satisfy me charles collins suggested one yesterday morning in which there is something though not much i will turn it over and over and try a few more starts on my own account finally i swear i will not give it up until august is out vow registered  i am clear that a number by various writers would not do if we have not the usual sort of number we must call the current number for that date the christmas number and make it as good as possible  i sit in the châlet26 like mariana in the moated grange and to as much purpose  i am buying the freehold of the meadow at gads and of an adjoining arable field so that i shall now have about eightandtwenty freehold acres in a ringfence no more now  i made up a very good number yesterday you will see in it a very short article that i have called now which is a highly remarkable piece of description it is done by a new man from whom i have accepted another article but he will never do anything so good

  wednesday aug 26th 1868  my dear cerjat  i was happy to receive your esteemed letter a few days ago  the severity of the winter in america which was quite exceptional even in that rigorous climate combined with the hard work i had to do tried me a good deal neuralgia and colds beset me either by turns or both together and i had often much to do to get through at night but the sea voyage home again did wonders in restoring me and i have been very well indeed though a little fatigued ever since i am now preparing for a final reading campaign in england scotland and ireland it will begin on the 6th of october and will probably last with short occasional intermissions until june  the great subject in england for the moment is the horrible accident to the irish mailtrain it is now supposed that the petroleum known to be a powerful anæsthetic rendered the unfortunate people who were burnt almost instantly insensible to any sensation my escape in the staplehurst accident of three years ago is not to be obliterated from my nervous system to this hour i have sudden vague rushes of terror even when riding in a hansom cab which are perfectly unreasonable but quite insurmountable i used to make nothing of driving a pair of horses habitually through the most crowded parts of london i cannot now drive with comfort to myself on the country roads here and i doubt if i could ride at all in the saddle my reading secretary and companion knows so well when one of these odd momentary seizures comes upon me in a railway carriage that he instantly produces a dram of brandy which rallies the blood to the heart and generally prevails i forget whether i ever told you that my watch a chronometer has never gone exactly since the accident so the irish catastrophe naturally revives the dreadful things i saw that day  the only other news here you know as well as i to wit that the country is going to be ruined and that the church is going to be ruined and that both have become so used to being ruined that they will go on perfectly well                                        sidenote miss dickens       office of all the year round no 26 wellington street

question i should waver now  but my conviction that i am more useful and more happy as i am than i could ever be in parliament is not to be shaken i considered it some weeks ago when i had a stirring proposal from the birmingham people and i then set it up on a rock for ever and a day  do tell mr russel that i truly feel this mark of confidence and that i hope to acknowledge it in person in

restraint and that with mere unmeaning forms i have no sympathy but i most strongly and affectionately impress upon you the priceless value of the new testament and the study of that book as the one unfailing guide in life deeply respecting it and bowing down before the character of our saviour as separated from the vain constructions and inventions of men you cannot go very wrong and will always preserve at heart a true spirit of veneration and humility similarly i impress upon you the habit of saying a christian prayer every night and morning these things have stood by me all through my life

road that the railway travelling over such a distance involves something more than thirty thousand shocks to the nerves dolby didnt like it at all  the signals for a gale were up at berwick and along the road between there and here it came on just as we arrived and blew tremendously hard all night the wind is still very high though the sky is bright and the sun shining we couldnt sleep for the

not to do the oliver murder until after the 5th of january when i shall ascertain its effect on a great audience it is curious to notice how the shadow of its coming affects the scotch mind there was such a disposition to hold back for it here until i return to finish in february that we had next to no let when we arrived it all came with a rush yesterday they gave me a most magnificent welcome

delivered at all the year round office yesterday i was attending a funeral it comes to hand here consequently today  i am diffident of addressing mr gladstone on the subject of your desire to be appointed to the vacant commissionership of inland revenue because although my respect for him and confidence in him are second to those of no man in england a bold word at this time but a truthful one my personal acquaintance with him is very slight but you may make through any of your friends any use you please of this letter towards the end of bringing its contents under mr gladstones notice  in expressing my conviction that you deserve the place and are in every way qualified for it i found my testimony upon as accurate a knowledge of your character and abilities as anyone can possibly have acquired in my editorship both of household words and all the year round you know very well that i have invariably offered you those subjects of political and social interest to write upon in which integrity exactness a remarkable power of generalising evidence and balancing facts and a special clearness in stating the case were indispensable on the part of the writer my confidence in your powers has never been misplaced and through all our literary intercourse you have never been hasty or wrong whatever trust you have undertaken has been so completely discharged that it has become my habit to read your proofs rather for my own edification than as in other cases for the detection of some slip here or there or the more pithy presentation of the subject  that your literary work has never interfered with the discharge of your official duties i may assume to be at least as well known to your colleagues as it is to me it is idle to say that if the post were in my gift you should have it because you have had for some years most of the posts of high trust that have been at my disposal an excellent public servant in your literary sphere of action i should be heartily glad if you could have this new opportunity of distinguishing yourself in the same character and this is at least unselfish in me for i suppose i should then lose you

this note today because your going away is much upon my mind and because i want you to have a few parting words from me to think of now and then at quiet times i need not tell you that i love you dearly and am very very sorry in my heart to part with you but this life is half made up of partings and these pains must be borne it is my comfort and my sincere conviction that you are going to try the life for which you are beat fitted i think its freedom and wildness more suited to you than any experiment in a study or office would ever have been and without that training you could have followed no other suitable occupation  what you have already wanted until now has been a set steady constant purpose i therefore exhort you to persevere in a thorough determination to do whatever you have to do as well as you can do it i was not so old as you are now when i first had to win my food and do this out of this determination and i have never slackened in it since  never take a mean advantage of anyone in any transaction and never be hard upon people who are in your power try to do to others as you would have them do to you and do not be discouraged if they fail sometimes it is much better for you that they should fail in obeying the greatest rule laid down by our saviour than that you should  i put a new testament among your books for the very same reasons and with the very same hopes that made me write an easy account of it for you when you were a little child because it is the best book that ever was or will be known in the world and because it teaches you the best lessons by which any human creature who tries to be truthful and faithful to duty can possibly be guided as your brothers have gone away one by one i have written to each such words as i am now writing to you and have entreated them all to guide themselves by this book putting aside the interpretations and inventions of men  you will remember that you have never at home been wearied about religious observances or mere formalities i have always been anxious not to weary my children with such things before they are old enough to form opinions respecting them you will therefore understand the better that i now most solemnly impress upon you the truth and beauty of the christian religion as it came from christ himself and the impossibility of your going far wrong if you humbly but heartily respect it  only one thing more on this head the more we are in earnest as to feeling it the less we are disposed to hold forth about it never abandon the wholesome practice of saying your own private prayers night and morning i have never abandoned it myself and i know the comfort of it  i hope you will always be able to say in after life that you had a kind father you cannot show your affection for him so well or make him so happy as by doing your duty                                               your affectionate father  footnotes  20 the agricultural college cirencester  21 no

year and were to have been continued until the end of may the work was even harder than it had ever been charles dickens began his country tour in ireland early in january and read continuously in all parts of england and scotland until the end of april a public dinner in commemoration of his last readings in the town was given to him at liverpool on the 10th april besides all this severe country work he was giving a series of readings at st jamess hall and reading the murder from oliver twist in london and in the country frequently four times a week in the second week of february a sudden and unusually violent attack of the old trouble in his foot made it imperatively necessary to postpone a reading at st jamess hall and to delay for a day or two his departure for scotland the foot continued to cause him pain and inconvenience but as will be seen from his letters he generally spoke of himself as otherwise well until he arrived at preston where he was to read on the 22nd of april the day before this appointed reading he writes home of some grave symptoms which he had observed in himself and had reported to his doctor mr f carr beard that gentleman taking alarm at what he considered indisputable evidences of overwork wisely resolved not to content himself with written consultations but went down to preston on the day appointed for the reading there and after seeing his patient peremptorily stopped it carried him off to liverpool and the next day to london there he consulted sir thomas watson who entirely corroborated mr beards opinion and the two doctors agreed that the course of readings must be stopped for this year and that reading combined with travelling must be stopped for ever charles dickens had no alternative but to acquiesce in this verdict but he felt it keenly not only for himself but for the sake of the messrs chappell who showed the most disinterested kindness and solicitude on the occasion he at once returned home to gads hill and the rest and quiet of the country restored him for the time to almost his usual condition of health and spirits but it was observed by all who loved him that from this time forth he never regained his old vigour and elasticity the attack at preston was the beginning of the end  during the spring and summer of this year he received visits from many dearly valued american friends in may he stayed with his daughter and sisterinlaw for two or three weeks at the st jamess hotel piccadilly having promised to be in london at the time of the arrival of mr and mrs fields of boston who visited europe accompanied by miss mabel lowell the daughter of the famous american poet this year besides these friends mr and mrs childs of philadelphiafrom whom he had received the greatest kindness and hospitality and for whom he had a hearty regarddr fordyce barker and his son mr eytinge an illustrator of an american edition of charles dickenss works and mr bayard taylor paid visits to gads hill which were thoroughly enjoyed by charles dickens and his family this last summer was a very happy one he had the annual summer visitors and parties of his friends in the neighbourhood he was as usual projecting improvements in his beloved country home one which he called the crowning improvement of all was a large conservatory which was to be added during the absence of the family in london in the following spring  the state of mr willss health made it necessary for him now to retire altogether from the editorship of all the year round charles dickenss own letters express the regret which he felt at the dissolution of this long and always pleasant association mr willss place at the office was filled by charles dickenss eldest son now sole editor and proprietor of the journal  in september charles dickens went to birmingham accompanied by his son harry and presided at the opening of the session of what he calls in his letter to mr arthur ryland our institution the midland institute he made a speech on education to the young students and promised to go back early in the following year and distribute the prizes in one of the letters which we give to mr ryland he speaks of himself as being in full force again and going to finish his farewell readings soon after christmas he had obtained the sanction of sir thomas watson to giving twelve readings in london only which he had fixed for the beginning of the following year  the letter to his friend mr finlay which opens the year was in reply to a proposal for a public banquet at belfast projected by the mayor of that town and conveyed through mr finlay this gentleman was at that time proprietor of the northern whig newspaper at belfast and he was soninlaw to mr alexander russel editor of the scotsman  charles dickenss letter this new year to m de cerjat was his last that faithful and affectionate friend died very shortly afterwards  to miss mary boyle he writes to acknowledge a new years gift which he had been much touched by receiving from her at a time when he knew she was deeply afflicted by the sudden death of her brother captain cavendish boyle for whom charles dickens had a true regard and friendship  while he was giving his series of london readings in the spring he received a numerously signed circular letter from actors and actresses of the various london theatres they were very curious about his new reading of the oliver twist murder and representing to him the impossibility of their attending an evening requested him to give a morning reading for their especial benefit we give his answer complying with the request and the occasion was to him a most gratifying and deeply interesting one  the letter to mr edmund ollier was in answer to an invitation to be present at the inauguration of a bust of mr leigh hunt which was to be placed over his grave at kensal green  the letter to mr shirley brooks the wellknown writer who succeeded mr mark lemon as editor of punch and for whom charles dickens had a cordial regard was on the subject of a memorial on behalf of mrs peter cunningham whose husband had recently died  the remarkable story of which he writes to his daughter in august was called an experience it was written by a lady who prefers to be anonymous who had been a contributor to household words from its first starting and was always highly valued in this capacity by charles dickens  our latest letters for this year are in october one to mr charles kent sympathising with him on a disappointment which he had experienced in a business undertaking and one to mr macready in which he tells him of his being in the preliminary agonies of a new book the first number of edwin drood was to appear before the end of his course of readings in march and he was at work so long

distinction on my part would be impracticable my time in ireland is all anticipated and i could not possibly prolong my stay because i must be back in london to read on tuesday fortnight and then must immediately set forth for the west of england it is not likely besides that i shall get through these farewells before the end of may and the work is so hard and my voice is so precious that i fear to add an ounce to the fatigue or i might be overweighted the avoidance of gas and crowds when i am not in the act of being cooked before those lights of mine is an essential part of the training to which as i think you know i strictly adhere and although i have accepted the liverpool invitation i have done so as an exception the liverpool people having always treated me in our public relations

next day i start for dublin and belfast i am just back from scotland for a few christmas holidays i go back there next month and in the meantime and afterwards go everywhere else  take my guarantee for it you may be quite comfortable on the subject of papal aspirations and encroachments the english people are in unconquerable opposition to that church they have the animosity in the blood derived from the history of the past though perhaps unconsciously but they do sincerely want to win ireland over if they can they know that since the union she has been hardly used they know that scotland has her religion and a very uncomfortable one they know that scotland though intensely antipapal perceives it to be unjust that ireland has not her religion too and has very emphatically declared her opinion in the late elections they know that a richlyendowed church forced upon a people who dont belong to it is a grievance with these people they know that many things but especially an artfully and schemingly managed institution like the romish church thrive upon a grievance and that rome has thriven exceedingly upon this and made the most of it lastly the best among them know that there is a gathering cloud in the west considerably bigger than a mans hand under which a powerful irishamerican body rich and active is always drawing ireland in that direction and that these are not times in which other powers would back our holding ireland by force unless we could make our claim good in proving fair and equal government  poor townshend charged me in his will to publish without alteration his religious opinions which he sincerely believed would tend to the happiness of mankind to publish them without alteration is absolutely impossible for they are distributed in the strangest fragments through the strangest notebooks pocketbooks slips of paper and what not and produce a most incoherent and tautological result i infer that he must have held some alwayspostponed idea of fitting them together for these reasons i would certainly publish nothing about them if i had any discretion in the matter having none i suppose a book must be made his pictures and rings are gone to

and gamp we immediately telegraphed to the office answer no books there as my impression was that he must have left them at st jamess hall we then arranged to send him up to london at seven this morning meanwhile though not reproached he wept copiously and audibly i had asked him over and over again was he sure he had not put them in my large black trunk too sure too sure hadnt opened that trunk after tuesday nights reading he opened it to get some clothes out when i went to bed and there the books were he produced them with an air of injured surprise as if we had put them there

those sad words about his suffering and fear that the end is not far off  we are very comfortably housed here and certainly that immense hall is a wonderful place for its size without much greater

ladies are to dine at the dinner and we hear it is to be a very grand affair dolby is doubtful whether it may not hurt the business by drawing a great deal of money in another direction which i think possible enough trade is very bad here and the gloom of the preston strike seems to brood over the place the titiens company have been doing wretchedly i should have a greater sympathy with them if

 both my feet are very tender and often feel as though they were in hot water but i was wonderfully well and strong thank god and had no end of voice for the two nights running in that great birmingham hall we had enormous houses  so far as i understand the dinner arrangements here they are much too long as to the acoustics of that hall and the position of the tables both as bad as bad can be my only consolation is that if anybody can be heard i probably can be the honorary secretary tells me that six hundred people are to dine the mayor being no speaker and out of health besides hands over the toast of the evening to lord dufferin the town is full of the festival the theatre royal touched up for the occasion will look remarkably bright and well for the readings and our lets are large it is remarkable that our largest let as yet is for thursday not friday i infer that the dinner damages friday but dolby does not think so there appears to be great curiosity to hear the murder on friday night last i read to two thousand people and odd hundreds  i hear that anthony trollope dixon lord houghton lemon esquiros of the revue des deux mondes and sala are to be called upon to speak the last for the newspaper press all the liverpool notabilities are to muster and manchester is to be represented by its mayor with due formality  i had been this morning to look at st georges hall and suggest what can be done to improve its acoustics as usually happens in such cases their most important arrangements are already made and unchangeable i should not have placed the tables in the committees way at all and could certainly have placed the daïs to much greater advantage so all the good i could do was to show where banners could be hung with some hope of stopping echoes such is my small news soon exhausted we arrived here at three yesterday afternoon it is now midday chorley has not yet appeared but he had called at the local agents while i was at birmingham  it is a curious little instance of the way in which things fit together that there is a shipofwar in the mersey whose flags and so forth are to be brought up to st georges hall for the dinner she is the donegal of which paynter told me he had just been captain when he told me all about sydney at bath  one of the pleasantest things i have experienced here this time is the manner in which i am stopped in the streets by working men who want to shake hands with me and tell me they know my books i never go out but this happens down at the docks just now a cooper with a fearful stutter presented himself in this way his modesty combined with a conviction that if he were in earnest i would see it and wouldnt repel him made up as true a piece of natural politeness as i ever saw

comfort for my dear old friend  i am happy to report myself perfectly well and flourishing we are just now announcing the resumption and conclusion of the broken series of farewell readings in a

competitorsto whomsoever will tell me what idea in this second part is mine i dont mean an idea in language in the turning of a sentence in any little description of an action or a gesture or what not in a small way but an idea distinctly affecting the whole story as i found it you are all to assume that i found it in the main as you read it with one exception if i had written it i should have made

friday aug 13th 1869  my dear mr ryland  many thanks for your letter  i have very strong opinions on the subject of speechification and hold that there is everywhere a vast amount too much of it a sense of absurdity would be so strong upon me if i got up at birmingham to make a flourish on the advantages of education in the abstract for all sorts and conditions of men that i should inevitably check myself and present a surprising incarnation of the soul of wit but if i could interest myself in the practical usefulness of the particular institution in the ways of life of the students in their examples of perseverance and determination to get on in their numbers their favourite studies the number of hours they must daily give to the work that must be done for a livelihood before they can devote themselves to the acquisition of new knowledge and so forth then i could interest others this is the kind of information i want mere holding forth i utterly detest abominate and abjure  i fear i shall not be in london next week but if you will kindly send me here at your leisure the roughest notes of such points as i have indicated i shall be heartily obliged to you and will take care of their falling into shape and order in my mind meantime i make a note of monday 27th september and of writing to you touching your kind offer of hospitality three weeks before that date  i beg to

as sacrificing pleasure to the work i have to do and to the training under which alone i can do it without feeling it  you will see from the enclosed that i am in full force and going to finish my readings please god after christmas i am in the hope of receiving your promised notes in due course and continue in the irreverent condition in which i last reported myself on the subject of speechmaking now that men not only make the nights of the session hideous by what the americans call orating in parliament but trouble the peace of the vacation by saying over again what they said there with the addition of what they didnt say there and never will have the courage to say there i feel indeed that silence like gold across the atlantic is a rarity at a premium

prospect which has been received with nine times nine and one more by the whole house you will hardly know the place again it is so changed you are not expected to admire but there is a conservatory building at this momentbe still my soul  this leaves me in the preliminary agonies of a new book which i hope to begin publishing in twelve numbers not twenty next march the coming readings being all in london and being after the first fortnight only once a week will divert my attention very little i hope  harry has just gone up to cambridge again and i hope will get a fellowship in good time

welcome visitor at gads hill  30 of the guild of literature and art  31 the housekeeper at the office     1870  narrative   charles dickens passed his last christmas and new years day at gads hill with a party of family and friends in the usual way except that he was suffering again from an attack of the foot trouble particularly on christmas day when he was quite disabled by it and unable to walk at allable only to join the party in the evening by keeping his room all day however he was better in a day or two and early in january he went to london where he had taken the house of his friends mr and mrs milner gibson for the season  his series of farewell readings at st jamess hall began in january and ended on the 16th march he was writing edwin drood also and was of course constantly occupied with all the year round work in the beginning of january he fulfilled his promise of paying a second visit to birmingham and making a speech of which he writes in his last letter to mr macready  for his last reading he gave the christmas carol and the trial from pickwick and at the end of the evening he addressed a few farewell words to his audience it was a memorable and splendid occasion he was very deeply affected by the loving enthusiasm of his greeting and it was a real sorrow to him to give up for ever the personal associations with thousands of the readers of his books but when the pain mingled with pleasure of this last reading was over he felt greatly the relief of having undisturbed time for his own quieter pursuits and looked forward to writing the last numbers of edwin drood at gads hill where he was to return in june  the last public appearance of any kind that he made was at the royal academy dinner in may he was at the time far from well but he made a great effort to be present and to speak from his strong desire to pay a tribute to the memory of his dear old friend mr maclise who died in april  her majesty having expressed a wish conveyed through mr helps afterwards sir arthur helps to have a personal interview with charles dickens he accompanied mr helps to buckingham palace one afternoon in march he was most graciously and kindly received by her majesty and came away with a hope that the visit had been mutually agreeable the queen presented him with a copy of her journal in the highlands with an autograph inscription and he had afterwards the pleasure of requesting her acceptance of a set of his books he attended a levée held by the prince of wales in april and the last time he dined out in london was at a party given by lord houghton for the king of the belgians and the prince of wales who had both expressed a desire to meet charles dickens all through the season he had been suffering at intervals from the swollen foot and on this occasion it was so bad that up to the last moment it was very doubtful whether he could fulfil his engagement  we have very few letters for this year and none of any very particular interest but we give them all as they are the last  mr s l fildes was his new illustrator to whom he alludes in a note to mr frith we also give a short note to mr fildes himself  the correspondence of charles dickens with mrs dallas glyn the celebrated actress for whom he had a great friendship is so much on the subject of her own business that we have only been able to select two notes of any public interest  in explanation of the last letter we give an extract from a letter addressed to the daily news by mr j m makeham soon after the death of charles dickens as follows that the public may exactly understand the circumstances under which charles dickenss letter to me was written i am bound to explain that it is in reply to a letter which i addressed to him in reference to a passage in the tenth chapter of edwin drood respecting which i ventured to suggest that he had perhaps forgotten that the figure of speech alluded to by him in a way which to my certain knowledge was distasteful to some of his admirers was drawn from a passage of holy writ which is greatly reverenced by a large number of his countrymen as a prophetic description of the sufferings of our saviour  the ms of the little history of the new testament is now in the possession of his eldest daughter she has together with her aunt received many earnest entreaties both from friends and strangers that this history might be allowed to be published for the benefit of other children  these many petitions have his daughters fullest sympathy but she knows that her father wrote this history only for his own children that it was his particular wish that it never should be published and she therefore holds this wish as sacred and irrevocable   sidenote mr w h wills              5 hyde park place london w sunday jan 23rd 1870  my dear wills  in the note i had from you about nancy and sikes you seem to refer to some other note you had written me therefore i think it well merely to mention that i have received no other note  i do not wonder at your not being up to the undertaking even if you had had no cough under the wearing circumstances it was a very curious scene the actors and actresses most of the latter looking very pretty mustered in extraordinary force and were a fine audience i set myself to carrying out of themselves and their observation those who were bent on watching how the effects were got and i believe i succeeded coming back to it again however i feel it was madness ever to do it so continuously my ordinary pulse is seventytwo and it runs up under this effort to one hundred and twelve besides which it takes me ten or twelve minutes to get my wind back at all i being in the meantime like the man who lost the fightin fact his express image frank beard was in attendance to make divers experiments to report to watson and although as you know he stopped it instantly when he found me at preston he was very much astonished by the effects of the reading on the reader  so i hope you may be able to come and hear it before it is silent for ever it is done again on the evenings of the 1st february 15th february and 8th march i hope now i have got over the mornings that i may be able to work on my book but up to this time the great preparation required in getting the subjects up again and the twice a week besides have almost exclusively occupied me  i have something the matter with my right thumb and cant as you see write plainly i sent a word to poor robert chambers32 and i send my love to mrs wills                              ever

new long story here by sowing your name broadcast in so many fields at once and undertaking such an impossible amount of fiction at one time just as you are coming on with us you have another story in progress in the gentlemans magazine and another announced in once a week and so far as i know the art we both profess it cannot be reasonably pursued in this way i think the short story you are now finishing in these pages obviously marked by traces of great haste and small consideration and a long story similarly blemished would really do the publication irreparable harm  these considerations are so much upon my mind that i cannot forbear representing them to you in the hope that they may induce you to take a little more into account the necessity of care and preparation and some selfdenial in the quantity done i am quite sure that i write fully as much in your interest as in that of all the year round                                    believe me always faithfully yours

ever had a thought to the contrary your explanation is as it naturally would be being yours manly and honest and i am both satisfied and hopeful

lose the point that narrowminded fanatics who decry the theatre and defame its artists are absolutely the advocates of depraved and barbarous amusements for wherever a good drama and a wellregulated theatre decline some distorted form of theatrical entertainment will infallibly arise in their place in one of the last chapters of hard times mr sleary says something to the effect people will be

what is perfectly truethat i leave town for the peaceful following of my own pursuits at the end of next month that i have excused myself from filling all manner of claims on the ground that the public engagements i could make for the season were very few and were all made and that i cannot bear hot rooms when i am at work i have smoothed this as you would have me smooth it  with your longing for fresh air i can thoroughly sympathise may you get it soon and may you enjoy it and profit by it half as much as i wish                                                  ever faithfully yours

april 25th 1870  my dear kent  i received your book35 with the greatest pleasure and heartily thank you for it it is a volume of a highly prepossessing appearance and a most friendly look i felt as if i should have taken to it at sight even a very large even though i had known nothing of its contents or of its author  for the last week i have been most perseveringly and dingdongdoggedly at work making headway but slowly the spring always has a restless influence over me and i weary at any season of this london diningout beyond expression and i yearn for the country again this is my excuse for not having written to you sooner besides which i had a baseless conviction that i should see you at the office last thursday not having done so i fear you must be worse or no better if you can let me have a report of yourself pray do   sidenote mrs frederick pollock                        5 hyde park place w monday may 2nd 1870  my dear mrs pollock  pray tell the illustrious philip van artevelde that i will deal with the nefarious case in question if i can i am a little doubtful of the practicability of doing so and frisking outside the bounds of the law of libel i have that high opinion of the law of england generally which one is likely to derive from the impression that it puts all the honest men under the diabolical hoofs of all the scoundrels it makes me cautious of doing right an admirable instance of its wisdom  i was very sorry to have gone astray from you that sunday but as the earlier disciples entertained angels unawares so the later often miss them haphazard

which will yield to nothing but days of fomentation and horizontal rest set in last night and has caused me very great pain ever since and will too clearly be no better until it has had its usual time

sensitiveness to put any covering upon it except scalding fomentations having viciously bubbled and blistered it in all directions i hope it now begins to see the folly of its ways

change of air on the road my sense of your interest cannot be better proved than by my trying the remedy you recommend and that i will do immediately as i shall be in town on thursday my troubling you to order it would be quite unjustifiable i will use your name in applying for it and will report the result after a fair trial whether this remedy succeeds or fails as to the neuralgia i shall always

would be quite inconceivable i thinkbut for your letterthat any reasonable reader could possibly attach a scriptural reference to a passage in a book of mine reproducing a much abused social figure of speech impressed into all sorts of service on all sorts of inappropriate occasions without the faintest connexion of it with its original source i am truly shocked to find that any reader can make the mistake  i have always striven in my writings to express veneration for the life and lessons of our saviour because i feel it and because i rewrote that history for my childrenevery one of whom knew it from having it repeated to themlong before they could read and almost as soon as they could speak  but i have never made proclamation of this from the house tops                                            faithfully yours                                                        charles dickens  john m markham esq  all through this spring in london charles dickens had been ailing in health and it was remarked by many friends that he had a weary look and was aged and altered but he was generally in good spirits and his family had no uneasiness about him relying upon the country quiet and comparative rest at gads hill to have their usual influence in restoring his health and strength on the 2nd june he attended a private play at the house of mr and mrs freake where his two daughters were among the actresses the next day he went back to gads hill his daughter kate whose home was there at all times when she chose and almost always through the summer months went down on sunday the 5th june for a days visit to see the great improvement of the conservatory her father laughingly assured her she had now seen the last improvement at gads hill at this time he was tolerably well but she remarked to her sister and aunt how strangely he was tired and what a curious grey colour he had in his face after a very short walk on that sunday afternoon however he seemed quite himself again in the evening the next day his daughter kate went back accompanied by her sister who was to pay her a short visit to london  charles dickens was very hard at work on the sixth number of edwin drood on the monday and tuesday he was well but he was unequal to much exercise his last walk was one of his greatest favouritesthrough cobham park and woodon the afternoon of tuesday  on the morning of wednesday the 8th one of the loveliest days of a lovely summer he was very well in excellent spirits about his book of which he said he must finish his number that daythe next thursday being the day of his weekly visit to all the year round office therefore he would write all day in the châlet and take no walk or drive until the evening in the middle of the day he came to the house for an hours rest and smoked a cigar in the conservatoryout of which new addition to the house he was taking the greatest personal enjoymentand seemed perfectly well and exceedingly cheerful and hopeful when he came again to the house about an hour before the time fixed for the early dinner he seemed very tired silent and absorbed but this was so usual with him after a day of engrossing work that it caused no alarm or surprise to his sisterinlawthe only member of his household who happened to be at home he wrote some lettersamong them these last letters which we givein the library of the house and also arranged many trifling business matters with a view to his departure for london the next morning he was to be accompanied on his return at the end of the week by mr fildes to introduce the new illustrator to the neighbourhood in which many of the scenes of this last book of charles dickens as of his first were laid  it was not until they were seated at the dinnertable that a striking change in the colour and expression of his face startled his sisterinlaw and on her asking him if he was ill he said yes very ill i have been very ill for the last hour but on her expressing an intention of sending instantly for a doctor he stopped her and said no he would go on with dinner and go afterwards to london and then he made an effort to struggle against the fit that was fast coming on him and talked but incoherently and soon very indistinctly it being now evident that he was ill and very seriously ill his sisterinlaw begged him to come to his own room before she sent off for medical help come and lie down she entreated yes on the ground he said very distinctlythese were the last words he spokeand he slid from her arm and fell upon the floor  the servants brought a couch into the diningroom where he was laid a messenger was despatched for mr steele the rochester doctor and with a telegram to his doctor in london and to his daughters this was a few minutes after six oclock  his daughters arrived with mr frank beard this same evening his eldest son the next morning and his son henry and his sister letitia in the evening of the 9thtoo late alas  all through the night charles dickens never opened his eyes or showed a sign of consciousness in the afternoon of the 9th dr russell reynolds arrived at gads hill having been summoned by mr frank beard to meet himself and mr steele but he could only confirm their hopeless verdict and made his opinion known with much kind sympathy to the family before returning to london  charles dickens remained in the same unconscious state until the evening of this day when at ten minutes past six the watchers saw a shudder pass over him heard him give a deep sigh saw one tear roll down his cheek and he was gone from them and as they saw the dark shadow steal across his calm beautiful face not one among themcould they have been given such a powerwould have recalled his sweet spirit back to earth  as his family were aware that charles dickens had a wish to be buried near gads hill arrangements were made for his burial in the pretty churchyard of shorne a neighbouring village of which he was very fond but this intention was abandoned in consequence of a pressing request from the dean and chapter of rochester cathedral that his remains might be placed there a grave was prepared and everything arranged when it was made known to the family through dean stanley that there was a general and very earnest desire that charles dickens should find his restingplace in westminster abbey to such a fitting tribute to his memory they could make no possible objection although it was with great regret that they relinquished the idea of laying him in a place so closely identified with his life and his works his name notwithstanding is associated with rochester a tablet to his memory having been placed by his executors on the wall of rochester cathedral  with regard to westminster abbey his family only stipulated that the funeral might be made as private as possible and that the words of his will i emphatically direct that i be buried in an inexpensive unostentatious and strictly private manner should be religiously adhered to and so they were the solemn service in the vast cathedral being as private as the most thoughtful consideration could make it  the family of charles dickens were deeply grateful to all in authority who so carried out his wishes and more especially to dean stanley and to the late lady augusta stanley for the tender sympathy shown by them to the mourners on this day and also on sunday the 19th when the dean preached his beautiful funeral sermon  as during his life charles dickenss fondness for air light and gay colours amounted almost to a passion so when he lay dead in the home he had so dearly loved these things were not forgotten  the pretty room opening into the conservatory from which he had never been removed since his seizure was kept bright with the most beautiful of all kinds of flowers and flooded with the summer sun          and nothing stirred in the room the old old         fashion the fashion that came in with our         first garments and will
