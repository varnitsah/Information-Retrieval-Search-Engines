moved by the words and by the significance of his glance i turned in my chair  the door had opened and under the lintel stood the thickset figure of the comte de chatellerault before him a lacquey in my escutcheoned livery of redandgold was receiving with back obsequiously bent his hat and cloak  a sudden hush fell upon the assembly where a moment ago this very man had been the subject of our talk and silenced were the wits that but an instant since had been making free with his name and turning the languedoc courtshipfrom which he was newly returned with the shame of defeatinto a subject for heartless mockery and jest surprise was in the air for we had heard that chatellerault was crushed by his illfortune in the lists of cupid and we had not looked to see him joining so soon a board at whichor so at least i boastedmirth presided  and so for a little space the count stood pausing on my threshold whilst we craned our necks to contemplate him as though he had been an object for inquisitive inspection then a smothered laugh from the brainless la fosse seemed to break the spell i frowned it was a climax of discourtesy whose impression i must at all costs efface  i leapt to my feet with a suddenness that sent my chair gliding a full halfyard along the glimmering parquet of the floor and in two strides i had reached the count and put forth my hand to bid him welcome he took it with a leisureliness that argued sorrow he advanced into the full blaze of the candlelight and fetched a dismal sigh from the depths of his portly bulk  you are surprised to see me monsieur le marquis said he and his tone seemed to convey an apology for his comingfor his very existence almost  now nature had made my lord of chatellerault as proud and arrogant as lucifersome resemblance to which illustrious personage his downtrodden retainers were said to detect in the lineaments of his swarthy face environment had added to that store of insolence wherewith nature had equipped him and the kings favourin which he was my rivalhad gone yet further to mould the peacock attributes of his vain soul so that this wondrous humble tone of his gave me pause for to me it seemed that not even a courtship gone awry could account for it in such a man  i had not thought to find so many here said he and his next words contained the cause of his dejected air the king monsieur de bardelys has refused to see me and when the sun is gone we lesser bodies of the courtly firmament must needs turn for light and comfort to the moon and he made me a sweeping bow  meaning that i rule the night quoth i and laughed the figure is more playful than exact for whilst the moon is cold and cheerless me you shall find ever warm and cordial i could have wished monsieur de chatellerault that your gracing my board were due to a circumstance less untoward than his majestys displeasure  it is not for nothing that they call you the magnificent he answered with a fresh bow insensible to the sting in the tail of my honeyed words  i laughed and setting compliments to rest with that i led him to the table  ganymede a place here for monsieur le comte gilles antoine see to monsieur de chatellerault basile wine for monsieur le comte bestir there  in a moment he was become the centre of a very turmoil of attention my lacqueys flitted about him buzzing and insistent as bees about a rose would monsieur taste of this capon a la casserole or of this truffled peacock would a slice of this juicy ham a langlaise tempt monsieur le comte or would he give himself the pain of trying this turkey aux olives here was a salad whose secret monsieur le marquiss cook had learnt in italy and here a volauvent that was invented by quelon himself  basile urged his wines upon him accompanied by a page who bore a silver tray laden with beakers and wagons would monsieur le comte take white armagnac or red anjou this was a burgundy of which monsieur le marquis thought highly and this a delicate lombardy wine that his majesty had oft commended or perhaps monsieur de chatellerault would prefer to taste the last vintage of bardelys  and so they plagued him and bewildered him until his choice was made and even then a couple of them held themselves in readiness behind his chair to forestall his slightest want indeed had he been the very king himself no greater honour could we have shown him at the hotel de bardelys  but the restraint that his coming had brought with it hung still upon the company for chatellerault was little loved and his presence there was much as that of the skull at an egyptian banquet  for of all these fairweather friends that sat about my tableamongst whom there were few that had not felt his poweri feared there might be scarcely one would have the grace to dissemble his contempt of the fallen favourite that he was fallen as much his words as what already we had known had told us  yet in my house i would strive that he should have no foretaste of that coldness that tomorrow all paris would be showing him and to this end i played the host with all the graciousness that role may bear and overwhelmed him with my cordiality whilst to thaw all iciness from the bearing of my other guests i set the wines to flow more freely still my dignity would permit no less of me else would it have seemed that i rejoiced in a rivals downfall and took satisfaction from the circumstance that his disfavour with the king was like to result in my own further exaltation  my efforts were not wasted slowly the mellowing influence of the grape pronounced itself to this influence i added that of such wit as heaven has graced me with and by a word here and another there i set myself to lash their mood back into the joviality out of which his coming had for the moment driven it  and so presently goodhumour spread her mantle over us anew and quip and jest and laughter decked our speech until the noise of our merrymaking drifting out through the open windows must have been borne upon the breeze of that august night down the rue saintdominique across the rue de lenfer to the very ears perhaps of those within the luxembourg telling them that bardelys and his friends kept another of those revels which were become a byword in paris and had contributed not a little to the sobriquet of magnificent which men gave me  but later as the toasts grew wild and were pledged less for the sake of the toasted than for that of the wine itself wits grew more barbed and less restrained by caution recklessness hung a moment like a bird of prey above us then swooped abruptly down in the words of that fool la fosse  messieurs he lisped with that fatuousness he affected and with his eye fixed coldly upon chatellerault i have a toast for you he rose carefully to his feethe had arrived at that condition in which to move with care is of the first importance he shifted his eye from the count to his glass which stood half empty he signed to a lacquey to fill it to the brim gentlemen he commanded then in the silence that ensued he attempted to stand with one foot on the ground and one on his chair but encountering difficulties of balance he remained uprightsafer if less picturesque  messieurs i give you the most peerless the most beautiful the most difficult and cold lady in all france i drink to those her thousand graces of which fame has told us and to that greatest and most vexing charm of allher cold indifference to man i pledge you too the swain whose good fortune it maybe to play endymion to this diana  it will need pursued la fosse who dealt much in mythology and classic loreit will need an adonis in beauty a mars in valour an apollo in song and a very eros in love to accomplish it and i fear me he hiccoughed that it will go unaccomplished since the one man in all france on whom we have based our hopes has failed gentlemen to your feet i give you the matchless roxalanne de lavedan  such amusement as i felt was tempered by apprehension i shot a swift glance at chatellerault to mark how he took this pleasantry and this pledging of the lady whom the king had sent him to woo but whom he had failed to win he had risen with the others at la fosses bidding either unsuspicious or else deeming suspicion too flimsy a thing by which to steer conduct yet at the mention of her name a scowl darkened his ponderous countenance he set down his glass with such sudden force that its slender stem was snapped and a red stream of wine streaked the white tablecloth and spread around a silver flowerbowl the sight of that stain recalled him to himself and to the manners he had allowed himself for a moment to forget  bardelys a thousand apologies for my clumsiness he muttered  spilt wine i laughed is a good omen  and for once i accepted that belief since but for the shedding of that wine and its sudden effect upon him it is likely we had witnessed a shedding of blood thus was the illtimed pleasantry of my featherbrained la fosse tided over in comparative safety but the topic being raised was not so easily abandoned mademoiselle de lavedan grew to be openly discussed and even the counts courtship of her came to be hinted at at first vaguely then pointedly with a lack of delicacy for which i can but blame the wine with which these gentlemen had made a salad of their senses in growing alarm i watched the count but he showed no further sign of irritation he sat and listened as though no jot concerned there were moments when he even smiled at some lively sally and at last he went so far as to join in that merry combat of wits and defend himself from their attacks which were made with a goodhumour that but thinly veiled the dislike he was held in and the satisfaction that was culled from his late discomfiture  for a while i hung back and took no share in the banter that was toward but in the endlured perhaps by the spirit in which i have shown that chatellerault accepted it and lulled by the wine which in common with my guests i may have abusedi came to utter words but for which this story never had been written  chatellerault i laughed abandon these defensive subterfuges confess that you are but uttering excuses and acknowledge that you have conducted this affair with a clumsiness unpardonable in one equipped with your advantages of courtly rearing  a flush overspread his face the first sign of anger since he had spilled his wine  your successes bardelys render you vain and of vanity is presumption born he replied contemptuously  see i cried appealing to the company observe how he seeks to evade replying nay but you shall confess your clumsiness  a clumsiness murmured la fosse drowsily as signal as that which attended pans wooing of the queen of lydia  i have no clumsiness to confess he answered hotly raising his voice it is a fine thing to sit here in paris among the languid dull and nerveless beauties of the court whose favours are easily won because they look on dalliance as the best pastime offered them and are eager for such opportunities of it as you fleering coxcombs will afford them but this mademoiselle de lavedan is of a vastly different mettle she is a woman not a doll she is flesh and blood not sawdust powder and vermilion she has a heart and a will not a spirit corrupted by vanity and licence  la fosse burst into a laugh  hark o hark he cried to the apostle of the chaste  saint gris exclaimed another this good chatellerault has lost both heart and head to her  chatellerault glanced at the speaker with an eye in which anger smouldered  you have said it i agreed he has fallen her victim and so his vanity translates her into a compound of perfections does such a woman as you have described exist comte bah in a lovers mind perhaps or in the pages of some crackbrained poets fancies but nowhere else in this dull world of ours  he made a gesture of impatience  you have been clumsy chatellerault i insisted  you have lacked address the woman does not live that is not to be won by any man who sets his mind to do it if only he be of her station and have the means to maintain her in it or raise her to a better a womans love sir is a tree whose root is vanity your attentions flatter her and predispose her to capitulate then if you but wisely choose your time to deliver the attack and do so with the necessary adroitnessnor is overmuch demandedthe battle is won with ease and she surrenders believe me chatellerault i am a younger man than you by full five years yet in experience i am a generation older and i talk of what i know  he sneered heavily if to have begun your career of dalliance at the age of eighteen with an amour that resulted in a scandal be your title to experience i agree said he but for the rest bardelys for all your fine talk of conquering women believe me when i tell you that in all your life you have never met a woman for i deny the claim of these court creatures to that title if you would know a woman go to lavedan monsieur le marquis if you would have your army of amorous wiles suffer a defeat at last go employ it against the citadel of roxalanne de lavedans heart if you would be humbled in your pride betake yourself to lavedan  a challenge roared a dozen voices a challenge bardelys  mais voyons i deprecated with a laugh would you have me journey into languedoc and play at wooing this embodiment of all the marvels of womanhood for the sake of making good my argument of your charity gentlemen insist no further  the neverfailing excuse of the boaster sneered chatellerault when desired to make good his boast  monsieur conceives that i have made a boast quoth i keeping my temper  your words suggested oneelse i do not know the meaning of words they suggested that where i have failed you could succeed if you had a mind to try i have challenged you bardelys i challenge you again go about this wooing as you will dazzle the lady with your wealth and your magnificence with your servants your horses your equipages and all the splendours you can command yet i make bold to say that not a year of your scented attentions and most insidious wiles will bear you fruit are you sufficiently challenged  but this is rank frenzy i protested why should i undertake this thing  to prove me wrong he taunted me to prove me clumsy come bardelys what of your spirit  i confess i would do much to afford you the proof you ask but to take a wife pardi that is much indeed  bah he sneered you do well to draw back you are wise to avoid discomfiture this lady is not for you when she is won it will be by some bold and gallant gentleman and by no mincing squire of dames no courtly coxcomb no fop of the luxembourg be his experiences of dalliance never so vast  po cap de dieu growled cazalet who was a gascon captain in the guards and who swore strange southern oaths up bardelys afoot prove your boldness and your gallantry or be forever shamed a squire of dames a courtly coxcomb a fop of the luxembourg mordemondieu i have given a man a bellyful of steel for the half of those titles  i heeded him little and as little the other noisy babblers who now on their feetthose that could standwere spurring me excitedly to accept the challenge until from being one of the baiters it seemed that of a sudden the tables were turned and i was become the baited i sat in thought revolving the business in my mind and frankly liking it but little doubts of the issue were i to undertake it i had none  my views of the other sex were neither more nor less than my words to the count had been calculated to convey it may bei know now that it was that the women i had known fitted chatelleraults description and were not overdifficult to win hence such successes as i had had with them in such comedies of love as i had been engaged upon had given me a false impression but such at least was not my opinion that night i was satisfied that chatellerault talked wildly and that no such woman lived as he depicted cynical and soured you may account me such i know i was accounted in paris a man satiated with all that wealth and youth and the kings favour could give him stripped of illusions of faith and of zest the very magnificenceso enviedof my existence affording me more disgust than satisfaction since already i had gauged its shallows  is it strange therefore that in this challenge flung at me with such insistence a business that at first i disliked grew presently to beckon me with its novelty and its promise of new sensations  is your spirit dead monsieur de bardelys chatellerault was gibing when my silence had endured some moments is the cock that lately crowed so lustily now dumb look you monsieur le marquis you are accounted here a reckless gamester will a wager induce you to this undertaking  i leapt to my feet at that his derision cut me like a whip if what i did was the act of a braggart yet it almost seems i could do no less to bolster up my former boastingor what into boasting they had translated  youll lay a wager will you chatellerault i cried giving him back defiance for defiance a breathless silence fell then have it so listen gentlemen that you may be witnesses i do here pledge my castle of bardelys and my estates in picardy with every stick and stone and blade of grass that stands upon them that i shall woo and win roxalanne de lavedan to be the marquise of bardelys does the stake satisfy you monsieur le comte you may set all you have against it i added coarsely and yet i swear the odds will be heavily in your favour  i remember it was mironsac who first found his tongue and sought even at that late hour to set restraint upon us and to bring judgment to our aid  messieurs messieurs he besought us in heavens name bethink you what you do bardelys your wager is a madness monsieur de chatellerault youll not accept it youll  be silent i rebuked him with some asperity what has monsieur de chatellerault to say  he was staring at the tablecloth and the stain of the wine that he had spilled when first mademoiselle de lavedans name was mentioned his head had been bent so that his long black hair had tumbled forward and partly veiled his face at my question he suddenly looked up the ghost of a smile hung on his sensuous lips for all that excitement had paled his countenance beyond its habit  monsieur le marquis said he rising i take your wager and i pledge my lands in normandy against yours of bardelys should you lose they will no longer call you the magnificent should i losei shall be a beggar it is a momentous wager bardelys and spells ruin for one of us  a madness groaned mironsac  mordieux swore cazalet whilst la fosse who had been the original cause of all this trouble vented his excitement in a gibber of imbecile laughter  how long do you give me chatellerault i asked as quietly as i might  what time shall you require  i should prefer that you name the limit i answered  he pondered a moment then will three months suffice you he asked  if it is not done in three months i will pay said i  and then chatellerault did what after all was i suppose the only thing that a gentleman might do under the circumstances he rose to his feet and bidding the company charge their glasses he gave them a parting toast  messieurs drink with me to monsieur le marquis de bardelyss safe journey into languedoc and to the prospering of his undertaking  in answer a great shout went up from throats that suspense had lately held in leash men leapt on to their chairs and holding their glasses on high they acclaimed me as thunderously as though i had been the hero of some noble exploit instead of the main figure in a somewhat questionable wager  bardelys was the shout with which the house reechoed bardelys bardelys the magnificent vive bardelys     chapter ii the kings wishes   it was daybreak ere the last of them had left me for a dozen or so had lingered to play lansquenet after the others had departed with those that remained my wager had soon faded into insignificance as their minds became engrossed in the fluctuations of their own fortunes  i did not play myself i was not in the mood and for one night at least of sufficient weight already i thought the game upon which i was launched  i was out on the balcony as the first lines of dawn were scoring the east and in a moody thoughtful condition i had riveted my eyes upon the palace of the luxembourg which loomed a black pile against the lightening sky when mironsac came out to join me a gentle lovable lad was mironsac not twenty years of age and with the face and manners of a woman that he was attached to me i knew  monsieur le marquis said he softly i am desolated at this wager into which they have forced you  forced me i echoed no no they did not force me and yet i reflected with a sigh perhaps they did  i have been thinking monsieur that if the king were to hear of it the evil might be mended  but the king must not hear of it armand i answered quickly even if he did matters would be no bettermuch worse possibly  but monsieur this thing done in the heat of wine  is none the less done armand i concluded and i for one do not wish it undone  but have you no thought for the lady he cried  i laughed at him were i still eighteen boy the thought might trouble me had i my illusions i might imagine that my wife must be some woman of whom i should be enamoured as it is i have grown to the age of twentyeight unwed marriage becomes desirable i must think of an heir to all the wealth of bardelys and so i go to languedoc if the lady be but half the saint that fool chatellerault has painted her so much the better for my children if not so much the worse there is the dawn mironsac and it is time we were abed let us drive these plaguy gamesters home  when the last of them had staggered down my steps and i had bidden a drowsy lacquey extinguish the candles i called ganymede to light me to bed and aid me to undress his true name was rodenard but my friend la fosse of mythological fancy had named him ganymede after the cupbearer of the gods and the name had clung to him he was a man of some forty years of age born into my fathers service and since become my intendant factotum majordomo and generalissimo of my regiment of servants and my establishments both in paris and at bardelys  we had been to the wars together ere i had cut my wisdom teeth and thus had he come to love me there was nothing this invaluable servant could not do at baiting or shoeing a horse at healing a wound at roasting a capon or at mending a doublet he was alike a master besides possessing a score of other accomplishments that do not now occur to me which in his campaigning he had acquired of late the easy life in paris had made him incline to corpulency and his face was of a pale unhealthy fullness  tonight as he assisted me to undress it wore an expression of supreme woe  monseigneur is going into languedoc he inquired sorrowfully he always called me his seigneur as did the other of my servants born at bardelys  knave you have been listening said i  but monseigneur he explained when monsieur le comte de chatellerault laid his wager  and have i not told you ganymede that when you chance to be among my friends you should hear nothing but the words addressed to you see nothing but the glasses that need replenishing but there we are going into languedoc what of it  they say that war may break out at any moment he groaned that monsieur le duc de montmorency is receiving reenforcements from spain and that he intends to uphold the standard of monsieur and the rights of the province against the encroachments of his eminence the cardinal  so we are becoming politicians eh ganymede and how shall all this concern us had you listened more attentively you had learnt that we go to languedoc to seek a wife and not to concern ourselves with cardinals and dukes now let me sleep ere the sun rises  on the morrow i attended the levee and i applied to his majesty for leave to absent myself but upon hearing that it was into languedoc i went he frowned inquiry trouble enough was his brother already making in that province i explained that i went to seek a wife and deeming all subterfuge dangerous since it might only serve to provoke him when later he came to learn the ladys name i told himwithholding yet all mention of the wagerthat i fostered the hope of making mademoiselle de lavedan my marquise  deeper came the line between his brows at that and blacker grew the scowl he was not wont to bestow on me such looks as i now met in his weary eyes for louis xiii had much affection for me  you know this lady he demanded sharply  only by name your majesty  at that his brows went up in astonishment  only by name and you would wed her but marcel my friend you are a rich man one of the richest in france you cannot be a fortune hunter  sire i answered fame sings loudly the praises of this lady her beauty and her virtuepraises that lead me to opine she would make me an excellent chatelaine i am come to an age when it is well to wed indeed your majesty has often told me so and it seems to me that all france does not hold a lady more desirable heaven send she will agree to my suit  in that tired way of his that was so pathetic do you love me a little marcel he asked  sire i exclaimed wondering whither all this was leading us need i protest it  no he answered dryly you can prove it prove it by abandoning this languedoc quest i have motivessound motives motives of political import i desire another wedding for mademoiselle de lavedan i wish it so bardelys and i look to be obeyed  for a moment temptation had me by the throat here was an unlookedfor chance to shake from me a business which reflection was already rendering odious i had but to call together my friends of yesternight and with them the comte de chatellerault and inform them that by the king was i forbidden to go awooing roxalanne de lavedan so should my wager be dissolved and then in a flash i saw how they would sneer one and all and how they would think that i had caught avidly at this opportunity of freeing myself from an undertaking into which a boastful mood had lured me the fear of that swept aside my momentary hesitation  sire i answered bending my head contritely i am desolated that my inclinations should run counter to your wishes but to your wonted kindness and clemency i must look for forgiveness if these same inclinations drive me so relentlessly that i may not now turn back  he caught me viciously by the arm and looked sharply into my face  you defy me bardelys he asked in a voice of anger  god forbid sire i answered quickly i do but pursue my destiny  he took a turn in silence like a man who is mastering himself before he will speak many an eye i knew was upon us and not a few may have been marvelling whether already bardelys were about to share the fate that yesterday had overtaken his rival chatellerault at last he halted at my side again  marcel said he but though he used that name his voice was harsh go home and ponder what i have said if you value my favour if you desire my love you will abandon this journey and the suit you contemplate if on the other hand you persist in goingyou need not return the court of france has no room for gentlemen who are but lipservers no place for courtiers who disobey their king  that was his last word he waited for no reply but swung round on his heel and an instant later i beheld him deep in conversation with the duke of saintsimon of such a quality is the love of princesvain capricious and wilful indulge it ever and at any cost else you forfeit it  i turned away with a sigh for in spite of all his weaknesses and meannesses i loved this cardinalridden king and would have died for him had the need occurred as well he knew but in this matterwell i accounted my honour involved and there was now no turning back save by the payment of my wager and the acknowledgment of defeat     chapter iii rene de lesperon   that very day i set out for since the king was opposed to the affair and knowing the drastic measures by which he was wont to enforce what he desired i realized that did i linger he might find a way definitely to prevent my going  i travelled in a coach attended by two lacqueys and a score of menatarms in my own livery all commanded by ganymede my intendant himself came in another coach with my wardrobe and travelling necessaries we were a fine and almost regal cortege as we passed down the rue de lenfer and quitted paris by the orleans gate taking the road south so fine a cortege indeed that it entered my mind his majesty would come to hear of it and knowing my destination send after me to bring me back to evade such a possibility i ordered a divergence to be made and we struck east and into touraine at pontleduc near tours i had a cousin in the vicomte damaral and at his chateau i arrived on the third day after quitting paris  since that was the last place where they would seek me if to seek me they were inclined i elected to remain my cousins guest for fifteen days and whilst i was there we had news of trouble in the south and of a rising in languedoc under the duc de montmorency thus was it that when i came to take my leave of amaral he knowing that languedoc was my destination sought ardently to keep me with him until we should learn that peace and order were restored in the province but i held the trouble lightly and insisted upon going  resolutely then if by slow stages we pursued our journey and came at last to montauban there we lay a night at the auberge de navarre intending to push on to lavedan upon the morrow my father had been on more than friendly terms with the vicomte de lavedan and upon this i built my hopes of a cordial welcome and an invitation to delay for a few days the journey to toulouse upon which i should represent myself as bound  thus then stood my plans and they remained unaltered for all that upon the morrow there were wild rumours in the air of montauban there were tellings of a battle fought the day before at castelnaudary of the defeat of monsieurs partisans of the utter rout of gonzalo de cordovas spanish tatterdemalions and of the capture of montmorency who was sorely woundedsome said with twenty and some with thirty woundsand little like to live sorrow and discontent stalked abroad in languedoc that day for they believed that it was against the cardinal who sought to strip them of so many privileges that gaston dorleans had set up his standard  that those rumours of battle and defeat were true we had ample proof some few hours later when a company of dragoons in buff and steel rode into the courtyard of the auberge de navarre headed by a young spark of an officer who confirmed the rumour and set the number of montmorencys wounds at seventeen he was lying the officer told us at castelnaudary and his duchess was hastening to him from beziers poor woman she was destined to nurse him back to life and vigour only that he might take his trial at toulouse and pay with his head the price of his rebellion  ganymede who through the luxurious habits of his more recent years hadfor all his fine swaggerdeveloped a marked distaste for warfare and excitement besought me to take thought for my safety and to lie quietly at montauban until the province should be more settled  the place is a hotbed of rebellion he urged if these chouans but learn that we are from paris and of the kings party we shall have our throats slit as i live there is not a peasant in all this countryside indeed scarce a man of any sort but is a redhot orleanist anticardinalist and friend of the devil bethink you monseigneur to push on at the present is to court murder  why then we will court murder said i coldly give the word to saddle  i asked him at the moment of setting out did he know the road to lavedan to which the lying poltroon made answer that he did in his youth he may have known it and the countryside may have undergone since then such changes as bewildered him or it may be that fear dulled his wits and lured him into taking what may have seemed the safer rather than the likelier road but this i know that as night was falling my carriage halted with a lurch and as i put forth my head i was confronted by my trembling intendant his great fat face gleaming whitely in the gloom above the lawn collar on his doublet  why do we halt ganymede quoth i  monseigneur he faltered his trembling increasing as he spoke and his eyes meeting mine in a look of pitiful contrition i fear we are lost  lost i echoed of what do you talk am i to sleep in the coach  alas monseigneur i have done my best  why then god keep us from your worst i snapped open me this door  i stepped down and looked about me and by my faith a more desolate spot to lose us in my henchman could not have contrived had he been at pains to do so a bleak barren landscapesuch as i could hardly have credited was to be found in all that fair provinceunfolded itself looking now more bleak perhaps by virtue of the dim evening mist that hovered over it yonder to the right a dull russet patch of sky marked the west and then in front of us i made out the hazy outline of the pyrenees at sight of them i swung round and gripped my henchman by the shoulder  a fine trusty servant thou i cried boaster had you told us that age and fat living had so stunted your wits as to have extinguished memory i had taken a guide at montauban to show us the way yet here with the sun and the pyrenees to guide you even had you no other knowledge you lose yourself  monseigneur he whimpered i was choosing my way by the sun and the mountains and it was thus that i came to this impasse for you may see yourself that the road ends here abruptly  ganymede said i slowly when we return to parisif you do not die of fright twixt this and thenill find a place for you in the kitchens god send you may make a better scullion than a follower then vaulting over the wall attend me some halfdozen of you i commanded and stepped out briskly towards the barn  as the weatherbeaten old door creaked upon its rusty hinges we were greeted by a groan from within and with it the soft rustle of straw that is being moved surprised i halted and waited whilst one of my men kindled a light in the lanthorn that he carried  by its rays we beheld a pitiable sight in a corner of that building a man quite young and of a tall and vigorous frame lay stretched upon the straw he was fully dressed even to his great ridingboots and from the loose manner in which his backandbreast hung now upon him it would seem as if he had been making shift to divest himself of his armour but had lacked the strength to complete the task beside him lay a feathered headpiece and a sword attached to a richly broidered baldrick all about him the straw was clotted with brown viscous patches of blood the doublet which had been of skyblue velvet was all sodden and stained and inspection showed us that he had been wounded in the right side between the straps of his breastplate  as we stood about him now a silent pitying group appearing fantastic perhaps by the dim light of that single lanthorn he attempted to raise his head and then with a groan he dropped it back upon the straw that pillowed it from out of a face white as in death and drawn with haggard lines of pain a pair of great lustrous blue eyes were turned upon us abject and pitiful as the gaze of a dumb beast that is stricken mortally  it needed no acuteness to apprehend that we had before us one of yesterdays defeated warriors one who had spent his last strength in creeping hither to get his dying done in peace lest our presence should add fear to the agony already upon him i knelt beside him in the bloodsmeared straw and raising his head i pillowed it upon my arm  have no fear said i reassuringly we are friends do you understand  the faint smile that played for a second on his lips and lighted his countenance would have told me that he understood even had i not caught his words faint as a sigh merci monsieur he nestled his head into the crook of my arm waterfor the love of god he gasped to add in a groan je me meurs monsieur  assisted by a couple of knaves ganymede went about attending to the rebel at once handling him as carefully as might be to avoid giving him unnecessary pain they removed his backandbreast which was flung with a clatter into one of the corners of the barn then whilst one of them gently drew off his boots rodenard with the lanthorn close beside him cut away the fellows doublet and laid bare the oozing swordwound that gaped in his mangled side he whispered an order to gilles who went swiftly off to the coach in quest of something that he had asked for then he sat on his heels and waited his hand upon the mans pulse his eyes on his face  i stooped until my lips were on a level with my intendants ear  how is it with him i inquired  dying whispered rodenard in answer he has lost too much blood and he is probably bleeding inwardly as well there is no hope of his life but he may linger thus some little while sinking gradually and we can at least mitigate the suffering of his last moments  when presently the men returned with the things that ganymede had asked for he mixed some pungent liquid with water and whilst a servant held the bowl he carefully sponged the rebels wound this and a cordial that he had given him to drink seemed to revive him and to afford him ease his breathing was no longer marked by any rasping sound and his eyes seemed to burn more intelligently  i am dyingis it not so he asked and ganymede bowed his head in silence the poor fellow sighed raise me he begged and when this service had been done him his eyes wandered round until they found me then monsieur he said will you do me a last favour  assuredly my poor friend i answered going down on my knees beside him  youyou were not for the duke he inquired eyeing me more keenly  no monsieur but do not let that disturb you i have no interest in this rising and i have taken no side i am from paris on a journey ofof pleasure my name is bardelysmarcel de bardelys  bardelys the magnificent he questioned and i could not repress a smile  i am that overrated man  but then you are for the king and a note of disappointment crept into his voice before i could make him any answer he had resumed no matter marcel de bardelys is a gentleman and party signifies little when a man is dying i am rene de lesperon of lesperon in gascony he pursued will you send word to my sister afterwards  i bowed my head without speaking  she is the only relative i have monsieur butand his tone grew wistfulthere is one other to whom i would have you bear a message he raised his hand by a painful effort to the level of his breast strength failed him and he sank back i cannot monsieur he said in a tone of pathetic apology see there is a chain about my neck with a locket take it from me take it now monsieur there are some papers also monsieur take all i want to see them safely in your keeping  i did his bidding and from the breast of his doublet i drew some loose letters and a locket which held the miniature of a womans face  i want you to deliver all to her monsieur  it shall be done i answered deeply moved  hold ithold it up he begged his voice weakening let me behold the face  long his eyes rested on the likeness i held before him at last as one in a dream  wellbeloved he sighed bien aimee and down his grey haggard cheeks the tears came slowly forgive this weakness monsieur he whispered brokenly we were to have been wed in a month had i lived he ended with a sob and when next he spoke it was more labouredly as though that sob had robbed him of the half of what vitality remained tell her monsieur that my dying thoughts were of her telltell heri  her name i cried fearing he would sink before i learned it tell me her name  he looked at me with eyes that were growing glassy and vacant then he seemed to brace himself and to rally for a second  her name he mused in a faroff manner she ismademoiselle de   his head rolled on the suddenly relaxed neck he collapsed into rodenards arms  is he dead i asked  rodenard nodded in silence     chapter iv a maid in the moonlight   i do not know whether it was the influence of that thing lying in a corner of the barn under the cloak that rodenard had flung over it or whether other influences of destiny were at work to impel me to rise at the end of a halfhour and announce my determination to set out on horseback and find myself quarters more congenial  tomorrow i instructed ganymede as i stood ready to mount you will retrace your steps with the others and finding the road to lavedan you will follow me to the chateau  but you cannot hope to reach it tonight monseigneur through a country that is unknown to you he protested  i do not hope to reach it tonight i will ride south until i come upon some hamlet that will afford me shelter and in the morning direction  i left him with that and set out at a brisk trot night had now fallen but the sky was clear and a crescent moon came opportunely if feebly to dispel the gloom  i quitted the field and went back until i gained a crossroad where turning to the right i set my face to the pyrenees and rode briskly amain that i had chosen wisely was proved when some twenty minutes later i clattered into the hamlet of mirepoix and drew up before an inn flaunting the sign of a peacockas if in irony of its humbleness for it was no better than a wayside tavern neither stableboy nor ostler was here and the unclean overgrown urchin to whom i entrusted my horse could not say whether indeed pere abdon the landlord would be able to find me a room to sleep in i thirsted however and so i determined to alight if it were only to drink a can of wine and obtain information of my whereabouts  as i was entering the hostelry there was a clatter of hoofs in the street and four dragoons headed by a sergeant rode up and halted at the door of the paon they seemed to have ridden hard and some distance for their horses were jaded almost to the last point of endurance  within i called the host and having obtained a flagon of the best vintageheaven fortify those that must be content with his worsti passed on to make inquiries touching my whereabouts and the way to lavedan this i learnt was but some three or four miles distant about the other tablethere were but two within the roomstood the dragoons in a whispered consultation of which it had been well had i taken heed for it concerned me more closely than i could have dreamt  he answers the description said the sergeant and though i heard the words i took no thought that it was of me they spoke  padrieu swore one of his companions ill wager it is our man  and then just as i was noticing that master abdon who had also overheard the conversation was eyeing me curiously the sergeant stepped up to me and  what is your name monsieur quoth he  i vouchsafed him a stare of surprise before asking in my turn how may that concern you  your pardon my master but we are on the kings business  i remembered then that he had said i answered some description with that it flashed through my mind that they had been sent after me by his majesty to enforce my obedience to his wishes and to hinder me from reaching lavedan at once came the dominant desire to conceal my identity that i might go unhindered the first name that occurred to me was that of the poor wretch i had left in the barn half an hour ago and so  i am said i monsieur de lesperon at your service  too late i saw the mistake that i had made i own it was a blunder that no man of ordinary intelligence should have permitted himself to have committed remembering the unrest of the province i should rather have concluded that their business was more like to be in that connection  he is bold at least cried one of the troopers with a burst of laughter then came the sergeants voice cold and formal in the kings name monsieur de lesperon i arrest you  he had whipped out his sword and the point was within an inch of my breast but his arm i observed was stretched to its fullest extent which forbade his making a sudden thrust to hamper him in the lunge there was the table between us  so my mind working quickly in this desperate situation and realizing how dire and urgent the need to attempt an escape i leapt suddenly back to find myself in the arms of his followers but in moving i had caught up by one of its legs the stool on which i had been sitting as i raised it i eluded the pinioning grip of the troopers i twisted in their grasp and brought the stool down upon the head of one of them with a force that drove him to his knees up went that threelegged stool again to descend like a thunderbolt upon the head of another that freed me the sergeant was coming up behind but another flourish of my improvised battleaxe sent the two remaining soldiers apart to look to their swords ere they could draw i had darted like a hare between them and out into the street the sergeant cursing them with horrid volubility followed closely upon my heels  leaping as far into the roadway as i could i turned to meet the fellows onslaught using the stool as a buckler i caught his thrust upon it so violently was it delivered that the point buried itself in the wood and the blade snapped leaving him a hilt and a stump of steel i wasted no time in thought charging him wildly i knocked him over just as the two unhurt dragoons came stumbling out of the tavern  i gained my horse and vaulted into the saddle tearing the reins from the urchin that held them and driving my spurs into the beasts flanks i went careering down the street at a gallop gripping tightly with my knees whilst the stirrups which i had had no time to step into flew wildly about my legs  a pistol cracked behind me then another and a sharp stinging pain in the shoulder warned me that i was hit but i took no heed of it then the wound could not be serious else i had already been out of the saddle and it would be time enough to look to it when i had outdistanced my pursuers i say my pursuers for already there were hoofbeats behind me and i knew that those gentlemen had taken to their horses but as you may recall i had on their arrival noted the jaded condition of their cattle whilst i bestrode a horse that was comparatively fresh so that pursuit had but small terrors for me nevertheless they held out longer and gave me more to do than i had imagined would be the case for nigh upon a halfhour i rode before i could be said to have got clear of them and then for aught i knew they were still following resolved to hound me down by the aid of such information as they might cull upon their way  i was come by then to the garonne i drew rein beside the swiftly flowing stream winding itself like a flood of glittering silver between the black shadows of its banks a little while i sat there listening and surveying the stately turreted chateau that loomed a grey noble pile beyond the water i speculated what demesne this might be and i realized that it was probably lavedan  i pondered what i had best do and in the end i took the resolve to swim the river and knock at the gates if it were indeed lavedan i had but to announce myself and to one of my name surely its hospitalities would be spread if it were some other household even then the name of marcel de bardelys should suffice to ensure me a welcome  by spurring and coaxing i lured my steed into the river there is a proverb having it that though you may lead a horse to the water you cannot make him drink it would have now applied to my case for although i had brought mine to the water i could not make him swim or at least i could not make him breast the rush of the stream vainly did i urge him and try to hold him he plunged frantically snorted coughed and struggled gamely but the current was bearing us swiftly away and his efforts brought us no nearer to the opposite shore at last i slipped from his back and set myself to swim beside him leading him by the bridle but even thus he proved unequal to the task of resisting the current so that in the end i let him go and swam ashore alone hoping that he would land farther down and that i might then recapture him when however i had reached the opposite bank and stood under the shadow of the chateau i discovered that the cowardly beast had turned back and having scrambled out was now trotting away along the path by which we had come having no mind to go after him i resigned myself to the loss and turned my attention to the mansion now before me  some two hundred yards from the river it raised its great square bulk against the background of black starflecked sky from the facade before me down to the spot where i stood by the water came a flight of half a dozen terraces each balustraded in white marble ending in square flattopped pillars of florentine design what moon there was revealed the quaint architecture of that stately edifice and glittered upon the mullioned windows but within nothing stirred no yellow glimmer came to clash with the white purity of the moonlight no sound of man or beast broke the stillness of the night for all that the hour was early the air of the place was as that of some gigantic sepulchre a little daunted by this allenveloping stillness i skirted the terraces and approached the house on the eastern side here i found an oldworld drawbridgenow naturally in disusespanning a ditch fed from the main river for the erstwhile purposes of a moat i crossed the bridge and entered an imposing courtyard within this quadrangle the same silence dwelt and there was the same obscurity in the windows that overlooked it i paused at a loss how to proceed and i leaned against a buttress of the portcullis what time i considered  i was weak from fasting worn with hard riding and faint from the wound in my shoulder which had been the cause at least of my losing some blood in addition to all this i was shivering with the cold of my wet garments and generally i must have looked as little like that bardelys they called the magnificent as you might well conceive how then if i were to knock should i prevail in persuading these peoplewhoever they might beof my identity infinitely more had i the air of some fugitive rebel and it was more than probable that i should be kept in durance to be handed over to my friends the dragoons if later they came to ride that way i was separated from those who knew me and as things now stoodunless this were indeed lavedanit might be days before they found me again  i was beginning to deplore my folly at having cut myself adrift from my followers in the first place and having embroiled myself with the soldiers in the second i was beginning to contemplate the wisdom of seeking some outhouse of this mansion wherein to lie until morning when of a sudden a broad shaft of light coming from one of the windows on the first floor fell athwart the courtyard instinctively i crouched back into the shadow of my friendly buttress and looked up  that sudden shaft of light resulted from the withdrawal of the curtains that masked a window at this window which opened outward on to a balcony i now beheldand to me it was as the vision of beatrice may have been to dantethe white figure of a woman the moonlight bathed her as in her white robe she leaned upon the parapet gazing upward into the empyrean a sweet delicate face i saw not endowed perhaps with that exquisite balance and proportion of feature wherein they tell us beauty lies but blessed with a wondrously dainty beauty all its own a beauty perhaps as much of expression as of form for in that gentle countenance was mirrored every tender grace of girlhood all that is fresh and pure and virginal  i held my breath i think as i stood in ravished contemplation of that white vision if this were lavedan and that the cold roxalanne who had sent my bold chatellerault back to paris emptyhanded then were my task a very welcome one  how little it had weighed with me that i was come to languedoc to woo a woman bearing the name of roxalanne de lavedan i have already shown but here in this same languedoc i beheld tonight a woman whom it seemed i might have loved for not in ten yearsnot indeed in all my lifehad any face so wrought upon me and called to my nature with so strong a voice  i gazed at that child and i thought of the women that i had knownthe bold bedizened beauties of a court said to be the first in europe and then it came to me that this was no demoiselle of lavedan no demoiselle at all in fact for the noblesse of france owned no such faces candour and purity were not to be looked for in the highbred countenances of our great families they were sometimes found in the faces of the children of their retainers yes i had it now this child was the daughter of some custodian of the demesne before me  suddenly as she stood there in the moonlight a song sung at halfvoice floated down on the calm air it was a ditty of old provence a melody i knew and loved and if aught had been wanting to heighten the enchantment that already ravished me that soft melodious voice had done it singing still she turned and reentered the room leaving wide the windows so that faintly as from a distance her voice still reached me after she was gone from sight  it was in that hour that it came to me to cast myself upon this fair creatures mercy surely one so sweet and saintly to behold would take compassion on an unfortunate haply my wound and all the rest that i had that night endured made me dullwitted and warped my reason  with what strength i still possessed i went to work to scale her balcony the task was easy even for one in my spent condition the wall was thick with ivy and moreover a window beneath afforded some support for by standing on the heavy coping i could with my fingers touch the sill of the balcony above thus i hoisted myself and presently i threw an arm over the parapet already i was astride of that same parapet before she became aware of my presence  the song died suddenly on her lips and her eyes blue as forgetmenots were wide now with the fear that the sight of me occasioned another second and there had been an outcry that would have brought the house about our ears when stepping to the threshold of the room mademoiselle i entreated for the love of god be silent i mean you no harm i am a fugitive i am pursued  this was no considered speech there had been no preparing of words i had uttered them mechanically almostperhaps by inspiration for they were surely the best calculated to enlist this ladys sympathy and so far as went the words themselves they were rigorously true  with eyes wide open still she confronted me and i now observed that she was not so tall as from below i had imagined she was in fact of a short stature rather but of proportions so exquisite that she conveyed an impression of some height in her hand she held a taper by whose light she had been surveying herself in her mirror at the moment of my advent her unbound hair of brown fell like a mantle about her shoulders and this fact it was drew me to notice that she was in her nightrail and that this room to which i had penetrated was her chamber  who are you she asked breathlessly as though in such a pass my identity were a thing that signified  i had almost answered her as i had answered the troopers at mirepoix that i was lesperon then bethinking me that there was no need for such equivocation here i was on the point of giving her my name but noting my hesitation and misconstruing it she forestalled me  i understand monsieur said she more composedly and you need have no fear you are among friends  her eyes had travelled over my sodden clothes the haggard pallor of my face and the blood that stained my doublet from the shoulder downward from all this she had drawn her conclusions that i was a hunted rebel she drew me into the room and closing the window she dragged the heavy curtain across it thereby giving me a proof of confidence that smote me hardimpostor that i was  i crave your pardon mademoiselle for having startled you by the rude manner of my coming said i and never in my life had i felt less at ease than then but i was exhausted and desperate i am wounded i have ridden hard and i swam the river  the latter piece of information was vastly unnecessary seeing that the water from my clothes was forming a pool about my feet i saw you from below mademoiselle and surely i thought so sweet a lady would have pity on an unfortunate she observed that my eyes were upon her and in an act of instinctive maidenliness she bore her hand to her throat to draw the draperies together and screen the beauties of her neck from my unwarranted glance as though her daily gown did not reveal as much and more of them  that act however served to arouse me to a sense of my position what did i there it was a profanitya defiling i swore from which youll see that bardelys was grown of a sudden very nice  monsieur she was saying you are exhausted  but that i rode hard i laughed it is likely they had taken me to toulouse were i might have lost my head before my friends could have found and claimed me i hope youll see it is too comely a head to be so lightly parted with  for that said she half seriously half whimsically the ugliest head would be too comely  i laughed softly amusedly then of a sudden without warning a faintness took me and i was forced to brace myself against the wall breathing heavily the while at that she gave a little cry of alarm  monsieur i beseech you to be seated i will summon my father and we will find a bed for you you must not retain those clothes  angel of goodness i muttered gratefully and being still half dazed i brought some of my court tricks into that chamber by taking her hand and carrying it towards my lips but ere i had imprinted the intended kiss upon her fingersand by some miracle they were not withdrawnmy eyes encountered hers again i paused as one may pause who contemplates a sacrilege for a moment she held my glance with hers then i fell abashed and released her hand  the innocence peeping out of that childs eyes it was that had in that moment daunted me and made me tremble to think of being found there and of the vile thing it would be to have her name coupled with mine that thought lent me strength i cast my weariness from me as though it were a garment and straightening myself i stepped of a sudden to the window without a word i made shift to draw back the curtain when her hand falling on my sodden sleeve arrested me  what will you do monsieur she cried in alarm you may be seen  my mind was now possessed by the thing i should have thought of before i climbed to her balcony and my one resolve was to get me thence as quickly as might be  i had not the right to enter here i muttered i i stopped short to explain would only be to sully and so goodnight adieu i ended brusquely  but monsieur she began  let me go i commanded almost roughly as i shook my arm free of her grasp  bethink you that you are exhausted if you go forth now monsieur you will assuredly be taken you must not go  i laughed softly and with some bitterness too for i was angry with myself  hush child i said better so if it is to be  and with that i drew aside the curtains and pushed the leaves of the window apart she remained standing in the room watching me her face pale and hex eyes pained and puzzled  one last glance i gave her as i bestrode the rail of her balcony then i lowered myself as i had ascended i was hanging by my hands seeking with my foot for the coping of the window beneath me when suddenly there came a buzzing in my ears i had a fleeting vision of a white figure leaning on the balcony above me then a veil seemed drawn over my eyes there came a sense of falling a rush as of a tempestuous wind thennothing     chapter v the vicomte de lavedan   when next i awakened it was to find myself abed in an elegant apartment spacious and sunlit that was utterly strange to me for some seconds i was content to lie and take no count of my whereabouts my eyes travelled idly over the handsome furnishings of that choicely appointed chamber and rested at last upon the lean crooked figure of a man whose back was towards me and who was busy with some phials at a table not far distant then recollection awakened also in me and i set my wits to work to grapple with my surroundings i looked through the open window but from my position on the bed no more was visible than the blue sky and a faint haze of distant hills  i taxed my memory and the events of yesternight recurred to me i remembered the girl the balcony and my flight ending in my giddiness and my fall had they brought me into that same chateau oror what no other possibility came to suggest itself and seeing scant need to tax my brains with speculation since there was one there of whom i might ask the question  hola my master i called to him and as i did so i essayed to move the act wrung a sharp cry of pain from me my left shoulder was numb and sore but in my right foot that sudden movement had roused a sharper pang  at my cry that little wizened old man swung suddenly round he had the face of a bird of prey yellow as a louis dor with a great hooked nose and a pair of beady black eyes that observed me solemnly the mouth alone was the redeeming feature in a countenance that had otherwise been evil it was instinct with goodhumour but i had small leisure to observe him then for simultaneously with his turning there had been another movement at my bedside which drew my eyes elsewhere a gentleman richly dressed and of an imposing height approached me  you are awake monsieur he said in a half interrogative tone  will you do me the favour to tell me where i am monsieur quoth i  you do not know you are at lavedan i am the vicomte de lavedanat your service  although it was no more than i might have expected yet a dull wonder filled me to which presently i gave expression by asking stupidly  at lavedan but how came i hither  how you came is more than i can tell he laughed but ill swear the kings dragoons were not far behind you we found you in the courtyard last night in a swoon of exhaustion wounded in the shoulder and with a sprained foot it was my daughter who gave the alarm and called us to your assistance you were lying under her widow then seeing the growing wonder in my eyes and misconstruing it into alarm nay have no fear monsieur he cried you were very well advised in coming to us you have fallen among friends we are orleanists tooat lavedan for all that i was not in the fight at castelnaudary that was no fault of mine his graces messenger reached me overlate and for all that i set out with a company of my men i put back when i had reached lautrec upon hearing that already a decisive battle had been fought and that our side had suffered a crushing defeat he uttered a weary sigh  god help us monsieur monseigneur de richelieu is likely to have his way with us but let that be for the present you are here and you are safe as yet no suspicion rests on lavedan i was as i have said too late for the fight and so i came quietly back to save my skin that i might serve the cause in whatever other way might offer still in sheltering you i am serving gaston dorleans and that i may continue so to do i pray that suspicion may continue to ignore me if they were to learn of it at toulouse or of how with money and in other ways i have helped this rebellioni make no doubt that my head would be the forfeit i should be asked to pay  i was aghast at the freedom of treasonable speech with which this very debonnaire gentleman ventured to address an utter stranger  but tell me monsieur de lesperon resumed my host how is it with you  i started in fresh astonishment  howhow do you know that i am lesperon i asked  ma foi he laughed do you imagine i had spoken so unreservedly to a man of whom i knew nothing think better of me monsieur i beseech you i found these letters in your pocket last night and their superscription gave me your identity your name is well known to me he added my friend monsieur de marsac has often spoken of you and of your devotion to the cause and it affords me no little satisfaction to be of some service to one whom by repute i have already learned to esteem  i lay back on my pillows and i groaned here was a predicament mistaking me for that miserable rebel i had succoured at mirepoix and whose letters i bore upon me that i might restore them to some one whose name he had failed to give me at the last moment the vicomte de lavedan had poured the damning story of his treason into my ears  what if i were now to enlighten him what if i were to tell him that i was not lesperonno rebel at all in factbut marcel de bardelys the kings favourite that he would account me a spy i hardly thought but assuredly he would see that my life must be a danger to his own he must fear betrayal from me and to protect himself he would be justified in taking extreme measures rebels were not addicted to an excess of niceness in their methods and it was more likely that i should rise no more from the luxurious bed on which his hospitality had laid me but even if i had exaggerated matters and the vicomte were not quite so bloodthirsty as was usual with his order even if he chose to accept my promise that i would forget what he had said he must neverthelessin view of his indiscretiondemand my instant withdrawal from lavedan and what then of my wager with chatellerault  then in thinking of my wager i came to think of roxalanne herselfthat dainty sweetfaced child into whose chamber i had penetrated on the previous night and would you believe it that ithe satiated cynical unbelieving bardelysexperienced dismay at the very thought of leaving lavedan for no other reason than because it involved seeing no more of that provincial damsel  my unwillingness to be driven from her presence determined me to stay i had come to lavedan as lesperon a fugitive rebel in that character i had all but announced myself last night to mademoiselle in that character i had been welcomed by her father in that character then i must remain that i might be near her that i might woo and win her and thusthough this i swear had now become a minor consideration with memake good my boast and win the wager that must otherwise involve my ruin  as i lay back with closed eyes and gave myself over to pondering the situation i took a pleasure oddly sweet in the prospect of urging my suit under such circumstances chatellerault had given me a free hand i was to go about the wooing of mademoiselle de lavedan as i chose but he had cast it at me in defiance that not with all my magnificence not with all my retinue and all my state to dazzle her should i succeed in melting the coldest heart in france  and now behold i had cast from me all these outward embellishments i came without pomp denuded of every emblem of wealth of every sign of power as a poor fugitive gentleman i came hunted proscribed and pennilessfor lesperons estate would assuredly suffer sequestration to win her thus would by my faith be an exploit i might take pride in a worthy achievement to encompass  and so i left things as they were and since i offered no denial to the identity that was thrust upon me as lesperon i continued to be known to the vicomte and to his family  presently he called the old man to my bedside and i heard them talking of my condition  you think then anatole he said in the end that in three or four days monsieur de lesperon may be able to rise  i am assured of it replied the old servant  whereupon turning to me be therefore of good courage monsieur said lavedan for your hurt is none so grievous after all  i was muttering my thanks and my assurances that i was in excellent spirits when we were suddenly disturbed by a rumbling noise as of distant thunder  mort dieu swore the vicomte a look of alarm coming into his face with a bent head he stood in a listening attitude  what is it i inquired  horsemenon the drawbridge he answered shortly a troop by the sound  and then in confirmation of these words followed a stamping and rattle of hoofs on the flags of the courtyard below the old servant stood wringing his hands in helpless terror and wailing monsieur monsieur  but the vicomte crossed rapidly to the window and looked out then he laughed with intense relief and in a wondering voice they are not troopers he announced they have more the air of a company of servants in private livery and there is a carriagepardieu two carriages  at once the memory of rodenard and my followers occurred to me and i thanked heaven that i was abed where he might not see me and that thus he would probably be sent forth emptyhanded with the news that his master was neither arrived nor expected  but in that surmise i went too fast ganymede was of a tenacious mettle and of this he now afforded proof upon learning that naught was known of the marquis de bardelys at lavedan my faithful henchman announced his intention to remain there and await me since that was he assured the vicomte my destination  my first impulse said lavedan when later he came to tell me of it was incontinently to order his departure but upon considering the matter and remembering how high in power and in the kings favour stands that monstrous libertine bardelys i deemed it wiser to afford shelter to this outrageous retinue his stewarda flabby insolent creaturesays that bardelys left them last night near mirepoix to ride hither bidding them follow today curious that we should have no news of him that he should have fallen into the garonne and drowned himself were too great a good fortune to be hoped for  the bitterness with which he spoke of me afforded me ample cause for congratulation that i had resolved to accept the role of lesperon yet remembering that my father and he had been good friends his manner left me nonplussed what cause could he have for this animosity to the son could it be merely my position at court that made me seem in his rebel eyes a natural enemy  you are acquainted with this bardelys i inquired by way of drawing him  i knew his father he answered gruffly an honest upright gentleman  and the son i inquired timidly has he none of these virtues  i know not what virtues he may have his vices are known to all the world he is a libertine a gambler a rake a spendthrift they say he is one of the kings favourites and that his monstrous extravagances have earned for him the title of magnificent he uttered a short laugh a fit servant for such a master as louis the just  monsieur le vicomte said i warming in my own defence i swear you do him injustice he is extravagant but then he is rich he is a libertine but then he is young and he has been reared among libertines he is a gamester but punctiliously honourable at play believe me monsieur i have some acquaintance with marcel de bardelys and his vices are hardly so black as is generally believed whilst in his favour i think the same may be said that you have just said of his fatherhe is an honest upright gentleman  and that disgraceful affair with the duchesse de bourgogne inquired lavedan with the air of a man setting an unanswerable question  mon dieu i cried will the world never forget that indiscretion an indiscretion of youth no doubt much exaggerated outside court circles  the vicomte eyed me in some astonishment for a moment  monsieur de lesperon he said at length you appear to hold this bardelys in high esteem he has a staunch supporter in you and a stout advocate yet me you cannot convince and he shook his head solemnly even if i did not hold him to be such a man as i have pronounced him but were to account him a paragon of all the virtues his coming hither remains an act that i must resent  but why monsieur le vicomte  because i know the errand that brings him to lavedan he comes to woo my daughter  had he flung a bomb into my bed he could not more effectively have startled me  it astonishes you eh he laughed bitterly but i can assure you that it is so a month ago i was visited by the comte de chatelleraultanother of his majestys fine favourites he came unbidden offered no reason for his coming save that he was making a tour of the province for his amusement his acquaintance with me was of the slightest and i had no desire that it should increase yet here he installed himself with a couple of servants and bade fair to take a long stay  i was surprised but on the morrow i had an explanation a courier arriving from an old friend of mine at court bore me a letter with the information that monsieur de chatellerault was come to lavedan at the kings instigation to sue for my daughters hand in marriage the reasons were not far to seek the king who loves him would enrich him the easiest way is by a wealthy alliance and roxalanne is accounted an heiress in addition to that my own power in the province is known whilst my defection from the cardinalist party is feared what better link wherewith to attach me again to the fortunes of the crownfor crown and mitre have grown to be synonymous in this topsyturvy francethan to wed my daughter to one of the kings favourites  but for that timely warning god knows what mischief had been wrought as it was monsieur de chatellerault had but seen my daughter upon two occasions on the very day that i received the tidings i speak of i sent her to auch to the care of some relatives of her mothers chatellerault remained a week then growing restive he asked when my daughter would return when you depart monsieur i answered him and being pressed for reasons i dealt so frankly with him that within twentyfour hours he was on his way back to paris  the vicomte paused and took a turn in the apartment whilst i pondered his words which were bringing me a curious revelation presently he resumed  and now chatellerault having failed in his purpose the king chooses a more dangerous person for the gratifying of his desires he sends the marquis marcel de bardelys to lavedan on the same business no doubt he attributes chatelleraults failure to clumsiness and he has decided this time to choose a man famed for courtly address and gifted with such arts of dalliance that he cannot fail but enmesh my daughter in them it is a great compliment that he pays us in sending hither the handsomest and most accomplished gentleman of all his courtso fame has ityet it is a compliment of whose flattery i am not sensible bardelys goes hence as emptyhanded as went chatellerault let him but show his face and my daughter journeys to auch again am i not well advised monsieur de lesperon  why yes i answered slowly after the manner of one who deliberates if you are persuaded that your conclusions touching bardelys are correct  i am more than persuaded what other business could bring him to lavedan  it was a question that i did not attempt to answer haply he did not expect me to answer it he left me free to ponder another issue of this same business of which my mind was become very full chatellerault had not dealt fairly with me often since i had left paris had i marvelled that he came to be so rash as to risk his fortune upon a matter that turned upon a womans whim that i possessed undeniable advantages of person of birth and of wealth chatellerault could not have disregarded yet these and the possibility that they might suffice to engage this ladys affections he appeared to have set at naught when he plunged into that rash wager  he must have realized that because he had failed was no reason to presume that i must also fail there was no consequence in such an argument and often as i have said had i marvelled during the past days at the readiness with which chatellerault had flung down the gage now i held the explanation of it he counted upon the vicomte de lavedan to reason precisely as he was reasoning and he was confident that no opportunities would be afforded me of so much as seeing this beautiful and cold roxalanne  it was a wily trap he had set me worthy only of a trickster  fate however had taken a hand in the game and the cards were redealt since i had left paris the terms of the wager permitted me to choose any line of action that i considered desirable but destiny it seemed had chosen for me and set me in a line that should at least suffice to overcome the parental resistancethat breastwork upon which chatellerault had so confidently depended  as the rebel rene de lesperon i was sheltered at lavedan and made welcome by my fellowrebel the vicomte who already seemed much taken with me and who had esteemed me before seeing me from the much that monsieur de marsacwhoever he might behad told him of me as rene de lesperon i must remain and turn to best account my sojourn praying god meanwhile that this same monsieur de marsac might be pleased to refrain from visiting lavedan whilst i was there     chapter vi in convalescence   of the week that followed my coming to lavedan i find some difficulty in writing it was for me a time very crowded with eventsevents that appeared to be moulding my character anew and making of me a person different indeed from that marcel de bardelys whom in paris they called the magnificent yet these events although significant in their total were of so vague and slight a nature in their detail that when i come to write of them i find really little that i may set down  rodenard and his companions remained for two days at the chateau and to me his sojourn there was a source of perpetual anxiety for i knew not how far the fool might see fit to prolong it it was well for me that this anxiety of mine was shared by monsieur de lavedan who disliked at such a time the presence of men attached to one who was so notoriously of the kings party he came at last to consult me as to what measures might be taken to remove them and inothing loath to conspire with him to so desirable endbade him suggest to rodenard that perhaps evil had befallen monsieur de bardelys and that instead of wasting his time at lavedan he were better advised to be searching the province for his master  this counsel the vicomte adopted and with such excellent results that that very daywithin the hour in factganymede aroused to a sense of his proper duty set out in quest of me not a little disturbed in mindfor with all his shortcomings the rascal loved me very faithfully  that was on the third day of my sojourn at lavedan on the morrow i rose my foot being sufficiently recovered to permit it i felt a little weak from loss of blood but anatolewho for all his evil countenance was a kindly and gentleservant was confident that a few daysa week at mostwould see me completely restored  of leaving lavedan i said nothing but the vicomte who was one of the most generous and noble hearted men that it has ever been my good fortune to meet forestalled any mention of my departure by urging that i should remain at the chateau until my recovery were completed and for that matter as long thereafter as should suit my inclinations  at lavedan you will be safe my friend he assured me for as i have told you we are under no suspicion let me urge you to remain until the king shall have desisted from further persecuting us  and when i protested and spoke of trespassing he waived the point with a brusqueness that amounted almost to anger  believe monsieur that i am pleased and honoured at serving one who has so stoutly served the cause and sacrificed so much to it  at that being not altogether dead to shame i winced and told myself that my behaviour was unworthy and that i was practising a detestable deception yet some indulgence i may justly claim in consideration of how far i was victim of circumstance did i tell him that i was bardelys i was convinced that i should never leave the chateau alive very noblehearted was the vicomte and no man have i known more averse to bloodthirstiness but he had told me much during the days that i had lain abed and many lives would be jeopardized did i proclaim what i had learned from him hence i argued that any disclosure of my identity must perforce drive him to extreme measures for the sake of the friends he had unwittingly betrayed  on the day after rodenards departure i dined with the family and met again mademoiselle de lavedan whom i had not seen since the balcony adventure of some nights ago the vicomtesse was also present a lady of very austere and noble appearancelean as a pike and with a most formidable nosebut as i was soon to discover with a mind inclining overmuch to scandal and the highseasoned talk of the courts in which her girlhood had been spent  from her lips i heard that day the old scandalous story of monseigneur de richelieus early passion for anne of austria with much unction did she tell us how the queen had lured his eminence to dress himself in the motley of a jester that she might make a mock of him in the eyes of the courtiers she had concealed behind the arras of her chamber  this anecdote she gave us with much wealth of discreditable detail and scant regard for either her daughters presence or for the blushes that suffused the poor childs cheeks in every way she was a pattern of the class of women amongst whom my youth had been spent a class which had done so much towards shattering my faith and lowering my estimate of her sex lavedan had married her and brought her into languedoc and here she spent her years lamenting the scenes of her youth and prone it would seem to make them matter for conversation whenever a newcomer chanced to present himself at the chateau  looking from her to her daughter i thanked heaven that roxalanne was no reproduction of the mother she had inherited as little of her character as of her appearance both in feature and in soul mademoiselle de lavedan was a copy of that noble gallant gentleman her father  one other was present at that meal of whom i shall have more to say hereafter this was a young man of good presence save perhaps a too obtrusive foppishness whom monsieur de lavedan presented to me as a distant kinsman of theirs one chevalier de sainteustache he was very tallof fully my own heightand of an excellent shape although extremely young but his head if anything was too small for his body and his goodnatured mouth was of a weakness that was confirmed by the significance of his chin whilst his eyes were too closely set to augur frankness  he was a pleasant fellow seemingly of that negative pleasantness that lies in inoffensiveness but otherwise dull and of an untutored mindrustic as might be expected in one the greater part of whose life had been spent in his native province and of a rusticity rendered all the more flagrant by the very efforts he exerted to dissemble it  it was after madame had related that unsavoury anecdote touching the cardinal that he turned to ask me whether i was well acquainted with the court i was near to committing the egregious blunder of laughing in his face but recollecting myself betimes i answered vaguely that i had some knowledge of it whereupon he all but caused me to bound from my chair by asking me had i ever met the magnificent bardelys  ii am acquainted with him i answered warily why do you ask  i was reminded of him by the fact that his servants have been here for two days you were expecting the marquis himself were you not monsieur le vicomte  lavedan raised his head suddenly after the manner of a man who has received an affront  i was not chevalier he answered with emphasis his intendant an insolent knave of the name of rodenard informed me that this bardelys projected visiting me he has not come and i devoutly hope that he may not come trouble enough had i to rid myself of his servants and but for monsieur de lesperons wellconceived suggestion they might still be here  you have never met him monsieur inquired the chevalier  never replied our host in such a way that any but a fool must have understood that he desired nothing less than such a meeting  a delightful fellow murmured sainteustachea brilliant dazzling personality  youyou are acquainted with him i asked  acquainted echoed that boastful liar we were as brothers  how you interest me and why have you never told us quoth madame her eyes turned enviously upon the young manas enviously as were lavedans turned in disgust it is a thousand pities that monsieur de bardelys has altered his plans and is no longer coming to us to meet such a man is to breathe again the air of the grand monde you remember monsieur de lesperon that affair with the duchess de bourgogne and she smiled wickedly in my direction  i have some recollection of it i answered coldly but i think that rumour exaggerates when tongues wag a little rivulet is often described as a mountain torrent  you would not say so did you but know what i know she informed me roguishly often i confess rumour may swell the importance of such an affaire but in this case i do not think that rumour does it justice  i made a deprecatory gesture and i would have had the subject changed but ere i could make an effort to that end the fool sainteustache was babbling again  you remember the duel that was fought in consequence monsieur de lesperon  yes i assented wearily  and in which a poor young fellow lost his life growled the vicomte it was practically a murder  nay monsieur i cried with a sudden heat that set them staring at me there you do him wrong monsieur de bardelys was opposed to the best blade in france the mans reputation as a swordsman was of such a quality that for a twelvemonth he had been living upon it doing all manner of unseemly things immune from punishment by the fear in which he was universally held his behaviour in the unfortunate affair we are discussing was of a particularly shameful character oh i know the details messieurs i can sure you he thought to impose his reputation upon bardelys as he had imposed it upon a hundred others but bardelys was overtough for his teeth he sent that notorious young gentleman a challenge and on the following morning he left him dead in the horsemarket behind the hotel vendome but far from a murder monsieur it was an act of justice and the most richly earned punishment with which ever man was visited  even if so cried the vicomte in some surprise why all this heat to defend a brawler  a brawler i repeated after him oh no that is a charge his worst enemies cannot make against bardelys he is no brawler the duel in question was his first affair of the kind and it has been his last for unto him has clung the reputation that had belonged until then to la vertoile and there is none in france bold enough to send a challenge to him and seeing what surprise i was provoking i thought it well to involve another with me in his defence so turning to the chevalier i am sure said i that monsieur de sainteustache will confirm my words  thereupon his vanity being all aroused the chevalier set himself to paraphrase all that i had said with a heat that cast mine into a miserable insignificance  at least laughed the vicomte at length he lacks not for champions for my own part i am content to pray heaven that he come not to lavedan as he intended  mais voyons gaston the vicomtesse protested why harbour prejudice wait at least until you have seen him that you may judge him for yourself  already have i judged him i pray that i may never see him  they tell me he is a very handsome man said she appealing to me for confirmation lavedan shot her a sudden glance of alarm at which i could have laughed hitherto his sole concern had been his daughter but it suddenly occurred to him that perhaps not even her years might set the vicomtesse in safety from imprudences with this devourer of hearts should he still chance to come that way  madame i answered he is accounted not illfavored and with a deprecatory smile i added i am said somewhat to resemble him  say you so she exclaimed raising her eyebrows and looking at me more closely than hitherto and then it seemed to me that into her face crept a shade of disappointment if this bardelys were not more beautiful than i then he was not nearly so beautiful a man as she had imagined she turned to sainteustache  it is indeed so chevalier she inquired do you note the resemblance  vanitas vanitate murmured the youth who had some scraps of latin and a taste for airing them i can see no likenessno trace of one monsieur de lesperon is well enough i should say but bardelys he cast his eyes to the ceiling there is but one bardelys in france  enfin i laughed you are no doubt well qualified to judge chevalier i had flattered myself that some likeness did exist but probably you have seen the marquis more frequently than have i and probably you know him better nevertheless should he come his way i will ask you to look at us side by side and be the judge of the resemblance  should i happen to be here he said with a sudden constraint not difficult to understand i shall be happy to act as arbiter  should you happen to be here i echoed questioningly but surely should you hear that monsieur de bardelys is about to arrive you will postpone any departure you may be on the point of making so that you may renew this great friendship that you tell us you do the marquis the honour of entertaining for him  the chevalier eyed me with the air of a man looking down from a great height upon another the vicomte smiled quietly to himself as he combed his fair beard with his forefinger in a meditative fashion whilst even roxalannewho had sat silently listening to a conversation that she was at times mercifully spared from following too minutelyflashed me a humorous glance to the vicomtesse alone who in common with women of her type was of a singular obtusenesswas the situation without significance  sainteustache to defend himself against my delicate imputation and to show how well acquainted he was with bardelys plunged at once into a thousand details of that gentlemans magnificence he described his suppers his retinue his equipages his houses his chateaux his favour with the king his successes with the fair sex and i know not what besidesin all of which i confess that even to me there was a certain degree of novelty roxalanne listened with an air of amusement that showed how well she read him later when i found myself alone with her by the river whither we had gone after the repast and the chevaliers reminiscences were at an end she reverted to that conversation  is not my cousin a great fanfarron monsieur she asked  surely you know your cousin better than i i answered cautiously why question me upon his character  i was hardly questioning i was commenting he spent a fortnight in paris once and he accounts himself or would have us account him intimate with every courtier at the luxembourg oh he is very amusing this good cousin but tiresome too she laughed and there was the faintest note of scorn in her amusement now touching this marquis de bardelys it is very plain that the chevalier boasted when he said that they were as brothershe and the marquisis it not he grew ill at ease when you reminded him of the possibility of the marquiss visit to lavedan and she laughed quaintly to herself do you think that he so much as knows bardelys she asked me suddenly  not so much as by sight i answered he is full of information concerning that unworthy gentleman but it is only information that the meanest scullion in paris might afford you and just as inaccurate  why do you speak of him as unworthy are you of the same opinion as my father  aye and with better cause  you know him well  know him pardieu he is my worst enemy a wornout libertine a sneering cynical misogynist a nauseated reveller a hateful egotist there is no more unworthy person ill swear in all france peste the very memory of the fellow makes me sick let us talk of other things  but although i urged it with the best will and the best intentions in the world i was not to have my way the air became suddenly heavy with the scent of musk and the chevalier de sainteustache stood before us and forced the conversation once more upon the odious topic of monsieur de bardelys  the poor fool came with a plan of campaign carefully considered bent now upon overthrowing me with the knowledge he would exhibit and whereby he looked to encompass my humiliation before his cousin  speaking of bardelys monsieur de lesperon  my dear chevalier we were no longer speaking of him  he smiled darkly let us speak of him then  but are there not a thousand more interesting things that we might speak of  this he took for a fresh sign of fear and so he pressed what he accounted his advantage  yet have patience there is a point on which perhaps you can give me some information  impossible said i  are you acquainted with the duchesse de bourgogne  i was i answered casually and as casually i added are you  excellently well he replied unhesitatingly i was in paris at the time of the scandal with bardelys  i looked up quickly  was it then that you met her i inquired in an idle sort of way  yes i was in the confidence of bardelys and one night after we had supped at his hotelone of those suppers graced by every wit in parishe asked me if i were minded to accompany him to the louvre we went a masque was in progress  ah said i after the manner of one who suddenly takes in the entire situation and it was at this masque that you met the duchesse  you have guessed it ah monsieur if i were to tell you of the things that i witnessed that night they would amaze you said he with a great air and a casual glance at mademoiselle to see into what depth of wonder these glimpses into his wicked past were plunging her  i doubt it not said i thinking that if his imagination were as fertile in that connection as it had been in mine he was likely indeed to have some amazing things to tell but do i understand you to say that that was the time of the scandal you have touched upon  the scandal burst three days after that masque it came as a surprise to most people as for mefrom what bardelys had told mei expected nothing less  pardon chevalier but how old do you happen to be  a curious question that said he knitting his brows  perhaps but will you not answer it  i am twentyone said he what of it  you are twenty mon cousin roxalanne corrected him  he looked at her a second with an injured air  why truetwenty that is so he acquiesced and again what of it he demanded  what of it monsieur i echoed will you forgive me if i express amazement at your precocity and congratulate you upon it  his brows went if possible closer together and his face grew very red he knew that somewhere a pitfall awaited him yet hardly where  i do not understand you  bethink you chevalier ten years have flown since this scandal you refer to so that at the time of your supping with bardelys and the wits of paris at the time of his making a confidant of you and carrying you off to a masque at the louvre at the time of his presenting you to the duchesse de bourgogne you were just ten years of age i never had cause to think overwell of bardelys but had you not told me yourself i should have hesitated to believe him so vile a despoiler of innocence such a perverter of youth  he crimsoned to the very roots of his hair  roxalanne broke into a laugh my cousin my cousin she cried they that would become masters should begin early is it not so  monsieur de lesperon said he in a very formal voice do you wish me to apprehend that you have put me through this catechism for the purpose of casting a doubt upon what i have said  but have i done that have i cast a doubt i asked with the utmost meekness  so i apprehend  then you apprehend amiss your words i assure you admit of no doubt whatever and now monsieur if you will have mercy upon me we will talk of other things i am so weary of this unfortunate bardelys and his affairs he may be the fashion of paris and at court but down here his very name befouls the air mademoiselle i said turning to roxalanne you promised me a lesson in the lore of flowers  come then said she and being an exceedingly wise child she plunged straightway into the history of the shrubs about us  thus did we avert a storm that for a moment was very imminent yet some mischief was done and some good too perhaps for if i made an enemy of the chevalier de sainteustache by humbling him in the eyes of the one woman before whom he sought to shine i established a bond twixt roxalanne and myself by that same humiliation of a foolish coxcomb whose boastfulness had long wearied her     chapter vii the hostility of sainteustache   in the days that followed i saw much of the chevalier de sainteustache he was a very constant visitor at lavedan and the reason of it was not far to seek for my own part i disliked himi had done so from the moment when first i had set eyes on himand since hatred like affection is often a matter of reciprocity the chevalier was not slow to return my dislike our manner gradually by almost imperceptible stages grew more distant until by the end of a week it had become so hostile that lavedan found occasion to comment upon it  beware of sainteustache he warned me you are becoming very manifestly distasteful to each other and i would urge you to have a care i dont trust him his attachment to our cause is of a lukewarm character and he gives me uneasiness for he may do much harm if he is so inclined it is on this account that i tolerate his presence at lavedan frankly i fear him and i would counsel you to do no less the man is a liar even if but a boastful liar and liars are never long out of mischief  the wisdom of the words was unquestionable but the advice in them was not easily followed particularly by one whose position was so peculiar as my own in a way i had little cause to fear the harm the chevalier might do me but i was impelled to consider the harm that at the same time he might do the vicomte  despite our growing enmity the chevalier and i were very frequently thrown together the reason for this was of course that wherever roxalanne was to be found there generally were we both to be found also yet had i advantages that must have gone to swell a rancour based as much upon jealousy as any other sentiment for whilst he was but a daily visitor at lavedan i was established there indefinitely  of the use that i made of that time i find it difficult to speak from the first moment that i had beheld roxalanne i had realized the truth of chatelleraults assertion that i had never known a woman he was right those that i had met and by whom i had judged the sex had by contrast with this child little claim to the title virtue i had accounted a shadow without substance innocence a synonym for ignorance love a fable a fairy tale for the delectation of overgrown children  in the company of roxalanne de lavedan all those old cynical beliefs built up upon a youth of undesirable experiences were shattered and the error of them exposed swiftly was i becoming a convert to the faith which so long i had sneered at and as lovesick as any unfledged youth in his first amour  damn it was something for a man who had lived as i had lived to have his pulses quicken and his colour change at a maids approach to find himself colouring under her smile and paling under her disdain to have his mind running on rhymes and his soul so enslaved that if she is not to be won chagrin will dislodge it from his body  here was a fine mood for a man who had entered upon his business by pledging himself to win and wed this girl in cold and supreme indifference to her personality and that pledge how i cursed it during those days at lavedan how i cursed chatellerault cunning subtle trickster that he was how i cursed myself for my lack of chivalry and honour in having been lured so easily into so damnable a business for when the memory of that wager rose before me it brought despair in its train had i found roxalanne the sort of woman that i had looked to findthe only sort that i had ever knownthen matters had been easy i had set myself in cold blood and by such wiles as i knew to win such affection as might be hers to bestow and i would have married her in much the same spirit as a man performs any other of the necessary acts of his lifetime and station i would have told her that i was bardelys and to the woman that i had expected to find there had been no difficulty in making the confession but to roxalanne had there been no wager i might have confessed my identity as it was i found it impossible to avow the one without the other for the sweet innocence that invested her gentle trusting soul must have given pause to any but the most abandoned of men before committing a vileness in connection with her  we were much together during that week and just as day by day hour by hour my passion grew and grew until it absorbed me utterly so too did it seem to me that it awakened in her a responsive note there was an odd light at times in her soft eyes i came upon her more than once with snatches of lovesongs on her lips and when she smiled upon me there was a sweet tenderness in her smile which had things been different would have gladdened my soul beyond all else but which things being as they were was rather wont to heighten my despair i was no coxcomb i had had experiences and i knew these signs but something too i guessed of the heart of such a one as roxalanne to the full i realized the pain and shame i should inflict upon her when my confession came i realized too how the love of this dear child so honourable and high of mind must turn to contempt and scorn when i plucked away my mask and let her see how poor a countenance i wore beneath  and yet i drifted with the tide of things it was my habit so to drift and the habit of a lifetime is not to be set at naught in a day by a resolve however firm a score of times was i reminded that an evil is but increased by being ignored a score of times confession trembled on my lips and i burned to tell her everything from its inceptionthe environment that had erstwhile warped me the honesty by which i was now inspiredand so cast myself upon the mercy of her belief  she might accept my story and attaching credit to it forgive me the deception i had practised and recognize the great truth that must ring out in the avowal of my love but on the other hand she might not accept it she might deem my confession a shrewd part of my scheme and the dread of that kept me silent day by day  fully did i see how with every hour that sped confession became more and more difficult the sooner the thing were done the greater the likelihood of my being believed the later i left it the more probable was it that i should be discredited alas bardelys it seemed had added cowardice to his other shortcomings  as for the coldness of roxalanne that was a pretty fable of chatelleraults or else no more than an assumption an invention of the imaginative la fosse far indeed from it i found no arrogance or coldness in her all unversed in the artifices of her sex all unacquainted with the wiles of coquetry she was the very incarnation of naturalness and maidenly simplicity to the tales thatwith many expurgationsi told her of court life to the pictures that i drew of paris the luxembourg the louvre the palais cardinal and the courtiers that thronged those historic palaces she listened avidly and enthralled and much as othello won the heart of desdemona by a recital of the perils he had endured so it seemed to me was i winning the heart of roxalanne by telling her of the things that i had seen  once or twice she expressed wonder at the depth and intimacy of the knowledge of such matters exhibited by a simple gascon gentleman whereupon i would urge in explanation the appointment in the guards that lesperon had held some few years ago a position that will reveal much to an observant man  the vicomte noted our growing intimacy yet set no restraint upon it down in his heart i believe that noble gentleman would have been well pleased had matters gone to extremes between us for however impoverished he might deem me lesperons estates in gascony being as i have said likely to suffer sequestration in view of his treasonhe remembered the causes of this and the deep devotion of the man i impersonated to the affairs of gaston dorleans  again he feared the very obvious courtship of the chevalier de sainteustache and he would have welcomed a turn of events that would effectually have frustrated it that he did not himself interfere so far as the chevaliers wooing was concerned i could but set down to the mistrust of sainteustacheamounting almost to fearof which he had spoken  as for the vicomtesse the same causes that had won me some of the daughters regard gained me also no little of the mothers  she had been attached to the chevalier until my coming but what did the chevalier know of the great world compared with what i could tell her love of scandal drew her to me with inquiries upon this person and that person many of them but names to her  my knowledge and wealth of detailfor all that i curbed it lest i should seem to know too muchdelighted her prurient soul had she been more motherly this same knowledge that i exhibited should have made her ponder what manner of life i had led and should have inspired her to account me no fit companion for her daughter but a selfish woman little inclined to be plagued by the concerns of anothereven when that other was her daughtershe left things to the destructive course that they were shaping  and so everythingif we except perhaps the chevalier de sainteustacheconspired to the advancement of my suit in a manner that must have made chatellerault grind his teeth in rage if he could have witnessed it but which made me grind mine in despair when i pondered the situation in detail  one eveningi had been ten days at the chateauwe went a halfleague or so up the garonne in a boat she and i as we were returning drifting with the stream the oars idle in my hand i spoke of leaving lavedan  she looked up quickly her expression was almost of alarm and her eyes dilated as they met minefor as i have said she was all unversed in the ways of her sex and by nature too guileless to attempt to disguise her feelings or dissemble them  but why must you go so soon she asked you are safe at lavedan and abroad you may be in danger it was but two days ago that they took a poor young gentleman of these parts at pau so that you see the persecution is not yet ended are youand her voice trembled ever so slightlyare you weary of us monsieur  i shook my head at that and smiled wistfully  weary i echoed surely mademoiselle you do not think it surely your heart must tell you something very different  she dropped her eyes before the passion of my gaze and when presently she answered me there was no guile in her words there were the dictates of the intuitions of her sex and nothing more  but it is possible monsieur you are accustomed to the great world  the great world of lesperon in gascony i interrupted  no no the great world you have inhabited at paris and elsewhere i can understand that at lavedan you should find little of interest andand that your inactivity should render you impatient to be gone  if there were so little to interest me then it might be as you say but oh mademoiselle i ceased abruptly fool i had almost fallen a prey to the seductions that the time afforded me the balmy languorous eventide the broad smooth river down which we glided the foliage the shadows on the water her presence and our isolation amid such surroundings had almost blotted out the matter of the wager and of my duplicity  she laughed a little nervous laugh andmaybe to ease the tension that my sudden silence had begottenyou see she said how your imagination deserts you when you seek to draw upon it for proof of what you protest you were about to tell me ofof the interests that hold you at lavedan and when you come to ponder them you find that you can think of nothing is itis it not so she put the question very timidly as if half afraid of the answer she might provoke  no it is not so i said  i paused a moment and in that moment i wrestled with myself confession and avowalconfession of what i had undertaken and avowal of the love that had so unexpectedly come to metrembled upon my lips to be driven shuddering away in fear  have i not said that this bardelys was become a coward then my cowardice suggested a course to meflight i would leave lavedan i would return to paris and to chatellerault owning defeat and paying my wager it was the only course open to me my honour so tardily aroused demanded no less yet not so much because of that as because it was suddenly revealed to me as the easier course did i determine to pursue it what thereafter might become of me i did not know nor in that hour of my hearts agony did it seem to matter overmuch  there is much mademoiselle much indeed to hold me firmly at lavedan i pursued at last but mymy obligations demand of me that i depart  you mean the cause she cried but believe me you can do nothing to sacrifice yourself cannot profit it infinitely better you can serve the duke by waiting until the time is ripe for another blow and how can you better preserve your life than by remaining at lavedan until the persecutions are at an end  i was not thinking of the cause mademoiselle but of myself aloneof my own personal honour i would that i could explain but i am afraid i ended lamely  afraid she echoed now raising her eyes in wonder  aye afraid afraid of your contempt of your scorn  the wonder in her glance increased and asked a question that i could not answer i stretched forward and caught one of the hands lying idle in her lap  roxalanne i murmured very gently and my tone my touch and the use of her name drove her eyes for refuge behind their lids again a flush spread upon the ivory pallor of her face to fade as swiftly leaving it very white her bosom rose and fell in agitation and the little hand i held trembled in my grasp there was a moments silence not that i had need to think or choose my words but there was a lump in my throataye i take no shame in confessing it for this was the first time that a good and true emotion had been vouchsafed me since the duchesse de bourgogne had shattered my illusions ten years ago  roxalanne i resumed presently when i was more master of myself we have been good friends you and i since that night when i climbed for shelter to your chamber have we not  but yes monsieur she faltered  ten days ago it is think of itno more than ten days and it seems as if i had been months at lavedan so well have we become acquainted in these ten days we have formed opinions of each other but with this difference that whilst mine are right yours are wrong i have come to know you for the sweetest gentlest saint in all this world would to god i had known you earlier it might have been very different i might have beeni would have beendifferent and i would not have done what i have done you have come to know me for an unfortunate but honest gentleman such am i not i am under false colours here mademoiselle unfortunate i may beat least of late i seem to have become so honest i am noti have not been there child i can tell you no more i am too great a coward but when later you shall come to hear the truthwhen after i am gone they may tell you a strange story touching this fellow lesperon who sought the hospitality of your fathers housebethink you of my restraint in this hour bethink you of my departure you will understand these things perhaps afterwards but bethink you of them and you will unriddle them for yourself perhaps be merciful upon me then judge me not overharshly  i paused and for a moment we were silent then suddenly she looked up her fingers tightened upon mine  monsieur de lesperon she pleaded of what do speak you are torturing me monsieur  look in my face roxalanne can you see nothing there of how i am torturing myself  then tell me monsieur she begged her voice a very caress of suppliant softnesstell me what vexes you and sets a curb upon your tongue you exaggerate i am assured you could do nothing dishonourable nothing vile  child i cried i thank god that you are right i cannot do what is dishonourable and i will not for all that a month ago i pledged myself to do it  a sudden horror a doubt a suspicion flashed into her glance  youyou do not mean that you are a spy she asked and from my heart a prayer of thanks went up to heaven that this at least it was mine frankly to deny  no nonot that i am no spy  her face cleared again and she sighed  it is i think the only thing i could not forgive since it is not that will you not tell me what it is  for a moment the temptation to confess to tell her everything was again upon me but the futility of it appalled me  dont ask me i besought her you will learn it soon enough for i was confident that once my wager was paid the news of it and of the ruin of bardelys would spread across the face of france like a ripple over water presently  forgive me for having come into your life roxalanne i implored her and then i sighed again helas had i but known you earlier i did not dream such women lived in this wornout france  i will not pry monsieur since your resolve appears to be so firm but ifif after i have heard this thing you speak of she said presently speaking with averted eyes and if having heard it i judge you more mercifully than you judge yourself and i send for you will youwill you come back to lavedan  my heart gave a great bounda great a sudden throb of hope but as sudden and as great was the rebound into despair  you will not send for me be assured of that i said with finality and we spoke no more  i took the oars and plied them vigorously i was in haste to end the situation tomorrow i must think of my departure and as i rowed i pondered the words that had passed between us not one word of love had there been and yet in the very omission of it avowal had lain on either side a strange wooing had been minea wooing that precluded the possibility of winning and yet a wooing that had won aye it had won but it might not take i made fine distinctions and quaint paradoxes as i tugged at my oars for the human mind is a curiously complex thing and with some of us there is no such spur to humour as the sting of pain  roxalanne sat white and very thoughtful but with veiled eyes so that i might guess nothing of what passed within her mind  at last we reached the chateau and as i brought the boat to the terrace steps it was sainteustache who came forward to offer his wrist to mademoiselle  he noted the pallor of her face and darted me a quick suspicionladen glance as we were walking towards the chateau  monsieur de lesperon said he in a curious tone do you know that a rumour of your death is current in the province  i had hoped that such a rumour might get abroad when i disappeared i answered calmly  and you have taken no single step to contradict it  why should i since in that rumour may be said to lie my safety  nevertheless monsieur voyons surely you might at least relieve the anxieties the affliction i might almost sayof those who are mourning you  ah said i and who may these be  he shrugged his shoulders and pursed his lips in a curiously deprecatory smile with a sidelong glance at mademoiselle  do you need that i name mademoiselle de marsac he sneered  i stood still my wits busily working my face impassive under his scrutinizing glance in a flash it came to me that this must be the writer of some of the letters lesperon had given me the original of the miniature i carried  as i was silent i grew suddenly conscious of another pair of eyes observing me mademoiselles she remembered what i had said she may have remembered how i had cried out the wish that i had met her earlier and she may not have been slow to find an interpretation for my words i could have groaned in my rage at such a misinterpretation i could have taken the chevalier round to the other side of the chateau and killed him with the greatest relish in the world but i restrained myself i resigned myself to be misunderstood what choice had i  monsieur de sainteustache said i very coldly and looking him straight between his closeset eyes i have permitted you many liberties but there is one that i cannot permit any oneand much as i honour you i can make no exception in your favour that is to interfere in my concerns and presume to dictate to me the manner in which i shall conduct them be good enough to bear that in your memory  in a moment he was all servility the sneer passed out of his face the arrogance out of his demeanour he became as full of smiles and capers as the meanest sycophant  you will forgive me monsieur he cried spreading his hands and with the humblest smile in the world i perceive that i have taken a great liberty yet you have misunderstood its purport i sought to sound you touching the wisdom of a step upon which i have ventured  that is monsieur i asked throwing back my head with the scent of danger breast high  i took it upon myself today to mention the fact that you are alive and well to one who had a right i thought to know of it and who is coming hither tomorrow  that was a presumption you may regret said i between my teeth to whom do you impart this information  to your friend monsieur de marsac he answered and through his mask of humility the sneer was again growing apparent he will be here tomorrow he repeated  marsac was that friend of lesperons to whose warm commendation of the gascon rebel i owed the courtesy and kindness that the vicomte de lavedan had meted out to me since my coming  is it wonderful that i stood as if frozen my wits refusing to work and my countenance wearing i doubt not a very stricken look here was one coming to lavedan who knew lesperonone who would unmask me and say that i was an impostor what would happen then a spy they would of a certainty account me and that they would make short work of me i never doubted but that was something that troubled me less than the opinion mademoiselle must form how would she interpret what i had said that day in what light would she view me hereafter  such questions sped like swift arrows through my mind and in their train came a dull anger with myself that i had not told her everything that afternoon it was too late now the confession would come no longer of my own free will as it might have done an hour ago but would be forced from me by the circumstances that impended thus it would no longer have any virtue to recommend it to her mercy  the news seems hardly welcome monsieur de lesperon said roxalanne in a voice that was inscrutable her tone stirred me for it betokened suspicion already something might yet chance to aid me and in the mean while i might spoil all did i yield to this dread of the morrow by an effort i mastered myself and in tones calm and level that betrayed nothing of the tempest in my soul  it is not welcome mademoiselle i answered i have excellent reasons for not desiring to meet monsieur de marsac  excellent indeed are they lisped sainteustache with an ugly droop at the corners of his mouth i doubt not youll find it hard to offer a plausible reason for having left him and his sister without news that you were alive  monsieur said i at random why will you drag in his sisters name  why he echoed and he eyed me with undisguised amusement he was standing erect his head thrown back his right arm outstretched from the shoulder and his hand resting lightly upon the gold mount of his beribboned cane he let his eyes wander from me to roxalanne then back again to me at last is it wonderful that i should drag in the name of your betrothed said he but perhaps you will deny that mademoiselle de marsac is that to you he suggested  and i forgetting for the moment the part i played and the man whose identity i had put on made answer hotly i do deny it  why then you lie said he and shrugged hits shoulders with insolent contempt  in all my life i do not think it could be said of me that i had ever given way to rage rude untutored minds may fall a prey to passion but a gentleman i hold is never angry nor was i then so far as the outward signs of anger count i doffed my hat with a sweep to roxalanne who stood by with fear and wonder blending in her glance  mademoiselle you will forgive that i find it necessary to birch this babbling schoolboy in your presence  then with the pleasantest manner in the world i stepped aside and plucked the cane from the chevaliers hand before he had so much as guessed what i was about i bowed before him with the utmost politeness as if craving his leave and tolerance for what i was about to do and then before he had recovered from his astonishment i had laid that cane three times in quick succession across his shoulders with a cry at once of pain and of mortification he sprang back and his hand dropped to his hilt  monsieur roxalanne cried to him do you not see that he is unarmed  but he saw nothing or if he saw thanked heaven that things were in such case and got his sword out thereupon roxalanne would have stepped between us but with arm outstretched i restrained her  have no fear mademoiselle said i very quietly for if the wrist that had overcome la vertoile were not with a stick a match for a couple of such swords as this coxcombs then was i forever shamed  he bore down upon me furiously his point coming straight for my throat i took the blade on the cane then as he disengaged and came at me lower i made counterparry and pursuing the circle after i had caught his steel i carried it out of his hand it whirled an instant a shimmering wheel of light then it clattered against the marble balustrade half a dozen yards away with his sword it seemed that his courage too departed and he stood at my mercy a curious picture of foolishness surprise and fear  now the chevalier de sainteustache was a young man and in the young we can forgive much but to forgive such an act as he had been guilty ofthat of drawing his sword upon a man who carried no weaponswould have been not only a ridiculous toleration but an utter neglect of duty as an older man it behoved me to read the chevalier a lesson in manners and gentlemanly feeling so quite dispassionately and purely for his own future good i went about the task and administered him a thrashing that for thoroughness it would be hard to better i was not discriminating i brought my cane down with a rhythmical precision and whether it took him on the head the back or the shoulders i held to be more his affair than mine i had a moral to inculcate and the injuries he might receive in the course of it were inconsiderable details so that the lesson was borne in upon his soul two or three times he sought to close with me but i eluded him i had no mind to descend to a vulgar exchange of blows my object was not to brawl but to administer chastisement and this object i may claim to have accomplished with a fair degree of success  at last roxalanne interfered but only when one blow a little more violent perhaps than its precursors resulted in the sudden snapping of the cane and monsieur de eustaches utter collapse into a moaning heap  i deplore mademoiselle to have offended your sight with such a spectacle but unless these lessons are administered upon the instant their effect is not half so salutary  he deserved it monsieur said she with a note almost of fierceness in her voice and of such poor mettle are we that her resentment against that groaning mass of fopperies and wheals sent a thrill of pleasure through me i walked over to the spot where his sword had fallen and picked it up  monsieur de sainteustache said i you have so dishonoured this blade that i do not think you would care to wear it again saying which i snapped it across my knee and flung it far out into the river for all that the hilt was a costly one richly wrought in bronze and gold  he raised his livid countenance and his eyes blazed impotent fury  par la mort dieu he cried hoarsely you shall give me satisfaction for this  if you account yourself still unsatisfied i am at your service when you will said i courteously  then before more could be said i saw monsieur de lavedan and the vicomtesse approaching hurriedly across the parterre the vicomtes brow was black with what might have appeared anger but which i rightly construed into apprehension  what has taken place what have you done he asked of me  he has brutally assaulted the chevalier cried madame shrilly her eyes malevolently set upon me he is only a child this poor sainteustache she reproached me i saw it all from my window monsieur de lesperon it was brutal it was cowardly so to beat a boy shame if you had a quarrel with him are there not prescribed methods for their adjustment between gentlemen pardieu could you not have given him proper satisfaction  if madame will give herself the trouble of attentively examining this poor sainteustache said i with a sarcasm which her virulence prompted you will agree i think that i have given him very proper and very thorough satisfaction i would have met him sword in hand but the chevalier has the fault of the very younghe is precipitate he was in too great a haste and he could not wait until i got a sword so i was forced to do what i could with a cane  but you provoked him she flashed back  whoever told you so has misinformed you madame on the contrary he provoked me he gave me the lie i struck himcould i do lessand he drew i defended myself and i supplemented my defence by a caning so that this poor sainteustache might realize the unworthiness of what he had done that is all madame  but she was not so easily to be appeased not even when mademoiselle and the vicomte joined their voices to mine in extenuation of my conduct it was like lavedan for all that he was full of dread of the result and of the vengeance sainteustache might wreakboy though he washe expressed himself freely touching the chevaliers behaviour and the fittingness of the punishment that had overtaken him  the vicomtesse stood in small awe of her husband but his judgment upon a point of honour was a matter that she would not dare contest she was ministering to the still prostrate chevalier who i think remained prostrate now that he might continue to make appeal to her sympathywhen suddenly she cut in upon roxalannes defence of me  where have you been she demanded suddenly  when my mother  this afternoon answered the vicomtesse impatiently the chevalier was waiting two hours for you  roxalanne coloured to the roots of her hair the vicomte frowned  waiting for me my mother but why for me  answer my questionwhere have you been  i was with monsieur de lesperon she answered simply  alone the vicomtesse almost shrieked  but yes the poor childs tones were laden with wonder at this catechism  gods death she snapped it seems that my daughter is no better than  heaven knows what may have been coming for she had the most virulent scandalous tongue that i have ever known in a womans headwhich is much for one who has lived at court to say but the vicomte sharing my fears perhaps and wishing to spare the childs ears interposed quickly come madame what airs are these what sudden assumption of graces that we do not affect we are not in paris this is not the luxembourg en province comme en province and here we are simple folk  simple folk she interrupted gasping by god am i married to a ploughman am i vicomtesse of lavedan or the wife of a boor of the countryside and is the honour of your daughter a matter  the honour of my daughter is not in question madame he interrupted in his turn and with a sudden sternness that spent the fire of her indignation as a spark that is trampled underfoot then in a calm level voice ah here are the servants said he  permit them madame to take charge of monsieur de sainteustache anatole you had better order the carriage for monsieur le chevalier i do not think that he will be able to ride home  anatole peered at the pale young gentleman on the ground then he turned his little wizened face upon me and grinned in a singularly solemn fashion monsieur de sainteustache was little loved it seemed  leaning heavily upon the arm of one of the lacqueys the chevalier moved painfully towards the courtyard where the carriage was being prepared for him at the last moment he turned and beckoned the vicomte to his side  as god lives monsieur de lavedan he swore breathing heavily in the fury that beset him you shall bitterly regret having taken sides today with that gascon bully remember me both of you when you are journeying to toulouse  the vicomte stood beside him impassive and unmoved by that grim threat for all that to him it must have sounded like a deathsentence  adieu monsieura speedy recovery was all he answered  but i stepped up to them do you not think vicomte that it were better to detain him i asked  pshaw he ejaculated let him go  the chevaliers eyes met mine in a look of terror perhaps already that young man repented him of his menace and he realized the folly of threatening one in whose power he still chanced to be  bethink you monsieur i cried yours is a noble and useful life mine is not without value either shall we suffer these livesaye and the happiness of your wife and daughterto be destroyed by this vermin  let him go monsieur let him go i am not afraid  i bowed and stepped back motioning to the lacquey to take the fellow away much as i should have motioned him to remove some uncleanness from before me  the vicomtesse withdrew in high dudgeon to her chamber and i did not see her again that evening mademoiselle i saw once for a moment and she employed that moment to question me touching the origin of my quarrel with sainteustache  did he really lie monsieur de lesperon she asked  upon my honour mademoiselle i answered solemnly i have plighted my troth to no living woman then my chin sank to my breast as i bethought me of how tomorrow she must opine me the vilest liar livingfor i was resolved to be gone before marsac arrivedsince the real lesperon i did not doubt was indeed betrothed to mademoiselle de marsac  i shall leave lavedan betimes tomorrow mademoiselle i pursued presently what has happened today makes my departure all the more urgent delay may have its dangers you will hear strange things of me as already i have warned you but be merciful much will be true much false yet the truth itself is very vile and i stopped short in despair of explaining or even tempering what had to come i shrugged my shoulders in my abandonment of hope and i turned towards the window she crossed the room and came to stand beside me  will you not tell me have you no faith in me ah monsieur de lesperon  sh child i cannot it is too late to tell you now  oh not too late from what you say they will tell me i should think perhaps worse of you than you deserve what is this thing you hide what is this mystery tell me monsieur tell me  did ever woman more plainly tell a man she loved him and that loving him she would find all excuses for him was ever woman in better case to hear a confession from the man that loved her and of whose love she was assured by every instinct that her sex possesses in such matters those two questions leapt into my mind and in resolving them i all but determined to speak even now in the eleventh hour  and theni know not howa fresh barrier seemed to arise it was not merely a matter of telling her of the wager i was embarked upon not merely a matter of telling her of the duplicity that i had practised of the impostures by which i had gained admittance to her fathers confidence and trust not merely a matter of confessing that i was not lesperon there would still be the necessity of saying who i was even if she forgave all else could she forgive me for being bardelys the notorious bardelys the libertine the rake some of whose exploits she had heard of from her mother painted a hundred times blacker than they really were might she not shrink from me when i told her i was that man in her pure innocence she deemed no doubt that the life of every man who accounted himself a gentleman was moderately clean she would not see in meas did her motherno more than a type of the best class in france and having no more than the vices of my order as a monster of profligacy might she behold me and thatah dieui could not endure that she should do whilst i was by  it may beindeed now as i look back i know that i exaggerated my case i imagined she would see it as i saw it then for would you credit it with this great love that was now come to me it seemed the ideals of my boyhood were returned and i abhorred the man that i had been the life i had led now filled me with disgust and loathing the notions i had formed seemed to me now all vicious and distorted my cynicism shallow and unjust  monsieur de lesperon she called softly to me noting my silence  i turned to her i set my hand lightly upon her arm i let my gaze encounter the upward glance of her eyesblue as forgetmenots  you suffer she murmured with sweet compassion  worse roxalanne i have sown in your heart too the seed of suffering oh i am too unworthy i cried out and when you come to discover how unworthy it will hurt you it will sting your pride to think how kind you were to me she smiled incredulously in denial of my words no child i cannot tell you  she sighed and then before more could be said there was a sound at the door and we started away from each other the vicomte entered and my last chance of confessing of perhaps averting much of what followed was lost to me     chapter viii the portrait   into the mind of every thoughtful man must come at times with bitterness the reflection of how utterly we are at the mercy of fate the victims of her every whim and caprice we may set out with the loftiest the sternest resolutions to steer our lives along a wellconsidered course yet the slightest of fortuitous circumstances will suffice to force us into a direction that we had no thought of taking  now had it pleased monsieur de marsac to have come to lavedan at any reasonable hour of the day i should have been already upon the road to paris intent to own defeat and pay my wager a night of thought besides strengthening my determination to follow such a course had brought the reflection that i might thereafter return to roxalanne a poor man it is true but one at least whose intentions might not be misconstrued  and so when at last i sank into sleep my mind was happier than it had been for many days of roxalannes love i was assured and it seemed that i might win her after all once i removed the barrier of shame that now deterred me it may be that those thoughts kept me awake until a late hour and that to this i owe it that when on the morrow i awakened the morning was well advanced the sun was flooding my chamber and at my bedside stood anatole  whats oclock i inquired sitting bolt upright  past ten said he with stern disapproval  and you have let me sleep i cried  we do little else at lavedan even when we are awake he grumbled there was no reason why monsieur should rise then holding out a paper monsieur stanislas de marsac was here betimes this morning with mademoiselle his sister he left this letter for you monsieur  amaze and apprehension were quickly followed by relief since anatoles words suggested that marsac had not remained i took the letter nevertheless with some misgivings and whilst i turned it over in my hands i questioned the old servant  he stayed an hour at the chateau monsieur anatole informed me monsieur le vicomte would have had you roused but he would not hear of it if what monsieur de sainteustache has told me touching your guest should prove to be true said he i would prefer not to meet him under your roof monsieur monsieur de sainteustache my master replied is not a person whose word should have weight with any man of honour but in spite of that monsieur de marsac held to his resolve and although he would offer no explanation in answer to my masters many questions you were not aroused  at the end of a halfhour his sister entered with mademoiselle they had been walking together on the terrace and mademoiselle de marsac appeared very angry affairs are exactly as monsieur de sainteustache has represented them said she to her brother at that he swore a most villainous oath and called for writing materials at the moment of his departure he desired me to deliver this letter to you and then rode away in a fury and seemingly not on the best of terms with monsieur le vicomte  and his sister i asked quickly  she went with him a fine pair as i live he added casting his eyes to the ceiling  at least i could breathe freely they were gone and whatever damage they may have done to the character of poor rene de lesperon ere they departed they were not there at all events to denounce me for an impostor with a mental apology to the shade of the departed lesperon for all the discredit i was bringing down upon his name i broke the seal of that momentous epistle which enclosed a length of some thirtytwo inches of string  monsieur i read wherever i may chance to meet you it shall be my duty to kill you  a rich beginning in all faith if he could but maintain that uncompromising dramatic flavour to the end his epistle should be worth the trouble of deciphering for he penned a vile scrawl of pothooks  it is because of this the letter proceeded that i have refrained from coming face to face with you this morning the times are too troublous and the province is in too dangerous a condition to admit of an act that might draw the eyes of the keeper of the seals upon lavedan to my respect then to monsieur le vicomte and to my own devotion to the cause we mutually serve do you owe it that you still live i am on my way to spain to seek shelter there from the kings vengeance  to save myself is a duty that i owe as much to myself as to the cause but there is another duty one that i owe my sister whom you have so outrageously slighted and this duty by gods grace i will perform before i leave of your honour monsieur we will not speak for reasons into which i need not enter and i make no appeal to it but if you have a spark of manhood left if you are not an utter craven as well as a knave i shall expect you on the day after tomorrow at any hour before noon at the auberge de la couronne at grenade there monsieur if you please we will adjust our differences that you may come prepared and so that no time need be wasted when we meet i send you the length of my sword  thus ended that angry firebreathing epistle i refolded it thoughtfully then having taken my resolve i leapt from the bed and desired anatole to assist me to dress  i found the vicomte much exercised in mind as to the meaning of marsacs extraordinary behaviour and i was relieved to see that he at least could conjecture no cause for it in reply to the questions with which he very naturally assailed me i assured him that it was no more than a matter of a misunderstanding that monsieur de marsac had asked me to meet him at grenade in two days time and that i should then no doubt be able to make all clear  meanwhile i regretted the incident since it necessitated my remaining and encroaching for two days longer upon the vicomtes hospitality to all this however he made the reply that i expected concluding with the remark that for the present at least it would seem as if the chevalier de sainteustache had been satisfied with creating this trouble betwixt myself and marsac  from what anatole had said i had already concluded that marsac had exercised the greatest reticence but the interview between his sister and roxalanne filled me with the gravest anxiety women are not wont to practise the restraint of men under such circumstances and for all that mademoiselle de marsac may not have expressed it in so many words that i was her faithless lover yet women are quick to detect and interpret the signs of disorders springing from such causes and i had every fear that roxalanne was come to the conclusion that i had lied to her yesternight with an uneasy spirit then i went in quest of her and i found her walking in the old rose garden behind the chateau  she did not at first remark my approach and i had leisure for some moments to observe her and to note the sadness that dwelt in her profile and the listlessness of her movements this then was my workmine and that of monsieur de chatellerault and those other merry gentlemen who had sat at my table in paris nigh upon a month ago  i moved and the gravel crunched under my foot whereupon she turned and at sight of me advancing towards her she started the blood mounted to her face to ebb again upon the instant leaving it paler than it had been she made as if to depart then she appeared to check herself and stood immovable and outwardly calm awaiting my approach  but her eyes were averted and her bosom rose and fell too swiftly to lend colour to that mask of indifference she hurriedly put on yet as i drew nigh she was the first to speak and the triviality of her words came as a shock to me and for all my knowledge of womans way caused me to doubt for a moment whether perhaps her calm were not real after all  you are a laggard this morning monsieur de lesperon and with a half laugh she turned aside to break a rose from its stem  true i answered stupidly i slept overlate  a thousand pities since thus you missed seeing mademoiselle de marsac have they told you that she was here  yes mademoiselle stanislas de marsac left a letter for me  you will regret not having seen them no doubt quoth she  i evaded the interrogative note in her voice that is their fault they appear to have preferred to avoid me  is it matter for wonder she flashed with a sudden gleam of fury which she as suddenly controlled with the old indifference she added you do not seem perturbed monsieur  on the contrary mademoiselle i am very deeply perturbed  at not having seen your betrothed she asked and now for the first time her eyes were raised and they met mine with a look that was a stab  mademoiselle i had the honour of telling you yesterday that i had plighted my troth to no living woman  at that reminder of yesterday she winced and i was sorry that i had uttered it for it must have set the wound in her pride ableeding again yesterday i had as much as told her that i loved her and yesterday she had as much as answered me that she loved me for yesterday i had sworn that sainteustaches story of my betrothal was a lie today she had had assurance of the truth from the very woman to whom lesperons faith was plighted and i could imagine something of her shame  yesterday monsieur she answered contemptuously you lied in many things  nay i spoke the truth in all oh god in heaven mademoiselle i exclaimed in sudden passion will you not believe me will you not accept my word for what i say and have a little patience until i shall have discharged such obligations as will permit me to explain  explain quoth she with withering disdain  there is a hideous misunderstanding in all this i am the victim of a miserable chain of circumstances oh i can say no more these marsacs i shall easily pacify i am to meet monsieur de marsac at grenade on the day after tomorrow in my pocket i have a letter from this living swordblade in which he tells me that he will give himself the pleasure of killing me then yet  i hope he does monsieur she cut in with a fierceness before which i fell dumb and left my sentence unfinished i shall pray god that he may she added you deserve it as no man deserved it yet  for a moment i stood stricken indeed by her words then my reason grasping the motive of that fierceness a sudden joy pervaded me it was a fierceness breathing that hatred that is a part of love than which it is true no hatred can be more deadly and yet so eloquently did it tell me of those very feelings which she sought jealously to conceal that moved by a sudden impulse i stepped close up to her  roxalanne i said fervently you do not hope for it what would your life be if i were dead child child you love me even as i love you i caught her suddenly to me with infinite tenderness with reverence almost can you lend no ear to the voice of this love can you not have faith in me a little can you not think that if i were quite as unworthy as you makebelieve to your very self this love could have no place  it has no place she cried you lieas in all things else i do not love you i hate you dieu how i hate you  she had lain in my arms until then with upturned face and piteous frightened eyeslike a bird that feels itself within the toils of a snake yet whose horror is blent with a certain fascination now as she spoke her will seemed to reassert itself and she struggled to break from me but as her fierceness of hatred grew so did my fierceness of resolve gain strength and i held her tightly  why do you hate me i asked steadily ask yourself roxalanne and tell me what answer your heart makes does it not answer that indeed you do not hate methat you love me  oh god to be so insulted she cried out will you not release me miserable must i call for help oh you shall suffer for this as there is a heaven you shall be punished  but in my passion i held her despite entreaties threats and struggles i was brutal if you will yet think of what was in my soul at being so misjudged at finding myself in this position and deal not over harshly with me the courage to confess which i had lacked for days came to me then i must tell her let the result be what it might it could not be worse than this and this i could endure no longer  listen roxalanne  i will not listen enough of insults have i heard already let me go  nay but you shall hear me i am not rene de lesperon had these marsacs been less impetuous and foolish had they waited to have seen me this morning they would have told you so  she paused for a second in her struggles to regard me then with a sudden contemptuous laugh she renewed her efforts more vigorously than before  what fresh lies do you offer me release me i will hear no more  as heaven is my witness i have told you the truth i know how wild a sound it has and that is partly why i did not tell you earlier but your disdain i cannot suffer that you should deem me a liar in professing to love you  her struggles were grown so frantic that i was forced to relax my grip but this i did with a suddenness that threw her out of balance and she was in danger of falling backwards to save herself she caught at my doublet which was torn open under the strain  we stood some few feet apart and white and palpitating in her anger she confronted me her eyes lashed me with their scorn but under my steady unflinching gaze they fell at last when next she raised them there was a smile of quiet but unutterable contempt upon her lips  will you swear said she that you are not rene de lesperon that mademoiselle de marsac is not your betrothed  yesby my every hope of heaven i cried passionately  she continued to survey me with that quiet smile of mocking scorn  i have heard it said quoth she that the greatest liars are ever those that are readiest to take oath then with a sudden gasp of loathing i think you have dropped something monsieur said she pointing to the ground and without waiting for more she swung round and left me  face upwards at my feet lay the miniature that poor lesperon had entrusted to me in his dying moments it had dropped from my doublet in the struggle and i never doubted now but that the picture it contained was that of mademoiselle de marsac     chapter ix a night alarm   i was returning that same afternoon from a long walk that i had takenfor my mood was of that unenviable sort that impels a man to be movingwhen i found a travellingchaise drawn up in the quadrangle as if ready for a journey as i mounted the steps of the chateau i came face to face with mademoiselle descending i drew aside that she might pass and this she did with her chin in the air and her petticoat drawn to her that it might not touch me  i would have spoken to her but her eyes looked straight before her with a glance that was too forbidding besides which there was the gaze of a halfdozen grooms upon us so bowing before herthe plume of my doffed hat sweeping the groundi let her go yet i remained standing where she had passed me and watched her enter the coach i looked after the vehicle as it wheeled round and rattled out over the drawbridge to raise a cloud of dust on the white dry road beyond  in that hour i experienced a sense of desolation and a pain to which i find it difficult to give expression it seemed to me as if she had gone out of my life for all timeas if no reparation that i could ever make would suffice to win her back after what had passed between us that morning already wounded in her pride by what mademoiselle de marsac had told her of our relations my behaviour in the rose garden had completed the work of turning into hatred the tender feelings that but yesterday she had all but confessed for me that she hated me now i was well assured my reflections as i walked had borne it in upon me how rash how mad had been my desperate action and with bitterness i realized that i had destroyed the last chance of ever mending matters  not even the payment of my wager and my return in my true character could avail me now the payment of my wager forsooth even that lost what virtue it might have contained where was the heroism of such an act had i not failed indeed and was not therefore the payment of my wager become inevitable  fool fool why had i not profited that gentle mood of hers when we had drifted down the stream together why had i not told her then of the whole business from its ugly inception down to the pass to which things were come adding that to repair the evil i was going back to paris to pay my wager and that when that was done i would return to ask her to become my wife that was the course a man of sense would have adopted he would have seen the dangers that beset him in my false position and would have been quick to have forestalled them in the only manner possible  heighho it was done the game was at an end and i had bungled my part of it like any fool one task remained methat of meeting marsac at grenade and doing justice to the memory of poor lesperon what might betide thereafter mattered little i should be ruined when i had settled with chatellerault and marcel de saintpol de bardelys that brilliant star in the firmament of the court of france would suffer an abrupt eclipse would be quenched for all time but this weighed little with me then i had lost everything that i might have valuedeverything that might have brought fresh zest to a jaded satiated life  later that day i was told by the vicomte that there was a rumour current to the effect that the marquis de bardelys was dead idly i inquired how the rumour had been spread and he told me that a riderless horse which had been captured a few days ago by some peasants had been recognized by monsieur de bardelyss servants as belonging to their master and that as nothing had been seen or heard of him for a fortnight it was believed that he must have met with some mischance not even that piece of information served to arouse my interest let them believe me dead if they would to him that is suffering worse than death to be accounted dead is a small matter  the next day passed without incident mademoiselles absence continued and i would have questioned the vicomte concerning it but a not unnatural hesitancy beset me and i refrained  on the morrow i was to leave lavedan but there were no preparations to be made no packing to be done for during my sojourn there i had been indebted to the generous hospitality of the vicomte for my very apparel we supped quietly together that night the vicomte and ifor the vicomtesse was keeping her room  i withdrew early to my chamber and long i lay awake revolving a gloomy future in my mind i had given no thought to what i should do after having offered my explanation to monsieur de marsac on the morrow nor could i now bring myself to consider it with any degree of interest i would communicate with chatellerault to inform him that i accounted my wager lost i would send him my note of hand making over to him my picardy estates and i would request him to pay off and disband my servants both in paris and at bardelys  as for myself i did not know and as i have hinted i cared but little in what places my future life might lie i had still a little property by beaugency but scant inclination to withdraw to it to paris i would not return that much i was determined upon but upon no more i had thoughts of going to spain yet that course seemed no less futile than any other of which i could bethink me i fell asleep at last vowing that it would be a mercy and a fine solution to the puzzle of how to dispose of the future if i were to awaken no more  i was however destined to be roused again just as the veil of night was being lifted and the chill breath of dawn was upon the world there was a loud knocking at the gates of lavedan confused noises of voices of pattering feet of doors opening and closing within the chateau  there was a rapping at my chamber door and when i went to open i found the vicomte on the threshold nightcapped in his shirt and bearing a lighted taper  there are troopers at the gate he exclaimed as he entered the room that dog sainteustache has already been at work  for all the agitation that must have been besetting him his manner was serene as ever what are we to do he asked  you are admitting themnaturally said i inquiry in my voice  why yes and he shrugged his shoulders what could it avail us to resist them even had i been prepared for it it would be futile to attempt to suffer a siege  i wrapped a dressinggown about me for the morning air was chill  monsieur le vicomte said i gravely i heartily deplore that monsieur de marsacs affairs should have detained me here but for him i had left lavedan two days ago as it is i tremble for you but we may at least hope that my being taken in your house will draw down no ill results upon you i shall never forgive myself if through my having taken refuge here i should have encompassed your destruction  there is no question of that he replied with the quick generosity characteristic of the man this is the work of sainteustache sooner or later i always feared that it would happen for sooner or later he and i must have come to enmity over my daughter that knave had me in his power he knewbeing himself outwardly one of usto what extent i was involved in the late rebellion and i knew enough of him to be assured that if some day he should wish to do me ill he would never scruple to turn traitor i am afraid monsieur de lesperon that it is not for you aloneperhaps not for you at allthat the soldiers have come but for me  then before i could answer him the door was flung wide and into the room in nightcap and hastily donned robelooking a very meagre in that disfiguring deshabilleswept the vicomtesse  see she cried to her husband her strident voice raised in reproachsee to what a pass you have brought us  anne anne he exclaimed approaching her and seeking to soothe her be calm my poor child and be brave  but evading him she towered lean and malevolent as a fury  calm she echoed contemptuously brave then a short laugh broke from hera despairing mocking mirthless expression of anger by god do you add effrontery to your other failings dare you bid me be calm and brave in such an hour have i been warning you fruitlessly these twelve months past that after disregarding me and deriding my warnings you should bid me be calm now that my fears are realized  there was a sound of creaking gates below the vicomte heard it  madame he said putting aside his erstwhile tender manner and speaking with a lofty dignity the troopers have been admitted let me entreat you to retire it is not befitting our station  what is our station she interrupted harshly rebelsproscribed houseless beggars that is our station thanks to you and your insane meddling with treason what is to become of us fool what is to become of roxalanne and me when they shall have hanged you and have driven us from lavedan by gods death a fine season this to talk of the dignity of our station did i not warn you malheureux to leave party faction alone you laughed at me  madame your memory does me an injustice he answered in a strangled voice i never laughed at you in all my life  you did as much at least did you not bid me busy myself with womens affairs did you not bid me leave you to follow your own judgment you have followed itto a pretty purpose as god lives these gentlemen of the kings will cause you to follow it a little farther she pursued with heartless loathsome sarcasm you will follow it as far as the scaffold at toulouse that you will tell me is your own affair but what provision have you made for your wife and daughter did you marry me and get her to leave us to perish of starvation or are we to turn kitchen wenches or sempstresses for our livelihood  with a groan the vicomte sank down upon the bed and covered his face with his hands  god pity me he cried in a voice of agonyan agony such as the fear of death could never have infused into his brave soul an agony born of the heartlessness of this woman who for twenty years had shared his bed and board and who now in the hour of his adversity failed him so cruellyso tragically  aye she mocked in her bitterness call upon god to pity you for i shall not  she paced the room now like a caged lioness her face livid with the fury that possessed her she no longer asked questions she no longer addressed him oath followed oath from her thin lips and the hideousness of this womans blasphemy made me shudder at last there were heavy steps upon the stairs and moved by a sudden impulse madame i cried let me prevail upon you to restrain yourself  she swung round to face me her doseset eyes ablaze with anger  sangdieu by what right do you she began but this was no time to let a womans tongue go babbling on no time for ceremony no season for making a leg and addressing her with a simper i caught her viciously by the wrist and with my face close up to hers folle i cried and ill swear no man had ever used the word to her before she gasped and choked in her surprise and rage then lowering my voice lest it should reach the approaching soldiers would you ruin the vicomte and yourself i muttered her eyes asked me a question and i answered it how do you know that the soldiers have come for your husband it may be that they are seeking meand only me they may know nothing of the vicomtes defection shall you then be the one to inform them of it by your unbridled rantings and your accusations  her jaw fell open in astonishment this was a side of the question she had not considered  let me prevail upon you madame to withdraw and to be of good courage it is more than likely that you alarm yourself without cause  she continued to stare at me in her amazement and the confusion that was congenital with it and if there was not time for her to withdraw at least the possibility i had suggested acted as a timely warning  in that moment the door opened again and on the threshold appeared a young man in a plumed hat and corselet carrying a naked sword in one hand and a lanthorn in the other behind him i caught the gleam of steel from the troopers at his heels  which of you is monsieur rene de lesperon he inquired politely his utterance flavoured by a strong gascon accent  i stood forward i am known by that name monsieur le capitaine said i  he looked at me wistfully apologetically almost then in the kings name monsieur de lesperon i call upon you to yield said he  i have been expecting you my sword is yonder monsieur i replied suavely if you will allow me to dress i shall be ready to accompany you in a few minutes  he bowed and it at once became clear that his business at lavedan wasas i had suggested to the vicomtesse might be possiblewith me alone  i am grateful for the readiness of your submission said this very polite gentleman he was a comely lad with blue eyes and a goodhumoured mouth to which a pair of bristling moustaches sought vainly to impart an expression of ferocity  before you proceed to dress monsieur i have another duty to discharge  discharge your duty monsieur i answered whereupon he made a sign to his men and in a moment they were ransacking my garments and effects while this was taking place he turned to the vicomte and vicomtesse and offered them a thousand apologies for having interrupted their slumbers and for so rudely depriving them of their guest he advanced in his excuse the troublous nature of the times and threw in a bunch of malisons at the circumstances which forced upon soldiers the odious duties of the tipstaff hoping that we would think him none the less a gentleman for the unsavoury business upon which he was engaged  from my clothes they took the letters addressed to lesperon which that poor gentleman had entrusted to me on the night of his death and among these there was one from the duc dorleans himself which would alone have sufficed to have hanged a regiment besides these they took monsieur de marsacs letter of two days ago and the locket containing the picture of mademoiselle de marsac  the papers and the portrait they delivered to the captain who took them with the same air of deprecation tainted with disgust that coloured all his actions in connection with my arrest  to this same repugnance for his catchpoll work do i owe it that at the moment of setting out he offered to let me ride without the annoyance of an escort if i would pass him my parole not to attempt an escape  we were standing then in the hall of the chateau his men were already in the courtyard and there were only present monsieur le vicomte and anatolethe latter reflecting the look of sorrow that haunted his masters face the captains generosity was certainly leading him beyond the bounds of his authority and it touched me  monsieur is very generous said i  he shrugged his shoulders impatiently  cap de dieu he criedhe had a way of swearing that reminded me of my friend cazalet it is no generosity monsieur it is a desire to make this obscene work more congenial to the spirit of a gentleman which devil take me i cannot stifle not for the king himself and then monsieur de lesperon are we not fellowcountrymen are we not gascons both pardieu there is no more respected a name in the whole of gascony than that of lesperon and that you belong to so honourable a family is alone more than sufficient to warrant such slight favours as it may be in my power to show you  you have my parole that i will attempt no escape monsieur le capitaine i answered bowing may acknowledgment of his compliments  i am mironsac de castelroux of chateau rouge in gascony he informed me returning my bow my faith had he not made a pretty soldier he would have made an admirable master of deportment  my leavetaking of monsieur de lavedan was brief but cordial apologetic on my part intensely sympathetic on his and so i went out alone with castelroux upon the road to toulouse his men being ordered to follow in half an hours time and to travel at their leisure  as we cantered alongcastelroux and iwe talked of many things and i found him an amusing and agreeable companion had my mood been other than despairing the news he gave me might have occasioned me some concern for it seemed that prisoners arraigned for treason and participation in the late rising were being very summarily treated many were never so much as heard in their own defence the evidence collected of their defection being submitted to the tribunal and judgment being forthwith passed upon them by judges who had no ears for anything they might advance in their own favour  the evidence of my identity was complete there was my own admission to castelroux the evidence of the treason of lesperon was none the less complete in fact it was notorious and there was the dukes letter found amongst my effects if the judges refused to lend an ear to my assurances that i was not lesperon at all but the missing bardelys my troubles were likely to receive a very summary solution the fear of it however weighed not overheavily upon me i was supremely indifferent life was at an end so far as i was concerned i had ruined the one chance of real happiness that had ever been held out to me and if the gentlemen of the courts of toulouse were pleased to send me unheeded to the scaffold what should it signify  but there was another matter that did interest me and that was my interview with marsac touching this i spoke to my captor  there is a gentleman i wish to see at grenade this morning you have amongst the papers taken from me a letter making this assignation monsieur le capitaine and i should be indeed grateful if you would determine that we shall break our fast there so that i may have an opportunity of seeing him the matter is to me of the highest importance  it concerns he asked  a lady i answered  ah yes but the letter is of the nature of a challenge is it not naturally i cannot permit you to endanger your life  lest we disappoint the headsman at toulouse i laughed have no fear there shall be no duel  then i am content monsieur and you shall see your friend  i thanked him and we talked of other things thereafter as we rode in the early morning along the toulouse road our conversation found its way i scarce know how to the topic of paris and the court and when i casually mentioned in passing that i was well acquainted with the luxembourg he inquired whether i had ever chanced to meet a young spark of the name of mironsac  mironsac i echoed why yes and i was on the point of adding that i knew the youth intimately and what a kindness i had for him when deeming it imprudent i contented myself with asking you know him  pardieu he swore the fellow is my cousin we are both mironsacs he is mironsac of castelvert whilst i as you may remember i told you am mironsac of castelroux to distinguish us he is always known as mironsac and i as castelroux peste it is not the only distinction for while he basks in the sunshine of the great world of paristhey are wealthy the mironsacs of castelverti a poor devil of a gascony cadet am playing the catchpoll in languedoc  i looked at him with fresh interest for the mention of that dear lad mironsac brought back to my mind the night in paris on which my illstarred wager had been laid and i was reminded of how that highminded youth had soughtwhen it was too late to reason me out of the undertaking by alluding to the dishonour with which in his honest eyes it must be fraught  we spoke of his cousincastelroux and iand i went so far now as to confess that i had some love for the youth whom i praised in unmistakable terms this inclined to increase the friendliness which my young captain had manifested since my arrest and i was presently emboldened by it to beg of him to add to the many favours that i already owed him by returning to me the portrait which his men had subtracted from my pocket it was my wish to return this to marsac whilst at the same time it would afford corroboration of my story  to this castelroux made no difficulty  why yes said he and he produced it i crave your pardon for not having done the thing of my own accord what can the keeper of the seals want with that picture  i thanked him and pocketed the locket  poor lady he sighed a note of compassion in his voice by my soul monsieur de lesperon fine work this for soldiers is it not diable it is enough to turn a gentlemans stomach sour for life and make him go hide himself from the eyes of honest men had i known that soldiering meant such business i had thought twice before i adopted it as a career for a man of honour i had remained in gascony and tilled the earth sooner than have lent myself to this  my good young friend i laughed what you do you do in the kings name  so does every tipstaff he answered impatiently his moustaches bristling as the result of the scornful twist he gave his lips to think that i should have a hand in bringing tears to the eyes of that sweet lady quelle besogne bon dieu quelle besogne  i laughed at the distress vented in that whimsical gascon tongue of his whereupon he eyed me in a wonder that was tempered with admiration for to his brave soul a gentleman so stoical as to laugh under such parlous circumstances was very properly a gentleman to be admired     chapter x the risen dead   it was close upon ten oclock as we rode into the yard of the imposing hotel de la couronne at grenade  castelroux engaged a private room on the first floora handsome chamber overlooking the courtyardand in answer to the inquiries that i made i was informed by the landlord that monsieur de marsac was not yet arrived  my assignation was before noon monsieur de castelroux said i with your permission i would wait until noon  he made no difficulty two hours were of no account we had all risen very early and he was himself he said entitled to some rest  whilst i stood by the window it came to pass than a very tall indifferently apparelled gentleman issued from the hostelry and halted for some moments in conversation with the ostler below he walked with an enfeebled step and leaned heavily for support upon a stout cane as he turned to reenter the inn i had a glimpse of a face woefully pale about which as about the mans whole figure there was a something that was familiara something that puzzled me and on which my mind was still dwelling when presently i sat down to breakfast with castelroux  it may have been a halfhour later and our meal being at an end we were sitting talkingi growing impatient the while that this monsieur de marsac should keep me waiting sowhen of a sudden the rattle of hoofs drew me once more to the window a gentleman riding very recklessly had just dashed through the portecochere and was in the act of pulling up his horse he was a lean active man very richly dressed and with a face that by its swarthiness of skin and the sable hue of beard and hair looked almost black  ah you are there he cried with something between a snarl and a laugh and addressing somebody within the shelter of the porch par la mort dieu i had hardly looked to find you  from the recess of the doorway i heard a gasp of amazement and a cry of marsac you here  so this was the gentleman i was to see a stable boy had taken his reins and he leapt nimbly to the ground into my range of vision hobbled now the enfeebled gentleman whom earlier i had noticed  my dear stanislas he cried i cannot tell you how rejoiced i am to see you and he approached marsac with arms that were opened as if to embrace him  the newcomer surveyed him a moment in wonder with eyes grown dull then abruptly raising his hand he struck the fellow on the breast and thrust him back so violently that but for the stableboys intervention he had of a certainty fallen with a look of startled amazement on his haggard face the invalid regarded his assailant  as for marsac he stepped close up to him  what is this he cried harshly what is this makebelieve feebleness that you are pale poltroon i do not wonder but why these tottering limbs why this assumption of weakness do you look to trick me by these signs  have you taken leave of your senses exclaimed the other a note of responsive anger sounding in his voice have you gone mad stanislas  abandon this pretence was the contemptuous answer two days ago at lavedan my friend they informed me how complete was your recovery from what they told us it was easy to guess why you tarried there and left us without news of you that was my reason as you may have surmised for writing to you my sister has mourned you for deadwas mourning you for dead whilst you sat at the feet of your roxalanne and made love to her among the roses of lavedan  lavedan echoed the other slowly then raising his voice what the devil are you saying he blazed what do i know of lavedan  in a flash it had come to me who that enfeebled gentleman was rodenard the blunderer had been at fault when he had said that lesperon had expired clearly he could have no more than swooned for here in the flesh was lesperon himself the man i had left for dead in that barn by mirepoix  how or where he had recovered were things that at the moment did not exercise my mindnor have i since been at any pains to unravel the mystery of it but there he was and for the moment that fact was allsufficing what complications would come of his presence heaven alone could foretell  put an end to this playacting roared the savage marsac it will avail you nothing my sisters tears may have weighed lightly with you but you shall pay the price of them and of the slight you have put upon her  my god marsac cried the other roused to an equal fierceness will you explain  aye snarled marsac and his sword flashed from his scabbard ill explain as god lives ill explainwith this and he whirled his blade under the eyes of the invalid come my master the comedys played out cast aside that crutch and draw draw man or sangdieu ill run you through as you stand  there was a commotion below the landlord and a posse of his satelliteswaiters ostlers and stableboysrushed between them and sought to restrain the bloodthirsty marsac but he shook them off as a bull shakes off a pack of dogs and like an angry bull too did he stand his ground and bellow in a moment his sweeping sword had cleared a circle about him in its lightning dartings hither and thither at random it had stung a waiter in the calf and when the fellow saw the blood staining his hose he added to the general din his shrieks that he was murdered marsac swore and threatened in a breath and a kitchen wench from a point of vantage on the steps called shame upon him and abused him roundly for a cowardly assassin to assail a poor sufferer who could hardly stand upright  po cap de dieu swore castelroux at my elbow saw you ever such an ado what has chanced  but i never stayed to answer him unless i acted quickly blood would assuredly be shed i was the one man who could explain matters and it was a mercy for lesperon that i should have been at hand in the hour of his meeting that fireeater marsac i forgot the circumstances in which i stood to castelroux i forgot everything but the imminent necessity that i should intervene some seven feet below our window was the roof of the porch from that to the ground it might be some eight feet more before my gascon captain knew what i was about i had swung myself down from the window on to the projecting porch a second later i created a diversion by landing in the midst of the courtyard fray with the alarmed castelrouxwho imagined that i was escapingfollowing by the same unusual road and shouting as he came monsieur de lesperon hi monsieur de lesperon mordieu remember your parole monsieur de lesperon  nothing could have been better calculated to stem marsacs fury nothing could have so predisposed him to lend an ear to what i had to say for it was very evident that castelrouxs words were addressed to me and that it was i whom he called by the name of lesperon in an instant i was at marsacs side but before i could utter a word what the devil does this mean he asked eyeing me with fierce suspicion  it means monsieur that there are more lesperons than one in france i am the lesperon who was at lavedan if you doubt me ask this gentleman who arrested me there last night ask him too why we have halted here ask him if you will to show you the letter that you left at lavedan making an assignation here before noon today which letter i received  the suspicion faded from marsacs eyes and they grew round with wonder as he listened to this prodigious array of evidence lesperon looked on in no less amazement yet i am sure from the manner of his glance that he did not recognize in me the man that had succoured him at mirepoix that after all was natural enough for the minds of men in such reduced conditions as had been his upon that night are not prone to receive very clear impressions and still less prone to retain such impressions as they do receive  before marsac could answer me castelroux was at my side  a thousand apologies he laughed a fool might have guessed the errand that took you so quickly through that window and none but a fool would have suspected you of seeking to escape it was unworthy in me monsieur de lesperon  i turned to him while those others still stood gaping and led him aside  monsieur le capitaine said i you find it troublesome enough to reconcile your conscience with such arrests as you are charged to make is it not so  mordieu he cried by way of emphatically assenting  now if you should chance to overhear words betraying to you certain people whom otherwise you would never suspect of being rebels your soldiers duty would nevertheless compel you to apprehend them would it not  why true i am afraid it would he answered with a grimace  but if forewarned that by being present in a certain place you should overhear such words what course would you pursue  avoid it like a pestilence monsieur he answered promptly  then monsieur le capitaine may i trespass upon your generosity to beseech you to let me take these litigants to our room upstairs and to leave us alone there for a halfhour  frankness was my best friend in dealing with castelrouxfrankness and his distaste for the business they had charged him with as for marsac and lesperon they were both eager enough to have the mystery explained and when castelroux having consentedi invited them to my chamber they came readily enough  since monsieur de lesperon did not recognize me there was no reason why i should enlighten him touching my identity and every reason why i should not as soon as they were seated i went to the heart of the matter at once and without preamble  a fortnight ago gentlemen said i i was driven by a pack of dragoons across the garonne i was wounded in the shoulder and very exhausted and i knocked at the gates of lavedan to crave shelter that shelter gentlemen was afforded me and when i had announced myself as monsieur de lesperon it was all the more cordially because one monsieur de marsac who was a friend of the vicomte de lavedan and a partisan in the lost cause of orleans happened often to have spoken of a certain monsieur de lesperon as his very dear friend i have no doubt gentlemen that you will think harshly of me because i did not enlighten the vicomte but there were reasons for which i trust you will not press me since i shall find it difficult to answer you with truth  but is your name lesperon cried lesperon  that monsieur is a small matter whether my name is lesperon or not i confess to having practised a duplicity upon the vicomte and his family since i am certainly not the lesperon whose identity i accepted but if i accepted that identity monsieur i also accepted your liabilities and so i think that you should find it in your heart to extend me some measure of forgiveness as rene de lesperon of lesperon in gascony i was arrested last night at lavedan and as you may observe i am being taken to toulouse to stand the charge of high treason i have not demurred i have not denied in the hour of trouble the identity that served me in my hour of need i am taking the bitter with the sweet and i assure you gentlemen that the bitter predominates in a very marked degree  but this must not be cried lesperon rising i know not what use you may have made of my name but i have no reason to think that you can have brought discredit upon it and so  i thank you monsieur but  and so i cannot submit that you shall go to toulouse in my stead where is this officer whose prisoner you are pray summon him monsieur and let us set the matter right  this is very generous i answered calmly but i have crimes enough upon my head and so if the worst should befall me i am simply atoning in one person for the errors of two  but that is no concern of mine he cried  it is so much your concern that if you commit so egregious a blunder as to denounce yourself you will have ruined yourself without materially benefitting me  he still objected but in this strain i argued for some time and to such good purpose that in the end i made him realize that by betraying himself he would not save me but only join me on the journey to the scaffold  besides gentlemen i pursued my case is far from hopeless i have every confidence that as matters stand by putting forth my hand at the right moment by announcing my identity at the proper season i can if i am so inclined save my neck from the headsman  if you are so inclined they both cried their looks charged with inquiry  let that be i answered it does not at present concern us what i desire you to understand monsieur de lesperon is that if i go to toulouse alone when the time comes to proclaim myself and it is found that i am not rene de lesperon of lesperon in gascony they will assume that you are dead and there will be no count against me  but if you come with me and thereby afford proof that you are alive my impersonation of you may cause me trouble they may opine that i have been an abettor of treason that i have attempted to circumvent the ends of justice and that i may have impersonated you in order to render possible your escape for that you may rest assured they will punish me  you will see therefore that my own safety rests on your passing quietly out of france and leaving the belief behind you that you are deada belief that will quickly spread once i shall have cast off your identity you apprehend me  vaguely monsieur and perhaps you are right what do you say stanislas  say cried the fiery marsac i am weighed down with shame my poor rene for having so misjudged you  more he would have said in the same strain but lesperon cut him short and bade him attend to the issue now before him they discussed it at some length but always under the cloud in which my mysteriousness enveloped it and in the end encouraged by my renewed assurances that i could best save myself if lesperon were not taken with me the gascon consented to my proposals  marsac was on his way to spain his sister he told us awaited him at carcassonne lesperon should set out with him at once and in fortyeight hours they would be beyond the reach of the kings anger  i have a favour to ask of you monsieur de marsac said i rising for our business was at an end it is that if you should have an opportunity of communicating with mademoiselle de lavedan you will let her know that i am notnot the lesperon that is betrothed to your sister  i will inform her of it monsieur he answered readily and then of a sudden a look of understanding and of infinite pity came into his eyes my god he cried  what is it monsieur i asked staggered by that sudden outcry  do not ask me monsieur do not ask me i had forgotten for the moment in the excitement of all these revelations but he stopped short  well monsieur  he seemed to ponder a moment then looking at me again with that same compassionate glance you had better know said he and yetit is a difficult thing to tell you i understand now much that i had not dreamt of youyou have no suspicion of how you came to be arrested  for my alleged participation in the late rebellion  yes yes but who gave the information of your whereabouts who told the keeper of the seals where you were to be found  oh that i answered easily why i never doubted it it was the coxcomb sainteustache i whipped him  i stopped short there was something in marsacs black face something in his glance that forced the unspoken truth upon my mind  mother in heaven i cried do you mean that it was mademoiselle de lavedan  he bowed his head in silence did she hate me then so much as that would nothing less than my death appease her and had i utterly crushed the love that for a little while she had borne me that she could bring herself to hand me over to the headsman  god what a stab was that it turned me sick with griefaye and with some rage not against her oh not against her against the fates that had brought such things to pass  i controlled myself while their eyes were yet upon me i went to the door and held it open for them and they perceiving something of my disorder were courteous enough to omit the protracted leavetakings that under other auspices there might have been marsac paused a moment on the threshold as if he would have offered me some word of comfort then perceiving perhaps how banal must be all comfort that was of words alone and how it might but increase the anger of the wound it was meant to balm he sighed a simple adieu monsieur and went his way  when they were gone i returned to the table and sitting down i buried my head in my arms and there i lay a prey to the most poignant grief that in all my easy fortunate life i had ever known that she should have done this thing that the woman i loved the pure sweet innocent girl that i had wooed so ardently in my unworthiness at lavedan should have stooped to such an act of betrayal to what had i not reduced her since such things could be  then out of my despair grew comfort slowly at first and more vigorously anon the sudden shock of the news had robbed me of some of my wit and had warped my reasoning later as the pain of the blow grew duller i came to reflect that what she had done was but a proofan overwhelming proofof how deeply she had cared such hatred as this can be but born of a great love reaction is ever to be measured by the action that occasions it and a great revulsion can only come of a great affection had she been indifferent to me or had she but entertained for me a passing liking she would not have suffered so  and so i came to realize how cruel must have been the pang that had driven her to this but she had loved me aye and she loved me still for all that she thought she hated and for all that she had acted as if she hated but even if i were wrongeven if she did hate mewhat a fresh revulsion would not be hers when anon she learnt thatwhatever my sinsi had not played lightly with her love that i was not as she had imagined the betrothed of another woman  the thought fired me like wine i was no longer listlessno longer indifferent as to whether i lived or died i must live i must enlighten the keeper of the seals and the judges at toulouse concerning my identity why indeed had i ever wavered bardelys the magnificent must come to life again and thenwhat then  as suddenly as i had been exalted was i cast down there was a rumour abroad that bardelys was dead in the wake of that rumour i shrewdly guessed that the report of the wager that had brought him into languedoc would not be slow to follow what then would she love me any the better would she hate me any the less if now she was wounded by the belief that i had made sport of her love would not that same belief be with her again when she came to know the truth  aye the tangle was a grievous one yet i took heart my old resolve returned to me and i saw the need for urgencyin that alone could lie now my redemption in her eyes my wager must be paid before i again repaired to her for all that it should leave me poor indeed in the mean while i prayed god that she might not hear of it ere i returned to tell her     chapter xi the kings commissioner   for that most amiable of gascon cadets monsieur de castelroux i have naught but the highest praise in his every dealing with me he revealed himself so very gallant generous and highminded a gentleman that it was little short of a pleasure to be his prisoner he made no inquiries touching the nature of my interview with those two gentlemen at the hotel de la couronne and when at the moment of leaving i requested him to deliver a packet to the taller of those same two he did so without comment or question that packet contained the portrait of mademoiselle de marsac but on the inner wrapper was a note requesting lesperon not to open it until he should be in spain  neither marsac nor lesperon did i see again before we resumed our journey to toulouse  at the moment of setting out a curious incident occurred castelrouxs company of dragoons had ridden into the courtyard as we were mounting they lined up under their lieutenants command to allow us to pass but as we reached the portecochere we were delayed for a moment by a travellingcarriage entering for relays and coming apparently from toulouse castelroux and i backed our horses until we were in the midst of the dragoons and so we stood while the vehicle passed in as it went by one of the leather curtains was drawn back and my heart was quickened by the sight of a pale girl face with eyes of blue and brown curls lying upon the slender neck her glance lighted on me swordless and in the midst of that company of troopers and i bowed low upon the withers of my horse doffing my hat in distant salutation  the curtain dropped again and eclipsed the face of the woman that had betrayed me with my mind full of wild surmisings as to what emotions might have awakened in her upon beholding me i rode away in silence at monsieur de castelrouxs side had she experienced any remorse any shame whether or not such feelings had been aroused at sight of me it certainly would not be long ere she experienced them for at the hotel de la couronne were those who would enlighten her  the contemplation of the remorseful grief that might anon beset her when she came to ponder the truth of matters and with that truth those things that at lavedan i had uttered filled me presently with regret and pity i grew impatient to reach toulouse and tell the judges of the mistake that there had been my name could not be unknown to them and the very mention of it i thought should suffice to give them pause and lead them to make inquiries before sending me to the scaffold yet i was not without uneasiness for the summariness with which castelroux had informed me they were in the habit of dealing with those accused of high treason occasioned me some apprehensive pangs  this apprehension led me to converse with my captor touching those trials seeking to gather from him who were the judges i learnt then that besides the ordinary tribunal a commissioner had been dispatched by his majesty and was hourly expected to arrive at toulouse it would be his mission to supervise and direct the inquiries that were taking place it was said he added that the king himself was on his way thither to be present at the trial of monsieur le duc de montmorency but he was travelling by easy stages and was not yet expected for some days my heart which had leapt at the news as suddenly sank again with the consideration that i should probably be disposed of before the kings arrival it would behoove me therefore to look elsewhere for help and for some one to swear to my identity  do you know the name of this kings commissioner i asked  it is a certain comte de chatellerault a gentleman man said to stand very high in his majestys favour  chatellerault i cried in wondering joy  you know him  most excellently i laughed we are very intimately acquainted  why then monsieur i augur you this gentlemans friendship and that it may pilot you through your trouble although being mercifully minded he stopped short  but i laughed easily indeed my dear captain i think it will said i although friendship in this world is a thing of which the unfortunate know little  but i rejoiced too soon as you shall hear  we rode diligently on our way lying along the fertile banks of the garonne now yellow with the rustling corn towards evening we made our last halt at fenouillet whence a couple of hours riding should bring us to toulouse  at the posthouse we overtook a carriage that seemingly had halted for relays but upon which i scarce bestowed a glance as i alighted  whilst castelroux went to arrange for fresh horses i strode into the common room and there for some moments i stood discussing the viands with our host when at last i had resolved that a cold pasty and a bottle of armagnac would satisfy our wants i looked about me to take survey of those in the room one group in a remote corner suddenly riveted my attention to such a degree that i remained deaf to the voice of castelroux who had just entered and who stood now beside me in the centre of this group was the comte de chatellerault himself a thickset sombre figure dressed with that funereal magnificence he affected  but it was not the sight of him that filled me with amazement for that castelrouxs information had prepared me and i well understood in what capacity he was there my surprise sprang rather from the fact that amongst the halfdozen gentlemen about himand evidently in attendancei beheld the chevalier de sainteustache now knowing as i did the chevaliers treasonable leanings there was ample cause for my astonishment at finding him in such company apparently too he was on very intimate terms with the count for in raising my glance i had caught him in the act of leaning over to whisper familiarly in chatelleraults ear  their eyesindeed for that matter the eyes of the entire companywere turned in my direction  perhaps it was not a surprising thing that chatellerault should gaze upon me in that curious fashion for was it not probable that he had heard that i was dead besides the fact that i was without a sword and that at my side stood a kings officer afforded evidence enough of my condition and well might chatellerault stare at beholding me so manifestly a prisoner  even as i watched him he appeared to start at something that sainteustache was saying and a curious change spread over his face its whilom expression had been rather one of dismay for having believed me dead he no doubt accounted his wager won whereas seeing me alive had destroyed that pleasant conviction but now it took on a look of relief and of something that suggested malicious cunning  that said castelroux in my ear is the kings commissioner  did i not know it i never waited to answer him but striding across the room i held out my hand over the tableto chatellerault  my dear comte i cried you are most choicely met  i would have added more but there was something in his attitude that silenced me he had turned half from me and stood now hand on hip his great head thrown back and tilted towards his shoulder his expression one of freezing and disdainful wonder  now if his attitude filled me with astonishment and apprehension consider how these feelings were heightened by his words  monsieur de lesperon i can but express amazement at your effrontery if we have been acquainted in the past do you think that is a sufficient reason for me to take your hand now that you have placed yourself in a position which renders it impossible for his majestys loyal servants to know you  i fell back a pace my mind scarce grasping yet the depths of this inexplicable attitude  this to me chatellerault i gasped  to you he blazed stirred to a sudden passion what else did you expect monsieur de lesperon  i had it in me to give him the lie to denounce him then for a low swindling trickster i understood all at once the meaning of this wondrous makebelieve from sainteustache he had gathered the mistake there was and for his wagers sake he would let the error prevail and hurry me to the scaffold what else might i have expected from the man that had lured me into such a wagera wager which the knowledge he possessed had made him certain of winning would he who had cheated at the dealing of the cards neglect an opportunity to cheat again during the progress of the game  as i have said i had it in my mind to cry out that he liedthat i was not lesperon that he knew i was bardelys but the futility of such an outcry came to me simultaneously with the thought of it and i fear me i stood before him and his satellitesthe mocking sainteustache amongst thema very foolish figure  there is no more to be said i murmured at last  but there is he retorted there is much more to be said you shall render yet an account of your treason and i am afraid my poor rebel that your comely head will part company with your shapely body you and i will meet at toulouse what more is to be said will be said in the tribunal there  a chill encompassed me i was doomed it seemed this man ruling the province pending the kings arrival would see to it that none came forward to recognize me he would expedite the comedy of my trial and close it with the tragedy of my execution my professions of a mistake of identityif i wasted breath upon them would be treated with disdain and disregarded utterly god what a position had i got myself into and what a vein of comedy ran through itgrim tragic comedy if you will yet comedy to all faith the very woman whom i had wagered to wed had betrayed me into the hands of the very man with whom i laid my wager  but there was more in it than that as i had told mironsac that night in paris when the thing had been initiated it was a duel that was being fought betwixt chatellerault and mea duel for supremacy in the kings good graces we were rivals and he desired my removal from the court to this end had he lured me into a bargain that should result in my financial ruin thereby compelling me to withdraw from the costly life of the luxembourg and leaving him supreme the sole and uncontested recipient of our masters favour now into his hand fate had thrust a stouter weapon and a deadlier a weapon which not only should make him master of the wealth that i had pledged but one whereby he might remove me for all time a thousandfold more effectively than the mere encompassing of my ruin would have done  i was doomed i realized it fully and very bitterly  i was to go out of the ways of men unnoticed and unmourned as a rebel under the obscure name of another and bearing anothers sins upon my shoulders i was to pass almost unheeded to the gallows bardelys the magnificentthe marquis marcel saintpol de bardelys whose splendour had been a byword in francewas to go out like a guttering candle  the thought filled me with the awful frenzy that so often goes with impotency such a frenzy as the damned in hell may know i forgot in that hour my precept that under no conditions should a gentleman give way to anger in a blind access of fury i flung myself across the table and caught that villainous cheat by the throat before any there could put out a hand to stop me  he was a heavy man if a short one and the strength of his thickset frame was a thing abnormal yet at that moment such nervous power did i gather from my rage that i swung him from his feet as though he had been the puniest weakling i dragged him down on to the table and there i ground his face with a most excellent goodwill and relish  you liar you cheat you thief i snarled like any crossgrained mongrel the king shall hear of this you knave by god he shall  they dragged me from him at lastthose lapdogs that attended himand with much rough handling they sent me sprawling among the sawdust on the floor it is more than likely that but for castelrouxs intervention they had made short work of me there and then  but with a bunch of mordieus sangdieus and po cap de dieus the little gascon flung himself before my prostrate figure and bade them in the kings name and at their peril to stand back  chatellerault sorely shaken his face purple and with blood streaming from his nostrils had sunk into a chair he rose now and his first words were incoherent raging gasps  what is your name sir he bellowed at last addressing the captain  amedee de mironsac de castelroux of chateau rouge in gascony answered my captor with a grand manner and a flourish and added your servant  what authority have you to allow your prisoners this degree of freedom  i do not need authority monsieur replied the gascon  do you not blazed the count we shall see wait until i am in toulouse my malapert friend  castelroux drew himself up straight as a rapier his face slightly flushed and his glance angry yet he had the presence of mind to restrain himself partly at least  i have my orders from the keeper of the seals to effect the apprehension of monsieur de lesperon and to deliver him up alive or dead at toulouse so that i do this the manner of it is my own affair and who presumes to criticize my methods censoriously impugns my honour and affronts me and who affronts me monsieur be he whosoever he may be renders me satisfaction i beg that you will bear that circumstance in mind  his moustaches bristled as he spoke and altogether his air was very fierce and truculent for a moment i trembled for him but the count evidently thought better of it than to provoke a quarrel particularly one in which he would be manifestly in the wrong kings commissioner though he might be there was an exchange of questionable compliments betwixt the officer and the count whereafter to avoid further unpleasantness castelroux conducted me to a private room where we took our meal in gloomy silence  it was not until an hour later when we were again in the saddle and upon the last stage of our journey that i offered castelroux an explanation of my seemingly mad attack upon chatellerault  you have done a very rash and unwise thing monsieur he had commented regretfully and it was in answer to this that i poured out the whole story i had determined upon this course while we were supping for castelroux was now my only hope and as we rode beneath the stars of that september night i made known to him my true identity  i told him that chatellerault knew me and i informed him that a wager lay between uswithholding the particulars of its naturewhich had brought me into languedoc and into the position wherein he had found and arrested me at first he hesitated to believe me but when at last i had convinced him by the vehemence of my assurances as much as by the assurances themselves he expressed such opinions of the comte de chatellerault as made my heart go out to him  you see my dear castelroux that you are now my last hope i said  a forlorn one my poor gentleman he groaned  nay that need not be my intendant rodenard and some twenty of my servants should be somewhere betwixt this and paris let them be sought for monsieur and let us pray god that they be still in languedoc and may be found in time  it shall be done monsieur i promise you he answered me solemnly but i implore you not to hope too much from it chatellerault has it in his power to act promptly and you may depend that he will waste no time after what has passed  still we may have two or three days and in those days you must do what you can my friend  you may depend upon me he promised  and meanwhile castelroux said i you will say no word of this to any one  that assurance also he gave me and presently the lights of our destination gleamed out to greet us  that night i lay in a dank and gloomy cell of the prison of toulouse with never a hope to bear company during those dark wakeful hours  a dull rage was in my soul as i thought of my position for it had not needed castelrouxs recommendation to restrain me from building false hopes upon his chances of finding rodenard and my followers in time to save me some little ray of consolation i culled perhaps from my thoughts of roxalanne out of the gloom of my cell my fancy fashioned her sweet girl face and stamped it with a look of gentle pity of infinite sorrow for me and for the hand she had had in bringing me to this  that she loved me i was assured and i swore that if i lived i would win her yet in spite of every obstacle that i myself had raised for my undoing     chapter xii the tribunal of toulouse   i had hoped to lie some days in prison before being brought to trial and that during those days castelroux might have succeeded in discovering those who could witness to my identity conceive therefore something of my dismay when on the morrow i was summoned an hour before noon to go present myself to my judges  from the prison to the palace i was taken in chains like any thieffor the law demanded this indignity to be borne by one charged with the crimes they imputed to me the distance was but short yet i found it overlong which is not wonderful considering that the people stopped to line up as i went by and to cast upon me a shower of opprobrious derisionfor toulouse was a very faithful and loyal city it was within some two hundred yards of the palace steps that i suddenly beheld a face in the crowd at the sight of which i stood still in my amazement this earned me a stab in the back from the buttend of the pike of one of my guards  what ails you now quoth the man irritably forward monsieur le traite  i moved on scarce remarking the fellows roughness my eyes were still upon that facethe white piteous face of roxalanne i smiled reassurance and encouragement but even as i smiled the horror in her countenance seemed to increase then as i passed on she vanished from my sight and i was left to conjecture the motives that had occasioned her return to toulouse had the message that marsac would yesterday have conveyed to her caused her to retrace her steps that she might be near me in my extremity or had some weightier reason influenced her return did she hope to undo some of the evil she had done alas poor child if such were her hopes i sorely feared me they would prove very idle  of my trial i should say but little did not the exigencies of my story render it necessary to say much even now across the gap of years my gorge rises at the mockery which in the kings name those gentlemen made of justice i can allow for the troubled conditions of the times and i can realize how in cases of civil disturbances and rebellion it may be expedient to deal summarily with traitors yet not all the allowances that i can think of would suffice to condone the methods of that tribunal  the trial was conducted in private by the keeper of the sealsa lean wizened individual with an air as musty and dry as that of the parchments among which he had spent his days he was supported by six judges and on his right sat the kings commissioner monsieur de chatelleraultthe bruised condition of whose countenance still advertised the fact that we had met but yesterday  upon being asked my name and place of abode i created some commotion by answering boldly i am the sieur marcel de saintpol marquis of bardelys of bardelys in picardy  the presidentthat is to say the keeper of the sealsturned inquiringly to chatellerault the count however did no more than smile and point to something written on a paper that lay spread upon the table the president nodded  monsieur rene de lesperon said he the court may perhaps not be able to discriminate whether this statement of yours is a deliberate attempt to misguide or frustrate the ends of justice or whether either in consequence of your wounds or as a visitation of god for your treason you are the victim of a deplorable hallucination but the court wishes you to understand that it is satisfied of your identity the papers found upon your person at the time of your arrest besides other evidence in our power remove all possibility of doubt in that connection therefore in your own interests we implore you to abandon these false statements if so be that you are master of your wits your only hope of saving your head must lie in your truthfully answering our questions and even then monsieur de lesperon the hope that we hold out to you is so slight as to be no hope at all  there was a pause during which the other judges nodded their heads in sage approval of their presidents words for myself i kept silent perceiving how little it could avail me to continue to protest and awaited his next question  you were arrested monsieur at the chateau de lavedan two nights ago by a company of dragoons under the command of captain de castelroux is that so  it is so monsieur  and at the time of your arrest upon being apprehended as rene de lesperon you offered no repudiation of the identity on the contrary when monsieur de castelroux called for monsieur de lesperon you stepped forward and acknowledged that you were he  pardon monsieur what i acknowledged was that i was known by that name  the president chuckled evilly and his satellites smiled in polite reflection of his mood  this acute differentiating is peculiar monsieur de lesperon to persons of unsound mental condition said he i am afraid that it will serve little purpose a man is generally known by his name is he not i did not answer him shall we call monsieur de castelroux to confirm what i have said  it is not necessary since you allow that i may have said i was known by the name but refuse to recognize the distinction between that and a statement that lesperon is my name it would serve no purpose to summon the captain  the president nodded and with that the point was dismissed and he proceeded as calmly as though there never had been any question of my identity  you are charged monsieur de lesperon with high treason in its most virulent and malignant form you are accused of having borne arms against his majesty have you anything to say  i have to say that it is false monsieur that his majesty has no more faithful or loving subject than am i  the president shrugged his shoulders and a shade of annoyance crossed his face  if you are come here for no other purpose than to deny the statements that i make i am afraid that we are but wasting time he cried testily if you desire it i can summon monsieur de castelroux to swear that at the time of your arrest and upon being charged with the crime you made no repudiation of that charge  naturally not monsieur i cried somewhat heated by this seemingly studied ignoring of important facts because i realized that it was monsieur de castelrouxs mission to arrest and not to judge me monsieur de castelroux was an officer not a tribunal and to have denied this or that to him would have been so much waste of breath  ah very nimble very nimble in truth monsieur de lesperon but scarcely convincing we will proceed you are charged with having taken part in several of the skirmishes against the armies of marshals de schomberg and la force and finally with having been in close attendance upon monsieur de montmorency at the battle of castelnaudary what have you to say  that it is utterly untrue  yet your name monsieur is on a list found among the papers in the captured baggage of monsieur le duc de montmorency  no monsieur i denied stoutly it is not  the president smote the table a blow that scattered a flight of papers  par la mort dieu he roared with a most indecent exhibition of temper in one so placed i have had enough of your contradictions you forget monsieur your position  at least i broke in harshly no less than you forget yours  the keeper of the seals gasped for breath at that and his fellow judges murmured angrily amongst themselves chatellerault maintained his sardonic smile but permitted himself to utter no word  i would gentlemen i cried addressing them all that his majesty were here to see how you conduct your trials and defile his courts as for you monsieur le president you violate the sanctity of your office in giving way to anger it is a thing unpardonable in a judge i have told you in plain terms gentlemen that i am not this rene de lesperon with whose crimes you charge me yet in spite of my denials ignoring them or setting them down either to a futile attempt at defence or to an hallucination of which you suppose me the victim you proceed to lay those crimes to my charge and when i deny your charges you speak of proofs that can only apply to another  how shall the name of lesperon having been found among the duke of montmorencys papers convict me of treason since i tell you that i am not lesperon had you the slightest the remotest sense of your high duty messieurs you would ask me rather to explain how if what i state be true i come to be confounded with lesperon and arrested in his place then messieurs you might seek to test the accuracy of what statements i may make but to proceed as you are proceeding is not to judge but to murder justice is represented as a virtuous woman with bandaged eyes holding impartial scales in your hands gentlemen by my soul she is become a very harlot clutching a veil  chatelleraults cynical smile grew broader as my speech proceeded and stirred up the rancour in the hearts of those august gentlemen the keeper of the seals went white and red by turns and when i paused there was an impressive silence that lasted for some moments at last the president leant over to confer in a whisper with chatellerault then in a voice forcedly calmlike the calm of nature when thunder is brewinghe asked me who do you insist that you are monsieur  once already have i told you and i venture to think that mine is a name not easily forgotten i am the sieur marcel de saintpol marquis of bardelys of bardelys in picardy  a cunning grin parted his thin lips  have you any witnesses to identify you  hundreds monsieur i answered eagerly seeing salvation already within my grasp  name some of them  i will name oneone whose word you will not dare to doubt  that is  his majesty the king i am told that he is on his way to toulouse and i but ask messieurs that you await his arrival before going further with my trial  is there no other witness of whom you can think monsieur some witness that might be produced more readily for if you can indeed establish the identity you claim why should you languish in prison for some weeks  his voice was soft and oily the anger had all departed out of it which ilike a foolimagined to be due to my mention of the king  my friends monsieur le garde des sceaux are all either in paris or in his majestys train and so not likely to be here before him there is my intendant rodenard and there are my servantssome twenty of themwho may perhaps be still in languedoc and for whom i would entreat you to seek them you might succeed in finding within a few days if they have not yet determined to return to paris in the belief that i am dead  he stroked his chin meditatively his eyes raised to the sunlit dome of glass overhead  ahh he gasped it was a longdrawn sigh of regret of conclusion or of weary impatience there is no one in toulouse who will swear to your identity monsieur he asked  i am afraid there is not i replied i know of no one  as i uttered those words the presidents countenance changed as abruptly as if he had flung off a mask from soft and catlike that he had been during the past few moments he grew of a sudden savage as a tiger he leapt to his feet his face crimson his eyes seeming to blaze and the words he spoke came now in a hot confused and almost incoherent torrent  miserable he roared out of your own mouth have you convicted yourself and to think that you should have stood there and wasted the time of this courthis majestys timewith your damnable falsehoods what purpose did you think to serve by delaying your doom did you imagine that haply whilst we sent to paris for your witnesses the king might grow weary of justice and in some fit of clemency announce a general pardon such things have been known and it may be that in your cunning you played for such a gain based upon such a hope but justice fool is not to be cozened had you indeed been bardelys you had seen that here in this court sits a gentleman who is very intimate with him he is there monsieur that is monsieur le comte de chatellerault of whom perhaps you may have heard yet when i ask you whether in toulouse there is any one who can bear witness to your identity you answer me that you know of no one i will waste no more time with you i promise you  he flung himself back into his chair like a man exhausted and mopped his brow with a great kerchief which he had drawn from his robes his fellow judges laid their heads together and with smiles and nods winks and leers they discussed and admired the miraculous subtlety and acumen of this solomon chatellerault sat calmly smiling in solemn mockery  for a spell i was too thunderstruck to speak aghast at this catastrophe like a fool indeed i had tumbled into the pit that had been dug for me by chatellerault for i never doubted that it was of his contriving at last my masters said i these conclusions may appear to you most plausible but believe me they are fallacious i am perfectly acquainted with monsieur de chatellerault and he with me and if he were to speak the truth and play the man and the gentleman for once he would tell you that i am indeed bardelys but monsieur le comte has ends of his own to serve in sending me to my doom it is in a sense through his agency that i am at present in this position and that i have been confounded with lesperon what then could it have availed me to have made appeal to him and yet monsieur le president he was born a gentleman and he may still retain some notion of honour ask him sirask him pointblank whether i am or not marcel de bardelys  the firmness of my tones created some impression upon those feeble minds indeed the president went so far as to turn an interrogative glance upon the count but chatellerault supremely master of the situation shrugged his shoulders and smiled a pitying longsuffering smile  must i really answer such a question monsieur le president he inquired in a voice and with a manner that clearly implied how low would be his estimate of the presidents intelligence if he were indeed constrained to do so  but no monsieur le comte replied the president with sudden haste and in scornful rejection of the idea there is no necessity that you should answer  but the question monsieur le president i thundered my hand outstretched towards chatellerault ask himif you have any sense of your dutyask him am i not marcel de bardelys  silence blazed the president back at me you shall not fool us any longer you nimblewitted liar  my head drooped this coward had indeed shattered my last hope  some day monsieur i said very quietly i promise you that your behaviour and these gratuitous insults shall cost you your position pray god they do not cost you also your head  my words they treated as one might treat the threats of a child that i should have had the temerity to utter them did but serve finally to decide my doom if indeed anything had been wanting  with many epithets of opprobrium such as are applied to malefactors of the lowest degree they passed sentence of death upon me and with drooping spirits giving myself up for lost and assured that i should be led to the block before many hours were sped i permitted them to reconduct me through the streets of toulouse to my prison  i could entertain you at length upon my sensations as i walked between my guards a man on the threshold of eternity with hundreds of men and women gaping at memen and women who would live for years to gape upon many another wretch in my position the sun shone with a brilliance that to such eyes as mine was a very mockery thus would it shine on through centuries and light many another unfortunate to the scaffold the very sky seemed pitiless in the intensity of its cobalt unfeeling i deemed the note that everywhere was struck by man and nature so discordant was it with my gloomy outlook if you would have food for reflection upon the evanescent quality of life upon the nothingness of man upon the empty heartless egoism implicit in human nature get yourselves sentenced to death and then look around you with such a force was all this borne in upon me and with such sufficiency that after the first pang was spent i went near to rejoicing that things were as they were and that i was to die haply before sunset it was become such a world as did not seem worth a mans while to live in a world of vainness of hollowness of meanness of nothing but illusions the knowledge that i was about to die that i was about to quit all this seemed to have torn some veil from my eyes and to have permitted me to recognize the worthless quality of what i left well may it be that such are but the thoughts of a mans dying moments whispered into his soul by a merciful god to predispose him for the wrench and agony of his passing  i had been a halfhour in my cell when the door was opened to admit castelroux whom i had not seen since the night before he came to condole with me in my extremity and yet to bid me not utterly lose hope  it is too late today to carry out the sentence said he and as tomorrow will be sunday you will have until the day after by then much may betide monsieur my agents are everywhere scouring the province for your servants and let us pray heaven that they may succeed in their search  it is a forlorn hope monsieur de castelroux i sighed and i will pin no faith to it lest i suffer a disappointment that will embitter my last moments and perhaps rob me of some of the fortitude i shall have need of  he answered me nevertheless with words of encouragement no effort was being spared and if rodenard and my men were still in languedoc then was every likelihood that they would be brought to toulouse in time then he added that that however was not the sole object of his visit a lady had obtained permission of the keeper of the seals to visit me and she was waiting to be admitted  a lady i exclaimed and the thought of roxalanne flitted through my mind mademoiselle de lavedan i inquired  he nodded yes said he then added she seems in sore affliction monsieur  i besought him to admit her forthwith and presently she came castelroux closed the door as he withdrew and we were left alone together as she put aside her cloak and disclosed to me the pallor of her face and the disfiguring red about her gentle eyes telling of tears and sleeplessness all my own trouble seemed to vanish in the contemplation of her affliction  we stood a moment confronting each other with no word spoken then dropping her glance and advancing a step in a faltering hesitating manner monsieur monsieur she murmured in a suffocating voice  in a bound i was beside her and i had gathered her in my arms her little brown head against my shoulder  roxalanne i whispered as soothingly as i mightroxalanne  but she struggled to be free of my embrace  let me go monsieur she pleaded a curious shrinking in her very voice do not touch me monsieur you do not knowyou do not know  for answer i enfolded her more tightly still  but i do know little one i whispered and i even understand  at that her struggles ceased upon the instant and she seemed to lie limp and helpless in my arms  you know monsieur she questioned meyou know that i betrayed you  yes i answered simply  and you can forgive me i am sending you to your death and you have no reproaches for me oh monsieur it will kill me  hush child i whispered what reproaches can i have for you i know the motives that impelled you  not altogether monsieur you cannot know them i loved you monsieur i do love you monsieur oh this is not a time to consider words if i am bold and unmaidenly ii  neither bold nor unmaidenly butoh the sweetest damsel in all france my roxalanne i broke in coming to her aid mine was a leprous sinful soul child when i came into languedoc i had no faith in any human good and i looked as little for an honest man or a virtuous woman as one looks for honey in a nettle i was soured and my life had hardly been such a life as it was meet to bring into contact with your own then among the roses at lavedan in your dear company roxalanne it seemed that some of the good some of the sweetness some of the purity about you were infused anew into my heart i became young again and i seemed oddly cleansed in that hour of my rejuvenation i loved you roxalanne  her face had been raised to mine as i spoke there came now a flutter of the eyelids a curious smile about the lips then her head drooped again and was laid against my breast a sigh escaped her and she began to weep softly  nay roxalanne do not fret come child it is not your way to be weak  i have betrayed you she moaned i am sending you to your death  i understand i understand i answered smoothing her brown hair  not quite monsieur i loved you so monsieur that you can have no thought of how i suffered that morning when mademoiselle de marsac came to lavedan  at first it was but the pain of thinking thatthat i was about to lose you that you were to go out of my life and that i should see you no moreyou whom i had enshrined so in my heart  i called myself a little fool that morning for having dreamed that you had come to care for me my vanity i thought had deluded me into imagining that your manner towards me had a tenderness that spoke of affection i was bitter with myself and i suffered oh so much then later when i was in the rose garden you came to me  you remember how you seized me and how by your manner you showed me that it was not vanity alone had misled me you had fooled me i thought even in that hour i imagined you were fooling me you made light of me and my sufferings were naught to you so that i might give you some amusement to pass the leisure and monotony of your sojourn with us  roxalannemy poor roxalanne i whispered  then my bitterness and sorrow all turned to anger against you you had broken my heart and i thought that you had done it wantonly for that i burned to punish you ah and not only that perhaps i think too that some jealousy drove me on you had wooed and slighted me yet you had made me love you and if you were not for me i swore you should be for no other and so while my madness endured i quitted lavedan and telling my father that i was going to auch to his sisters house i came to toulouse and betrayed you to the keeper of the seals  scarce was the thing done than i beheld the horror of it and i hated myself in my despair i abandoned all idea of pursuing the journey to auch but turned and made my way back in haste hoping that i might still come to warn you but at grenade i met you already in charge of the soldiers at grenade too i learnt the truththat you were not lesperon can you not guess something of my anguish then already loathing my act and beside myself for having betrayed you think into what despair i was plunged by monsieur de marsacs intimation  then i understood that for reasons of your own you had concealed your identity you were not perhaps betrothed indeed i remembered then how solemnly you had sworn that you were not and so i bethought me that your vows to me may have been sincere and such as a maid might honourably listen to  they were roxalanne they were i cried  but she continued that you had mademoiselle de marsacs portrait was something that i could not explain but then i hear that you had also lesperons papers upon you so that you may have become possessed of the one with the others and now monsieur  she ceased and there against my breast she lay weeping and weeping in her bitter passion of regret until it seemed to me she would never regain her selfcontrol  it has been all my fault roxalanne said i and if i am to pay the price they are exacting it will be none too high i embarked upon a dastardly business which brought me to languedoc under false colours i wish indeed that i had told you when first the impulse to tell you came upon me afterwards it grew impossible  tell me now she begged tell me who you are  sorely was i tempted to respond almost was i on the point of doing so when suddenly the thought of how she might shrink from me of how even then she might come to think that i had but simulated love for her for infamous purposes of gain restrained and silenced me during the few hours of life that might be left me i would at least be lord and master of her heart when i was deadfor i had little hope of castelrouxs effortsit would matter less and perhaps because i was dead she would be merciful  i cannot roxalanne not even now it is too vile ifif they carry out the sentence on monday i shall leave a letter for you telling you everything  she shuddered and a sob escaped her from my identity her mind fled back to the more important matter of my fate  they will not carry it out monsieur oh they till not say that you can defend yourself that you are not the man they believe you to be  we are in gods hands child it may be that i shall save myself yet if i do i shall come straight to you and you shall know all that there is to know but remember childand raising her face in my hands i looked down into the blue of her tearful eyesremember little one that in one thing i have been true and honourable and influenced by nothing but my heartin my wooing of you i love you roxalanne with all my soul and if i should die you are the only thing in all this world that i experience a regret at leaving  i do believe it i do indeed nothing can ever alter my belief again will you not then tell me who you are and what is this thing which you call dishonourable that brought you into languedoc  a moment again i pondered then i shook my head  wait child said i and she obedient to my wishes asked no more  it was the second time that i neglected a favourable opportunity of making that confession and as i had regretted having allowed the first occasion to pass unprofited so was i and still more poignantly to regret this second silence  a little while she stayed with me yet and i sought to instil some measure of comfort into her soul i spoke of the hopes that i based upon castelrouxs finding friends to recognize mehopes that were passing slender and she poor child sought also to cheer me and give me courage  if only the king were here she sighed i would go to him and on my knees i would plead for your enlargement but they say he is no nearer than lyons and i could not hope to get there and back by monday i will go to the keeper of the seals again monsieur and i will beg him to be merciful and at least to delay the sentence  i did not discourage her i did not speak of the futility of such a step but i begged her to remain in toulouse until monday that she might visit me again before the end if the end were to become inevitable  then castelroux came to reconduct her and we parted but she left me a great consolation a great strengthening comfort if i were destined indeed to walk to the scaffold it seemed that i could do it with a better grace and a gladder courage now     chapter xiii the eleventh hour   castelroux visited me upon the following morning but he brought no news that might be accounted encouraging none of his messengers were yet returned nor had any sent word that they were upon the trail of my followers my heart sank a little and such hope as i still fostered was fast perishing indeed so imminent did my doom appear and so unavoidable that later in the day i asked for pen and paper that i might make an attempt at setting my earthly affairs to rights yet when the writing materials were brought me i wrote not i sat instead with the feathered end of my quill between my teeth and thus pondered the matter of the disposal of my picardy estates  coldly i weighed the wording of the wager and the events that had transpired and i came at length to the conclusion that chatellerault could not be held to have the least claim upon my lands that he had cheated at the very outset as i have earlier shown was of less account than that he had been instrumental in violently hindering me  i took at last the resolve to indite a full memoir of the transaction and to request castelroux to see that it was delivered to the king himself thus not only would justice be done but i shouldthough tardilybe even with the count no doubt he relied upon his power to make a thorough search for such papers as i might leave and to destroy everything that might afford indication of my true identity but he had not counted upon the good feeling that had sprung up betwixt the little gascon captain and me nor yet upon my having contrived to convince the latter that i was indeed bardelys and he little dreamt of such a step as i was about to take to ensure his punishment hereafter  resolved at last i was commencing to write when my attention was arrested by an unusual sound it was at first no more than a murmuring noise as of at sea breaking upon its shore gradually it grew its volume and assumed the shape of human voices raised in lusty clamour then above the din of the populace a gun boomed out then another and another  i sprang up at that and wondering what might be toward i crossed to my barred window and stood there listening i overlooked the courtyard of the jail and i could see some commotion below in sympathy as it were with the greater commotion without  presently as the populace drew nearer it seemed to me that the shouting was of acclamation next i caught a blare of trumpets and lastly i was able to distinguish above the noise which had now grown to monstrous proportions the clattering hoofs of some cavalcade that was riding past the prison doors  it was borne in upon me that some great personage was arriving in toulouse and my first thought was of the king at the idea of such a possibility my brain whirled and i grew dizzy with hope the next moment i recalled that but last night roxalanne had told me that he was no nearer than lyons and so i put the thought from me and the hope with it for travelling in that leisurely indolent fashion that was characteristic of his every action it would be a miracle if his majesty should reach toulouse before the week was out and this but sunday  the populace passed on then seemed to halt and at last the shouts died down on the noontide air i went back to my writing and to wait until from my jailer when next he should chance to appear i might learn the meaning of that uproar  an hour perhaps went by and i had made some progress with my memoir when my door was opened and the cheery voice of castelroux greeted me from the threshold  monsieur i have brought a friend to see you  i turned in my chair and one glance at the gentle comely face and the fair hair of the young man standing beside castelroux was enough to bring me of a sudden to my feet  mironsac i shouted and sprang towards him with hands outstretched  but though my joy was great and my surprise profound greater still was the bewilderment that in mironsacs face i saw depicted  monsieur de bardelys he exclaimed and a hundred questions were contained in his astonished eyes  po cap de dieu growled his cousin i was well advised it seems to have brought you  but mironsac asked his cousin as he took my hands in his own why did you not tell me amedee that it was to monsieur le marquis de bardelys that you were conducting me  would you have had me spoil so pleasant a surprise his cousin demanded  armand said i never was a man more welcome than are you you are but come in time to save my life  and then in answer to his questions i told him briefly of all that had befallen me since that night in paris when the wager had been laid and of how through the cunning silence of chatellerault i was now upon the very threshold of the scaffold his wrath burst forth at that and what he said of the count did me good to hear at last i stemmed his invective  let that be for the present mironsac i laughed you are here and you can thwart all chatelleraults designs by witnessing to my identity before the keeper of the seals  and then of a sudden a doubt closed like a cold hand upon my brain i turned to castelroux  mon dieu i cried what if they were to deny me a fresh trial  deny it you he laughed they will not be asked to grant you one  there will be no need added mironsac i have but to tell the king  but my friend i exclaimed impatiently i am to die in the morning  and the king shall be told todaynow at once i will go to him  i stared askance a moment then the thought of the uproar that i had heard recurring to me has the king arrived already i exclaimed  naturally monsieur how else do i come to be here i am in his majestys train  at that i grew again impatient i thought of roxalanne and of how she must be suffering and i bethought me that every moment mironsac now remained in my cell was another moment of torture for that poor child so i urged him to be gone at once and carry news of my confinement to his majesty he obeyed me and i was left alone once more to pace up and down in my narrow cell a prey to an excitement such as i should have thought i had outlived  at the end of a halfhour castelroux returned alone  well i cried the moment the door opened and without giving him so much as time to enter what news  mironsac tells me that his majesty is more overwrought than he has ever seen him you are to come to the palace at once i have an order here from the king  we went in a coach and with all privacy for he informed me that his majesty desired the affair to be kept secret having ends of his own to serve thereby  i was left to wait some moments in an antechamber whilst castelroux announced me to the king then i was ushered into a small apartment furnished very sumptuously in crimson and gold and evidently set apart for his majestys studies or devotions as i entered louiss back was towards me he was standinga tall spare figure in blackleaning against the frame of a window his head supported on his raised left arm and his eyes intent upon the gardens below  he remained so until castelroux had withdrawn and the door had closed again then turning suddenly he confronted me his back to the light so that his face was in a shadow that heightened its gloom and wonted weariness  voila monsieur de bardelys was his greeting and unfriendly see the pass to which your disobedience of my commands has brought you  i would submit sire i answered that i have been brought to it by the incompetence of your majestys judges and the illwill of others whom your majesty honours with too great a confidence rather than by this same disobedience of mine  the one and the other perhaps he said more softly though after all they appear to have had a very keen nose for a traitor come bardelys confess yourself that  i a traitor  he shrugged his shoulders and laughed without any conspicuous mirth  is not a traitor one who runs counter to the wishes of his king and are you not therefore a traitor whether they call you lesperon or bardelys but there he ended more softly still and flinging himself into a chair as he spoke i have been so wearied since you left me marcel they have the best intentions in the world these dullards and some of them love me even but they are tiresome all even chatellerault when he has a fancy for a jestas in your case perpetrates it with the grace of a bear the sprightliness of an elephant  jest said i  you find it no jest marcel pardieu who shall blame you he would be a man of unhealthy humour that could relish such a pleasantry as that of being sentenced to death but tell me of it the whole story marcel i have not heard a story worth the listening to sincesince you left us  would it please you sire to send for the comte de chatellerault ere i begin i asked  chatellerault no no he shook his head whimsically chatellerault has had his laugh already and like the illmannered dog he is he has kept it to himself i think marcel that it is our turn now i have purposely sent chatellerault away that he may gain no notion of the catastrophic jest we are preparing him in return  the words set me in the very best of humours and to that it may be due that presently as i warmed to my narrative i lent it a vigour that drew his majesty out of his wonted apathy and listlessness he leaned forward when i told him of my encounter with the dragoons at mirepoix and how first i had committed the false step of representing myself to be lesperon  encouraged by his interest i proceeded and i told my story with as much piquancy as i was master of repressing only those slight matters which might reflect upon monsieur de lavedans loyalty but otherwise dealing frankly with his majesty even down to the genuineness of the feelings i entertained for roxalanne often he laughed more often still he nodded approvingly in understanding and sympathy whilst now and then he purred his applause but towards the end when i came to the matter of the tribunal of toulouse of how my trial was conducted and of the part played in it by chatellerault his face grew set and hard  it is trueall this that you tell me he cried harshly  as true as the gospels if you deem an oath necessary sire i swear by my honour that i have uttered nothing that is false and that in connection with monsieur de chatellerault even as i have suppressed nothing so also have i exaggerated nothing  the dastard he snapped but we will avenge you marcel never fear it  then the trend of his thoughts being changed he smiled wearily  by my faith you may thank god every night of your worthless life that i came so opportunely to toulouse and so may that fair child whose beauty you have limned with such a lovers ardour nay never redden marcel what at your age and with such a heavy score of affaires to your credit has it been left for a simple languedoc maiden to call a blush to your callous cheek ma foi they say truly that love is a great regenerator a great rejuvenator  i made him no answer other than a sigh for his words set me thinking and with thought came a tempering of the gay humour that had pervaded me remarking this and misreading it he laughed outright  there marcel never fear we will not be rigorous you have won both the maid and the wager and by the mass you shall enjoy both  helas sire i sighed again when the lady comes to know of the wager  waste no time in telling her marcel and cast yourself upon her mercy nay go not with so gloomy a face my friend when woman loves she can be very merciful leastways they tell me so  then his thoughts shifting ground once more he grew stern again  but first we have chatellerault to deal with what shall we do with him  it is for your majesty to decide  for me he cried his voice resuming the harshness that was never far from it i have a fancy for having gentlemen about me think you i will set eyes again upon that dastard i am already resolved concerning him but it entered my mind that it might please you to be the instrument of the law for me  me sire  aye and why not they say you can play a very deadly sword upon necessity this is an occasion that demands an exception from our edict you have my sanction to send the comte de chatellerault a challenge and see that you kill him bardelys he continued viciously for by the mass if you dont i will if he escapes your sword or if he survives such hurt as you may do him the headsman shall have him mordieu is it for nothing that i am called louis the just  i stood in thought for a moment then  if i do this thing sire i ventured the world will say of me that i did so to escape the payment i had incurred  fool you have not incurred it when a man cheats does he not forfeit all his rights  that is very true but the world  peste he snapped impatiently you are beginning to weary me marceland all the world does that so excellently that it needs not your collaboration go your ways man and do as you elect but take my sanction to slay this fellow chatellerault and i shall be the better pleased if you avail yourself of it he is lodged at the auberge royale where probably you will find him at present now go i have more justice to dispense in this rebellious province  i paused a moment  shall i not resume my duties near your majesty  he pondered a moment then he smiled in his weary way  it would please me to have you for these creatures are so dismally dull all of them je mennuie tellement marcel he sighed ough but no my friend i do not doubt you would be as dull as any of them at present a man in love is the weariest and most futile thing in all this weary futile world what shall i do with your body what time your soul is at lavedan i doubt me you are in haste to get you there so go marcel get you wed and live out your amorous intoxication marriage is the best antidote when that is done return to me  that will be never sire i answered slyly  say you so master cupid bardelys and he combed his beard reflectively be not too sure there have been other passionsaye as great as yoursyet have they staled but you waste my time go marcel you are excused your duties by me for as long as your own affairs shall hold you elsewherefor as long as you please we are here upon a gloomy businessas you know there are my cousin montmorency and the others to be dealt with and we are holding no levees countenancing no revels but come to me when you will and i will see you adieu  i murmured my thanks and very deep and sincere were they then having kissed his hand i left him  louis xiii is a man who lacks not maligners of how history may come to speak of him it is not mine to hazard but this i can say that i at least did never find him other than a just and kindly master an upright gentleman capricious at times and wilful as must inevitably be the case with such spoilt children of fortune as are princes but of lofty ideals and high principles it was his worst fault that he was always tired and through that everlasting weariness he came to entrust the determining of most affairs to his eminence hence has it resulted that the censure for many questionable acts of his reign which were the work of my lord cardinal has recoiled upon my august masters head  but to me with all the faults that may be assigned him he was ever louis the just and wherever his name be mentioned in my hearing i bare my head      chapter xiv eavesdropping   i turned it over in my mind after i had left the kings presence whether or not i should visit with my own hands upon chatellerault the punishment he had so fully earned that i would have gone about the task rejoicing you may readily imagine but there was that accursed wager andto restrain methe thought of how such an action might be construed into an evasion of its consequences better a thousand times that his majesty should order his arrest and deal with him for his attempted perversion of justice to the service of his own vile ends the charge of having abused his trust as kings commissioner to the extent of seeking to do murder through the channels of the tribunal was one that could not fail to have fatal results for himas indeed the king had sworn  that was the position of affairs as it concerned chatellerault the world and me but the position must also be considered as it concerned roxalanne and deeply indeed did i so consider it much pondering brought me again to the conclusion that until i had made the only atonement in my power the only atonement that would leave me with clean hands i must not again approach her  whether chatellerault had cheated or not could not affect the question as it concerned mademoiselle and me if i paid the wagerwhether in honour bound to do so or noti might then go to her impoverished it is true but at least with no suspicion attaching to my suit of any ulterior object other than that of winning roxalanne herself  i could then make confession and surely the fact that i had paid where clearly there was no longer any need to pay must earn me forgiveness and afford proof of the sincerity of my passion  upon such a course then did i decide and with this end in view i took my way towards the auberge royale where his majesty had told me that the count was lodged it was my purpose to show myself fully aware of the treacherous and unworthy part he had played at the very inception of the affair and that if i chose to consider the wager lost it was that i might the more honestly win the lady  upon inquiring at the hostelry for monsieur de chatellerault i was informed by the servant i addressed that he was within but that at the moment he had a visitor i replied that i would wait and demanded a private room since i desired to avoid meeting any court acquaintances who might chance into the auberge before i had seen the count  my apparel at the moment may not have been all that could have been desired but when a gentlemans rearing has taken place amid an army of servitors to minister to his every wish he is likely to have acquired an air that is wont to win him obedience with all celerity was i ushered into a small chamber opening on the one side upon the common room and being divided on the other by the thinnest of wooden partitions from the adjoining apartment  here the landlord having left me i disposed myself to wait and here i did a thing i would not have believed myself capable of doing a thing i cannot think of without blushing to this very day in short i played the eavesdropperi marcel saintpol de bardelys yet if you who read and are niceminded shudder at this confession or worse still shrug your shoulders in contempt with the reflection that such former conduct of mine as i have avowed had already partly disposed you against surprise at this i do but ask that you measure my sin by my temptation and think honestly whether in my position you might not yourselves have fallen ayebe you never so noble and highprincipledi make bold to say that you had done no less for the voice that penetrated to my ears was that of roxalanne de lavedan  i sought an audience with the king she was saying but i could not gain his presence they told me that he was holding no levees and that he refused to see any one not introduced by one of those having the private entree  and so answered the voice of chatellerault in tones that were perfectly colourless you come to me that i may present you to his majesty  you have guessed it monsieur le comte you are the only gentleman of his majestys suite with whom i can claim acquaintancehowever slightand moreover it is well known how high you stand in his royal favour i was told that they that have a boon to crave can find no better sponsor  had you gone to the king mademoiselle said he had you gained audience he would have directed you to make your appeal to me i am his commissioner in languedoc and the prisoners attainted with high treason are my property  why then monsieur she cried in an eager voice that set my pulses throbbing youll not deny me the boon i crave youll not deny me his life  there was a short laugh from chatellerault and i could hear the deliberate fall of his feet as he paced the chamber  mademoiselle mademoiselle you must not overrate my powers you must not forget that i am the slave of justice you may be asking more than is in my power to grant what can you advance to show that i should be justified in proceeding as you wish  helas monsieur i can advance nothing but my prayers and the assurance that a hideous mistake is being made  what is your interest in this monsieur de lesperon  he is not monsieur de lesperon she cried  but since you cannot tell me who he is you must be content that we speak of him at least as lesperon said he and i could imagine the evil grin with which he would accompany the words  the better that you may appreciate that which followed let me here impart to you the suspicions which were already sinking into my mind to be changed later into absolute convictions touching the course the count intended to pursue concerning me the sudden arrival of the king had thrown him into some measure of panic and no longer daring to carry out his plans concerning me it was his object i made no doubt to set me at liberty that very evening ere he did so however and presuming upon my ignorance of his majestys presence in toulouse chatellerault would of a certainty have bound me down by solemn promisemaking that promise the price of my liberty and my lifeto breathe no word of my captivity and trial no doubt his cunning brain would have advanced me plausible and convincing reasons so to engage myself  he had not calculated upon castelroux nor that the king should already have heard of my detention now that roxalanne came to entreat him to do that which already he saw himself forced to do he turned his attention to the profit that he might derive from her interestedness on my behalf i could guess also something of the jealous rage that must fill him at this signal proof of my success with her and already i anticipated i think the bargain that he would drive  tell me then he was repeating what is your interest in this gentleman  there was a silence i could imagine her gentle face clouded with the trouble that sprang from devising an answer to that question i could picture her innocent eyes cast down her delicate cheeks pinked by some measure of shame as at last in a low stifled voice the four words broke from her i love him monsieur  ah dieu to hear her confess it so if yesternight it had stirred me to the very depths of my poor sinful soul to have her say so much to me how infinitely more did it not affect me to overhear this frank avowal of it to another and to think that she was undergoing all this to the end that she might save me  from chatellerault there came an impatient snort in answer and his feet again smote the floor as he resumed the pacing that for a moment he had suspended then followed a pause a long silence broken only by the counts restless walking to and fro at last why are you silent monsieur she asked in a trembling voice  helas mademoiselle i can do nothing i had feared that it might be thus with you and if i put the question it was in the hope that i was wrong  but he monsieur she exclaimed in anguish what of him  believe me mademoiselle if it lay in my power i would save him were he never so guilty if only that i might spare you sorrow  he spoke with tender regret foul hypocrite that he was  oh no no she cried and her voice was of horror and despair you do not mean that she stopped short and then after a pause it was the count who finished the sentence for her  i mean mademoiselle that this lesperon must die  you will marvel that i let her suffer so that i did not break down the partition with my hands and strike that supple gentleman dead at her feet in atonement for the anguish he was causing her but i had a mind to see how far he would drive this game he was engaged upon  again there was a spell of silence and at last when mademoiselle spoke i was amazed at the calm voice in which she addressed him marvelling at the strength and courage of one so frail and childlike to behold  is your determination indeed irrevocable monsieur if you have any pity will you not at least let me bear my prayers and my tears to the king  it would avail you nothing as i have said the languedoc rebels are in my hands he paused as if to let those words sink well into her understanding then if i were to set him at liberty mademoiselle if i were to spirit him out of prison in the night bribing his jailers to keep silent and binding him by oath to quit france at once and never to betray me i should be myself guilty of high treason thus alone could the thing be done and you will see mademoiselle that by doing it i should be endangering my neck  there was an ineffable undercurrent of meaning in his wordsan intangible suggestion that he might be bribed to do all this to which he so vaguely alluded  i understand monsieur she answered chokingi understand that it would be too much to ask of you  it would be much mademoiselle he returned quickly and his voice was now subdued and invested with an odd quiver but nothing that your lips might ask of me and that it might lie in the power of mortal man to do would be too much  you mean she cried a catch in her breath had she guessedas i without sight of her face had guessedwhat was to follow my gorge was rising fast i clenched my hands and by an effort i restrained myself to learn that i had guessed aright  some two months ago he said i journeyed to lavedan as you may remember i saw you mademoisellefor a brief while only it is trueand ever since i have seen nothing else but you his voice went a shade lower and passion throbbed in his words  she too perceived it for the grating of a chair informed me that she had risen  not now monsieurnot now she exclaimed this is not the season i beg of you think of my desolation  i do mademoiselle and i respect your grief and with all my heart believe me i share it yet this is the season and if you have this mans interests at heart you will hear me to the end  through all the imperiousness of his tone an odd note of respectreal or assumedwas sounding  if you suffer mademoiselle believe me that i suffer also and if i make you suffer more by what i say i beg that you will think how what you have said how the very motive of your presence here has made me suffer do you know mademoiselle what it is to be torn by jealousy can you imagine it if you can you can imagine also something of the torture i endured when you confessed to me that you loved this lesperon when you interceded for his life mademoiselle i love youwith all my heart and soul i love you i have loved you i think since the first moment of our meeting at lavedan and to win you there is no risk that i would not take no danger that i would not brave  monsieur i implore you  hear me out mademoiselle he cried then in quieter voice he proceeded at present you love this monsieur de lesperon  i shall always love him always monsieur  wait wait wait he exclaimed annoyed by her interruption if he were to live and you were to wed him and be daily in his company i make no doubt your love might endure but if he were to die or if he were to pass into banishment and you were to see him no more you would mourn him for a little while and thenhelas it is the way of men and womentime would heal first your sorrow then your heart  never monsieuroh never  i am older child than you are i know at present you are anxious to save his life anxious because you love him and also because you betrayed him and you would not have his death upon your conscience he paused a moment then raising his voice mademoiselle said he i offer you your lovers life  monsieur monsieur cried the poor child i knew you were good i knew  a moment do not misapprehend me i do not say that i give iti offer it  but the difference  that if you would have it mademoiselle you must buy it i have said that for you i would brave all dangers to save your lover i brave the scaffold if i am betrayed or if the story transpire my head will assuredly fall in the place of lesperons this i will risk mademoisellei will do it gladlyif you will promise to become my wife when it is done  there was a moan from roxalanne then silence thenoh monsieur you are pitiless what bargain is this that you offer me  a fair one surely said that son of hella very fair one the risk of my life against your hand in marriage  if youif you truly loved me as you say monsieur she reasoned you would serve me without asking guerdon  in any other thing i would but is it fair to ask a man who is racked by love of you to place another in your arms and that at the risk of his own life ah mademoiselle i am but a man and i am subject to human weaknesses if you will consent this lesperon shall go free but you must see him no more and i will carry my consideration so far as to give you six months in which to overcome your sorrow ere i present myself to you again to urge my suit  and if i refuse monsieur  he sighed  to the value which i set upon my life you must add my very human jealousy from such a combination what can you hope for  you mean in short that he must die  tomorrow was that infernal cheats laconic answer  they were silent a little while then she fell asobbing  be pitiful monsieur have mercy if you indeed love me oh he must not die i cannot i dare not let him die save him monsieur and i will pray for you every night of my life i will pray for you to our holy mother as i am now praying to you for him  lived there the man to resist that innocent devout appeal lived there one who in answer to such gentle words of love and grief could obtrude his own coarse passions it seems there did for all he answered was you know the price child  and god pity me i must pay it i must for if he dies i shall have his blood upon my conscience then she checked her grief and her voice grew almost stern in the restraint she set upon herself if i give you my promise to wed you hereaftersay in six months timewhat proof will you afford me that he who is detained under the name of lesperon shall go free  i caught the sound of something very like a gasp from the count  remain in toulouse until tomorrow and tonight ere he departs he shall come to take his leave of you are you content  be it so monsieur she answered  then at last i leapt to my feet i could endure no more you may marvel that i had had the heart to endure so much and to have so let her suffer that i might satisfy myself how far this scoundrel chatellerault would drive his tricksters bargain  a more impetuous man would have beaten down the partition or shouted to her through it the consolation that chatelleraults bargain was no bargain at all since i was already at large and that is where a more impetuous man would have acted upon instinct more wisely than did i upon reason instead i opened the door and crossing the common room i flung myself down a passage that i thought must lead to the chamber in which they were closeted but in this i was at fault and ere i had come upon a waiter and been redirected some precious moments were lost he led me back through the common room to a door opening upon another corridor he pushed it wide and i came suddenly face to face with chatellerault still flushed from his recent contest  you here he gasped his jaw falling and his cheeks turning pale as well they might for all that he could not dream i had overheard his bargaining  we will go back if you please monsieur le comte said i  back where he asked stupidly  back to mademoiselle back to the room you have just quitted and none too gently i pushed him into the corridor again and so in the gloom i missed the expression of his face  she is not there said he  i laughed shortly  nevertheless we will go back i insisted  and so i had my way and we gained the room where his infamous traffic had been held yet for once he spoke the truth she was no longer there  where is she i demanded angrily  gone he answered and when i protested that i had not met her you would not have a lady go by way of the public room would you he demanded insolently she left by the side door into the courtyard  that being so monsieur le comte said i quietly i will have a little talk with you before going after her and i carefully closed the door     chapter xv monsieur de chatellerault is angry   within the room chatellerault and i faced each other in silence and how vastly changed were the circumstances since our last meeting  the disorder that had stamped itself upon his countenance when first he had beheld me still prevailed there was a lowering sullen look in his eyes and a certain displacement of their symmetry which was peculiar to them when troubled  although a cunning plotter and a scheming intriguer in his own interests chatellerault as i have said before was not by nature a quick man his wits worked slowly and he needed leisure to consider a situation and his actions therein ere he was in a position to engage with it  monsieur le comte quoth i ironically i make you my compliments upon your astuteness and the depth of your schemes and my condolences upon the little accident owing to which i am here and in consequence of which your pretty plans are likely to miscarry  he threw back his great head like a horse that feels the curb and his smouldering eyes looked up at me balefully then his sensuous lips parted in scorn  how much do you know he demanded with sullen contempt  i have been in that room for the half of an hour i answered rapping the partition with my knuckles  the dividing wall as you will observe is thin and i heard everything that passed between you and mademoiselle de lavedan  so that bardelys known as the magnificent bardelys the mirror of chivalry bardelys the arbiter elegantiarum of the court of france is no better it seems than a vulgar spy  if he sought by that word to anger me he failed  lord count i answered him very quietly you are of an age to know that the truth alone has power to wound i was in that room by accident and when the first words of your conversation reached me i had not been human had i not remained and strained my ears to catch every syllable you uttered for the rest let me ask you my dear chatellerault since when have you become so nice that you dare cast it at a man that he has been eavesdropping  you are obscure monsieur what is it that you suggest  i am signifying that when a man stands unmasked for a cheat a liar and a thief his own character should give him concern enough to restrain him from strictures upon that of another  a red flush showed through the tan of his skin then faded and left him livida very evil sight as god lives he flung his heavilyfeathered hat upon the table and carried his hand to his hilt  gods blood he cried you shall answer me for this  i shook my head and smiled but i made no sign of drawing  monsieur we must talk a while i think that you had better  he raised his sullen eyes to mine perhaps the earnest impressiveness of my tones prevailed be that as it may his halfdrawn sword was thrust back with a click and what have you to say he asked  be seated i motioned him to a chair by the table and when he had taken it i sat down opposite to him taking up a quill i dipped it in the inkhorn that stood by and drew towards me a sheet of paper  when you lured me into the wager touching mademoiselle de lavedan said i calmly you did so counting upon certain circumstances of which you alone had knowledge that should render impossible the urging of my suit that monsieur le comte was undeniably the action of a cheat was it not  damnation he roared and would have risen but my hand upon his arm i restrained him and pressed him back into his chair  by a sequence of fortuitous circumstances i pursued it became possible for me to circumvent the obstacle upon which you had based your calculations those same circumstances led later to my being arrested in error and in place of another man you discovered how i had contravened the influence upon which you counted you trembled to see how the unexpected had befriended me and you began to fear for your wager  what did you do seeing me arraigned before you in your quality as kings commissioner you pretended to no knowledge of me you became blind to my being any but lesperon the rebel and you sentenced me to death in his place so that being thus definitely removed i should be unable to carry out my undertaking and my lands should consequently pass into your possession that monsieur was at once the act of a thief and a murderer wait monsieur restrain yourself until i shall have done today again fortune comes to my rescue again you see me slipping from your grasp and you are in despair then in the eleventh hour mademoiselle de lavedan comes to you to plead for my life by that act she gives you the most ample proof that your wager is lost what would a gentleman a man of honour have done under these circumstances what did you do you seized that last chance you turned it to the best account you made this poor girl buy something from you you made her sell herself to you for nothingpretending that your nothing was a something of great value what term shall we apply to that to say that you cheated again seems hardly adequate  by god bardelys  wait i thundered looking him straight between the eyes so that again he sank back cowed then resuming the calm with which hitherto i had addressed him your cupidity said i your greed for the estates of bardelys and your jealousy and thirst to see me impoverished and so ousted from my position at court to leave you supreme in his majestys favour have put you to strange shifts for a gentleman chatellerault yet wait  and dipping my pen in the inkhorn i began to write i was conscious of his eyes upon me and i could imagine his surmisings and bewildered speculations as my pen scratched rapidly across the paper in a few moments it was done and i tossed the pen aside i took up the sandbox  when a man cheats monsieur le comte and is detected he is invariably adjudged the loser of his stakes on that count alone everything that you have is now mine by rights again i had to quell an interruption but if we wave that point and proceed upon the supposition that you have dealt fairly and honourably with me why then monsieur you have still sufficient evidencethe word of mademoiselle herself in factthat i have won my wager and so if we take this the most lenient view of the casei paused to sprinkle the sand over my writingyour estates are still lost to you and pass to be my property  do they by god he roared unable longer to restrain himself and leaping to his feet you have done have you not you have said all that you can call to mind you have flung insults and epithets at me enough to earn the cutting of a dozen throats you have dubbed me cheat and thiefhe choked in his passionuntil you have had your fillis it not so now listen to me master bardelys master spy master buffoon master masquerader what manner of proceeding was yours to go to lavedan under a false name how call you that was that perhaps not cheating  no monsieur it was not i answered quietly it was in the terms of your challenge that i was free to go to lavedan in what guise i listed employing what wiles i pleased but let that be i ended and creasing the paper i poured the sand back into the box and dusted the document the point is hardly worth discussing at this time of day if not one way why then in another your wager is lost  is it he set his arms akimbo and eyed me derisively his thickset frame planted squarely before me you are satisfied that it is so quite satisfied eh he leered in my face why then monsieur le marquis we will see whether a few inches of steel will win it back for me and once more his hand flew to his hilt  rising i flung the document i had accomplished upon the table glance first at that said i  he stopped to look at me in inquiry my manner sowing so great a curiosity in him that his passion was all scattered before it then he stepped up to the table and lifted the paper as he read his hand shook amazement dilated his eyes and furrowed his brow  whatwhat does it signify he gasped  it signifies that although fully conscious of having won i prefer to acknowledge that i have lost i make over to you thus my estates of bardelys because monsieur i have come to realize that that wager was an infamous oneone in which a gentleman should have had no partand the only atonement i can make to myself my honour and the lady whom we insultedis that  i do not understand he complained  i apprehend your difficulty comte the point is a nice one but understand at least that my picardy estates are yours only monsieur you will be well advised to make your will forthwith for you are not destined yourself to enjoy them  he looked at me his glance charged with inquiry  his majesty i continued in answer to his glance is ordering your arrest for betraying the trust he had reposed in you and for perverting the ends of justice to do your own private murdering  mon dieu he cried falling of a sudden unto a most pitiful affright the king knows  knows i laughed in the excitement of these other matters you have forgotten to ask how i come to be at liberty i have been to the king monsieur and i have told him what has taken place here at toulouse and how i was to have gone to the block tomorrow  scelerat he cried you have ruined me rage and grief were blent in his accents he stood before me livid of face and with hands clenching and unclenching at his sides  did you expect me to keep such a matter silent even had i been so inclined it had not been easy for his majesty had questions to ask me from what the king said monsieur you may count upon mounting the scaffold in my stead so be advised and make your will without delay if you would have your heirs enjoy my picardy chateau  i have seen terror and anger distort mens countenances but never have i seen aught to compare with the disorder of chatellerault at that moment he stamped and raved and fumed he poured forth a thousand ordures of speech in his frenzy he heaped insults upon me and imprecations upon the king whose lapdog he pronounced me his short stout frame was quivering with passion and fear his broad face distorted by his hideous grimaces of rage and then while yet his ravings were in full flow the door opened and in stepped the airy chevalier de sainteustache  he stood still amazed beneath the lintelmarvelling to see all this anger and abashed at beholding me his sudden appearance reminded me that i had last seen him at grenade in the counts company on the day of my arrest the surprise it had occasioned me now returned upon seeing him so obviously and intimately seeking chatellerault  the count turned on him in his anger  well popinjay he roared what do you want with me  monsieur le comte cried the other in blent indignation and reproach  you will perceive that you are come inopportunely i put in monsieur de chatellerault is not quite himself  but my speech again drew his attention to my presence and the wonder grew in his eyes at finding me there for to him i was still lesperon the rebel and he marvelled naturally that i should be at large  then in the corridor there was a sound of steps and voices and as i turned i beheld in the doorway behind sainteustache the faces of castelroux mironsac and my old acquaintance the babbling irresponsible buffoon la fosse from mironsac he had heard of my presence in toulouse and piloted by castelroux they were both come to seek me out ill swear it was not thus they had looked to find me  they pushed their way into the room impelling sainteustache forward and there were greetings exchanged and felicitations whilst chatellerault curbing his disorder drew the chevalier into a corner of the room and stood there listening to him  at length i heard the count exclaim  do as you please chevalier if you have interests of your own to serve serve them as for myselfi am past being interested  but why monsieur the chevalier inquired  why echoed chatellerault his ferocity welling up again then swinging round he came straight at me as a bull makes a charge  monsieur de bardelys he blazed  bardelys gasped sainteustache in the background  what now i inquired coldly turning from my friends  all that you said may be true and i may be doomed but i swear before god that you shall not go unpunished  i think monsieur that you run a grave risk of perjuring yourself i laughed  you shall render me satisfaction ere we part he cried  if you do not deem that paper satisfaction enough then monsieur forgive me but your greed transcends all possibility of being ever satisfied  the devil take your paper and your estates what shall they profit me when i am dead  they may profit your heirs i suggested  how shall that profit me  that is a riddle that i cannot pretend to elucidate  you laugh you knave he snorted then with an abrupt change of manner you do not lack for friends said he beg one of these gentlemen to act for you and if you are a man of honour let us step out into the yard and settle the matter  i shook my head  i am so much a man of honour as to be careful with whom i cross steel i prefer to leave you to his majestys vengeance his headsman may be less particular than am i no monsieur on the whole i do not think that i can fight you  his face grew a shade paler it became grey the jaw was set and the eyes were more out of symmetry than i had ever seen them their glance approached what is known in italy as the malocchio and to protect themselves against the baneful influences of which men carry charms a moment he stood so eyeing me then coming a step nearer   you do not think that you can fight me eh  you do not think it pardieu how shall i make you change your mind to the insult of words you appear impervious you imagine your courage above dispute because by a lucky accident you killed la vertoile some years ago and the fame of it has attached to you in the intensity of his anger he was breathing heavily like a man overburdened you have been living ever since by the reputation which that accident gave you let us see if you can die by it monsieur de bardelys and leaning forward he struck me on the breast so suddenly and so powerfullyfor he was a man of abnormal strengththat i must have fallen but that la fosse caught me in his arms  kill him lisped the classicminded fool play theseus to this bull of marathon  chatellerault stood back his hands on his hips his head inclined towards his right shoulder and an insolent leer of expectancy upon his face  will that resolve you he sneered  i will meet you i answered when i had recovered breath but i swear that i shall not help you to escape the headsman  he laughed harshly  do i not know it he mocked how shall killing you help me to escape come messieurs sortons at once  sor i answered shortly and thereupon we crowded from the room and went pelemele down the passage to the courtyard at the back     chapter xvi swords   la fosse led the way with me his arm through mine swearing that he would be my second he had such a stomach for a fight had this irresponsible irrepressible rhymester that it mounted to the heights of passion with him and when i mentioned in answer to a hint dropped in connection with the edict that i had the kings sanction for this combat he was nearly mad with joy  blood of la fosse was his oath the honour to stand by you shall be mine my bardelys you owe it me for am i not in part to blame for all this ado nay youll not deny me that gentleman yonder with the wildcat moustaches and a name like a gascon oaththat cousin of mironsacs i meanhas the flair of a fight in his nostrils and a craving to be in it but youll grant me the honour will you not pardieu it will earn me a place in history  or the graveyard quoth i by way of cooling his ardour  peste what an augury then with a laugh but he added indicating sainteustache that long lean sainti forget of what he is patronhardly wears a murderous air  to win peace from him i promised that he should stand by me but the favour lost much of its value in his eyes when presently i added that i did not wish the seconds to engage since the matter was of so very personal a character  mironsac and castelroux assisted by sainteustache closed the heavy portecochere and so shut us in from the observation of passersby the clanging of those gates brought the landlord and a couple of his knaves and we were subjected to the prayers and intercessions to the stormings and ravings that are ever the prelude of a stableyard fight but which invariably end as these ended in the landlords withdrawal to run for help to the nearest corpsdegarde  now my myrmillones cried la fosse in bloodthirsty jubilation to work before the host returns  po cap de dieu growled castelroux is this a time for jests master joker  jests i heard him retorting as he assisted me to doff my doublet do i jest diable you gascons are a slowwitted folk i have a taste for allegory my friend but that never yet was accounted so low a thing as jesting  at last we were ready and i shifted the whole of my attention to the short powerful figure of chatellerault as he advanced upon me stripped to the waist his face set and his eyes full of stern resolve despite his low stature and the breadth of frame which argue sluggish motion there was something very formidable about the count his bared arms were great masses of muscular flesh and if his wrist were but half as supple as it looked powerful that alone should render him a dangerous antagonist  yet i had no qualm of fear no doubt even touching the issue not that i was an habitual ferrailleur as i have indicated i had fought but one man in all my life nor yet am i of those who are said to know no fear under any circumstances such men are not truly brave they are stupid and unimaginative in proof of which i will advance the fact that you may incite a timid man to deeds of reckless valour by drugging him with wine but this is by the way it may be that the very regular fencing practice that in paris i was wont to take may so have ordered my mind that the fact of meeting unbaited steel had little power to move me  be that as it may i engaged the count without a tremor either of the flesh or of the spirit i was resolved to wait and let him open the play that i might have an opportunity of measuring his power and seeing how best i might dispose of him i was determined to do him no hurt and to leave him as i had sworn to the headsman and so either by pressure or by seizure it was my aim to disarm him  but on his side also he entered upon the duel with all caution and wariness from his rage i had hoped for a wild angry rush that should afford me an easy opportunity of gaining my ends with him not so however now that he came with steel to defend his life and to seek mine he appeared to have realized the importance of having keen wits to guide his hand and so he put his anger from him and emerged calm and determined from his whilom disorder  some preliminary passes we made from the first engagement in the lines of tierce each playing warily for an opening yet neither of us giving ground or betraying haste or excitement now his blade slithered on mine with a ceaseless tremor his eyes watched mine from under lowering brows and with knees bent he crouched like a cat making ready for a spring then it came sudden as lightning was his disengage he darted under my guard then over it then back and under it again and stretching out in the lungehis doublefeint completedhe straightened his arm to drive home the botte  but with a flying point i cleared his blade out of the line of my body there had been two sharp tinkles of our meeting swords and now chatellerault stood at his fullest stretch the half of his steel past and behind me for just a fraction of time completely at my mercy yet i was content to stand and never move my blade from his until he had recovered and we were back in our first position once again  i heard the deep bass of castelrouxs mordieux the sharp gasp of fear from sainteustache who already in imagination beheld his friend stretched lifeless on the ground and the cry of mortification from la fosse as the count recovered but i heeded these things little as i have said to kill the count was not my object it had been wise perhaps in chatellerault to have appreciated that fact but he did not from the manner in which he now proceeded to press me i was assured that he set his having recovered guard to slowness on my part never thinking of the speed that had been necessary to win myself such an opening as i had obtained  my failure to run him through in that moment of jeopardy inspired him with a contempt of my swordplay this he now made plain by the recklessness with which he fenced in his haste to have done ere we might chance to be interrupted of this recklessness i suddenly availed myself to make an attempt at disarming him i turned aside a vicious thrust by a closea dangerously closeparry and whilst in the act of encircling his blade i sought by pressure to carry it out of his hand i was within an ace of succeeding yet he avoided me and doubled back  he realized then perhaps that i was not quite so contemptible an antagonist as he had been imagining and he went back to his earlier and more cautious tactics then i changed my plans i simulated an attack and drove him hard for some moments strong he was but there were advantages of reach and suppleness with me and even these advantages apart had i aimed at his life i could have made short work of him but the game i played was fraught with perils to myself and once i was in deadly danger and as near death from the sword as a man may go and live my attack had lured him as i desired that it should into making a riposte he did so and as his blade twisted round mine and came slithering at me i again carried it off by encircling it and again i exerted pressure to deprive him of it but this time i was farther from success than before he laughed at the attempt as with a suddenness that i had been far from expecting he disengaged again and his point darted like a snake upwards at my throat  i parried that thrust but i only parried it when it was within some three inches of my neck and even as i turned it aside it missed me as narrowly as it might without tearing my skin the imminence of the peril had been such that as we mutually recovered i found a cold sweat bathing me  after that i resolved to abandon the attempt to disarm him by pressure and i turned my attention to drawing him into a position that might lend itself to seizure but even as i was making up my mind to thiswe were engaged in sixte at the timei saw a sudden chance his point was held low while he watched me so low that his arm was uncovered and my point was in line with it to see the opening to estimate it and to take my resolve was all the work of a fraction of a second the next instant i had straightened my elbow my blade shot out in a lightning stroke and transfixed his swordarm  there was a yell of pain followed by a deep growl of fury as wounded but not vanquished the enraged count caught his falling sword in his left hand and whilst my own blade was held tight in the bone of his right arm he sought to run me through i leapt quickly aside and then before he could renew the attempt my friends had fallen upon him and wrenched his sword from his hand and mine from his arm  it would ill have become me to taunt a man in his sorry condition else might i now have explained to him what i had meant when i had promised to leave him for the headsman even though i did consent to fight him  mironsac castelroux and la fosse stood babbling around me but i paid no heed either to castelrouxs patois or to la fosses misquotations of classic authors the combat had been protracted and the methods i had pursued had been of a very exhausting nature i leaned now against the portecochere and mopped myself vigorously then sainteustache who was engaged in binding up his principals arm called to la fosse  i followed my second with my eyes as he went across to chatellerault the count stood white his lips compressed no doubt from the pain his arm was causing him then his voice floated across to me as he addressed la fosse  you will do me the favour monsieur to inform your friend that this was no first blood combat but one a outrance i fence as well with my left arm as with my right and if monsieur de bardelys will do me the honour to engage again i shall esteem it  la fosse bowed and came over with the message that already we had heard  i fought said i in answer in a spirit very different from that by which monsieur de chatellerault appears to have been actuated he made it incumbent upon me to afford proof of my courage that proof i have afforded i decline to do more moreover as monsieur de chatellerault himself must perceive the light is failing us and in a few minutes it will be too dark for swordplay  in a few minutes there will be need for none monsieur shouted chatellerault to save time he was boastful to the end  here monsieur in any case come those who will resolve the question i answered pointing to the door of the inn  as i spoke the landlord stepped into the yard followed by an officer and a halfdozen soldiers these were no ordinary keepers of the peace but musketeers of the guard and at sight of them i knew that their business was not to interrupt a duel but to arrest my erstwhile opponent upon a much graver charge  the officer advanced straight to chatellerault  in the kings name monsieur le comte said he i demand your sword  it may be that at bottom i was still a man of soft heart unfeeling cynic though they accounted me for upon remarking the misery and gloom that spread upon chatelleraults face i was sorry for him notwithstanding the much that he had schemed against me of what his fate would be he could have no shadow of doubt he knewnone betterhow truly the king loved me and how he would punish such an attempt as had been made upon my life to say nothing of the prostitution of justice of which he had been guilty and for which alone he had earned the penalty of death  he stood a moment with bent head the pain of his arm possibly forgotten in the agony of his spirit then straightening himself suddenly with a proud half scornful air he looked the officer straight between the eyes  you desire my sword monsieur he inquired  the musketeer bowed respectfully  sainteustache will you do me the favour to give it to me  and while the chevalier picked up the rapier from the ground where it had been flung that man waited with an outward calm for which at the moment i admired him as we must ever admire a tranquil bearing in one smitten by a great adversity and than this i can conceive few greater he had played for much and he had lost everything ignominy degradation and the block were all that impended for him in this world and they were very imminent  he took the sword from the chevalier he held it for a second by the hilt like one in thought like one who is resolving upon something whilst the musketeer awaited his good pleasure with that deference which all gentle minds must accord to the unfortunate  still holding his rapier he raised his eyes for a second and let them rest on me with a grim malevolence then he uttered a short laugh and shrugging his shoulders he transferred his grip to the blade as if about to offer the hilt to the officer holding it so halfway betwixt point and quillons he stepped suddenly back and before any there could put forth a hand to stay him he had set the pummel on the ground and the point at his breast and so dropped upon it and impaled himself  a cry went up from every throat and we sprang towards him he rolled over on his side and with a grin of exquisite pain yet in words of unconquerable derision you may have my sword now monsieur lofficier he said and sank back swooning  with an oath the musketeer stepped forward he obeyed chatellerault to the letter by kneeling beside him and carefully withdrawing the sword then he ordered a couple of his men to take up the body  is he dead asked some one and some one else replied not yet but he soon will be  two of the musketeers bore him into the inn and laid him on the floor of the very room in which an hour or so ago he had driven a bargain with roxalanne a cloak rolled into a pillow was thrust under his head and there we left him in charge of his captors the landlord sainteustache and la fosse the latter inspired i doubt not by that morbidity which is so often a feature of the poetic mind and which impelled him now to witness the deathagony of my lord of chatellerault  myself having resumed my garments i disposed myself to repair at once to the hotel de lepee there to seek roxalanne that i might set her fears and sorrows at rest and that i might at last make my confession  as we stepped out into the street where the dusk was now thickening i turned to castelroux to inquire how sainteustache came into chatelleraults company  he is of the family of the iscariot i should opine answered the gascon as soon as he had news that chatellerault was come to languedoc as the kings commissioner he repaired to him to offer his services in the work of bringing rebels to justice he urged that his thorough acquaintance with the province should render him of value to the king as also that he had had particular opportunities of becoming acquainted with many treasonable dealings on the part of men whom the state was far from suspecting  mort dieu i cried i had suspected something of such a nature you do well to call him of the family of the iscariot he is more so than you imagine i have knowledge of thisample knowledge he was until lately a rebel himself and himself a follower of gaston dorleansthough of a lukewarm quality what reasons have driven him to such work do you know  the same reason that impelled his forefather judas of old the desire to enrich himself for every hitherto unsuspected rebel that shall be brought to justice and whose treason shall be proven by his agency he claims the half of that rebels confiscated estates  diable i exclaimed and does the keeper of the seals sanction this  sanction it sainteustache holds a commission has a free hand and a company of horse to follow him in his rebelhunting  has he done much so far was my next question  he has reduced half a dozen noblemen and their families the wealth he must thereby have amassed should be very considerable indeed  tomorrow castelroux i will see the king in connection with this pretty gentleman and not only shall we find him a dungeon deep and dank but we shall see that he disgorges his bloodmoney  if you can prove his treason you will be doing blessed work returned castelroux until tomorrow then for here is the hotel de lepee  from the broad doorway of an imposing building a warm glow of light issued out and spread itself fanwise across the illpaved street in thislike bats about a lampflitted the black figures of gaping urchins and other stragglers and into this i now passed having taken leave of my companions  i mounted the steps and i was about to cross the threshold when suddenly above a burst of laughter that greeted my ears i caught the sound of a singularly familiar voice this seemed raised at present to address such company as might be within one moment of doubt had ifor it was a month since last i had heard those soft unctuous accents then i was assured that the voice i heard was indeed the voice of my steward ganymede castelrouxs messenger had found him at last it seemed and had brought him to toulouse  i was moved to spring into the room and greet that old retainer for whom despite the gross and sensuous ways that with advancing years were claiming him more and more i had a deep attachment but even as i was on the point of entering not only his voice but the very words that he was uttering floated out to my ears and they were of a quality that held me there to play the hidden listener for the second time in my life in one and the same day     chapter xvii the babbling of ganymede   never until that hour as i stood in the porch of the hotel de lepee hearkening to my henchmans narrative and to the bursts of laughter which ever and anon it provoked from his numerous listeners had i dreamed of the raconteur talents which rodenard might boast yet was i very far from being appreciative now that i discovered them for the story that he told was of how one marcel saintpol marquis de bardelys had laid a wager with the comte de chatellerault that he would woo and win mademoiselle de lavedan to wife within three months nor did he stop there rodenard it would seem was well informed he had drawn all knowledge of the state of things from castelrouxs messenger and lateri know not from whomat toulouse since his arrival  he regaled the company therefore with a recital of our finding the dying lesperon and of how i had gone off alone and evidently assumed the name and role of that proscribed rebel and thus conducted my wooing under sympathy inspiring circumstances at lavedan then came he announced the very cream of the jest when i was arrested as lesperon and brought to toulouse and to trial in lesperons stead he told them how i had been sentenced to death in the other mans place and he assured them that i would certainly have been beheaded upon the morrow but that news had been borne to himrodenardof my plight and he was come to deliver me  my first impulse upon hearing him tell of the wager had been to stride into the room and silence him by my coming that i did not obey that impulse was something that presently i was very bitterly to regret how it came that i did not i scarcely know i was tempted perhaps to see how far this henchman whom for years i had trusted was unworthy of that trust and so there in the porch i stayed until he had ended by telling the company that he was on his way to inform the kingwho by great good chance was that day arrived in toulouseof the mistake that had been made and thus obtain my immediate enlargement and earn my undying gratitude  again i was on the point of entering to administer a very stern reproof to that talkative rogue when of a sudden there was a commotion within i caught a scraping of chairs a dropping of voices and then suddenly i found myself confronted by roxalanne de lavedan herself issuing with a page and a woman in attendance  for just a second her eyes rested on me and the light coming through the doorway at her back boldly revealed my countenance and a very startled countenance it must have been for in that fraction of time i knew that she had heard all that rodenard had been relating under that instants glance of her eyes i felt myself turn pale a shiver ran through me and the sweat started cold upon my brow then her gaze passed from me and looked beyond into the street as though she had not known me whether in her turn she paled or reddened i cannot say for the light was too uncertain next followed what seemed to me an interminable pause although indeed it can have been no more than a matter of secondsaye and of but few then her gown drawn well aside she passed me in that same irrecognizing way whilst i abashed shrank back into the shadows of the porch burning with shame and rage and humiliation  from under her brows her woman glanced at me inquisitively her liveried page his nose in the air eyed me so pertly that i was hard put to it not to hasten with my foot his descent of the steps  at last they were gone and from the outside the shrill voice of her page was wafted to me he was calling to the ostler for her carriage standing in my deep mortification where she had passed me i conjectured from that demand that she was journeying to lavedan  she knew now how she had been cheated on every hand first by me and later that very afternoon by chatellerault and her resolve to quit toulouse could but signify that she was done with me for good that it had surprised her to find me at large already i fancied i had seen in her momentary glance but her pride had been quick to conquer and stifle all signs of that surprise  i remained where she had passed me until her coach had rumbled away into the night and during the moments that elapsed i had stood arguing with myself and resolving upon my course of action but despair was fastening upon me  i had come to the hotel de lepee exulting joyous and confident of victory i had come to confess everything to her and by virtue of what i had done that confession was rendered easy i could have said to her the woman whom i wagered to win was not you roxalanne but a certain mademoiselle de lavedan your love i have won but that you may foster no doubts of my intentions i have paid my wager and acknowledge defeat i have made over to chatellerault and to his heirs for all time my estates of bardelys  oh i had rehearsed it in my mind and i was confidenti knewthat i should win her and nowthe disclosure of that shameful traffic coming from other lips than mine had ruined everything by forestalling my avowal  rodenard should pay for itby god he should once again did i become a prey to the passion of anger which i have ever held to be unworthy in a gentleman but to which it would seem that i was growing accustomed to give way the ostler was mounting the steps at the moment he carried in his hand a stout horsewhip with a long knotted thong hastily muttering a by your leave i snatched it from him and sprang into the room  my intendant was still talking of me the room was crowded for rodenard alone had brought with him my twenty followers one of these looked up as i brushed past him and uttered a cry of surprise upon recognizing me but rodenard talked on engrossed in his theme to the exclusion of all else  monsieur le marquis he was saying is a gentleman whom it is indeed an honour to serve  a scream burst from him with the last word for the lash of my whip had burnt a wheal upon his wellfed sides  it is an honour that shall be yours no more you dog i cried  he leapt high into the air as my whip cut him again he swung round his face twisted with pain his flabby cheeks white with fear and his eyes wild with anger for as yet the full force of the situation had not been borne in upon him then seeing me there and catching something of the awful passion that must have been stamped upon my face he dropped on his knees and cried out something that i did not understand for i was past understanding much just then  the lash whistled through the air again and caught him about the shoulders he writhed and roared in his anguish of both flesh and spirit but i was pitiless he had ruined my life for me with his talking and as god lived he should pay the only price that it lay in his power to paythe price of physical suffering again and again my whip hissed about his head and cut into his soft white flesh whilst roaring for mercy he moved and rocked on his knees before me instinctively he approached me to hamper my movements whilst i moved back to give my lash the better play he held out his arms and joined his fat hands in supplication but the lash caught them in its sinuous tormenting embrace and started a red wheal across their whiteness he tucked them into his armpits with a scream and fell prone upon the ground  then i remember that some of my men essayed to restrain me which to my passion was as the wind to a blaze i cracked my whip about their heads commanding them to keep their distance lest they were minded to share his castigation and so fearful an air must i have worn that daunted they hung back and watched their leaders punishment in silence  when i think of it now i take no little shame at the memory of how i beat him it is indeed with deep reluctance and yet deeper shame that i have brought myself to write of it if i offend you with this account of that horsewhipping let necessity be my apology for the horsewhipping itself i have unfortunately no apology save the blind fury that obsessed mewhich is no apology at all  upon the morrow i repented me already with much bitterness but in that hour i knew no reason i was mad and of my madness was born this harsh brutality  you would talk of me and my affairs in a tavern you hound i cried out of breath both by virtue of my passion and my exertions let the memory of this act as a curb upon your poisonous tongue in future  monseigneur he screamed misericorde monseigneur  aye you shall have mercyjust so much mercy as you deserve have i trusted you all these years and did my father trust you before me for this have you grown sleek and fat and smug in my service that you should requite me thus sangdieu rodenard my father had hanged you for the half of the talking that you have done this night you dog you miserable knave  monseigneur he shrieked again forgive for your sainted mothers sake forgive monseigneur i did not know  but you are learning cur you are learning by the pain of your fat carcase is it not so carrion  he sank down his strength exhausted a limp moaning bleeding mass of flesh into which my whip still cut relentlessly  i have a picture in my mind of that illlighted room of the startled faces on which the flickering glimmer of the candles shed odd shadows of the humming and cracking of my whip of my own voice raised in oaths and epithets of contempt of rodenards screams of the cries raised here and there in remonstrance or in entreaty and of some more bold that called shame upon me then others took up that cry of shame so that at last i paused and stood there drawn up to my full height as if in challenge towering above the heads of any in that room i held my whip menacingly i was unused to criticism and their expressions of condemnation roused me  who questions my right i demanded arrogantly whereupon they one and all fell silent if any here be bold enough to step out he shall have my answer then as none responded i signified my contempt for them by a laugh  monseigneur wailed rodenard at my feet his voice growing feeble  by way of answer i gave him a final cut then i flung the whip which had grown ragged in the frayback to the ostler from whom i had borrowed it  let that suffice you rodenard i said touching him with my foot see that i never set eyes upon you again if you cherish your miserable life  not that monseigneur groaned the wretch oh not that you have punished me you have whipped me until i cannot stand forgive me monseigneur forgive me now  i have forgiven you but i never wish to see you again lest i should forget that i have forgiven you take him away some of you i bade my men and in swift silent obedience two of them stepped forward and bore the groaning sobbing fellow from the room when that was done host i commanded prepare me a room attend me a couple of you  i gave orders thereafter for the disposal of my baggage some of which my lacqueys brought up to the chamber that the landlord had in haste made ready for me in that chamber i sat until very late a prey to the utmost misery and despair my rage being spent i might have taken some thought for poor ganymede and his condition but my own affairs crowded overheavily upon my mind and sat the undisputed rulers of my thoughts that night  at one moment i considered journeying to lavedan only to dismiss the idea the next what could it avail me now would roxalanne believe the tale i had to tell would she not think naturally enough that i was but making the best of the situation and that my avowal of the truth of a story which it was not in my power to deny was not spontaneous but forced from me by circumstances no there was nothing more to be done a score of amours had claimed my attention in the past and received it yet there was not one of those affairs whose miscarriage would have afforded me the slightest concern or mortification it seemed like an irony like a dies ire that it should have been left to this first true passion of my life to have gone awry  i slept ill when at last i sought my bed and through the night i nursed my bitter grief huddling to me the corpse of the love she had borne me as a mother may the corpse of her firstborn  on the morrow i resolved to leave toulouseto quit this province wherein so much had befallen me and repair to beaugency there to grow old in misanthropical seclusion i had done with courts i had done with love and with women i had done it seemed to me with life itself prodigal had it been in gifts that i had not sought of it it had spread my table with the richest offerings but they had been little to my palate and i had nauseated quickly and now when here in this remote corner of france it had shown me the one prize i coveted it had been swift to place it beyond my reach thereby sowing everlasting discontent and misery in my hitherto pampered heart  i saw castelroux that day but i said no word to him of my affliction he brought me news of chatellerault the count was lying in a dangerous condition at the auberge royale and might not be moved the physician attending him all but despaired of his life  he is asking to see you said castelroux  but i was not minded to respond for all that he had deeply wronged me for all that i despised him very cordially the sight of him in his present condition might arouse my pity and i was in no mood to waste upon such a one as chatellerault even on his deathbeda quality of which i had so dire a need just then for my own case  i will not go said i after deliberation tell him from me that i forgive him freely if it be that he seeks my forgiveness tell him that i bear him no rancour andthat he had better make his will to save me trouble hereafter if he should chance to die  i said this because i had no mind if he should perish intestate to go in quest of his next heirs and advise them that my late picardy estates were now their property  castelroux sought yet to persuade me to visit the count but i held firmly to my resolve  i am leaving toulouse today i announced  whither do you go  to hell or to beaugencyi scarce know which nor does it matter  he looked at me in surprise but being a man of breeding asked no questions upon matters that he accounted secret  but the king he ventured presently  his majesty has already dispensed me from my duties by him  nevertheless i did not go that day i maintained the intention until sunset then seeing that it was too late i postponed my departure until the morrow i can assign no reason for my dallying mood perhaps it sprang from the inertness that pervaded me perhaps some mysterious hand detained me be that as it may that i remained another night at the hotel de lepee was one of those contingencies which though slight and seemingly inconsequential in themselves lead to great issues had i departed that day for beaugency it is likely that you had never heard of meleastways not from my own penfor in what so far i have told you without that which is to follow there is haply little that was worth the labour of setting down  in the morning then i set out but having started late we got no farther than grenade where we lay the night once more at the hotel de la couronne and so through having delayed my departure by a single day did it come to pass that a message reached me before it might have been too late  it was high noon of the morrow our horses stood saddled indeed some of my men were already mountedfor i was not minded to disband them until beaugency was reachedand my two coaches were both ready for the journey the habits of a lifetime are not so easy to abandon even when necessity raises her compelling voice  i was in the act of settling my score with the landlord when of a sudden there were quick steps in the passage the clank of a rapier against the wall and a voicethe voice of castelrouxcalling excitedly bardelys monsieur de bardelys  what brings you here i cried in greeting as he stepped into the room  are you still for beaugency he asked sharply throwing back his head  why yes i answered wondering at this excitement  then you have seen nothing of sainteustache and his men  nothing  yet they must have passed this way not many hours ago then tossing his hat on the table and speaking with sudden vehemence if you have any interest in the family of lavedan you will return upon the instant to toulouse  the mention of lavedan was enough to quicken my pulses yet in the past two days i had mastered resignation and in doing that we school ourselves to much restraint i turned slowly and surveyed the little captain attentively his black eyes sparkled and his moustaches bristled with excitement clearly he had news of import i turned to the landlord  leave us monsieur lhote said i shortly and when he had departed what of the lavedan family castelroux i inquired as calmly as i might  the chevalier de sainteustache left toulouse at six oclock this morning for lavedan  swift the suspicion of his errand broke upon my mind  he has betrayed the vicomte i half inquired half asserted  castelroux nodded he has obtained a warrant for his apprehension from the keeper of the seals and is gone to execute it in the course of a few days lavedan will be in danger of being no more than a name this sainteustache is driving a brisk trade by god and some fine prizes have already fallen to his lot but if you add them all together they are not likely to yield as much as this his latest expedition unless you intervene bardelys the vicomte de lavedan is doomed and his family houseless  i will intervene i cried by god i will and as for sainteustachehe was born under a propitious star indeed if he escapes the gallows he little dreams that i am still to be reckoned with there castelroux i will start for lavedan at once  already i was striding to the door when the gascon called me back  what good will that do he asked were it not better first to return to toulouse and obtain a counterwarrant from the king  there was wisdom in his wordsmuch wisdom but my blood was afire and i was in too hot a haste to reason  return to toulouse i echoed scornfully a waste of time captain no i will go straight to lavedan i need no counterwarrant i know too much of this chevaliers affairs and my very presence should be enough to stay his hand he is as foul a traitor as youll find in france but for the moment god bless him for a very opportune knave gilles i called throwing wide the door gilles  monseigneur he answered hastening to me  put back the carriages and saddle me a horse i commanded and bid your fellows mount at once and await me in the courtyard we are not going to beaugency gilles we ride northto lavedan     chapter xviii sainteustache is obstinate   on the occasion of my first visit to lavedan i had disregardedor rather fate had contrived that i should disregardchatelleraults suggestion that i should go with all the panoply of powerwith my followers my liveries and my equipages to compose the magnificence all france had come to associate with my name and thus dazzle by my brilliant lustre the lady i was come to win as you may remember i had crept into the chateau like a thief in the nightwounded bedraggled and of miserable aspect seeking to provoke compassion rather than admiration  not so now that i made my second visit i availed myself of all the splendour to which i owed my title of magnificent and rode into the courtyard of the chateau de lavedan preceded by twenty wellmounted knaves wearing the gorgeous saintpol liveries of scarlet and gold with the bardelys escutcheon broidered on the breasts of their doubletson a field or a bar azure surcharged by three lilies of the field they were armed with swords and musketoons and had more the air of a royal bodyguard than of a company of attendant servants  our coming was in a way well timed i doubt if we could have stayed the execution of sainteustaches warrant even had we arrived earlier but for effectto produce a striking coup de theatrewe could not have come more opportunely  a coach stood in the quadrangle at the foot of the chateau steps down these the vicomte was descending with the vicomtessegrim and blasphemant as ever on one side and his daughter white of face and with tightly compressed lips on the other between these two womenhis wife and his childas different in body as they were different in soul came lavedan with a firm step a good colour and a look of wellbred lofty indifference to his fate  he disposed himself to enter the carriage which was to bear him to prison with much the same air he would have assumed had his destination been a royal levee  around the coach were grouped a score of men of sainteustaches companyhalf soldiers half ploughboysillgarbed and indifferently accoutred in dull breastplates and steel caps many of which were rusted by the carriage door stood the long lank figure of the chevalier himself dressed with his wonted care and perfumed curled and beribboned beyond belief his weak boyish face sought by scowls and by the adoption of a grim smile to assume an air of martial ferocity  such was the grouping in the quadrangle when my men with gilles at their head thundered across the drawbridge giving pause to those within and drawing upon themselves the eyes of all as they rode two by two under the oldworld arch of the keep into the courtyard and gilles who knew our errand and who was as readywitted a rogue as ever rode with me took in the situation at a glance knowing how much i desired to make a goodly show he whispered an order this resulted in the couples dividing at the gateway one going to the left and one to the right so that as they came they spread themselves in a crescent and drawing rein they faced forward confronting and half surrounding the chevaliers company  as each couple appeared the curiositythe uneasiness probablyof sainteustache and his men had increased and their expectancy was on tiptoe to see what lord it was went abroad with such regal pomp when i appeared in the gateway and advanced at the trot into the middle of the quadrangle there i drew rein and doffed my hat to them as they stood openmouthed and gaping one and all if it was a theatrical display a parade worthy of a tiltground it was yet a noble and imposing advent and their gaping told me that it was not without effect the men looked uneasily at the chevalier the chevalier looked uneasily at his men mademoiselle very pale lowered her eyes and pressed her lips yet more tightly the vicomtesse uttered an oath of astonishment whilst lavedan too dignified to manifest surprise greeted me with a sober bow  behind them on the steps i caught sight of a group of domestics old anatole standing slightly in advance of his fellows and wondering no doubt whether this were indeed the bedraggled lesperon of a little while agofor if i had thought of pomp in the display of my lacqueys no less had i considered it in the decking of my own person without any of the ribbons and fopperies that mark the coxcomb yet was i clad plumed and armed with a magnificence such as ill swear had not been seen within the grey walls of that old castle in the lifetime of any of those that were now present  gilles leapt from his horse as i drew rein and hastened to hold my stirrup with a murmured monsieur which title drew a fresh astonishment into the eyes of the beholders  i advanced leisurely towards sainteustache and addressed him with such condescension as i might a groom to impress and quell a man of this type your best weapon is the arrogance that a nobler spirit would resent  a world of odd meetings this sainteustache i smiled disdainfully a world of strange comings and goings and of strange transformations the last time we were here we stood mutually as guests of monsieur le vicomte at present you appear to be officiating as aa tipstaff  monsieur he coloured and he uttered the word in accents of awakening resentment i looked into his eyes coldly impassively as if waiting to hear what he might have to add and so i stayed until his glance fell and his spirit was frozen in him he knew me and he knew how much i was to be feared a word from me to the king might send him to the wheel it was upon this i played presently as his eye fell is your business with me monsieur de bardelys he asked and at that utterance of my name there was a commotion on the steps whilst the vicomte started and his eyes frowned upon me and the vicomtesse looked up suddenly to scan me with a fresh interest she beheld at last in the flesh the gentleman who had played so notorious a part ten years ago in that scandal connected with the duchesse de bourgogne of which she never tired of reciting the details and think that she had sat at table with him day by day and been unconscious of that momentous fact such i make no doubt was what passed through her mind at the moment and to judge from her expression i should say that the excitement of beholding the magnificent bardelys had for the nonce eclipsed beholding even her husbands condition and the imminent sequestration of lavedan  my business is with you chevalier said i it relates to your mission here  his jaw fell you wish  to desire you to withdraw your men and quit lavedan at once abandoning the execution of your warrant  he flashed me a look of impotent hate you know of the existence of my warrant monsieur de bardelys and you must therefore realize that a royal mandate alone can exempt me from delivering monsieur de lavedan to the keeper of the seals  my only warrant i answered somewhat baffled but far from abandoning hope is my word you shall say to the garde des sceaux that you have done this upon the authority of the marquis de bardelys and you have my promise that his majesty shall confirm my action  in saying that i said too much as i was quickly to realize  his majesty will confirm it monsieur he said interrogatively and he shook his head that is a risk i dare not run my warrant sets me under imperative obligations which i must dischargeyou will see the justice of what i state  his tone was all humility all subservience nevertheless it was firm to the point of being hard but my last card the card upon which i was depending was yet to be played  will you do me the honour to step aside with me chevalier i commanded rather than besought  at your service sir said he and i drew him out of earshot of those others  now sainteustache we can talk said i with an abrupt change of manner from the coldly arrogant to the coldly menacing i marvel greatly at your temerity in pursuing this iscariot business after learning who i am at toulouse two nights ago  he clenched his hands and his weak face hardened  i would beg you to consider your expressions monsieur and to control them said he in a thick voice  i vouchsafed him a stare of freezing amazement you will no doubt remember in what capacity i find you employed nay keep your hands still sainteustache i dont fight catchpolls and if you give me trouble my men are yonder and i jerked my thumb over my shoulder and now to business i am not minded to talk all day i was saying that i marvel at your temerity and more particularly at your having laid information against monsieur de lavedan and having come here to arrest him knowing as you must know that i am interested in the vicomte  i have heard of that interest monsieur said he with a sneer for which i could have struck him  this act of yours i pursued ignoring his interpolation savours very much of flying in the face of destiny it almost seems to me as if you were defying me  his lip trembled and his eyes shunned my glance  indeedindeed monsieur he was protesting when i cut him short  you cannot be so great a fool but that you must realize that if i tell the king what i know of you you will be stripped of your illgotten gains and broken on the wheel for a double traitora betrayer of your fellowrebels  but you will not do that monsieur he cried it would be unworthy in you  at that i laughed in his face heart of god are you to be what you please and do you still expect that men shall be nice in dealing with you i would do this thing and by my faith monsieur de eustache i will do it if you compel me  he reddened and moved his foot uneasily perhaps i did not take the best way with him after all i might have confined myself to sowing fear in his heart that alone might have had the effect i desired by visiting upon him at the same time the insults i could not repress i may have aroused his resistance and excited his desire above all else to thwart me  what do you want of me he demanded with a sudden arrogance which almost cast mine into the shade  i want you said i deeming the time ripe to make a plain tale of it to withdraw your men and to ride back to toulouse without monsieur de lavedan there to confess to the keeper of the seals that your suspicions were unfounded and that you have culled evidence that the vicomte has had no relations with monsieur the kings brother  he looked at me in amazementamusedly almost  a likely story that to bear to the astute gentlemen in toulouse said he  aye ma foi a most likely story said i when they come to consider the profit that you are losing by not apprehending the vicomte and can think of none that you are making they will have little difficulty in believing you  but what of this evidence you refer to  you have i take it discovered no incriminating evidenceno documents that will tell against the vicomte  no monsieur it is true that i have not  he stopped and bit his lip my smile making him aware of his indiscretion  very well then you must invent some evidence to prove that he was in no way associated with the rebellion  monsieur de bardelys said he very insolently we waste time in idle words if you think that i will imperil my neck for the sake of serving you or the vicomte you are most prodigiously at fault  i have never thought so but i have thought that you might be induced to imperil your neckas you have itfor its own sake and to the end that you might save it  he moved away monsieur you talk in vain you have no royal warrant to supersede mine do what you will when you come to toulouse and he smiled darkly meanwhile the vicomte goes with me  you have no evidence against him i cried scarce believing that he would dare to defy me and that i had failed  i have the evidence of my word i am ready to swear to what i knowthat whilst i was here at lavedan some weeks ago i discovered his connection with the rebels  and what think you miserable fool shall your word weigh against mine i cried never fear monsieur le chevalier i shall be in toulouse to give you the lie by showing that your word is a word to which no man may attach faith and by exposing to the king your past conduct if you think that after i have spoken king louis whom they name the just will suffer the trial of the vicomte to go further on your instigation or if you think that you will be able to slip your own neck from the noose i shall have set about it you are an infinitely greater fool than i deem you  he stood and looked at me over his shoulder his face crimson and his brows black as a thundercloud  all this may betide when you come to toulouse monsieur de bardelys said he darkly but from here to toulouse it is a matter of some twenty leagues  with that he turned on his heel and left me baffled and angry to puzzle out the inner meaning of his parting words  he gave his men the order to mount and bade monsieur de lavedan enter the coach whereupon gilles shot me a glance of inquiry for a second as i stepped slowly after the chevalier i was minded to try armed resistance and to convert that grey courtyard into a shambles then i saw betimes the futility of such a step and i shrugged my shoulders in answer to my servants glance  i would have spoken to the vicomte ere he departed but i was too deeply chagrined and humiliated by my defeat so much so that i had no room in my thoughts even for the very natural conjecture of what lavedan must be thinking of me i repented me then of my rashness in coming to lavedan without having seen the kingas castelroux had counselled me i had come indulging vain dreams of a splendid overthrow of sainteustache i had thought to shine heroically in mademoiselles eyes and thus i had hoped that both gratitude for having saved her father and admiration at the manner in which i had achieved it would predispose her to grant me a hearing in which i might plead my rehabilitation once that were accorded me i did not doubt i should prevail  now my dream was all dispelled and my pride had suffered just such a humiliating fall as the moralists tell us pride must ever suffer there seemed little left me but to go hence with lambent tail like a dog that has been whippedmy dazzling escort become a mockery but that it served the more loudly to advertise my true impotency  as i approached the carriage the vicomtesse swept suddenly down the steps and came towards me with a friendly smile monsieur de bardelys said she we are grateful for your intervention in the cause of that rebel my husband  madame i besought her under my breath if you would not totally destroy him i beseech you to be cautious by your leave i will have my men refreshed and thereafter i shall take the road to toulouse again i can only hope that my intervention with the king may bear better fruit  although i spoke in a subdued key sainteustache who stood near us overheard me as his face very clearly testified  remain here sir she replied with some effusion and follow us when you are rested  follow you i inquired do you then go with monsieur de lavedan  no anne said the vicomte politely from the carriage it will be tiring you unnecessarily you were better advised to remain here until my return  i doubt not that the poor vicomte was more concerned with how she would tire him than with how the journey might tire her but the vicomtesse was not to be gainsaid the chevalier had sneered when the vicomte spoke of returning madame had caught that sneer and she swung round upon him now with the vehement fury of a virago  hell not return you think you judas she snarled at him her lean swarthy face growing very evil to see but he shallby god he shall and look to your skin when he does monsieur the catchpoll for on my honour you shall have a foretaste of hell for your trouble in this matter  the chevalier smiled with much restraint a womans tongue said he does no injury  will a womans arm think you demanded that warlike matron you muskstinking tipstaff ill  anne my love implored the vicomte soothingly i beg that you will control yourself  shall i submit to the insolence of this misbegotten vassal shall i  remember rather that it does not become the dignity of your station to address the fellow we avoid venomous reptiles but we do not pause to reproach them with their venom god made them so  sainteustache coloured to the roots of his hair then turning hastily to the driver he bade him start he would have closed the door with that but that madame thrust herself forward  that was the chevaliers chance to be avenged you cannot go said he  cannot her cheeks reddened why not monsieur lesperon  i have no reasons to afford you he answered brutally you cannot go  your pardon chevalier i interposed you go beyond your rights in seeking to prevent her monsieur le vicomte is not yet convicted do not i beseech you transcend the already odious character of your work  and without more ado i shouldered him aside and held the door that she might enter she rewarded me with a smilehalf vicious half whimsical and mounted the step sainteustache would have interfered he came at me as if resenting that shoulderthrust of mine and for a second i almost thought he would have committed the madness of striking me  take care sainteustache i said very quietly my eyes fixed on his and much as dead caesars ghost may have threatened brutus with philippi we meet at toulouse chevalier said i and closing the carriage door i stepped back  there was a flutter of skirts behind me it was mademoiselle so brave and outwardly so calm until now the moment of actual separationand added thereunto perhaps her mothers going and the loneliness that for herself she foresawproved more than she could endure i stepped aside and she swept past me and caught at the leather curtain of the coach  father she sobbed  there are some things that a man of breeding may not witnesssome things to look upon which is near akin to eavesdropping or reading the letters of another such a scene did i now account the present one and turning i moved away but sainteustache cut it short for scarce had i taken three paces when his voice rang out the command to move the driver hesitated for the girl was still hanging at the window but a second command accompanied by a vigorous oath overcame his hesitation he gathered up his reins cracked his whip and the lumbering wheels began to move  have a care child i heard the vicomte cry have a care adieu mon enfant  she sprang back sobbing and assuredly she would have fallen thrown out of balance by the movement of the coach but that i put forth my hands and caught her  i do not think she knew whose were the arms that held her for that brief space so desolated was she by the grief so long repressed at last she realized that it was this worthless bardelys against whom she rested this man who had wagered that he would win and wed her this impostor who had come to her under an assumed name this knave who had lied to her as no gentleman could have lied swearing to love her whilst in reality he did no more than seek to win a wager when all this she realized she shuddered a second then moved abruptly from my grasp and without so much as a glance at me she left me and ascending the steps of the chateau she passed from my sight  i gave the order to dismount as the last of sainteustaches followers vanished under the portcullis     chapter xix the flint and the steel   mademoiselle will see you monsieur said anatole at last  twice already had he carried unavailingly my request that roxalanne should accord me an interview ere i departed on this the third occasion i had bidden him say that i would not stir from lavedan until she had done me the honour of hearing me seemingly that threat had prevailed where entreaties had been scorned  i followed anatole from the halflight of the hall in which i had been pacing into the salon overlooking the terraces and the river where roxalanne awaited me she was standing at the farther end of the room by one of the long windows which was open for although we were already in the first week of october the air of languedoc was as warm and balmy as that of paris or picardy is in summer  i advanced to the centre of the chamber and there i paused and waited until it should please her to acknowledge my presence and turn to face me i was no fledgling i had seen much i had learnt much and been in many places and my bearing was wont to convey it never in my life had i been gauche for which i thank my parents and if years agolong years agoa certain timidity had marked my first introductions to the louvre and the luxembourg that timidity was something from which i had long since parted company and yet it seemed to me as i stood in that pretty sunlit room awaiting the pleasure of that child scarce out of her teens that some of the awkwardness i had escaped in earlier years some of the timidity of long ago came to me then i shifted the weight of my body from one leg to the other i fingered the table by which i stood i pulled at the hat i held my colour came and went i looked at her furtively from under bent brows and i thanked god that her back being towards me she might not see the clown i must have seemed  at length unable longer to brook that discomposing silence  mademoiselle i called softly the sound of my own voice seemed to invigorate me to strip me of my awkwardness and selfconsciousness it broke the spell that for a moment had been over me and brought me back to myselfto the vain selfconfident flamboyant bardelys that perhaps you have pictured from my writings  i hope monsieur she answered without turning that what you may have to say may justify in some measure your very importunate insistence  on my life this was not encouraging but now that i was master of myself i was not again so easily to be disconcerted my eyes rested upon her as she stood almost framed in the opening of that long window how straight and supple she was yet how dainty and slight withal she was far from being a tall woman but her clean length of limb her very slightness and the highbred poise of her shapely head conveyed an illusion of height unless you stood beside her the illusion did not sway me then i saw only a child but a child with a great spirit with a great soul that seemed to accentuate her physical helplessness that helplessness which i felt rather than saw wove into the warp of my love she was in grief just thenin grief at the arrest of her father and at the dark fate that threatened him in grief at the unworthiness of a lover of the two which might be the more bitter it was not mine to judge but i burned to gather her to me to comfort and cherish her to make her one with me and thus whilst giving her something of my mans height and strength cull from her something of that pure noble spirit and thus sanctify my own  i had a moments weakness when she spoke i was within an ace of advancing and casting myself upon my knees like any lenten penitent to sue forgiveness but i set the inclination down betimes such expedients would not avail me here  what i have to say mademoiselle i answered after a pause would justify a saint descending into hell or rather to make my metaphor more apt would warrant a sinners intrusion into heaven  i spoke solemnly yet not too solemnly the least slur of a sardonic humour was in my tones  she moved her head upon the white column of her neck and with the gesture one of her brown curls became disordered i could fancy the upward tilt of her delicate nose the scornful curve of her lip as she answered shortly then say it quickly monsieur  and being thus bidden i said quickly i love you roxalanne  her heel beat the shimmering parquet of the floor she half turned towards me her cheek flushed her lip tremulous with anger  will you say what you have to say monsieur she demanded in a concentrated voice and having said it will you go  mademoiselle i have already said it i answered with a wistful smile  oh she gasped then suddenly facing round upon me a world of anger in her blue eyeseyes that i had known dreamy but which were now very wide awake was it to offer me this last insult you forced your presence upon me was it to mock me with those words mea woman with no man about me to punish you shame sir yet it is no more than i might look for in you  mademoiselle you do me grievous wrong i began  i do you no wrong she answered hotly then stopped unwilling haply to be drawn into contention with me enfin since you have said what you came to say will you go and she pointed to the door  mademoiselle mademoiselle i began in a voice of earnest intercession  go she interrupted angrily and for a second the violence of her voice and gesture almost reminded me of the vicomtesse i will hear no more from you  mademoiselle you shall i answered no whit less firmly  i will not listen to you talk if you will you shall have the walls for audience and she moved towards the door but i barred her passage i was courteous to the last degree i bowed low before her as i put myself in her way  it is all that was wantingthat you should offer me violence she exclaimed  god forbid said i  then let me pass  aye when you have heard me  i do not wish to hear you nothing that you may say can matter to me oh monsieur if you have any instincts of gentility if you have any pretension to be accounted anything but a mauvais sujet i beg of you to respect my grief you witnessed yourself the arrest of my father this is no season for such as scene as you are creating  pardon it is in such a season as this that you need the comfort and support that the man you love alone can give you  the man i love she echoed and from flushed that they had been her cheeks went very pale her eyes fell for an instant thenthey were raised again and their blue depths were offered me i think sir she said through her teeth that your insolence transcends all belief  can you deny it i cried can you deny that you love me if you canwhy then you lied to me three nights ago at toulouse  that smote her hardso hard that she forgot her assurance that she would not listen to meher promise to herself that she would stoop to no contention with me  if in a momentary weakness in my nescience of you as you truly are i did make some such admission i did entertain such feelings for you things have come to my knowledge since then monsieur that have revealed you to me as another man i have learnt something that has utterly withered such love as i then confessed now monsieur are you satisfied and will you let me pass she said the last words with a return of her imperiousness already angry at having been drawn so far  i am satisfied mademoiselle i answered brutally that you did not speak the truth three nights ago you never loved me it was pity that deluded you shame that urged youshame at the delilah part you had played and at your betrayal of me now mademoiselle you may pass said i  and i stood aside assured that as she was a woman she would not pass me now nor did she she recoiled a step instead her lip quivered then she recovered quickly her mother might have told her that she was a fool for engaging herself in such a duel with meme the veteran of a hundred amorous combats yet though i doubt not it was her first assaultatarms of this description she was more than a match for me as her next words proved  monsieur i thank you for enlightening me i cannot indeed have spoken the truth three nights ago you are right i do not doubt it now and you lift from me a load of shame  dieu it was like a thrust in the high lines and its hurtful violence staggered me i was finished it seemed the victory was hers and she but a child with no practice of cupids art of fence  now monsieur she added now that you are satisfied that you did wrong to say i loved you now that we have disposed of that questionadieu  a moment yet i cried we have disposed of that but there was another point an earlier one which for the moment we have disregarded we haveyou have disproved the love i was so presumptuous as to believe you fostered for me we have yet to reckon with the love i bear you mademoiselle and of that we shall not be able to dispose so readily  with a gesture of weariness or of impatience she turned aside what is it you want what do you seek to gain by thus provoking me to win your wager her voice was cold who to have looked upon that childlike face upon those meek pondering eyes could have believed her capable of so much cruelty  there can no longer be any question of my wager i have lost and paid it said i  she looked up suddenly her brows met in a frown of bewilderment clearly this interested her again was she drawn  how she asked you have lost and paid it  even so that odious cursed infamous wager was the something which i hinted at so often as standing between you and me the confession that so often i was on the point of makingthat so often you urged me to makeconcerned that wager would to god roxalanne that i had told you i cried and it seemed to me that the sincerity ringing in my voice drove some of the harshness from her countenance some of the coldness from her glance  unfortunately i pursued it always seemed to me either not yet time or already too late yet so soon as i regained my liberty my first thought was of that while the wager existed i might not ask you to become my wife lest i should seem to be carrying out the original intention which embarked me upon the business of wooing you and brought me here to languedoc and so my first step was to seek out chatellerault and deliver him my note of hand for my picardy possessions the bulkby far the greater bulkof all my fortune my second step was to repair to you at the hotel de lepee  at last i could approach you with clean hands i could confess what i had done and since it seemed to me that i had made the utmost atonement i was confident of success alas i came too late in the porch of the auberge i met you as you came forth from my talkative intendant you had learnt already the story of that bargain into which bardelys had entered you had learnt who i was and you thought that you had learnt why i wooed you accordingly you could but despise me  she had sunk into a chair her hands were folded in a listless manner in her lap and her eyes were lowered her cheeks pale but the swift heave of her bosom told me that my words were not without effect do you know nothing of the bargain that i made with chatellerault she asked in a voice that held i thought some trace of misery  chatellerault was a cheat i cried no man of honour in france would have accounted himself under obligation to pay that wager i paid it not because i thought the payment due but that by its payment i might offer you a culminating proof of my sincerity  be that as it may said she i passed him my word toto marry him if he set you at liberty  the promise does not hold for when you made it i was at liberty already besides chatellerault is dead by nowor very near it  dead she echoed looking up  yes dead we fought the ghost of a smile of sudden of scornful understanding passed like a ray of light across her face pardieu i cried you do me a wrong there it was not by my hands that he fell it was not by me that the duel was instigated  and with that i gave her the whole details of the affair including the information that chatellerault had been no party to my release and that for his attempted judicial murder of me the king would have dealt very hardly with him had he not saved the king the trouble by throwing himself upon his sword  there was a silence when i had done roxalanne sat on and seemed to ponder to let all that i had said sink in and advocate my cause as to me was very clear it must i turned aside and moved to one of the windows  why did you not tell me before she asked suddenly whyoh whydid you not confess to me the whole infamous affair as soon as you came to love me as you say you did  as i say i did i repeated after her do you doubt it can you doubt it in the face of what i have done  oh i dont know what to believe she cried a sob in her voice you have deceived me so far so often why did you not tell me that night on the river or later when i pressed you in this very house or again the other night in the prison of toulouse  you ask me why can you not answer the question for yourself can you not conceive the fear that was in me that you should shrink away from me in loathing the fear that if you cared a little i might for all time stifle such affection as you bore me the fear that i must ruin your trust in me oh mademoiselle can you not see how my only hope lay in first owning defeat to chatellerault in first paying the wager  how could you have lent yourself to such a bargain was her next question  how indeed i asked in my turn from your mother you have heard something of the reputation that attaches to bardelys i was a man of careless ways satiated with all the splendours life could give me nauseated by all its luxuries was it wonderful that i allowed myself to be lured into this affair it promised some excitement a certain novelty difficulties in a path that i hadalasever found all too smoothfor chatellerault had made your reputed coldness the chief bolster of his opinion that i should not win  again i was not given to overnice scruples i make no secret of my infirmities but do not blame me too much if you could see the fine demoiselles we have in paris if you could listen to their tenets and take a deep look into their lives you would not marvel at me i had never known any but these on the night of my coming to lavedan your sweetness your pure innocence your almost childish virtue dazed me by their novelty from that first moment i became your slave then i was in your garden day by day and here in this old languedoc garden with you and your roses during the languorous days of my convalescence is it wonderful that some of the purity some of the sweetness that was of you and of your roses should have crept into my heart and cleansed it a little ah mademoiselle i criedand coming close to her i would have bent my knee in intercession but that she restrained me  monsieur she interrupted we harass ourselves in vain this can have but one ending  her tones were cold but the coldness i knew was forcedelse had she not said we harass ourselves instead of quelling my ardour it gave it fuel  true mademoiselle i cried almost exultantly it can end but one way  she caught my meaning and her frown deepened i went too fast it seemed  it had better end now monsieur there is too much between us you wagered to win me to wife she shuddered i could never forget it  mademoiselle i denied stoutly i did not  how she caught her breath you did not  no i pursued boldly i did not wager to win you i wagered to win a certain mademoiselle de lavedan who was unknown to mebut not you not you  she smiled with never so slight a touch of scorn  your distinctions are very finetoo fine for me monsieur  i implore you to be reasonable think reasonably  am i not reasonable do i not think but there is so much to think of she sighed you carried your deception so far you came here for instance as monsieur de lesperon why that duplicity  again mademoiselle i did not said i  she glanced at me with pathetic disdain  indeed indeed monsieur you deny things very bravely  did i tell you that my name was lesperon did i present myself to monsieur your father as lesperon  surelyyes  surely no a thousand times no i was the victim of circumstances in that and if i turned them to my own account after they had been forced upon me shall i be blamed and accounted a cheat whilst i was unconscious your father seeking for a clue to my identity made an inspection of my clothes  in the pocket of my doublet they found some papers addressed to rene de lesperonsome love letters a communication from the duc dorleans and a womans portrait from all of this it was assumed that i was that lesperon upon my return to consciousness your father greeted me effusively whereat i wondered he passed on to discussnay to tell me ofthe state of the province and of his own connection with the rebels until i lay gasping at his egregious temerity then when he greeted me as monsieur de lesperon i had the explanation of it but too late could i deny the identity then could i tell him that i was bardelys the favourite of the king himself what would have occurred i ask you mademoiselle would i not have been accounted a spy and would they not have made short work of me here at your chateau  no no they would have done no murder  perhaps not but i could not be sure just then most men situated as your father was would have despatched me ah mademoiselle have you not proofs enough do you not believe me now  yes monsieur she answered simply i believe you  will you not believe then in the sincerity of my love  she made no rely her face was averted but from her silence i took heart i drew close to her i set my hand upon the tall back of her chair and leaning towards her i spoke with passionate heat as must have melted i thought any woman who had not a loathing for me  mademoiselle i am a poor man now i ended i am no longer that magnificent gentleman whose wealth and splendour were a byword yet am i no needy adventurer i have a little property at beaugencya very spot for happiness mademoiselle paris shall know me no more at beaugency i shall live at peace in seclusion and so that you come with me in such joy as in all my life i have done nothing to deserve i have no longer an army of retainers a couple of men and a maid or two shall constitute our household yet i shall account my wealth well lost if for loves sake youll share with me the peace of my obscurity i am poor mademoiselle yet no poorer even now than that gascon gentleman rene de lesperon for whom you held me and on whom you bestowed the priceless treasure of your heart  oh might it have pleased god that you had remained that poor gascon gentleman she cried  in what am i different roxalanne  in that he had laid no wager she answered rising suddenly  my hopes were withering she was not angry she was pale and her gentle face was troubleddear god how sorely troubled to me it almost seemed that i had lost  she flashed me a glance of her blue eyes and i thought that tears impended  roxalanne i supplicated  but she recovered the control that for a moment she had appeared upon the verge of losing she put forth her hand  adieu monsieur said she  i glanced from her hand to her face her attitude began to anger me for i saw that she was not only resisting me but resisting herself in her heart the insidious canker of doubt persisted she knewor should have knownthat it no longer should have any place there yet obstinately she refrained from plucking it out there was that wager but for that same obstinacy she must have realized the reason of my arguments the irrefutable logic of my payment she denied me and in denying me she denied herself for that she had loved me she had herself told me and that she could love me again i was assured if she would but see the thing in the light of reason and of justice  roxalanne i did not come to lavedan to say goodbye to you i seek from you a welcome not a dismissal  yet my dismissal is all that i can give will you not take my hand may we not part in friendly spirit  no we may not for we do not part at all  it was as the steel of my determination striking upon the flint of hers she looked up to my face for an instant she raised her eyebrows in deprecation she sighed shrugged one shoulder and turning on her heel moved towards the door  anatole shall bring you refreshment ere you go she said in a very polite and formal voice  then i played my last card was it for nothing that i had flung away my wealth if she would not give herself by god i would compel her to sell herself and i took no shame in doing it for by doing it i was saving her and saving myself from a life of unhappiness  roxalanne i cried the imperiousness of my voice arrested and compelled her perhaps against her very will  monsieur said she as demurely as you please  do you know what you are doing  but yesperfectly  pardieu you do not i will tell you you are sending your father to the scaffold  she turned livid her step faltered and she leant against the frame of the doorway for support then she stared at me wideeyed in horror  that is not true she pleaded yet without conviction he is not in danger of his life they can prove nothing against him monsieur de sainteustache could find no evidence herenothing  yet there is monsieur de sainteustaches word there is the factthe significant factthat your father did not take up arms for the king to afford the chevaliers accusation some measure of corroboration at toulouse in these times they are not particular remember how it had fared with me but for the kings timely arrival  that smote home the last shred of her strength fell from her a great sob shook her then covering her face with her hands mother in heaven have pity on me she cried oh it cannot be it cannot be  her distress touched me sorely i would have consoled her i would have bidden her have no fear assuring her that i would save her father but for my own ends i curbed the mood i would use this as a cudgel to shatter her obstinacy and i prayed that god might forgive me if i did aught that a gentleman should account unworthy my need was urgent my love allengrossing winning her meant winning life and happiness and already i had sacrificed so much her cry rang still in my ears it cannot be it cannot be  i trampled my nascent tenderness underfoot and in its room i set a harshness that i did not feela harshness of defiance and menace  it can be it will be and as god lives it shall be if you persist in your unreasonable attitude  monsieur have mercy  yes when you shall be pleased to show me the way to it by having mercy upon me if i have sinned i have atoned but that is a closed question now to reopen it were futile take heed of this roxalanne there is one thingone only in all france can save your father  that is monsieur she inquired breathlessly  my word against that of sainteustache my indication to his majesty that your fathers treason is not to be accepted on the accusation of sainteustache my information to the king of what i know touching this gentleman  you will go monsieur she implored me oh you will save him mon dieu to think of the time that we have wasted here you and i whilst he is being carried to the scaffold oh i did not dream it was so perilous with him i was desolated by his arrest i thought of some months imprisonment perhaps but that he should die monsieur de bardelys you will save him say that you will do this for me  she was on her knees to me now her arms clasping my boots her eyes raised in entreatygod what entreatyto my own  rise mademoiselle i beseech you i said with a quiet i was far from feeling there is no need for this let us be calm the danger to your father is not so imminent we may have some days yetthree or four perhaps  i lifted her gently and led her to a chair i was hard put to it not to hold her supported in my arms but i might not cull that advantage from her distress a singular niceness you will say perhaps as in your scorn you laugh at me perhaps you are right to laughyet are you not altogether right  you will go to toulouse monsieur she begged  i took a turn in the room then halting before her yes i answered i will go  the gratitude that leapt to her eyes smote me hard for my sentence was unfinished  i will go i continued quickly when you shall have promised to become my wife  the joy passed from her face she glanced at me a moment as if without understanding  i came to lavedan to win you roxalanne and from lavedan i shall not stir until i have accomplished my design i said very quietly you will therefore see that it rests with you how soon i may set out  she fell to weeping softly but answered nothing at last i turned from her and moved towards the door  where are you going she cried  to take the air mademoiselle if upon deliberation you can bring yourself to marry me send me word by anatole or one of the others and i shall set out at once for toulouse  stop she cried obediently i stopped my hand already upon the doorknob you are cruel monsieur she complained  i love you said i by way of explaining it to be cruel seems to be the way of love you have been cruel to me  would youwould you take what is not freely given  i have the hope that when you see that you must give you will give freely  ifif i make you this promise  yes i was growing white with eagerness  you will fulfil your part of the bargain  it is a habit of mine mademoiselleas witnesses the case of chatellerault she shivered at the mention of his name it reminded her of precisely such another bargain that three nights ago she had made precisely did i say well not quite precisely  ii promise to marry you then said she in a choking voice whenever you choose after my father shall have been set at liberty  i bowed i shall start at once said i  and perhaps out of shame perhaps out ofwho shall say what sentimentsi turned without another word and left her     chapter xx the bravi at blagnac   i was glad to be in the open once moreglad of the movement as i rode at the head of my brave company along the bank of the garonne and in the shade of the golden autumntinted trees  i was in a measure angry with myself that i had driven such a bargain with roxalanne in a measure angry with her that she had forced me to it by her obstinacy a fine gentleman i on my soul to have dubbed chatellerault a cheat for having done no worse than i had now brought myself to do yet was it so no i assured myself it was not a thousand times no what i had done i had done as much to win roxalanne to me as to win her from her own unreasonableness in the days to come she should thank me for my harshness for that which now she perhaps accounted my unfairness  then again would i ask myself was i very sure of this and so the two questions were flung the one against the other my conscience divided itself into two parties and they waged a war that filled me with a depressing uncertainty  in the end shame was overthrown and i flung back my head with a snort of assurance i was doing no wrong on the contrary i was doing rightboth by myself and by roxalanne what matter that i was really cheating her what matter that i had said i would not leave lavedan until i had her promise whilst in reality i had hurled my threat at sainteustache that i would meet him at toulouse and passed my word to the vicomtesse that i would succour her husband  i gave no thought to the hidden threat with which sainteustache had retorted that from lavedan to toulouse was a distance of some twenty leagues had he been a man of sterner purposes i might have been uneasy and on my guard but sainteustache pshaw  it is ill to underestimate an enemy be he never so contemptible and for my disdain of the chevalier i might have paid dearly had not fortunewhich of late had been practising singular jests upon me after seemingly abandoning me returned to my aid at the last moment  it was sainteustaches purpose that i should never reach toulouse alive for in all the world i was the one man he feared the one man who would encompass his undoing and destruction by a word and so he had resolved and disposed that i should be removed and to accomplish this he had left a line of bravi along the road i was to pass  he had counted upon my lying the night in one of the intervening towns for the journey was overlong to be accomplished at a stretch and wherever i might chance to lie there i should have to reckon with his assassins the nearer toulousealthough i knew not thisthe thicker grew my danger into the very thick of it i rode in the very thick of it i lay and all that came of it was that i obtained possession of one more and overwhelming piece of evidence against my murderous chevalier but i outrun my story  it had been my purpose to change horses at grenade and so push on and reach toulouse that very night or in the early hours of the following morning at grenade however there were no horses to be obtained at least not more than three and so leaving the greater portion of my company behind i set out escorted only by gilles and antoine night had fallen long before we reached lespinasse and with it came foul weather the wind rose from the west grew to the violence of a hurricane and brought with it such a deluge of cold cutting rain as never had it been my illchance to ride through from lespinasse to fenouillet the road dips frequently and wherever this occurred it seemed to us that we were riding in a torrent our horses fetlockdeep in mud  antoine complained in groans gilles growled openly and went the length of begging me as we rode through the illpaved flooded streets of fenouillet to go no farther but i was adamant in my resolve soaked to the skin my clothes hanging sodden about me and chilled to the marrow though i was i set my chattering teeth and swore that we should not sleep until we reached toulouse  my god he groaned and we but halfway  forward was all i answered and so as midnight chimed we left fenouillet behind us and dashed on into the open country and the full fury of the tempest  my servants came after me upon their stumbling horses whining and cursing by turns and forgetting in their misery the respect that they were accustomed to pay me i think now that it was a providence that guided me had i halted at fenouillet as they would have had me do it is odds that this chronicle would never have been penned for likely enough i had had my throat cut as i slept a providence was it also that brought my horse down within a halfmile of blagnac and so badly did it founder that it might not be ridden farther  the beasts my men bestrode were in little better condition and so with infinite chagrin i was forced to acknowledge defeat and to determine that at blagnac we should lie for the remainder of the night after all it mattered little a couple of hours riding in the morning would bring us to toulouse and we would start betimes  i bade gilles dismounthe had been the louder in his complainingsand follow us afoot bringing my horse to the auberge de letoile at blagnac where he would await him then i mounted his jaded beast and accompanied by antoinethe last of my retainersi rode into blagnac and pulled up at the sign of the star  with my whip i smote the door and i had need to smite hard if i would be heard above the wind that shrieked and howled under the eaves of that narrow street yet it almost seemed as if some one were expected for scarce had my knocking ceased when the door was opened and the landlord stood there shading a taper with his hand for a moment i saw the glow of its light on his rosy whitebearded face then a gust of wind extinguished it  diable he swore an ugly night for travelling adding as an afterthought you ride late monsieur  you are a man of supreme discernment monsieur lhote said i testily as i pushed him aside and stepped into the passage will you keep me in the rain till daylight whilst you perpend how late i ride is your ostler abed see to those beasts yourself then afterwards get me foodfor me and for my man and beds for both of us  i have but one room monsieur he answered respectfully you shall have that and your servant shall sleep in the hayloft  my servant sleeps in my room if you have but one set a mattress on the floor for him is this a night to leave a dog to sleep in a hayloft i have another servant following he will be here in a few minutes you must find room for him alsoin the passage outside my door if no other accommodation be possible  but monsieur he began in a tone of protest which i set down to the way a landlord has of making difficulties that he shall be the better paid for such lodging as he finds us  see to it i ordered peremptorily you shall be well paid now go tend those horses  on the wall of the passage fell a warm reddish glow from the common room which argued a fire and this was too alluring to admit of my remaining longer in discussion with him i strode forward therefore the auberge de letoile was not an imposing hostelry nor one at which from choice i had made a halt this common room stank most vilely of oil of burning tallowfrom the smoky tapersand of i know not what other noisome unsavourinesses  as i entered i was greeted by a resonant snore from a man seated in a corner by the fire his head had fallen back displaying the brown sinewy neck and he sleptor seemed to sleepwith mouth wide open full length on the hearth and in the red glare of the burning logs lay what at first glance i took to be a heap of rags but which closer scrutiny showed me to be another man seemingly asleep also  i flung my sodden castor on the table i dropped my drenched cloak on the ground and stepped with heavy tread and a noisy rattle of spurs across the floor yet my ragged gentleman slept on i touched him lightly with my whip  hold mon bonhomme i cried to him still he did not move whereat i lost patience and caught him a kick full in the side so choicely aimed that first it doubled him up then brought him into a sitting posture with the snarl of a crossgrained dog that has been rudely aroused  from out of an evil dirty countenance a pair of gloomy bloodshot eyes scowled threateningly upon me the man on the chair awoke at the same instant and sat forward  eh bien said i to my friend on the hearth will you stir yourself  for whom he growled is not the etoile as much for me as for you whoever you may be  we have paid our lodging pardieu swore he of the chair  my masters said i grimly if you have not eyes to see my sodden condition and if you therefore have not the grace to move that i may approach the fire ill see to it that you spend the night not only a letoile but a la belle etoile with which pleasantry and a touch of the foot i moved my friend aside my tone was not nice nor do i generally have the air of promising more than i can fulfil  they were growling together in a corner when antoine came to draw off my doublet and my boots they were still growling when gilles joined us presently although at his coming they paused to take his measure with their eyes for gilles was something of a giant and men were wont to turn their headsaye and women tooto admire his fine proportions we suppedso vilely that i have not the heart to tell you what we ateand having supped i bade my host light me to my chamber as for my men i had determined that they should spend the night in the common room where there was a fire and wherenotwithstanding the company of those two ruffians into whose presence i had not troubled to inquirethey would doubtless be better than elsewhere in that poor hostelry  in gathering up my cloak and doublet and other effects to bear them off to the kitchen the host would have possessed himself also of my sword but with a laugh i took it from him remarking that it required no drying  as we mounted the stairs i heard something above me that sounded like the creaking of a door the host heard it also for he stood suddenly still his glance very questioning  what was that said he  the wind i should say i answered idly and my answer seemed to reassure him for with a ah yesthe wind he went on  now for all that i am far from being a man of tremors or unwarranted fears to tell the truth the hostelry of the star was beginning to fret my nerves i could scarce have told you why had you asked me as i sat upon the bed after mine host had left me and turned my thoughts to it it was none of the trivial incidents that had marked my coming but it was i think the combination of them all first there was the hosts desire to separate me from my men by suggesting that they should sleep in the hayloft clearly unnecessary when he was not averse to turning his common room into a dormitory there was his very evident relief when after announcing that i would have them sleep one in my room and one in the passage by my door i consented to their spending the night below there was the presence of those two very illlooking cutthroats there was the attempt to carry off my sword and lastly there was that creaking door and the hosts note of alarm  what was that  i stood up suddenly had my fancy dwelling upon that very incident tricked me into believing that a door had creaked again i listened but a silence followed broken only by a drone of voices ascending from the common room as i had assured the host upon the stairs so i now assured myself that it was the wind the signboard of the inn perhaps swaying in the storm  and then when i had almost dismissed my doubts and was about to divest myself of my remaining clothes i saw something at which i thanked heaven that i had not allowed the landlord to carry off my rapier my eyes were on the door and as i gazed i beheld the slow raising of the latch it was no delusion my wits were keen and my eyes sharp there was no fear to make me see things that were not softly i stepped to the bedrail where i had hung my sword by the baldrick and as softly i unsheathed it the door was pushed open and i caught the advance of a stealthy step a naked foot shot past the edge of the door into my room and for a second i thought of pinning it to the ground with my rapier then came a leg then a halfdressed body surmounted by a facethe face of rodenard  at sight of it amazement and a hundred suspicions crossed my mind how in gods name came he here and for what purpose did he steal so into my chamber  but my suspicions perished even as they were begotten there was so momentous so alarmingly warning a look on his face as he whispered the one word monseigneur that clearly if danger there was to me it was not from him  what the devil i began  but at the sound of my voice the alarm grew in his eyes  sh he whispered his finger on his lips be silent monseigneur for heavens sake  very softly he closed the door softly yet painfully he hobbled forward to my side  there is a plot to murder you monseigneur he whispered  what here at blagnac  he nodded fearfully  bah i laughed you rave man who was to know that i was to come this way and who is there to plot against my life  monsieur de sainteustache he answered  and for the rest as to expecting you here they did not but they were prepared against the remote chance of your coming from what i have gathered there is not a hostelry betwixt this and lavedan at which the chevalier has not left his cutthroats with the promise of enormous reward to the men who shall kill you  i caught my breath at that my doubts vanished  tell me what you know said i be brief  thereupon this faithful dog whom i had so sorely beaten but four nights ago told me how upon finding himself able to walk once more he had gone to seek me out that he might implore me to forgive him and not cast him off altogether after a lifetime spent in the service of my father and of myself  he had discovered from monsieur de castelroux that i was gone to lavedan and he determined to follow me thither he had no horse and little money and so he had set out afoot that very day and dragged himself as far as blagnac where however his strength had given out and he was forced to halt a providence it seemed that this had so befallen for here at the etoile he had that evening overheard sainteustache in conversation with those two bravi below stairs it would seem from what he had said that at every hostelry from grenade to toulouseat which it was conceivable that i might spend the nightthe chevalier had made a similar provision  at blagnac if i got so far without halting i must arrive very late and therefore the chevalier had bidden his men await me until daylight he did not believe however that i should travel so far for he had seen to it that i should find no horses at the posthouses but it was just possible that i might nevertheless push on and sainteustache would let no possibility be overlooked here at blagnac the landlord rodenard informed me was also in sainteustaches pay their intention was to stab me as i slept  monseigneur he ended knowing what danger awaited you along the road i have sat up all night praying god and his saints that you might come this far and that thus i might warn you had i been less bruised and sore i had got myself a horse and ridden out to meet you as it was i could but hope and pray that you would reach blagnac and that  i gathered him into my arms at that but my embrace drew a groan from him for the poor faithful knave was very sore  my poor ganymede i murmured and i was more truly moved to sympathy i think than ever i had been in all my selfish life hearing his sobriquet a look of hope gleamed suddenly in his eye  you will take me back monseigneur he pleaded you will take me back will you not i swear that i will never let my tongue  sh my good ganymede not only will i take you back but i shall strive to make amends for my brutality come my friend you shall have twenty golden louis to buy unguents for your poor shoulders  monseigneur is very good he murmured whereupon i would have embraced him again but that he shivered and drew back  no no monseigneur he whispered fearfully it is a great honour but itit pains me to be touched  then take the will for the deed and now for these gentlemen below stairs i rose and moved to the door  order gilles to beat their brains out was ganymedes merciful suggestion  i shook my head we might be detained for doing murder we have no proof yet of their intentionsi think an idea flashed suddenly across my mind go back to your room ganymede i bade him lock yourself in and do not stir until i call you i do not wish their suspicions aroused  i opened the door and as ganymede obediently slipped past me and vanished down the passage monsieur lhote i called ho there gilles  monsieur answered the landlord  monseigneur replied gilles and there came a stir below  is aught amiss the landlord questioned a note of concern in his voice  amiss i echoed peevishly mincing my words as i uttered them pardi must i be put to it to undress myself whilst those two lazy dogs of mine are snoring beneath me come up this instant gilles and i added as an afterthought you had best sleep here in my room  at once monseigneur answered he but i caught the faintest tinge of surprise in his accents for never yet had it fallen to the lot of sturdy clumsy gilles to assist me at my toilet  the landlord muttered something and i heard gilles whispering his reply then the stairs creaked under his heavy tread  in my room i told him in half a dozen words what was afoot for answer he swore a great oath that the landlord had mulled a stoup of wine for him which he never doubted now was drugged i bade him go below and fetch the wine telling the landlord that i too had a fancy for it  but what of antoine he asked they will drug him  let them we can manage this affair you and i without his help if they did not drug him they might haply stab him so that in being drugged lies his safety  as i bade him so he did and presently he returned with a great steaming measure this i emptied into a ewer then returned it to him that he might take it back to the host with my thanks and our appreciation thus should we give them confidence that the way was clear and smooth for them  thereafter there befell precisely that which already you will be expecting and nothing that you cannot guess it was perhaps at the end of an hours silent waiting that one of them came we had left the door unbarred so that his entrance was unhampered but scarce was he within when out of the dark on either side of him rose gilles and i before he had realized it he was lifted off his feet and deposited upon the bed without a cry the only sound being the tinkle of the knife that dropped from his suddenly unnerved hand  on the bed with gilless great knee in his stomach and gilless hands at his throat he was assured in unequivocal terms that at his slightest outcry we would make an end of him i kindled a light we trussed him hand and foot with the bedclothes and then whilst he lay impotent and silent in his terror i proceeded to discuss the situation with him  i pointed out that we knew that what he had done he had done at sainteustaches instigation therefore the true guilt was sainteustaches and upon him alone the punishment should fall but ere this could come to pass he himself must add his testimony to oursmine and rodenards if he would come to toulouse and do that make a full confession of how he had been set to do this murderingthe chevalier de sainteustache who was the real culprit should be the only one to suffer the penalty of the law if he would not do that why then he must stand the consequences himselfand the consequences would be the hangman but in either case he was coming to toulouse in the morning  it goes without saying that he was reasonable i never for a moment held his judgment in doubt there is no loyalty about a cutthroat and it is not the way of his calling to take unnecessary risk  we had just settled the matter in a mutually agreeable manner when the door opened again and his confederaterendered uneasy no doubt by his long absencecame to see what could be occasioning this unconscionable delay in the slitting of the throats of a pair of sleeping men  beholding us there in friendly conclave and no doubt considering that under the circumstances his intrusion was nothing short of an impertinence that polite gentleman uttered a crywhich i should like to think was an apology for having disturbed us and turned to go with most indecorous precipitancy  but gilles took him by the nape of his dirty neck and haled him back into the room in less time than it takes me to tell of it he lay beside his colleague and was being asked whether he did not think that he might also come to take the same view of the situation overjoyed that we intended no worse by him he swore by every saint in the calendar that he would do our will that he had reluctantly undertaken the chevaliers business that he was no cutthroat but a poor man with a wife and children to provide for  and that in short was how it came to pass that the chevalier de sainteustache himself by disposing for my destruction disposed only for his own with these two witnesses and rodenard to swear how sainteustache had bribed them to cut my throat with myself and gilles to swear how the attempt had been made and frustrated i could now go to his majesty with a very full confidence not only of having the chevaliers accusations against whomsoever they might be discredited but also of sending the chevalier himself to the gallows he had so richly earned     chapter xxi louis the just   for me said the king these depositions were not necessary your word my dear marcel would have sufficed for the courts however perhaps it is well that you have had them taken moreover they form a valuable corroboration of the treason which you lay to the charge of monsieur de sainteustache  we were standingat least la fosse and i were standing louis xiii satin a room of the palace of toulouse where i had had the honour of being brought before his majesty la fosse was there because it would seem that the king had grown fond of him and could not be without him since his coming to toulouse  his majesty was as usual so dull and wearynot even roused by the approaching trial of montmorency which was the main business that had brought him south that even the company of this vapid shallow but irrepressibly goodhumoured la fosse with his everlasting mythology proved a thing desirable  i will see said louis that your friend the chevalier is placed under arrest at once and as much for his attempt upon your life as for the unstable quality of his political opinions the law shall deal with himconclusively he sighed it always pains me to proceed to extremes against a man of his stamp to deprive a fool of his head seems a work of supererogation  i inclined my head and smiled at his pleasantry louis the just rarely permitted himself to jest and when he did his humour was as like unto humour as water is like unto wine still when a monarch jests if you are wise if you have a favour to sue or a position at court to seek or to maintain you smile for all that the ineptitude of his witless wit be rather provocative of sorrow  nature needs meddling with at times hazarded la fosse from behind his majestys chair this sainteustache is a sort of pandoras box which it is well to close ere  go to the devil said the king shortly we are not jesting we have to do justice  ah justice murmured la fosse i have seen pictures of the lady she covers her eyes with a bandage but is less discreet where the other beauties of her figure are in question  his majesty blushed he was above all things a chasteminded man modest as a nun to the immodesty rampant about him he was in the habit of closing his eyes and his ears until the flagrancy or the noise of it grew to proportions to which he might remain neither blind nor deaf  monsieur de la fosse said he in an austere voice you weary me and when people weary me i send them awaywhich is one of the reasons why i am usually so much alone i beg that you will glance at that huntingbook so that when i have done with monsieur de bardelys you may give me your impressions of it  la fosse fell back obedient but unabashed and moving to a table by the window he opened the book louis had pointed out  now marcel while that buffoon prepares to inform me that the book has been inspired by diana herself tell me what else you have to tell  naught else sire  how naught what of this vicomte de lavedan  surely your majesty is satisfied that there is no chargeno heedful charge against him  aye but there is a chargea very heedful one and so far you have afforded me no proofs of his innocence to warrant my sanctioning his enlargement  i had thought sire that it would be unnecessary to advance proofs of his innocence until there were proofs of his guilt to be refuted it is unusual your majesty to apprehend a gentleman so that he may show cause why he did not deserve such apprehension the more usual course is to arrest him because there are proofs of his guilt to be preferred against him  louis combed his beard pensively and his melancholy eyes grew thoughtful  a nice point marcel said he and he yawned a nice point you should have been a lawyer then with an abrupt change of manner do you give me your word of honour that he is innocent he asked sharply  if your majestys judges offer proof of his guilt i give you my word that i will tear that proof to pieces  that is not an answer do you swear his innocence  do i know what he carries in his conscience quoth i still fencing with the question how can i give my word in such a matter ah sire it is not for nothing that they call you louis the just i pursued adopting cajolery and presenting him with his own favourite phrase you will never allow a man against whom there is no shred of evidence to be confined in prison  is there not he questioned yet his tone grew gentler history he had promised himself should know him as louis the just and he would do naught that might jeopardize his claim to that proud title there is the evidence of this sainteustache  would your majesty hang a dog upon the word of that double traitor  hum you are a great advocate marcel you avoid answering questions you turn questions aside by counterquestions he seemed to be talking more to himself than tome you are a much better advocate than the vicomtes wife for instance she answers questions and has a temperciel what a temper  you have seen the vicomtesse i exclaimed and i grew cold with apprehension knowing as i did the licence of that womans tongue  seen her he echoed whimsically i have seen her heard her wellnigh felt her the air of this room is still disturbed as a consequence of her presence she was here an hour ago  and it seemed lisped la fosse turning from his huntingbook as if the three daughters of acheron had quitted the domain of pluto to take embodiment in a single woman  i would not have seen her the king resumed as though la fosse had not spoken but she would not be denied i heard her voice blaspheming in the antechamber when i refused to receive her there was a commotion at my door it was dashed open and the swiss who held it was hurled into my room here as though he had been a mannikin dieu since i have reigned in france i have not been the centre of so much commotion she is a strong woman marcel the saints defend you hereafter when she shall come to be your motherinlaw in all france ill swear her tongue is the only stouter thing than her arm but shes a fool  what did she say sire i asked in my anxiety  say she sworeciel how she did swear not a saint in the calendar would she let rest in peace she dragged them all by turns from their chapterrolls to bear witness to the truth of what she said  that was  that her husband was the foulest traitor out of hell but that he was a fool with no wit of his own to make him accountable for what he did and that out of folly he had gone astray upon those grounds she besought me to forgive him and let him go when i told her that he must stand his trial and that i could offer her but little hope of his acquittal she told me things about myself which in my conceit and thanks to you flatterers who have surrounded me i had never dreamed  she told me i was ugly sourfaced and malformed that i was priestridden and a fool unlike my brother who she assured me is a mirror of chivalry and manly perfections she promised me that heaven should never receive my soul though i told my beads from now till doomsday and she prophesied for me a welcome among the damned when my time comes what more she might have foretold i cannot say she wearied me at last for all her novelty and i dismissed herthat is to say he amended i ordered four musketeers to carry her out god pity you marcel when you become her daughters husband  but i had no heart to enter into his jocularity this woman with her ungovernable passion and her rash tongue had destroyed everything  i see no likelihood of being her daughters husband i answered mournfully  the king looked up and laughed down on your knees then said he and render thanks to heaven  but i shook my head very soberly to your majesty it is a pleasing comedy said i but to me helas it is nearer far to tragedy  come marcel said he may i not laugh a little one grows so sad with being king of france tell me what vexes you  mademoiselle de lavedan has promised that she will marry me only when i have saved her father from the scaffold i came to do it very full of hope sire but his wife has forestalled me and seemingly doomed him irrevocably  his glance fell his countenance resumed its habitual gloom then he looked up again and in the melancholy depths of his eyes i saw a gleam of something that was very like affection  you know that i love you marcel he said gently were you my own son i could not love you more you are a profligate dissolute knave and your scandals have rung in my ears more than once yet you are different from these other fools and at least you have never wearied me to have done that is to have done something i would not lose you marcel as lose you i shall if you marry this rose of languedoc for i take it that she is too sweet a flower to let wither in the stale atmosphere of courts this man this vicomte de lavedan has earned his death why should i not let him die since if he dies you will not wed  do you ask me why sire said i because they call you louis the just and because no king was ever more deserving of the title  he winced he pursed his lips and shot a glance at la fosse who was deep in the mysteries of his volume then he drew towards him a sheet of paper and taking a quill he sat toying with it  because they call me the just i must let justice take its course he answered presently  but i objected with a sudden hope the course of justice cannot lead to the headsman in the case of the vicomte de lavedan  why not and his solemn eyes met mine across the table  because he took no active part in the revolt if he was a traitor he was no more than a traitor at heart and until a man commits a crime in deed he is not amenable to the laws rigour his wife has made his defection clear but it were unfair to punish him in the same measure as you punish those who bore arms against you sire  ah he pondered well what more  is that not enough sire i cried my heart beat quickly and my pulses throbbed with the suspense of that portentous moment  he bent his head dipped his pen and began to write  what punishment would you have me mete out to him he asked as he wrote come marcel deal fairly with me and deal fairly with himfor as you deal with him so shall i deal with you through him  i felt myself paling in my excitement there is banishment sireit is usual in cases of treason that are not sufficiently flagrant to be punished by death  yes he wrote busily banishment for how long marcel for his lifetime  nay sire that were too long  for my lifetime then  again that were too long  he raised his eyes and smiled ah you turn prophet well for how long then come man  i should think five years  five years be it say no more  he wrote on for a few moments then he raised the sandbox and sprinkled the document  tiens he cried as he dusted it and held it out to me there is my warrant for the disposal of monsieur le vicomte leon de lavedan he is to go into banishment for five years but his estates shall suffer no sequestration and at the end of that period he may return and enjoy themwe hope with better loyalty than in the past get them to execute that warrant at once and see that the vicomte starts today under escort for spain it will also be your warrant to mademoiselle de lavedan and will afford proof to her that your mission has been successful  sire i cried and in my gratitude i could say no more but i sank on my knee before him and raised his hand to my lips  there said he in a fatherly voice go now and be happy  as i rose he suddenly put up his hand  ma foi i had all but forgotten so much has monsieur de lavedans fate preoccupied us he picked up another paper from his table and tossed it to me it was my note of hand to chatellerault for my picardy estates  chatellerault died this morning the king pursued he had been asking to see you but when he was told that you had left toulouse he dictated a long confession of his misdeeds which he sent to me together with this note of yours he could not he wrote permit his heirs to enjoy your estates he had not won them he had really forfeited his own stakes since he had broken the rules of play he has left me to deliver judgment in the matter of his own lands passing into your possession what do you say to it marcel  it was almost with reluctance that i took up that scrap of paper it had been so fine and heroic a thing to have cast my wealth to the winds of heaven for loves sake that on my soul i was loath to see myself master of more than beaugency then a compromise suggested itself  the wager sire said i is one that i take shame in having entered upon that shame made me eager to pay it although fully conscious that i had not lost but even now i cannot in any case accept the forfeit chatellerault was willing to suffer shall weshall we forget that the wager was ever laid  the decision does you honour it was what i had hoped from you go now marcel i doubt me you are eager when your lovesickness wanes a little we shall hope to see you at court again  i sighed helas sire that would be never  so you said once before monsieur it is a foolish spirit upon which to enter into matrimony yetlike many folliesa fine one adieu marcel  adieu sire  i had kissed his hands i had poured forth my thanks i had reached the door already and he was in the act of turning to la fosse when it came into my head to glance at the warrant he had given me he noticed this and my sudden halt  is aught amiss he asked  youyou have omitted something sire i ventured and i returned to the table i am already so grateful that i hesitate to ask an additional favour yet it is but troubling you to add a few strokes of the pen and it will not materially affect the sentence itself  he glanced at me and his brows drew together as he sought to guess my meaning  well man what is it he demanded impatiently  it has occurred to me that this poor vicomte in a strange land alone among strange faces missing the loved ones that for so many years he has seen daily by his side will be pitiably lonely  the kings glance was lifted suddenly to my face must i then banish his family as well  all of it will not be necessary your majesty  for once his eyes lost their melancholy and as hearty a burst of laughter as ever i heard from that poor weary gentleman he vented then  ciel what a jester you are ah but i shall miss you he cried as seizing the pen he added the word i craved of him  are you content at last he asked returning the paper to me  i glanced at it the warrant now stipulated that madame la vicomtesse de lavedan should bear her husband company in his exile  sire you are too good i murmured  tell the officer to whom you entrust the execution of this warrant that he will find the lady in the guardroom below where she is being detained pending my pleasure did she but know that it was your pleasure she has been waiting upon i should tremble for your future when the five years expire     chapter xxii we unsaddle   mademoiselle held the royal warrant of her fathers banishment in her hand she was pale and her greeting of me had been timid i stood before her and by the door stood rodenard whom i had bidden attend me  as i had approached lavedan that day i had been taken with a great an overwhelming shame at the bargain i had driven i had pondered and it had come to me that she had been right to suggest that in matters of love what is not freely given it is not worth while to take and out of my shame and that conclusion had sprung a new resolve so that nothing might weaken it and lest after all the sight of roxalanne should bring me so to desire her that i might be tempted to override my purpose i had deemed it well to have the restraint of a witness at our last interview to this end had i bidden ganymede follow me into the very salon  she read the document to the very end then her glance was raised timidly again to mine and from me it shifted to ganymede stiff at his post by the door  this was the best that you could do monsieur she asked at last  the very best mademoiselle i answered calmly i do not wish to magnify my service but it was that or the scaffold madame your mother had unfortunately seen the king before me and she had prejudiced your fathers case by admitting him to be a traitor there was a moment when in view of that i was almost led to despair i am glad however mademoiselle that i was so fortunate as to persuade the king to just so much clemency  and for five years then i shall not see my parents she sighed and her distress was very touching  that need not be though they may not come to france it still remains possible for you to visit them in spain  true she mused that will be somethingwill it not  assuredly something under the circumstances much  she sighed again and for a moment there was silence  will you not sit monsieur said she at last she was very quiet today this little maidvery quiet and very wondrously subdued  there is scarce the need i answered softly whereupon her eyes were raised to ask a hundred questions you are satisfied with my efforts mademoiselle i inquired  yes i am satisfied monsieur  that was the end i told myself and involuntarily i also sighed still i made no shift to go  you are satisfied that ithat i have fulfilled what i promised  her eyes were again cast down and she took a step in the direction of the window  but yes your promise was to save my father from the scaffold you have done so and i make no doubt you have done as much to reduce the term of his banishment as lay within your power yes monsieur i am satisfied that your promise has been well fulfilled  heigho the resolve that i had formed in coming whispered it in my ear that nothing remained but to withdraw and go my way yet not for all that resolvenot for a hundred such resolvescould i have gone thus one kindly word one kindly glance at least would i take to comfort me i would tell her in plain words of my purpose and she should see that there was still some good some sense of honour in me and thus should esteem me after i was gone  ganymede said i  monseigneur  bid the men mount  at that she turned wonder opening her eyes very wide and her glance travelled from me to rodenard with its unspoken question but even as she looked at him he bowed and turning to do my bidding left the room we heard his steps pass with a jingle of spurs across the hall and out into the courtyard we heard his raucous voice utter a word of command and there was a stamping of hoofs a cramping of harness and all the bustle of preparation  why have you ordered your men to mount she asked at last  because my business here is ended and we are going  going said she her eyes were lowered now but a frown suggested their expression to me going whither  hence i answered that for the moment is all that signifies i paused to swallow something that hindered a clear utterance then adieu said i and i abruptly put forth my hand  her glance met mine fearlessly if puzzled  do you mean monsieur that you are leaving lavedanthus  so that i leave what signifies the manner of my going  butthe trouble grew in her eyes her cheeks seemed to wax paler than they had beenbut i thought thatthat we made a bargain  sh mademoiselle i implore you i cried i take shame at the memory of it almost as much shame as i take at the memory of that other bargain which first brought me to lavedan the shame of the former one i have wiped outalthough perchance you think it not i am wiping out the shame of the latter one it was unworthy in me mademoiselle but i loved you so dearly that it seemed to me that no matter how i came by you i should rest content if i but won you i have since seen the error if it the injustice of it i will not take what is not freely given and so farewell  i see i see she murmured and ignored the hand that i held out i am very glad of it monsieur  i withdrew my hand sharply i took up my hat from the chair on which i had cast it she might have spared me that i thought she need not have professed joy at least she might have taken my hand and parted in kindness  adieu mademoiselle i said again as stiffly as might be and i turned towards the door  monsieur she called after me i halted  mademoiselle  she stood demurely with eyes downcast and hands folded i shall be so lonely here  i stood still i seemed to stiffen my heart gave a mad throb of hope then seemed to stop what did she mean i faced her fully once more and i doubt not i was very pale yet lest vanity should befool me i dared not act upon suspicions and so true mademoiselle said i you will be lonely i regret it  as silence followed i turned again to the door and my hopes sank with each step in that direction  monsieur  her voice arrested me upon the very threshold  what shall a poor girl do with this great estate upon her hands it will go to ruin without a man to govern it  you must not attempt the task you must employ an intendant  i caught something that sounded oddly like a sob could it be dieu could it be after all yet i would not presume i half turned again but her voice detained me it came petulantly now  monsieur de bardelys you have kept your promise nobly will you ask no payment  no mademoiselle i answered very softly i can take no payment  her eyes were lifted for a second their blue depths seemed dim then they fell again  oh why will you not help me she burst out to add more softly i shall never be happy without you  you mean i gasped retracing a step and flinging my hat in a corner  that i love you marcelthat i want you  and you can forgiveyou can forgive i cried as i caught her  her answer was a laugh that bespoke her scorn of everythingof everything save us two of everything save our love that and the pout of her red lips was her answer and if the temptation of those lipsbut there i grow indiscreet  still holding her i raised my voice  ganymede i called  monseigneur came his answer through the open window  bid those knaves dismount and unsaddle
