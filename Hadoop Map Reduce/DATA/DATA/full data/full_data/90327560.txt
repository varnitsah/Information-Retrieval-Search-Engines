90327560	the island queen by rm ballantyne    chapter one  dethroned by fire and watera tale of the southern hemisphere  the open boat  early one morning in the year 18 hundred and something the great southern ocean was in one of its calmest moods insomuch that the cloudlets in the blue vault above were reflected with almost perfect fidelity in the blue hemisphere below and it was barely possible to discern the dividingline between water and sky  the only objects within the circle of the horizon that presented the appearance of solidity were an albatross sailing in the air and a little boat floating on the sea  the boat rested on its own reflected image almost motionless save when a slight undulation of the water caused the lower edge of its reflection to break off in oily patches but there was no dip of oars at its sides no rowers on its thwarts no guiding hand at the helm  evidently the albatross regarded the boat with curiosity not unmixed with suspicion for it sailed in wide circles round it with outstretched neck head turned on one side and an eye bent inquiringly downward  by slow degrees the circles diminished until the giant bird floated almost directly over the boat  then apparently it saw more than enough to satisfy its curiosity for uttering a hoarse cry it swooped aside and with a flap of its mighty wings made off towards the horizon where it finally disappeared  the flap and the cry seemed however to have put life into the little boat for a human head rose slowly above the gunwale  it was that of a youth of about twenty years of age apparently in the last stage of exhaustion  he looked round slowly with a dazed expression like one who only half awakes from sleep  drawing his hand across his brow and gazing wistfully on the calm sea he rose on his knees with difficulty and rested his arms on a thwart while he turned his gaze with a look of intense anxiety on the countenance of a young girl who lay in the bottom of the boat close beside him asleep or dead  it looks like death murmured the youth as he bent over the pale face his expression betraying sudden alarm and it mustit must come to this soon yet i cannot bear the thought  o god spare her  it seemed as if the prayer were answered at once for a fluttering sigh escaped from the girls bloodless lips but she did not awake  ah sleep on dear sister said the youth it is all the comfort that is left to you now  oh for food  how often i have wasted it thought lightly of it grumbled because it was not quite to my taste  what would i not give for a little of it nowa very little  he turned his head away from the sleeping girl and a wolfish glare seemed to shoot from his eyes as they rested on something which lay in the stern of the boat  there were other human beings in that boat besides the youth and his sistersome still living some dead for they had been many days on short allowance and the last four days in a state of absolute starvationall save pauline rigonda and her little brother otto whose fair curly head rested on his sisters arm  during the last two nights when all was still and the starving sailors were slumbering or attempting to slumber dominick rigondathe youth whom we have just introduced to the readerhad placed a small quantity of broken biscuit in the hands of his sister and little brother with a stern though whispered command to eat it secretly and in silence  obediently they ate or rather devoured their small portion wondering where their brother had found it  perchance they might have relished it less if they had known that dominick had saved it off his own too scant allowance when he saw that the little store in the boat was drawing to an endsaved it in the hope of being able to prolong the lives of pauline and otto  this reserve however had been also exhausted and it seemed as if the last ray of hope had vanished from dominicks breast on the calm morning on which our tale opens  as we have said the youth glared at something lying in the stern of the boat  it was a tarpaulin which covered a human form  dominick knew that it was a dead bodythat of the cabinboy who had died during the night with his head resting on dominicks arm  the two men who lay sleeping in the bow knew nothing of his death and they were so weak from exhaustion at the time the boy died that dominick had thought it unnecessary to rouse them  the poor boys emaciated frame could lie till morning he thought and then the sleepers would assist him to put it gently into the sea  but when morning came the pangs of hunger assailed the selfdenying youth with terrible power and a horrible thought occurred to him  he opened a large claspknife and creeping towards the body removed the tarpaulin  a faint smile rested on the dead lipsthe same smile that had moved them when dominick promised to carry the boys last loving message to his mother if he should survive  he dropped the knife with a convulsive shudder and turned his eyes on his sleeping sister and brother  then he thought as he picked up the knife again how small an amount of food would suffice to keep these two alive for a few days longer and surely a sail must come in sight at last they had waited for it expectingly so long  suddenly the youth flung the knife away from him with violence and endeavoured with all his might to lift the body of the boy  in the days of his strength he could have raised it with one hand  now he strove and energised for many minutes before he succeeded in raising it to the gunwale  at last with a mighty effort he thrust it overboard and it fell into the sea with a heavy plunge  the noise aroused the two men in the bow who raised themselves feebly it was to them an all too familiar sound  day by day they had heard it as one and another of their comrades had been committed to the deep one of the men managed to stand up but as he swayed about and gazed at dominick inquiringly he lost his balance and being too weak to recover himself fell over the side  he reappeared for a moment with outstretched arms and hands clutching towards the boat  then he sank to be seen no more  the other man who had been his intimate friend and messmate made a frantic effort to save him  his failure to do so seemed to be more than the poor fellow could bear for he sprang up with the wild laugh and the sudden strength of a maniac and leaped into the sea  dominick could do nothing to prevent this  while staring at the little patch of foam where the two men had gone down he was startled by the sound of his sisters voice  are they all gone brother she asked in a low horrified tone  allall sister  only you and otto and i left  how soundly the poor boy sleeps  i wish it might please god to let him die thus said pauline with a weary sigh that told eloquently of hope deferred  your wish may be granted returned dominick for the dear boy seems to be sinking  it can scarcely i think be natural sleep that prevented the shout of that poor fellow from arousing him  but lie down again pauline sleep may do you a little good if you can obtain it and i will watch  and pray suggested the poor girl as she lay down again languidly  yes i will pray  surely a sail must appear soon  dominick rigonda was strong in youthful hope even in that hour of sorest trial but he was not strong in faith  he prayed however and found his faith strengthened in the act for he looked up immediately after with a feeling amounting almost to certainty that the longexpected and wishedfor sail would greet his eyes  but no sail was visible in all the unbroken circle of his horizon  still the faith which had prompted the eager gaze did not quite evaporate  after the first shock of disappointment at his prayer not being answered according to its tenor his assurance that god would yet send relief returned in some degree and he was not altogether disappointed though the answer came at last in a way that he did not expect  after sitting in a halfsleeping condition for some time he aroused himself and crept with considerable difficulty to the bow to procure the blanket which had covered the two men who had just perished  a corner of the blanket had caught on the end of one of the floorplanks in disengaging it dominick chanced to raise the plank which was loose and observed something like a bundle lying underneath  curiosity prompted him to examine it  he found that it was wrapped in canvas and carefully tied with cord  opening it he discovered to his surprise and intense joy that it contained some ships biscuit a piece of boiled pork and a flask of water  only those who have been suddenly presented with food and drink while starving can appreciate the feelings that filled the heart of the poor youth with laughter and thanksgiving but his joy was not selfish for the prospect of immediate personal relief had but a secondary place in his thoughts  hastening with the inestimable treasure to the place where his brother and sister lay he carefully spread it out on a piece of sailcloth and cut a few thin slices of the pork before arousing them  awake sister and eat he said at last gently shaking pauline by the shoulder  o dominick she exclaimed raising herself and gazing eagerly at the food  i was dreaming of this when you awoke me  thats odd now said little otto who had also been aroused for i was dreaming of eating  and i am so hung  he got no further for having clutched a handful of biscuit he suddenly stopped the way of utterance  how good of you dom said pauline eating with as much relish though not with such voracity as her little brother where did you get this  no matter eat and be thankful said dominick curtly for he was himself eating with wolfish haste by that time  he restrained himself however after a few minutes  hold  we must not indulge too freely  it will hurt us after fasting so long  besides this supply is very small and must be made to last as long as possible  no my boy you must eat no more at this time but you may drink a little  about a tablespoonful of water was measured out to each and then the remainder of the food was carefully wrapped up and put away  do you think that this supply was hidden by one of the poor fellows who left us this morning asked pauline  i think so and no doubt his motive was a good one  you know he was very fond of his messmate  i should think he saved up his allowance to help him but whatever the motive it has proved a blessing to us  he ceased speaking for both sister and little brother had drooped their weary heads and were again in a heavy slumber  dominick himself felt intensely the desire to follow their example but he resisted it feeling that it was his duty to watch for the longexpected sail that never appeared  at first his efforts were successful but by degrees the tendency to sleep became so overpowering that his struggles were unavailing  sense of duty and every other motive gave way before it his head finally dropped forward and with a heavy sigh of contentment he followed his brother and sister to the land of nod  profound prolonged and refreshing was that sweet slumber after the first good meal these poor castaways had eaten for many days  the weather fortunately continued bright and warm so that they did not suffer so much from exposure as on previous days and the gentle rocking of the boat tended to deepen and prolong their repose  thus they floated peacefully during the greater part of that daythe one solitary speck on the surface of the great ocean for the albatross seemed to have finally forsaken them  towards noon a light westerly breeze sprang up  it was not sufficient to raise a sea or disturb the sleepers but in conjunction with ocean currents it drifted them to the southeast at a considerable rate so that in the evening without the aid of oar or sail they were far from the spot upon the sea where we introduced them to the reader  at last dominick awoke with a longdrawn sigh and raising his head looked over the side of the boat  an exclamation of surprise and joy broke from him for there like a speck where something like a heavy bank of clouds rested on the horizon was the longexpected sail  his first impulse was to awaken the sleepers but he checked himself he would look more carefully  his eyes might be deceiving him and the disappointment if he should be mistaken would be overwhelming  he would spare them that  rising to his feet he shaded his eyes with one hand and gazed long and earnestly  the longer he looked however and the more he rubbed his eyes the more convinced was he that a vessel was really in sight  pauline he said at length with suppressed emotion as he gently shook her arm see god has answered our prayers a vessel is in sight  the poor girl raised herself quickly with an exclamation of thankfulness and gazed intently in the direction pointed out  it is surely it is a ship she said butbutdont you think there is something curious about its appearance  i have indeed been puzzled during the last few minutes replied dominick  it seems as if there were something strange under her and her position too is rather oddho  otto rouse up my boy and look at the vessel coming to save us  your eyes are sharp  say dyou see anything strange about her  thus appealed to otto who felt greatly refreshed by his good meal and long sleep sat up and also gazed at the vessel in question  no dom he said at length i dont see much the matter with her except that she leans over on one side a good deal and theres something black under and around her  can it be a squall that has struck her said pauline  squalls you know make ships lie over very much at times and cause the sea round them to look very dark  it may be so returned dominick doubtfully  but we shall soon see for a squall wont take very long to bring her down to us  they watched the approaching vessel with intense eagerness but did not again speak for a considerable time  anxiety and doubt kept them silent  there was the danger that the vessel might fail to observe them and as their oars had been washed away they had no means of hoisting a flag of distress  then there was the unaccountable something about the vessels appearance which puzzled and filled them with uncertainty  at last they drew so near that dominick became all too well aware of what it was and a sinking of the heart kept him still silent for a time  brother said pauline at last in a sad voice as she turned her dark eyes on dominick i fear it is only a wreck  you are right he replied gloomily a wreck on a barren shore too not a scrap of vegetation on it as far as i can seea mere sandbank currents are carrying us towards it and have led us to fancy that the vessel was moving  he spoke with bitterness for the disappointment was very great and physical weakness had rendered him less able to bear it than he might otherwise have been  dont get grumpy dom said otto with a slightly humorous look that was peculiar to hima look which had not lighted up his eyes for many days past  i wont get grumpy returned dominick with sudden energy patting the boys head  it is quite clear that a good feed and a long rest were all you required to set up your plucky little spirit again  dom said pauline who had been looking intently at the wreck is there not something like a line of white close to the wreck  ay there is replied dominick his countenance again becoming grave it is a line of breakers through which it will be very difficult to steer our little boat  steer dom exclaimed otto with a look of surprise how can you talk of steering at all without oar or helm  i must make one of the floorplanks do for both returned dominick  i say continued the boy im horribly hungry  maynt i have just a bite or two more  stay im thinking replied the other  think fast then please for the wolf inside of me is howling  the result of dominicks thinking was that he resolved to consume as much of their stock of provisions as possible in one meal in order to secure all the strength that was available by such means and thus fit them for the coming struggle with the surf  for said he if we get capsized far from the shore we have no chance of reaching it by swimming in our present weak condition  our only plan is to get up all the strength we can by means of food  so here goes  he untied the bundle as he spoke and spread the contents on his knees ottowho was indeed a plucky little fellow and either did not realise or did not fear the danger that lay before himcommenced to eat with almost jovial avidity  indeed all three showed that they had benefited greatly by what they had already eaten and now for the first time during many days consumed what they considered a full and satisfactory meal while they drifted slowly but steadily towards the land  as they neared it the heavy mass on the horizon which they had taken for a bank of clouds became more distinct  a light haze cleared away and showed it to be an island to which the sandbank formed a barrier reef but any interest that might have been aroused by this discovery was absorbed by present anxiety for the white and gleaming surf warned them that a serious and critical moment in their lives was fast approaching  pauline was awed into silence and even ottos countenance became gradually solemnised    chapter two  wrecked on a reef  the coral reefs which in various shapes and sizes stud the southern seas are sometimes rendered almost unapproachable by the immense waves which fall upon them  even in the calmest weather these huge breakers may be seen falling with prolonged roar on the beach  the lightest undulation on the sea which might almost escape observation away from land takes the form of a grand quiet billow as it draws near to an islet or reef and finally coming majestically on like a wall of rolling crystal breaks the silence suddenly by its thunderous fall and gives to the sands a temporary fringe of pure white foam  to ride in on the crest of one such roller on a piece of board and leap upon the shore is a feat peculiar to south sea islanders who are trained to the water from earliest infancy  to do the same thing in a small boat without oars without strength without experience almost without courage is a feat that no south sea islander would attempt and the necessity for performing which might cause the hair of any islanders head to stand on end  that dominick rigondas hair did not stand on end as he sat there with pale cheeks and compressed lips was probably due to the fact that he had thrust his straw hat tightly down on his brows  as the boat drew nearer to the reef both pauline and otto had risen in the strength of their hearty meal and were now seated on the thwarts of the boat  their brother had selected the thickest floorplank and cut it roughly into the form of an oar with a claspknife  he now sat with it over the stern sculling gentlyvery gently however for he reserved the little strength that remained to him for the critical moment  the undulations of the sea which had rocked them hitherto so softly had by that time assumed a decided form and force so that the boat rose on the oily back of each billow that passed under it and slid back into a watery hollow to be relifted by each successive wave  you look very anxious said pauline clasping her hands on her knee and gazing earnestly in her brothers face  i cannot help it returned dominick curtly  is our danger then so great  dominick only half admitted that it was  he did not wish to alarm her and tried to smile as he said that the struggle would be briefit would soon be over  but tell me where lies the danger persisted pauline  i do not quite see it  where ignorance is bliss dear tis folly to be wise returned dominick with an unsuccessful effort to look more at ease  nay brother but i am not ignorant that danger existsonly ignorant as to the amount and nature of it  surely there cannot be much risk in pushing our boat through that white foam that lines the shore with so soft a fringe  i should think not broke in the pert and inexperienced otto why pina thus he abridged his sisters name theres as much danger i should think in pushing through a tub of soapsuds  come dom returned the girl explain it to me for if you dont point out where the danger really lies if you leave me in this state of partial ignorance i shall be filled with alarm instead of bliss from this moment till we reach the shore  well well sister said dominick when thus urged if you must have it i will explain  he went on to show that when the boat came near the shore the waves would grasp it instead of letting it slip back would carry it swiftly in on their crests so that the great difficulty in such a case would be to keep the boats head pointing to the land and if he failed to do so they would infallibly be overturned and have to swim ashore  well that would be unpleasant dom said the ignorant as well as innocent pauline but it would not matter much for we can all swim thanks to you for insisting on teaching us long ago  we will try our best said dominick who thereupon relapsed into silence wisely resolving to let his sister retain all the bliss of ignorance that was possible under the circumstances  indeed there was not much more time for conversation for the power of the waves was beginning to be felt by the little craft and the clumsy oar did not act with as much precision or force as was desirable while dominicks weakness rendered the steering difficult  pauline now began to realise the danger somewhat more clearly from experience and even otto showed symptoms of surprise that amounted very nearly to alarm as the boat at one point made a sudden rush on a wavetop as if it meant to try a race with it and then as suddenly slipped back into the hollow behind as if it had been disheartened feeling that there was no chance  at last they reached the point of greatest danger  the huge waves as we have said commenced out at sea in long gentle undulations  nearer the shore they advanced in the shape of glassy walls one after another like successive lines of indomitable infantry in time of war  further in the tops of these waves began to gurgle and foam and gather real instead of seeming motion as they rushed towards their fall  it was here that the boat showed symptoms of becoming unmanageable  why the waters beginning to boil exclaimed otto in some anxiety  hold on boy and keep quiet said his brother  as he spoke the water gurgled up so that it seemed as if about to pour inboard all round  at the same time the boat made a rush shoreward as if suddenly endowed with life  dominick struggled manfully to keep the stern to the sea  he succeeded but in another moment the boat slipped back  it had not been fairly caught and the wave passed on to fall with a roar like thunder a hundred yards or so ahead  the next will do it said dominick with an anxious glance behind where a crystal wall was coming grandly onunnaturally high it seemed to them owing to their position in the hollow  no need to tell otto now to hold on  no need to explain difficulty or danger to pauline  as her brother stood at the oar quivering as much from weakness as exertion she understood it all  but she was brave and she could swim  this latter fact lent her additional confidence best of all she had faith in god and her spirit was calmed for whether life or death lay before her she knew that her soul was safe  as dominick had prophesied the next wave took them fairly in its grasp for a few moments the water hissed and gurgled round them  the steersman seemed to lose control for a second or two but quickly recovered  then there was a bound as if the boat had been shot from a catapult and the billow fell  a tremendous roar tumultuous foam all round increasing speed  the land appeared to be rushing at them when dominicks oar snapped suddenly and he went overboard  a shriek from pauline and a shout from otto rose high above the din of raging water as the boat broachedto and hurled its remaining occupants into the sea  even in that trying moment dominick did not lose presence of mind  he could swim and dive like a waterrat  pushing towards his brother and sister who were heading bravely for the shore he shouted dig your fingers and toes deep into the sand and hold on for life if he corrected himself when you gain the beach  it was well they were forewarned and that they were constitutionally obedient  a few minutes later and they were all swept up high on the beach in a wilderness of foam  the return of that wilderness was like the rushing of a millrace  sand stones sticks and seaweed went back with it in dire confusion  prone on their knees with fingers and toes fixed and heads down the brothers and sister met the rush  it was almost too much for them  a moment more and strength as well as breath would have failed but the danger passed and dominick sprang to his feet  up up and run he shouted as he caught pauline round the waist and dragged her on  otto needed no help  they were barely in time  the succeeding wave roared after them as if maddened at having lost its prey and the foaming water was up with them and almost round their knees ere its fury was quite spent  safe exclaimed dominick  thank god murmured pauline as she sank exhausted on the sand  otto who had never seen his sister in such a state before ran to her and kneeling down anxiously seized one of her hands  never fear lad said his brother in reassuring tones shell soon come round  lend a hand to lift her  they bore the fainting girl up the beach and laid her on a grassy spot under a bush  and now dominick was glad to find that he had been mistaken in supposing that the coral reef was a mere sandbank destitute of vegetation  indeed before landing he had observed that there were a few trees on the highest part of it  he now perceived that there was quite a little grove of cocoanut palms with a thicket of underwood around them which if not extensive was at all events comparatively dense  he pointed out the fact to otto who was chafing his sisters hands  ay responded otto and the island on the other side must be a goodish big one for i got a glimpse of it through the trees as we came rushing in on that monstrous wave  in a short time pauline recovered and dominick returned to the waters edge with otto  our first care must be he said to save our little boat if we can for it is the only means we have of escaping from this island  escaping repeated otto in surprise  i dont want to escape from it dom  indeed why not  why because ive dreamed about being cast on a desolate island hundreds of times and ive read about robinson crusoe and all the other crusoes and ive longed to be cast on one and now i am cast on one so i dont want to escape  itll be the greatest fun in the world i only hope i wont wake up as usual to find that its all a dream  dominick laughed not scornfully by any means at the boys enthusiasm nevertheless he had strong sympathy with him for the period had not passed so long ago when he himself entertained a very vivid impression of the romance of such a situation and he did not trouble his mind about the stern realities  i sincerely hope it may come up to your expectations otto my boy nevertheless we must secure the boat for fishing purposes even though we dont try to escape in it  for fishing why we have neither hooks nor lines  true lad but we have got fingers and brains  it strikes me that we shall have occasion to use all our powers and possessions if we are not to starve here for the reef seems to have very little vegetation on it and there is sure to be a lagoon of water on the other side separating it from the island beyond  i wonder if there is fresh water on the reef said otto with a very sudden look of solemnity and pursing of the mouth  you may well ask that  i hope there is  we will go and settle the point the moment we have secured the boat if  he stopped for he saw at that moment that the sea had taken good care to secure the boat to itself as a plaything  having dashed it into small pieces it was by that time busily engaged in tossing these about among the foam now hurling the splinters high upon the shore anon sending up long watery tongues to lick them back and then casting them under the incoming rollers to be further reduced into what is usually styled matchwood  there was a small bay close at hand where the sandy beach was strewn with rocks in which the sea appeared to play this game with unusual vigour  it was a sort of hospital for marine incurables into which the sea cast its broken toys when tired of smashing them up and left them there to rot  regarding this spot with a thoughtful look dominick remarked that the wreck which lay on the rocks off the tail of the island was by no means the first that had taken place there  and wont be the last i fancy said otto  probably not  indeed from the appearance of this bay and the fact that an ocean current drifted us towards the spot i should think that the island is a particularly dangerous one for vessels  but come well go see how pina gets on and then proceed to examine our new home  returning to the place where pauline had been left they found the poor girl wringing the water out of her dress  the news of the fate of the little boat did not seem to affect her much she did not fully appreciate the loss and was more taken up with the idea of thankfulness for deliverance from death  may i not go with you she asked on hearing that her brothers were going to search for water  certainly  i thought you might perhaps prefer to rest and dry your clothes in the sun replied dominick  walking will dry them better said pina  besides i have quite recovered  youre a plucky little woman said otto as they set off  isnt it nice to be here all by ourselves on a real uninhabited island quite fit for robinson himself  who knows but we may find friday in the bushes  wouldnt that spoil it as an uninhabited isle  a little but not much  the thicket is too small to contain anything with life i fear said dominick whose anxiety as to food and drink prevented his sympathising much with the smalltalk of the other two  luckily the weather is warm he added and we wont require better shelter at present than the bushes afford unless a storm comesho what have we herea path  they had reached the entrance to the thicket and discovered what appeared to be an opening into it made apparently by the hand of man  nothing more likely said pauline  if so many wrecks have taken place hereas you seem to thinksome of the crews must have landed and perhaps lived here  ay and died here returned dominick in a grave low tone as he pointed to a skeleton lying on a spot which had once been cleared of bushes but so long ago that the vegetation had partially grown up again  the man whose bleached bones lay before them had evidently perished many years before  on examination nothing was found to afford any information about him but when they had advanced a dozen yards further they came upon six little mounds which showed that a party probably a wrecked crewhad sojourned there for a time and finally perished so far their story was clear enough  one by one they must have sunk until the last man had lain down to die and remain unburied  pushing past these sad evidences of former suffering and feeling that the same fate might await themselves they came to a sight which tended slightly to restore their spirits  it was a pool of water of considerable size whether a spring or a rainpool they could not tell neither did they care at that time for the sudden feeling of relieved anxiety was so great that they ran forward as if under one impulse and lying down on their breasts took a long refreshing draught  so powerful was the influence of this refreshment and discovery on their spirits that they became totally regardless and forgetful for the moment about foodall the more that having so recently had a good meal they were not hungry  i was sure we would find water said otto as they continued to explore the thicket and ive no doubt that we shall find yams and plantains and breadfruits andarent these the sort of things that grow wild on coral islands dom  yes but i fear not on such a little scrap of reef as this  however we shall not be quite destitute for there are cocoanuts you see though not many of them  come our prospects are brightening and as the sun is beginning to sink we will look out for a suitable campingground  as far away from the skeleton please as possible said otto  surely you dont suppose it can hurt you said pauline  nno of course not but it would be unpleasant to have it for a bedfellow you know so the further away from it the better  as he spoke they emerged from the thicket at the end opposite to the spot where they had entered and had their spirits again powerfully cheered by coming suddenly into a blaze of sunshine for the bright orb of day was descending at that side of the islet and his red resplendent rays were glowing on the reef and on the palmtrees  they also came in full view of the islet beyond which they now perceived was of considerable size and covered with vegetation but as dominick had suspected separated completely from the reef or outer isle on which they stood by a deep lagoon  splendid exclaimed pauline  as i feared muttered dominick and no means of reaching it  pooh  didnt robinson crusoe make rafts said otto at least if he didnt somebody else did and anyhow we can  come let us continue our walk said dominick  you dont fully appreciate the loss of our boat otto  dont you see that even if we do build a raft it will at best be a clumsy thing to manage and heavy to pull slow to sail and bad to steer and if we should chance to be on it when a stiff breeze springs up from the land we should probably be driven out to sea and lostor separated if pina should chance to have been left on shore at the time  what a fellow you are dom for supposing chances and difficulties and fancying they cannot be overcome returned otto with the pert selfsufficiency that characterised him  for my part i rather enjoy difficulties because of the fun of overcoming them  dont you see we three can make quite sure of never being separated by never going out on our raft except together so that we shall always enjoy ourselves unitedly or perish in company  then we can easily get over the difficulty of being blown out to sea by never going on the sea at all but confining ourselves entirely to the lagoon which is large enough for any reasonable man and may be larger than we think for we cant see the whole of it from where we stand  then as to sailing and rowing slowly we can overcome these difficulties by not being in a hurry taking things easy you know  to this dominick replied that there was one difficulty which his little brother with all his wisdom and capacity would never overcome  and what may that be demanded otto  the difficulty of being unable to talk commonsense  true dom true that is a great difficulty retorted the boy with deep humility of aspect for a mans conversation is greatly affected by the company he keeps and with you as my only male companion i have not much to hope for in the way of example  but even that may be got the better of by holding intercourse chiefly with pina  but what if i refuse to talk said pauline with a laugh  then will you be all the more able to listen sister mine which is the most commonsense thing that you can do except when brother dom speaks said the incorrigible boy  they had seated themselves on a bank while thus conversing and from their position could see over a considerable portion of the lagoon suddenly dominick pointed to an object a long way off which was half concealed by the shadow of an island  does it not look like a canoe he asked eagerly  cant make it out at all said otto shading his eyes with his hand  the sun on the water dazzles one so observed pauline that it is difficult to look steadily  in a few moments the object which had drawn their attention sailed out from under the shade of the island and breaking up into fragments rose into the air proving itself to be a flock of large aquatic birds which had been swimming in a line  things are not what they seem observed pauline rising and following her brothers through a little thicket  what a pity exclaimed otto i was in hopes it was a canoeful of savages  it would be such fun to have a real friday to be our servant  more likely that our friday would kill cook and eat us if he could said dominick to the surprise of otto who gave it as his opinion that savages never ate men and asked if his brother really believed that they did  indeed i do  we have it recorded by all the best authorities that south sea islanders are given to this horrible practice  there can be no doubt about it whatever and the less we see of these fellows in our present defenceless state the better  how little said pauline our dear father thought when he wrote for us to go out to him in his ship that we should be cast on an unknown island and the ship itself go to the bottom  little indeed and as little did poor mother dream of such a fate returned dominick when she let us all go so readily on the understanding that we should give father no rest until we had got him to give up business quit java for ever and return home  dear old mother said pauline i wishoh  i wish so much that we had not left her even though it was to be for only a few months  she must be so lonely with no one to talk to  you forget pina  forgetwhat  the cat returned otto unable to repress a smile which rose in spite of the ready tear that dimmed his eye at the mere mention of his mother you know the cat is her great resourcea sort of safetyvalve sometimes when ive been listening to her lying on the rug at her feet half asleep ive heard her talk to that cat as if it really was a human being and tell it all about her little affairs and daily troubles and worries in quite a confidential tone  ive taken it into my head that thats mothers way of thinking aloudshe thinks at the cat for company and to do the brute justice it does its best to accommodate her  ive seen it sit and stare at her by the halfhour at a time and give a little purr or a meaiow now and then as if it wanted to speak im quite sure it thinks and wonders no doubt what idle useless work it is to click knittingneedles together by the hour  dear me otto said pauline with a laugh i had no idea that you could think so much about anything  think exclaimed the boy indignantly dyou suppose that its only sternbrowed longlegged fellows like dom there who can think  why i think and think sometimes to such an extent that i nearly think myself inside out  but pina you dont know half as much about motherkin as i do for when you are with her she usually forgets herself i can see and talks only about the things that interest you whereas when theres nobody present but me she counts me for nothing and lets me do pretty much what i likebecause no doubt she thinks ill do that whether she lets me or notbut shes wrong for i love her far more than she thinks and then its when im quiet and she forgets me i fancy or thinks im asleep that she comes out strong at the cat  darling mother said pauline musingly  i can see her now in my mind with her neat black cap and smooth braided hair and gold spectacles as plain as if she were sitting before me  im sorry to destroy the vision pina on my own account as well as yours observed dominick but it behoves us now to look for a nights lodging for the sun is sinking fast and it would not be pleasant to lie down on the bare ground shelterless fine though the climate is come we will return to the place where we landed and search for a cave or a bit of overhanging rock  the best sleepingplace that they had up to that time discovered was undoubtedly the grove in which they had found the graves of the shipwrecked crew but as otto truly remarked it would probably result in uncomfortable dreams if they were to go to sleep in a buryingground alongside of a skeleton  accordingly they returned to the beach and sought for some time among the debris of the boat for anything useful that might have been washed up but found nothing  then they went alongshore in the direction of the wreck which had raised their hopes so high that day when first seen but nothing suitable was discovered until they rounded a low point of rocks when pauline came to a sudden pause  look a golden cave she exclaimed pointing eagerly to a grassy spot which was canopied by feathery palms and half enclosed by coral rocks where was a cavern into which the sinking sun streamed at the moment with wonderful intensity  their home for that night obviously lay before them but when they entered it and sat down their destitution became sadly apparent  no beds to spread no food to prepare nothing whatever to do but lie down and sleep  no matter were neither hungry nor thirsty said dominick with an air of somewhat forced gaiety and our clothes are getting dry  come sister you must be weary  lie down at the inner side of the cave and otto and i like faithful knights will guard the entrance  ii wish he added in a graver tone and with some hesitation that we had a bible that we might read a verse or two before lying down  i can help you in that said his sister eagerly  i have a fair memory you know and can repeat a good many verses  pauline repeated the twentythird psalm in a low sweet voice  when she had finished a sudden impulse induced dominick who had never prayed aloud before to utter a brief but fervent prayer and thanksgiving then the three lay down in the cave and in five minutes were sound asleep  thus appropriately did these castaways begin their sojourn on a spot which was destined to be their home for a long time to come    chapter three  explorations and discoveries  as the sun had bathed the golden cave when our castaways went to sleep so it flooded their simple dwelling when they awoke  then exclaims the intelligent reader the sun must have risen in the west  by no means good reader  whatever man in his wisdom or weakness may do or say the great luminaries of day and night hold on the even tenor of their way unchanged  but youth is a wonderful compound of strength hope vitality carelessness and freeandeasy oblivion and in the unconscious exercise of the last capacity pauline and her brothers had slept as they lay down without the slightest motion all through that night all through the gorgeous sunrise of the following morning all through the fervid noontide and the declining day until the setting sun again turned their restingplace into a cave of gold  the effect upon their eyelids was such that they winked and awoke with a mighty yawn  we speak advisedly  there were not three separate awakenings and three distinct yawns no the rousing of one caused the rousing of the others in succession so rapidly that the yawns commencing with paulines treble were prolonged through ottos tenor down to dominicks bass in one stupendous monotone or slide which the last yawner terminated in a groan of contentment  nature during the past few days had been doubly defrauded and she having now partially repaid herself allowed her captives to go free with restored vigour there was however enough of the debt still unpaid to induce a desire in the captives to return of their own accord to the prisonhouse of oblivion but the desire was frustrated by otto who sitting up suddenly and blinking at the sun with owlish gravity exclaimed  well i never  weve only slept five minutes  the sun hasnt set yet  dominick replying with a powerful stretch and another yawn also raised himself on one elbow and gazed solemnly in front of him  a gleam of intelligence suddenly crossed his countenance  why boy when we went to sleep the sun was what you may call six feet above the horizon now it is twelve feet if it is an inch so that if it be still setting it must be setting upwardsa phenomenon of which the records of astronomical research make no mention  but it is setting retorted otto with a puzzled look for i never heard of your astronomical searchers saying that theyd ever seen the sun rise in the same place where it sets  true otto and the conclusion i am forced to is that we have slept right on from sunset to sunset  so then weve lost a day murmured pauline who in an attitude of helpless repose had been winking with a languid expression at the luminous subject of discussion  good morning pina said dominick  good evening you mean interrupted his brother  well good evening it matters little which how have you slept  soundlyoh so soundly that i dont want to move  well then dont move ill rise and get you some breakfast  supper interposed otto  supper be it it matters notbut dont say weve lost a day sister mine  as regards time indeed we have but in strength i feel that i have gained a week or more  does any one know said otto gazing with a perplexed expression at the skyfor he had lain back again with his hands under his headdoes any one know what day it was when we landed  thursday i think said dominick  oh no exclaimed pauline surely it was wednesday or tuesday but the anxiety and confusion during the wreck and our terrible sufferings afterwards in the little boat have quite confused my mind on that point  well now heres a pretty state of things continued otto sleepily weve lost one day an we dont agree about three others and dom says hes gained a week how are we ever to find out when sunday comes i should like to know  theres a puzzlera reglarpuzzlpuz  a soft snore told that tired natures sweet restorer balmy sleep had again taken the little fellow captive and prolonged silence on the part of the other two proved them to have gone into similar captivity nature had not recovered her debt in full  she was in an exacting mood and held them fast during the whole of another night  then she set them finally free at sunrise on the following day when the soft yellow light streamed on surrounding land and sea converting their sleepingplace into a silver cave by contrast  there was no languid or yawny awakening on this occasion  dominick sat up the instant his eyes opened then sprang to his feet and ran out of the cave  he was followed immediately by otto and pauline the former declaring with emphasis that he felt himself to be a new man  yes richards himself again said dominick as he stretched himself with the energy of one who rejoices in his strength  now pina weve got a busy day before us  we must find out what our islet contains in the way of food first for i am ravenously hungry and then examine its other resources  it is very beautiful  one glance suffices to tell us that  and isnt it pleasant to think that it is all our own  the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof said his sister softly  the youths gaiety changed into a deeper and nobler feeling  he looked earnestly at pauline for a few seconds  right pina right he said  to tell you the truth i was halfashamed of my feelings that time when i broke into involuntary prayer and thanksgiving  im ashamed now of having been ashamed  come sister you shall read the word of god from memory and i will pray every morning and evening as long as we shall dwell here together  that day they wandered about their islet with more of gaiety and lightheartedness than they would have experienced had they neglected first to give honour to god who not only gives us all things richly to enjoy but also the very capacity for enjoyment  but no joy of earth is unmingled  the exploration did not result in unmitigated satisfaction as we shall see  their first great object of course was breakfast  i cant ask you what youll have pina  our only dish at least this morning said dominick glancing upwards is  cocoanuts put in otto  otto was rather fond of putting in his word or as dominick expressed it his oar  he was somewhat pert by nature and not at that time greatly modified by art  just so lad returned his brother and as you have a considerable spice of the monkey in you be good enough to climb up one of these palms and send down a few nuts  to do otto justice he was quite as obliging as he was pert but when he stood at the foot of the tall palmtree and looked up at its thick stem he hesitated  dyou know dom he said it seems to me rather easier to talk about than to do  you are not the first who has found that out returned his brother with a laugh  now dont you know how the south sea islanders get up the palmtrees  no never heard how  why i thought your great authority robinson crusoe had told you that  dont think he ever referred to it  friday may have known how but if he did he kept his knowledge to himself  i wish you two would discuss the literature of that subject some other time said pauline  im almost sinking for want of food  do be quick please  thus urged dominick at once took off his neckcloth and showed his brother how by tying his feet together with it at a sufficient distance apart so as to permit of getting a foot on each side of the tree the kerchief would catch on the rough bark and so form a purchase by which he could force himself up step by step as it were while grasping the stem with arms and knees  otto was an apt scholar in most things especially in those that required activity of body  he soon climbed the tree and plucked and threw down half a dozen cocoanuts  but when these had been procured there still remained a difficulty for the tough outer husk of the nuts nearly two inches thick could not easily be cut through with a claspknife so as to reach that kernel or nut which is ordinarily presented to english eyes in fruitshops  we have no axe so must adopt the only remaining method said dominick  laying a nut on a flat rock he seized a stone about twice the size of his own head and heaving it aloft brought it down with all his force on the nut which was considerably crushed and broken by the blow  with perseverance and the vigorous use of a claspknife he at last reached the interior  thereafter on cocoanut meat and cocoanut milk with a draught from a pool in the thicket they partook of their first breakfast on the reef  now our first duty is to bury the skeleton said dominick when the meal was concluded our next to examine the land and our last to visit the wreck  i think we shall be able to do all this in one day  like many perhaps we may say most of mans estimates dominicks calculation was short of the mark for the reef turned out to be considerably larger than they had at first supposed  it must be remembered that they had up to that time seen it only from the low level of the sea and from that point of view it appeared to be a mere sandbank with a slight elevation in the centre which was clothed with vegetation  but when the highest point of this elevation was gained they discovered that it had hidden from their view not only a considerable stretch of low land which lay behind but an extensive continuation of the lagoon or saltwater lake in which lay a multitude of smaller islets of varying shapes some mere banks of sand others with patches of vegetation in their centres and a few with several cocoanut palms on them the nucleus probably of future palm groves a large island formed the background to this lovely picture and the irregular coral reef guarded the whole from the violence of the ocean in some places this reef rose to a considerable height above the sealevel  in others it was so little above it that each falling breaker almost buried it in foam but everywhere it was a sufficient protection to the lagoon which lay calm and placid within encircled by its snowy fringethe result of the watery war outside  in one spot there was a deep entrance into this beautiful haven of peace and that chanced to be close to the golden cave and was about fifty yards wide at the extremity of the reef on the other side of this opening lay another elevated spot similar to their own though smaller and with only a few palms in the centre of it  from the sea this eminence had appeared to be a continuation of the other and it was only when they landed that the rigondas discovered the separation caused by the channel leading into the lagoon  fairyland exclaimed pauline who could scarcely contain herself with delight at the marvellous scene of beauty that had so unexpectedly burst upon their view  rather a noisy and bustling fairyland too said otto referring to the numerous seabirds that inquisitively came to look at them as well as to the other waterfowl that went about from isle to isle on whistling wings  the boy spoke jestingly but it was clear from his heaving chest partiallyopen mouth and glittering eyes that his little heart was stirred to an unwonted depth of emotion  alas that we have lost our boat exclaimed dominick  to this otto replied by expressing an earnest wish that he were able to swim as well as a south sea islander for in that case he would launch forth and spend the remainder of that day in visiting all the islands  yes and wouldnt it be charming responded his brother to pay your aquatic visits in such pleasant company as that  he pointed to an object which was visible at no great distance moving about on the surface of the glassy sea with great activity  what creature is that asked pauline  it is not a creature pina only part of a creature  you dont mean to say its a shark cried otto with a frown  indeed it isthe backfin of one at leastand he must have heard you for he seems impatient to join you in your little trip to the islands  ill put it off to some future day dom  but isnt it a pity that such pretty places should be spoiled by such greedy and cruel monsters  and yet they must have been made for some good purpose suggested pauline  i rather suspect said dominick that if game and fish only knew who shoot and catch them and afterwards eat them they might be inclined to call man greedy and cruel  but we cant help that dom  we must live you know  so says or thinks the shark no doubt when he swallows a man  while the abstruse question to which the shark had thus given rise was being further discussed the explorers returned to the thicket where they buried the skeleton beside the other graves  a close search was then made for any object that might identify the unfortunates or afford some clue to their history but nothing of the sort was found  strange muttered dominick on leaving the spot after completing their task  one would have expected that with a wrecked ship to fall back upon they would have left behind them evidences of some sort implements or books or empty beefcasksbut there is literally nothing  perhaps suggested pauline the men did not belong to this wreck they may have landed as we have done out of a small boat and the vessel we now see may have been driven here after they were dead  true pina it may have been so  however the matter must remain a mystery for the present  meanwhile we will go and explore the low land behind our reef  isnt it strange dom that we should become landed proprietors in this fashion remarked otto as they walked along  and that too added pauline at a time when our hopes were lowest and our case most desperate  tis a magnificent estate said dominick of which we will constitute pina the queen myself the prime minister and otto the army  to this otto objected that as it was the business of an army to defend the people and keep them in order there was no use for an army seeing that there were no people but dominick replied that a queen and prime minister formed part of a people and that an army was required to defend them  to keep them in order you should say retorted otto for that will clearly be my chief duty if i accept the situation  well ive no objection on the whole to be an army but please remember that in time of peace an army is expected to do no laborious work and that at all times it is clothed and fed by the state  now queen pina the first what would your majesty wish the army to do  go forth and subdue the land replied pina the first promptly with quite a regal sweep of her hand towards the low ground and the lagoon beyond  will your majesty deign to instruct me how i am to begin  the queen hesitated  she was rather puzzled as rulers sometimes are when required to tackle details  may it please your majesty said dominick coming to the rescue like a true premier it is the chief duty of a prime minister to advise his sovereign  if it be your pleasure i would recommend that the army should be sent down into yonder clump of reeds to ascertain what revenue is to be derived from the inhabitants thereof in the shape of wildfowl eggs etcetera while i visit the shore of the lagoon to ascertain the prospects of supply in the form of shellfish from that quarter meanwhile i would further advise your majesty to sit down on this coral throne and enjoy the contemplation of your kingdom till we return  with a dignified bow and a little laugh queen pina assented and the prime minister went off to the shore while the army defiled towards the marsh  left alone pina the first soon forgot her royal condition in contemplation of the lovely prospect before her  as she gazed over the sand and across the lagoon and out on the gleaming sea her thoughts assumed the wings of the morning and flew away over the mighty ocean to old england  sadness filled her heart and tears her eyes as she thought of a mild little mother who had since the departure of her three children been reduced for companionship to a huge household cat and who would ere long be wondering why letters were so long of coming from the dear ones who had left her  pauline had a vivid imagination and great power of mental abstraction she summoned up the image of the little mother so successfully that she felt as if she actually saw her knitting her socks sadly with her head on one side  she even heard her address the cat she was accustomed to address the cat when alone and express a hope that in the course of a month or six weeks more she might expect to have news of the absent ones  and pauline almost saw the household cat which occupied its usual place on the table at the old ladys elbow blink its eyes with sympathyor indifference she could not be quite sure which  then paulines wayward thoughts took a sudden flight to the island of java in the china seas where she beheld a bald little old gentlemana merchant and a shipownerwho was also her father and who sat reading a newspaper in his office and was wondering why his good ship flying fishwhich was bringing his children to him besides a quantity of other goodsdid not make its appearance and she plainly saw the look of disappointment as he threw the paper down exclaiming odd very odd but she must turn up soon  pauline saw nothing more after that for some time because her eyes were blinded with tears  then queen pina cheered up again for she thought that surely a ship would soon pass the island and take them off  as this last thought became more definite for pina was very young and hopeful her eyes dried and permitted her to observe her kingdom more clearly  the prime minister she observed was still busy on the shore and from his frequently stooping to pick up something she argued that the affairs of state in that quarter were prospering  presently from the midst of a mass of reeds not far off there arose a shout easily recognisable as that of the army which was followed by cries of a stupendous yet extremely familiar kind  pauline started up in considerable haste and a moment later beheld the chief authors of the noise burst from the clump of reeds in the form of a large sow and a troop of little pigs  they were evidently in a state of wild alarm for besides squealing with a degree of intensity possible only to pigs they ran in such furious haste that they stumbled over sticks and stones in reckless confusion scrambling to their feet again in such a hurry as to ensure repeated falls and generally twirling themselves and their tails in a manner that was consistent with nothing short of raving madness  little wonder that those creatures acted thus for close on their heels gasping and glaring the army burst forth and fell on them literally fell on one of them for otto in his anxiety to catch the hindmost pig a remarkably small but active animal tripped over a root just as he was about to lay hold of its little tail and fell on the top of it with fearful violence  the mechanical pressure combining with the creatures spiritual efforts produced a sudden yell that threw the cries of its companions quite into the shade  it might have sufficed to blow otto into the air  indeed it seemed as if some such result actually followed for after turning a complete somersault the boy was on his feet again as if by magic but so also was the little pig which being thus forcibly separated from its family turned aside and made for the main thicket  to cut off its retreat the army made a sudden flank movement headed the enemy grasped it by the curly tail and sought to lift it into his arms but the curly tail straightened out and being exceedingly thin as well as taper slipped from his hand  need we say that the little pig came to the ground with a remonstrative squeal  it also rolled over  otto unable to check himself flew past  the pig rose diverged and resumed its headlong flight  otto doubled came close up again stooped to conquer and was on the point of coming off victorious when with a final shriek of mingled rage and joy the enemy rushed through a hole under a prickly bush while the discomfited army plunged headlong into the same and stuck fast  meanwhile the rest of the porcine family had found refuge in an almost impenetrable part of the thicket  pork your majesty said otto on returning from the field of battle may at all events be counted as one of the products of your dominions  truly it would seem so responded the queen with a laugh nevertheless there does not appear to be much hope of its forming a source of supply to the royal larder  time will show said dominick coming up at the moment and see here are several kinds of shellfish which will form a pleasant addition to our fare  ay and i saw eggs among the reeds said otto some of which  not pigs eggs surely interrupted dominick  they may be so retorted otto the fact that english pigs dont lay eggs is no argument against south sea pigs doing so if they choose but as i was about to say your majesty when the premier interrupted mesome of these eggs i gathered and would have presented them as an offering from the army if i had not fallen and crushed them beyond repair  in corroboration of what he said otto opened his coat pocket and revealed in its depths a mass of yellow substance and broken shells  horrible exclaimed pauline how will you ever get it cleaned  by turning it inside outthus most gracious queen  he reversed the pocket as he spoke allowing the yellow compound to drip on the ground and thereafter wiped it with grass  i wouldnt have minded this loss so much he continued if i had not lost that little pig  but i shall know him again when i see him and you may depend on it that he is destined ere long to be turned into pork chops  well then on the strength of that hope we will continue the survey of our possessions said dominick leading the party still further into the low grounds  for some time the trio wandered about without making any further discoveries of importance until they came to a thicket somewhat similar to the one near which they had been cast on shore but much smaller  on entering it they were startled by a loud cackling noise accompanied by the whirring of wings  sounds marvellously like domestic fowls said dominick as he pushed forward  and such it turned out to be for on reaching an open glade in the thicket they beheld a large flock of hens running on ahead of them with a splendid cock bringing up the rear which turned occasionally to cast an indignant look at the intruders  that accounts for your eggs otto observed pauline  yes and here are more of them said the boy pointing to a nest with half a dozen eggs in it which he immediately proceeded to gather  it is quite evident to me remarked dominick as they continued to advance that both the pigs and fowls must have been landed from the wreck that lies on the shore and that after the death of the poor fellows who escaped the sea they went wild  probably they have multiplied and we may find the land well stocked  i hope so  perhaps we may find some more traces of the shipwrecked crew suggested pauline  their expectations were not disappointed for on returning in the evening from their tour of exploration they came on a partially cleared place in the thicket beside the golden cave which had evidently been used as a garden  in the midst of a mass of luxuriant undergrowth which almost smothered them vegetables of various kinds were found growingamong others the sweet potato  gathering some of these otto declared joyfully that he meant to have a royal feast that night but a difficulty which none of them had thought of had to be faced and overcome before that feast could be enjoyed  it was just as they arrived at the golden cave that this difficulty presented itself to their minds  dom said otto with a solemn look how are we to make a fire  by kindling it of course  yes but you stupid premier where are we to find a light  to tell you the truth my boy returned dominick i never thought of that till this moment and i cant very well see my way out of the difficulty  pauline to whom the brothers now looked shook her head  never before she said had she occasion to trouble her brain about a light  when she wanted one in england all she had to do was to call for one or strike a match  what was to be done in their present circumstances she had not the smallest conception  ill tell you what said otto after several suggestions had been made and rejected this is how well do it  we will gather a lot of dry grass and dead sticks and build them up into a pile with logs around it then pina will sit down and gaze steadily at the heart of the pile for some minutes with her great brown sparkling eyes she should be able to kindle a flame in the heart of almost anything in five minutesor say ten at the outside eh  i should think retorted the queen that your fiery spirit or flashing wit might accomplish the feat in a shorter time  it seems to me remarked dominick who had been thinking too hard to pay much regard to these pleasantries that if we live long here we shall have to begin life over againnot our own lives exactly but the worlds life  we shall have to invent everything anew for ourselves discover new methods of performing old familiar work and generally exercise our ingenuity to the uttermost  that may be quite true you philosophic premier returned otto but it does not light our fire or roast that old hen which you brought down with a stone so cleverly today  come now let us exercise our ingenuity a little more to the purpose if possible  if we had only some tinder said dominick we could find flint i dare say or some hard kind of stone from which fire could be struck with the back of a claspknife but i have seen nothing like tinder today  ive heard that burnt rag makes capital tinder  if so a bit of pinas dress might do but we cant burn it without fire  for a considerable time the trio sought to devise some means of procuring fire but without success and they were at last fain to content themselves with another cold supper of cocoanut and water after which being rather tired they went to rest as on the previous night    chapter four  difficulties met and overcome  the next day pauline and her brothers visited the wreck and here new difficulties met them for although the vessel lay hard and fast on the rocks there was a belt of water between it and the main shore which was not only broad but deep  i can easily swim it said dominick beginning to pull off his coat  dom said otto solemnly sharks  thats true my boy i wont risk it  he put his coat on again and turned to look for some driftwood with which to make a raft  theres sure to be some lying about you know he said for a wreck could hardly take place without something or other in the way of spars or wreckage being washed ashore  but dont you think suggested otto that the men whose graves we have found may have used it all up  otto was right  not a scrap of timber or cordage of any kind was to be found after a most diligent search and they were about to give it up in despair when pauline remembered the bay where they had been cast ashore and which we have described as being filled with wreckage  in truth this bay and the reef with its group of islands lay right in the track of one of those great ocean currents which as the reader probably knows are caused by the constant circulation of all the waters of the sea between the equator and the poles  this grand and continuous flow is caused by difference of temperature and density in seawater at different places  at the equator the water is warm at the poles it is cold  this alone would suffice to cause circulationsomewhat as water circulates in a boiling potbut other active agents are at work  the arctic and antarctic snows freshen the seawater as well as cool it while equatorial heat evaporates as well as warms it and thus leaves a superabundance of salt and lime behind  the grand ocean current thus caused is broken up into smaller streams and the courses of these are fixed by the conformation of landjust as a rivers flow is turned right or left and sometimes backward in eddies by the form of its banks and bottom  trade winds and the earths motion on its axis still further modify the streams both as to direction and force  it was one of those currents then which flowed past the reef and sometimes cast vessels and wreckage on its shores  hastening to the bay they accordingly found enough of broken spars and planks to have made half a dozen rafts twice the size of that required to go off with to the wreck so to work they went at once with eager enthusiasm  hold on shouted dominick after a few spars had been collected and dragged up on the sand  otto and pauline paused in their labour and looked anxiously at their brother for his face wore a perplexed look  we have forgotten that it is impossible to shove a raft of any size big or little through these huge breakers so as to get it round the point to where the wreck lies  well then cried otto with the ready assurance of ignorance well just drag it overland to the wreck and launch it there  but otto you have not taken into consideration the fact that our raft must be so large that when finished the dragging of it over rough ground would require three or four horses instead of three human beings  well then returned the boy well make it small just big enough to carry one person and then well be able to drag it overland and can go off to the wreck one at a time  now just think brainless one retorted dominick suppose that i were to go off first to the wreck what then  why then i would go off next of course and then pina would follow and so wed all get on board one at a time and explore it together  yes but what would you come off on  the raft to be sure  but the raft i have supposed is with me at the wreck  it wont go back to the shore of its own accord to fetch you and we have no ropes with which to haul it to and fro  then theres nothing for it said otto after a few moments thought but to make it big enough for two or carry over the broken spars and planks piecemeal and put them together opposite the wreck so come along  this latter plan being adopted they set to work with energy  to their joy they found not only that a good deal of cordagesomewhat worn indeed but still serviceablewas mingled with the wreckage but that many large protruding bolts and rusty nails formed convenient holdfasts which facilitated the building up and fastening together of the parts  at last after considerable labour the raft was got ready early in the afternoon and the brothers embarking on it with two long poles pushed off to the wreck while pauline sat on the shore and watched them  it was an anxious moment when they drew near enough to observe the vessel more distinctly for it was just possible that they might find in her hold a supply of food and things they stood so much in need of while on the other hand there was a strong probability that everything had been washed out of her long ago or that her former crew had taken out all that was worth removing  what if we should find casks of biscuits and barrels of pork to say nothing of tea and sugar and such like murmured the sanguine otto as they poled slowly out  and what if we should find nothing at all said dominick  o dom exclaimed otto in a voice so despairing that his companion turned to look at him in surprise  look see the ship has been on fire  it can only be the mere skeleton that is left  dominick turned quickly and saw that his brother had reason for this remark  they had by that time approached so near to the wreck that the charred condition of part of her bulwarks and specially of her lower spars became obvious and when a few minutes later they stood on the deck the scene that presented itself was one of black desolation evidently the illfated vessel had been enveloped in flames for everything on board was charred and it was almost certain that her crew had run her on the rocks as the only method of escaping her boats having been totally destroyed as was apparent from the small portions of them that still hung from the davits  nothing left said otto  i think that robinson crusoe himself would have given way to despair if his wreck had been anything like this  i wonder that even this much of it has been left above water after fire had got hold of it  perhaps the hull sank after the first crash on the rocks and put out the fire suggested dominick and then subsequent gales may have driven her higher up  even now her stern lies pretty deep and everything in her hold has been washed away  there could be no doubt as to the latter point for the deck had been blown up probably by gunpowder near the mainhatch leaving a great hole through which the hold could be seen almost as far as the bulkhead of the forecastle  hastening forward to the hatchway of this part of the vessel in the feeble hope that they might still find something that would be of use they descended quickly but the first glance round quenched such a hope for the fire had done its work there effectually and besides there were obvious indications that what the fire had spared her crew had carried away  the only things left of any value were the charred remnants of the hammocks and bedding which had belonged to the sailors  hurrah shouted otto with a sudden burst of joy as he leaped forward and dragged out a quantity of the bedding heres whatll make fire at last  you said dom that burnt rag was capital tinder  well here we have burnt sheets enough to last us for years to come  thats true returned dominick laughing at his brothers enthusiasm lets go aft and see if we can stumble on something more  but the examination of the after part of the vessel yielded no fruit as we have said that part was sunk deeply so that only the cabin skylight was above water and although they both gazed intently down through the water with which the cabin was filled they could see nothing whatever  with a boathook which they found jammed in the port bulwarks they poked and groped about for a considerable time but hooked nothing and were finally obliged to return emptyhanded to the anxious pauline  otto did not neglect however to carry off a pocketful of burntsheeting by means of which with flint and steel they were enabled that night to eat their supper by the blaze of a cheering fire the human heart when young does not quickly or easily give way to despondency  although the rigondas had thus been cast on an island in the equatorial seas and continued week after week to dwell there living on wild fruits and eggs and such animals and birds as they managed to snare with no better shelter than a rocky cavern and with little prospect of a speedy release they did not by any means mourn over their lot  you see remarked otto one evening when his sister wondered with a sigh whether their mother had yet begun to feel very anxious about them you see she could not have expected to hear much before this time for the voyage to eastern seas is always a long one and it is well known that vessels often get blown far out of their courses by monsoons and simoons and baboons and such like southern hurricanes so motherkins wont begin to grow anxious i hope for a long time yet and its likely that before she becomes very uneasy about us some ship or other will pass close enough to see our signals and take us off so  by the way interrupted dominick have you tried to climb our signaltree as you said you would do to replace the flag that was blown away by last nights gale  of course not  theres no hurry dom answered otto who if truth must be told was not very anxious to escape too soon from his present romantic position and thought that it would be time enough to attract the attention of any passing vessel when they grew tired of their solitude  besides he continued with that tendency to selfdefence which is so natural to fallen humanity im not a squirrel to run up the straight stem of a branchless tree fifty feet high or more  no my boy youre not a squirrel but as i have often told you you are a monkeyat least monkey enough to accomplish your ends when you have a mind to  now really you are too hard returned otto who was busily employed as he spoke in boring a hole through a cocoanut to get at the milk you know very well that the branch of the neighbouring tree by which we managed to reach the branches of the signaltree has been blown away so that the thing is impossible for the stem is far too big to be climbed in the same way as i get up the cocoanut trees  that has nothing to do with the question retorted dominick you said you would try  otto looked with an injured expression at his sister and asked what she thought of a man being required to attempt impossibilities  not a mana monkey interjected his brother  whether man or monkey said pauline in her quiet but decided way if you promised to attempt the thing you are bound to try  well then i will try and here i drink success to the trial  otto applied the cocoanut to his lips and took a long pull  come along now the sooner i prove the impossibility the better  rising at once with an injured expression the boy led the way towards a little eminence close at hand on the top of which grew a few trees of various kinds the tallest of these being the signaltree to which dominick had fixed one of the halfburnt pieces of sheeting brought from the wreck  the stem was perfectly straight and seemingly smooth and as they stood at its foot gazing up to the fluttering little piece of rag that still adhered to it the impossibility of the ascent became indeed very obvious  now sir are you convinced said otto  no sir i am not convinced returned dominick  you said you would try  without another word otto grasped the stem of the tree with arms and legs and did his best to ascend it  he had in truth so much of the monkey in him and was so wiry and tough that he succeeded in getting up full twelve or fourteen feet before being utterly exhausted  at that point however he stuck but instead of slipping down as he had intended and again requesting to know whether his brother was convinced he uttered a sharp cry and shouted  oh  i say dom what am i to do  why slip down of course  but i cant  the bark seems to be made of needlejoints all sticking upwards  if i try to slip my trousers vill remain behind andandi cant hold on much longer  let go then and drop said dominick stepping close to the tree  oh no dont cried pauline with a little shriek if you do youll youll  bust  yes i know i shall shouted otto in despair  no fear cried dominick holding out his arms let go ill cat  he was stopped abruptly by receiving a shock from his little brother which sent him sprawling on his back  he sprang up however with a gasp  why boy i had no idea you were so heavy he exclaimed laughing  now dont you go boasting in future you prime minister that i cant knock you down said otto as he gathered himself up  but i say youre not hurt are you he added with a look of concern while pauline seized one of dominicks hands and echoed the question  not in the leastonly a little wind knocked out of me  moreover im not yet convinced that the ascent of that tree is an impossibility  youll have to do it yourself then said otto and let me warn you beforehand that though im very grateful to you i wont stand under to catch you  was it not you who said the other night at supper that whatever a fellow resolved to do he could accomplish and added that where theres a will theres a way  i rather think it was you dom who gave expression to those boastful sentiments  it may be so  at all events i hold them  come now lend a hand and help me  the work will take some time as we have no other implements than our gullyknives but well manage it somehow  can i not help you asked pauline  of course you can  sit down on the bank here and ill give you something to do presently  dominick went as he spoke to a small tree the bark of which was long tough and stringy  cutting off a quantity of this he took it to his sister and showed her how to twist some of it into stout cordage leaving her busily at work on this he went down to the nearest bamboo thicket and cut a stout cane  it took some time to cut for the bamboo was hard and the knife small for such work  from the end of the cane he cut off a piece about a foot in length  now otto my boy you split that into four pieces and sharpen the end of each piece while i cut off another foot of the bamboo  but what are you going to do with these bits of stick asked otto as he went to work with a will  you shall see  no use in wasting time with explanations just now  i read of the plan in a book of travels  theres nothing like a good book of travels to put one up to numerous dodges  im not so sure o that objected the boy  i have read robinson crusoe over and over and over again and i dont recollect reading of his having made use of pegs to climb trees with  your memory may be at fault perhaps  besides robinsons is not the only book of travels in the world returned dominick as he hacked away at the stout bamboo  no but it is certainly the best returned otto with enthusiasm and i mean to imitate its hero  dont do that my boy said dominick whatever you do dont imitate act well the part allotted to you whatever it may be according to the promptings of your own particular nature but dont imitate  humph  i wont be guided by your wise notions mr premier  all i know is that i wish my clothes would wear out faster so that i might dress myself in skins of some sort  i would have made an umbrella by this time but it never seems to rain in this country  ha  wait till the rainy season comes round and youll have more than enough of it  come weve got enough of pegs to begin with  go into the thicket now cut some of the longest bamboos you can find and bring them to me six or eight will doslender ones about twice the thickness of my thumb at the ground  while otto was engaged in obeying this order his brother returned to the signaltree  well done pina he said youve made some capital cordage  what are you going to do now brother  you shall see said dominick picking up a heavy stone to use as a hammer with which he drove one of the hard sharp pegs into the tree at about three feet from the ground  we have said the peg was a foot long  as he fixed it in the tree about three inches deep nine inches of it projected  on this he placed his foot and raised himself to test its strength  it bore his weight well  above this first peg he fixed a second three feet or so higher and then a third about level with his face  ah  i see exclaimed otto coming up at that moment with several long bamboos  but man dont you see that if one of these pegs should give way while youre driving those above it down you come by the run and if you should be high up at the time death will be probablelameness for life certain  dominick did not condescend to answer this remark but taking one of the bamboos stood it up close to the tree not touching but a few inches from the trunk and bound it firmly with the cord to the three pegs  thus he had the first three rounds or rungs of an upright ladder one side of which was the tree the other the bamboo  mounting the second of these rungs he drove in a fourth peg and fastened the bamboo to it in the same way and then taking another step he fixed a fifth peg  thus step by step he mounted till he had reached between fifteen and twenty feet from the ground where the upright bamboo becoming too slender another was called for and handed up by otto  this was lashed to the first bamboo as well as to three of the highest pegs and the operation was continued  when the thin part of the second long bamboo was reached a third was added and so the work progressed until the ladder was completed and the lower branches of the tree were gained  long before that point however otto begged to be allowed to continue and finish the work which his brother agreed to and finally the signal flag was renewed by the greater part of an old hammock being lashed to the top of the tree  but weeks and months passed away and the flag continued to fly without attracting the attention of any one more important or more powerful to deliver them than the albatross and the wild seamew  during this period the ingenuity and inventive powers of the party were taxed severely for being utterly destitute of tools of any kind with the exception of the gullyknives before mentioned they found it extremely difficult to fashion any sort of implement  if we had only an axe or a saw said otto one morning with a groan of despair what a difference it would make  isnt there a proverb said pauline who at the time was busy making cordage while otto was breaking sticks for the fire which says that we never know our mercies till we lose them  perhaps there is said otto and if there isnt i dont care  i dont like proverbs they always tell you in an owlishly wise sort o way what you know only too well at a time when youd rather not know it if possible  now if we only had an axeever so smalli would be able to fell trees and cut em up into big logs instead of spending hours every day searching for dead branches and breaking them across my knee its not a pleasant branch of our business i can tell you  but you have the variety of hunting said his sister and that you know is an agreeable as well as useful branch  humph  its not so agreeable as i used to think it would be when one has to run after creatures that run faster than onesself and one is obliged to use wooden spears and slings instead of guns  by the way what a surprising i may say awful effect a wellslung stone has on the side of a little pig  i came upon a herd yesterday in the canebrake and before they could get away i slung a big stone at them which caught the smallest of the squeakers fair in the side  the sudden squeal that followed the slap was so intense that i thought the life had gone out of the creature in one agonising gush but it hadnt so i slung another stone which took it in the head and dropt it  poor thing  i wonder how you can be so cruel  cruel exclaimed otto i dont do it for pleasure do i  pigs and other things have got to be killed if we are to live  well i suppose so returned pauline with a sigh at all events it would never do to roast and eat them alive  but about the axe  is there no ironwork in the wreck that might be fashioned into one  oh yes sister dear returned otto with a short laugh theres plenty of ironwork  some crowbars and ringbolts and an anchor or two but do you suppose that i can slice off a bit of an anchor in the shape of an axe as you slice a loaf  well no not exactly but i thought there might be some small flat pieces that could be made to do  what is your difficulty asked dominick returning from a hunting expedition at that moment and flinging down three brace of fowls on the floor of the golden cave  when the difficulty was stated he remarked that he had often pondered the matter while lying awake at night and when wandering in the woods and he had come to the conclusion that they must return to what was termed the stone period of history and make their axes of flint  otto shook his head and thought pinas idea of searching the wreck till they found a piece of flat metal was a more hopeful scheme  what do you say to trying both plans cried pauline with sudden animation  come as you have voluntarily elected me queen of this realm i command you sir dominick to make a flint axe without delay and you sir otto to make an iron one without loss of time  your majesty shall be obeyed replied her obedient subjects and to work they went accordingly the very next morning  dominick searched far and near for a flint large enough for his purpose he found several and tried to split them by laying them on a flat stone upheaving another stone as large as he could lift and hurling it down on them with all his might  sometimes the flint would fly from under the stone without being broken sometimes it would be crushed to fragments and at other times would split in a manner that rendered it quite unsuitable  at last however by patient perseverance he succeeded in splitting one so that an edge of it was thin and sharp while the other end was thick and blunt  delighted with this success he immediately cut with his knife a branch of one of the hardest trees he could find and formed it into an axehandle  some of paulines cord he tied round the middle of this and then split it at one end using his flint for the purpose and a stone for a hammer  the split extended only as far as the cord and he forced it open by means of little stones as wedges until it was wide enough to admit the thick end of his flint axehead  using a piece of soft stone as a pencil he now marked the form of the flint where it touched the wood exactly and worked at this with his knife as patiently as a chinaman for several hours until the wood fitted the irregularities and indentations of the flint to a nicety  this of itself caused the wood to hold the flinthead very firmly  then the wedges were removed and when the handle was bound all round the split part with cord and the flinthead enveloped in the same the whole thing became like a solid mass  gingerly and anxiously did dominick apply it to a tree  to his joy his axe caused the chips to fly in all directions  he soon stopped however for fear of breaking it and set off in triumph to the golden cave  meanwhile otto launching the raft went on board the wreck to search for a suitable bit of iron  as he had said there was plenty on board but none of the size or shape that he required and he was about to quit in despair when he observed the flat iron plates about five inches square and quarter of an inch thick with a large hole in the centre of each which formed the sockets that held the davits for suspending the ships boats  a crowbar enabled him after much trouble to wrench off one of these  a handspike was after some hours labour converted into a handle with one side cut flat  laying the plate on this he marked its exact size and then cut away the wood until the iron sank its own thickness into it  there were plenty of nails in the wreck with these he nailed the iron through its own nailholes to the hard handspike and still further to secure it he covered it with a little piece of flat wood which he bound firmly on with some cordage made by his sister from cocoanut fibre  as the iron projected on both sides of the handle it thus formed a doubleedged axe of the most formidable appearance  of course the edges required grinding down but this was a mere matter of detail to be accomplished by prolonged and patient rubbing on a stone  otto arrived triumphantly at the golden cave almost at the same moment with his brother and they both laid their axes at the feet of the queen  thanks my trusty vassals she said i knew you would both succeed and had prepared a royal feast against your return  to which i have brought a royal appetite your majesty said otto  in truth so have i added dominick  there was a good deal of jesting in all this nevertheless the trio sat down to supper that night highly pleased with themselves  while eating they discussed with much animation the merits of the axes and experienced no little difficulty in deciding which was the better tool at last pauline settled the matter by declaring that the iron axe being the strongest was perhaps the best but as it was not yet sharpened while dominicks was ready for immediate use the flint axe was in present circumstances better  so then being equal said otto and having had a splendid supper we will retire to rest  thus in devising means for increasing their comforts and supplying their daily necessities the days and weeks flew swiftly by    chapter five  stirring events and changes  an event was now pending over the castaway family which was destined to darken their bright sky and interrupt them in the even tenor of their way  up to this time the interest not to say delight with which they went about their daily avocations the fineness of the weather and the romance of their situation had prevented their minds from dwelling much on the flight of time and if pauline had not remembered the sundays by conscientiously keeping a daily record with a pencil on a piece of bark not one of them would have believed it possible that two months had elapsed since they were cast ashore  the sanguine hope too which filled the breast of each that a vessel would certainly pass by sooner or later and take them off prevented their being disturbed by gloomy anticipations of a long exile and it is probable that they would have gone on pleasantly for a much longer time improving the golden cave and exploring the reef and developing the resources of what otto styled the queendom without much caring about the future had not the event above referred to come upon them with the sudden violence of a thunderclap terminating their peaceful life in a way they had never anticipated and leading to changes which the wildest imagination could hardly have conceived  that event was indeed the arrival of a ship but it did not arrive in the manner that had been expected  it came in the dead of a dark night when the elements seemed to have declared fierce war against each other for it was difficult to say whether the roaring of the sea the crashing of the thunder or the flashing of the forked lightning was most tremendous  a previous storm or two of a mild type having warned our trio that paradise had not been quite regained even in that lovely region they had fitted something like a front formed of wreckage to the golden cave and this had up to that time formed a sufficient protection against slight inclemencies of weather but on this particular night the gusts of wind were so violent and shook the front of their dwelling so much that both dominick and his brother found it impossible to sleep their sister however lay undisturbed because she reposed in an inner chamber which had been screened off with broken planks and these not only checked draughts but deadened sounds  im afraid our wall will come down said dominick raising himself at last on one elbow and gazing at the wooden erection uneasily  oh let it come growled otto who had been so frequently checked while dropping into slumber that night that he was getting quite cross  not feeling quite so regardless of consequences his brother dominick arose and endeavoured to prop the weak part of the structure with an additional piece of timber  he had accomplished his object and was about to lie down again to rest when a terrible cry was heard which rose above the roaring of the storm  there seemed something so appalling in it and at the same time so unaccountable in that solitary spot that dominicks heart almost stood still for a moment with superstitious fear  otto also heard the cry and sat bolt upright while drowsiness was effectually banished from his brain  dom did you hear that he asked in a solemn voice  i should think i did replied his brother in a low tone  the cave being very dark neither could see the other distinctly  they sat silent for a few moments anxiously listening for a repetition of the cry  move quietly otto said dominick as he crept towards their little door it evidently has not awaked pina and we may as well let her lie still till we find out what it is  youre not going out dom asked otto in anxiety  yes why not  bebecauseitit may bebesomethingawful  it must be something awful and that is just why i am going out come you didnt use to be a coward  this was touching the boy on a tender point  he was indeed by no means a coward when the danger he had to face was comprehensible and obvious but when the danger happened to be incomprehensible as well as invisible his courage was not quite as high as might have been desired the taunt of his brother stirred up his pride however  he rose and followed him in silence with stern resolve and a quaking heart  on issuing from their shelter the brothers had to lean heavily against the blast to prevent their being swept away  seeking the shelter of a bush they gazed around them but saw nothing save a dim appearance of bending trees and scudding foam  the cry may have come from the beach lets go down said dominick leaving the shelter of the bush and pushing forward  better go back was on ottos lips but he repressed the words and followed  there was not light enough to enable them to see objects on land but whatever chanced to be pictured against the dark sky became distinctly visible as a dark object  the old familiar wreck was therefore seen the moment they cleared the bushes that fringed the bay but close to it was another object which was very unfamiliar indeed to their eyes  it accounted for the cry and caused a gush of mingled feelings in the breasts of the brothers  let us now good reader wing our flight out to sea and backwards a little in time  on that stormy night of which we treat a large emigrant ship was scudding before the gale almost under bare poles part of her sails and rigging had been carried away the rest of her was more or less damaged  the officers having had no reliable observation for several days were not sure of their exact position on the great ocean and the captain being well aware of the danger of those seas was filled with anxiety  to add to his troubles the crew had become slightly mutinous and some of the emigrantsof whom there were upwards of three hundred on boardsided with the crew  it was even whispered that the chief mate was at the bottom of a plot to murder the captain and seize the ship  for what purpose of course no one could tell and indeed there was no apparent ground for the rumour beyond the fact that the matemalines by namewas a surly taciturn man with a scowling though handsome visage and a powerful frame  but whatever of truth might have been in these rumours was never brought to light for an accident occurred during the gale which put the commander of the vessel beyond the power of earthly foes  one of the larger ropes of the vessel snapt and the heavy block attached to it swung against the captain with such violence as to kill him on the spot the momentary confusion which followed the disaster distracted the attention of the steersman and a heavy sea was shipped by which the captains body was swept overboard  no attempt was made to lower a boat or check the ship  even the unskilled emigrants understood that no boat could live in such a sea and that rescue was impossible  the vessel held on her wild course as if nothing had happened  malines being now in command issued an order that all the emigrants should go below and the hatches be secured  the women and children and most of the men were already in their uncomfortable quarters below hatches but a group of hardylooking fellows who held on to ropes and stanchions near the windlass refused to move  among them was a remarkably powerful woman whose tongue afforded presumptive evidence that she had been born in the emerald isle  well stop where we be master said one of the emigrants with a quiet but resolute air  thats right joe stick up  we aint slaves said another  to this last speaker malines turned fiercely and knocked him down then seizing him by the collar and dragging him to the hatchway he thrust him below  it may be remarked that the man thus roughly treated redding by namewas a little man  bullies usually select little men when inclined to display their courage  shame on yez exclaimed the irish woman clenching her huge fist  if it wasnt that im a poor widdy woman idid  howld yer tongue mother lynch whispered a lively youth of about nineteen by her side who obviously hailed from the same country  its not aggravatin him thatll do him good  let him be darlin and hell soon blow the steam off  an what does it matter to me teddy malone whether he blows the steam off or keeps it down till he bursts his biler  is it a descendant o the royal family o munster asll howld her tongue whin she sees cruelty and injustice  without paying the slightest regard to this royal personage malines returned to the group of men and repeated his order to go below but they did not go and he seized a handspike with a view to enforce his commands  he hesitated however on observing that the man named joe after quietly buttoning his coat was turning up his wristbands as if in preparation for a pugilistic encounter  lookee here now mister malines said joe with a mild even kindly expression which was the very reverse of belligerent i was allers a lawabidin man myself and dont have no love for fightin but when im ordered to go into a dark hole and have the lid shut down on me an locked i feels a sort of objection dee see  if you lets us be usll let you be  if otherwise  joe stopped abruptly grinned and clenched his enormous fists  mr malines was one of those wise men who know when they have met their match  his knockings down and overbearing ways always stopped short at that line where he met courage and strength equal or superior to his own  he possessed about the average of bulldog courage and more than the average of physical strength but observing that joe was gifted with still more of both these qualities he lowered the handspike and with a sneer replied  oh wellplease yourselves  it matters nothing to me if you get washed overboard  make all fast lads he added turning to his crew who stood prepared for what one of them styled a scrimmage  malines returned to the quarterdeck followed by a halfsuppressed laugh from some of the mutinous emigrants  you see david remarked joe in a quiet tone to a man beside him as he turned down his cuffs i think from the look of him that if we was to strike on rocks or run on shore or take to sinking or anything o that sort the mate is mean enough to look arter hisself and leave the poor things below to be choked in a hole  so you an me must keep on deck so as to let em all out if need be  right joe right you are  the man who thus replied bore such a strong resemblance to joe in grave kindliness of expression and colossal size of frame that even a stranger could not fail to recognise them as brothers and such they werein truth they were twins having first seen the light together just thirty years before  there was this difference in the character of the brothers however that joe binney was the more intellectual and resolute of the two  david binney recognising this fact and loving his brother with all the fervour of a strong nature was in the habit of looking up to him for advice and submitting to him as if he had been an elder brother  nevertheless david was not without a mind of his own and sometimes differed in opinion with joe  he even occasionally disputed but never with the slightest tinge of illfeeling  while the brothers were conversing in an undertone on the dangers of the sea and the disagreeables of a forecabin the mass of unfortunates below were cowering in their berths rendered almost forgetful of the stifling atmosphere and the wailing of sick children by the fear of shipwreck as they listened with throbbing hearts to the howling wind and rattling cordage overhead and felt the tremendous shocks when the good ship was buffeted by the sea  near to joe binney stood one of the sailors on outlook  he was a darkcomplexioned savagelooking man who had done more than any one else to foment the bad feeling that had existed between the captain and his men  ye look somethin skeared hugh morris said joe observing that the lookout was gazing over the bow with an expression of alarm  breakers ahead roared the man at that momentporthardaport  the order was sharply repeated and promptly obeyed and the vessel came round in time to escape destruction on a ledge of rocks over which the water was foaming furiously  instantly malines went forward and began to give hurried directions to the steersman  the danger was avoided though the escape was narrow and the low rocks were seen passing astern while the sea ahead seemed to be free from obstruction as far at least as the profound darkness permitted them to see  theyll be all drowned like rats in a hole if we strike muttered the sailor hugh morris as if speaking to himself  not if i can help it said joe binney who overheard the remark  as he spoke he went to the little companion hatch or door to the forecabin and tried to open it but could not  here david he cried lend a hand  applying their united strengthwith some assistance from teddy malone and earnest encouragement from mrs lynchthey succeeded in bursting open the hatch  hallo there shouted joe in a voice that would have been creditable to a boatswain come on deck if ye dont want to be drownded  hooroo added malone were goin to the bottom  look alive wid ye  ay an bring up the childers yelled mrs lynch  dont lave wan o thim below  of course the poor emigrants were not slow to obey these startling orders  the state of affairs was so serious that malines either did not see or did not care for what was going on  he stood on the forecastle looking out intently ahead  land on the starboard beam shouted morris suddenly  the mate was on the point of giving an order to the steersman when he observed land looming on the port bow  instantly he saw that all hope was over  they were steering to inevitable destruction between two ledges of rock  what he would have done in the circumstances no one can tell because before he had time to act the vessel struck with great violence and the terrorstricken passengers gave vent to that appalling cry of fear which had so suddenly aroused dominick rigonda and his brother  as the vessel remained hard and fast with her bow thrust high on the rocks the emigrants and crew found a partial refuge from the violence of the waves on the forecastle  hence the first wild shriek of fear was not repeated  in a few minutes however a wave of greater size than usual came rushing towards the vessel  fortunately most of the emigrants failed to realise the danger but the seamen were fully alive to it  its all over with us exclaimed the mate in a sort of reckless despair  but he was wrong  the great billow which he expected would dash the vessel in piecesand which in nine cases out of ten would have done solifted the wreck so high as to carry it almost completely over the ledge on which it had struck leaving the stern high on the rocks while the bow was plunged into the partlyprotected water on the other side  the sudden descent of the forecastle induced the belief an many of the emigrants minds that they were about to go headlong to the bottom and another cry of terror arose but when they found that their place of refuge sank no further than to a level with the water most of them took heart again and began to scramble up to the quarterdeck as hastily as they had before scrambled to the forecastle  something like land ahead observed hugh morris who stood close to the mate  i dont see it returned the latter gruffly for he was jealous of the influence that morris had over the crew and during the whole voyage had treated him harshly  it may be there although you dont see it retorted hugh with a feeling of scorn which he made no attempt to conceal  sure i sees somethin movin on the wather exclaimed mrs lynch who during the occurrences just described had held on to a belaying pin with the tenacity and strength of an octopus  its the wather movin in yer own eyes mother said malone who stood beside his amazonian countrywoman  at that moment a halloo was heard faintly in the distance and soon after a raft was seen approaching guided apparently by two men  raft ahoy  where dee hail from shouted the mate  from nowhere came back promptly in a boys ringing voice  youve got on a coral reef shouted a powerful voice which we need scarcely say was that of dominick rigonda but youre safe enough now the last wave has shoved you over into sheltered water  youre in luck  well soon put you on shore  an island i suppose said malines as the raft came alongside  what may be its name  got no name that i know of as far as i know its uninhabited and probably unknown  only three of us herewrecked like yourselves  if you have boats lower them and ill pilot you to land  ohone groaned mrs lynch in solemn despair as she tried to see the speaker whom darkness rendered almost invisible  an unbeknown island uninhabited by nobody  boys we are done for intirely  didnt i say this would be the end of it when we made up our minds to go to say  no one seemed inclined just then to dispute the prophetic reminiscences of the widow for the order had been given to get ready one of the boats  turning to the emigrants who were now clustering on the fore part of the vessel malines condescending to adopt a more respectful tone addressed them as follows  now let me tell you one and all that your voyage has come to an end sooner than i expected  our ship is wrecked but were out of danger and must go ashore an live as best we can or die if we cant live where we are i dont know and dont care for it dont much matter its an island it seems and three people who have been wrecked before us are all its population  as it is too dark to go ashore comfortably tonight i would advise you to go below again an turn in till daylight  you may make your minds easy for theres no fear of our going to the bottom now  sure an youre right there murmured teddy malone for arent we at the bottom already  you may all do as you please however continued the mate after a lowtoned remark from one of the crew for my command has come to an end with the loss of the ship  when the mate ceased speaking there was a brief pause for the unfortunate emigrants had been so long accustomed to conform to the strict discipline of the ship that they felt like sheep suddenly deprived of a shepherd or soldiers bereft of their officers when thus left to think for themselves  then the selfsufficient and officious among them began to give advice and to dispute noisily as to what they should do so that in a few minutes their voices mingling with the gale and the cries of terrified children caused such a din that the strong spirit of the widow lynch was stirred within her inducing her to raise her masculine voice in a shout that silenced nearly all the rest  thats right mother cried young malone howld yer tongues boys and lets hear what the widdy has to say  isnt it herself has got the great mindnot to mintion the body  shut your murphytrap teddy retorted the widow an heres what ive got to say  we must have only wan man to guide us if we are to get on at all  too many cooks ye knows well enough is sure to spile the broth  let joe binney speak and the rest of ee howld yer tongues if ye can  thus invited modest joe gave it as his opinion that the emigrants could not do better than follow the advice of muster malinesgo below turn in and wait till daylight  he added further that he would count it a favour if muster malines would continue in command of the party at least till they all got ashore  this little compliment to the man whom he had so recently defied had a softening influence on the mate and the proposal was well received by the people who even during the few minutes of anarchy which had prevailed were led to appreciate the value of order and government  you are right binney said the mate  i would advise you all good people to go below and rest as well as you can while i and those who choose to act under me will go ashore and make the best possible arrangements for your landing in the morning  now why dont ye do what yeer towld at wanst cried mrs lynch who had evidently made up her mind that the reins of government were not to be entirely given up to the mate  its not wishin are ye to get wetter than ye are aready  go below ivery wan of ye  like a meek flock the women and children obeyed the mandate being absolutely in bodily fear of the woman while most of the men followed them with a laugh or a little chaff according to temperament  before the latter had left the deck malines suggested that joe binney and his brother david should accompany him on shore that night to represent the emigrants as it were and assist him in the proposed arrangements  besides he added there is just the possibility that we may fall into a trap  we know nothing about the man who has come off to us except his voice so that it will be wise to land with some of our best men armed  of course the brothers had no objection to this plan and accordingly they with the mate and four of the ships crewall armed with cutlasses and pistolsgot into one of the boats and were lowered into the water on the lee side of the vessel where dominick and otto had been quietly awaiting the end of the foregoing discussions  in a few minutes they reached the shore and then dominick shook hands with them and welcomed them to the islands which he said we have named refuge islands  run up to the cave otto he whispered while the party was engaged in drawing up the boat  stir up the fire and rouse pinatell her to prepare to receive company  shell be as much puzzled as if i told her to prepare to receive cavalry muttered the boy as he ran up to the cave  hallo  pina rouse up old girl he shouted bursting into the cave and falling on his knees before the embers of the fire which he soon blew up into a flame  i say pina hallo  pina  piiiina  dear me otto what is wrong asked the sleepy voice of pauline from behind her screen  wrong cried her brother nothings wrongthat is everythings wrong but dont be afraid old girl alls right  dress as fast as you can and prepare for company  what do you mean cried the girl by that time thoroughly aroused and somewhat alarmed by ottos words and excitement  cant explain  no time  get up make yourself presentable and come out of your den  as he spoke pauline lifted the curtain door of her apartment and stepped into the outer cave which was by that time all aglow with the ruddy blaze  do you call yourself presentable asked otto laughing why your hair is raised like the back of a wild cat  it is only right to say that the boy did not do his sister justice  an old shawl thrown hastily on and descending in confused folds around her slight graceful figure invested her with an air of classic simplicity while her pretty face surrounded by a wealth of dishevelled but beautiful hair was suggestive of something very much the reverse of a wild cat  are you prepared sister for a stunning surprise said otto quickly for he heard the approaching footsteps of the party  im prepared for anything said pauline her lustrous eyes and her little mouth opening simultaneously for she also heard the numerous footfalls outside  tis well cried otto starting up and assuming a heroic attitude as he waved his right hand toward the door of the cavern no time to explain  enter dominick with band of robbers headed by their captain amid shrieking wind forked lightning and peals of thunder  as he spoke pauline despite her surprise could scarcely refrain from laughter for ottos words were fulfilled almost to the letter  amid a strife of elements that caused their frail erections to tremble the little door burst open and dominick stooping low to save his head entered  he was followed by the gaunt dark form of malines who in rough garments and long fishermens boots with pistols in belt and cutlass by his side was a particularly good representative of a robbercaptain  following him came the still more gigantic joe binney and his equally huge brother david after which trooped in the boats crew one by one  as each man entered he stood stock stilldumb petrified with astonishmentas he gazed saucereyed at pauline  bereft of speech and motion she returned the gaze with interest  oh it was a rare treat to otto  his little bosom heaved with delight as he watched the shipwrecked men enter one after another and become petrefactions  some of the sailors even dropped their lower jaws with wonder  dominick who in the bustle of action had not thought of the surprise in store for his visitors burst into a hearty fit of laughter  it was well got up otto he said at last  no it wasnt dom  i do assure you it was not got up at all but came about in the most natural manner  well got up or not returned dominick here you are friends in what we have styled our golden cave and this is my sister pauline allow me to introduce you pina to part of a shipwrecked crew  the youths laughter and the introduction which followed seemed to disenchant the mariners who recovering selfpossession with a deep sigh became sheepish in bearing and seemed inclined to beat a retreat but our heroine quickly put them at their ease  with a natural tact and grace of manner which had the appearance of but was not meant for dignity she advanced and offered her little hand to malines who seemed to fear that he might crush it unintentionally so slight was the shake he gave it  you are heartily welcome to our cavern she said  im so grieved to hear that you have been wrecked  dont mention it miss  not worth speaking of i assure you were quite used to it replied malines not knowing very well what he said  the ice however was broken  from this point all went on as otto said swimmingly  the mate began to relate the circumstances of the recent wreck while pauline and otto spread the remains of their supper before the men and set about roasting the fowls that had been intended for the morrows breakfast  before long the gale began to abate and the sailors went out with dominick to select a spot on which the emigrants might encamp being aided in this work by a struggling and fitful moonlight  after that malines went back with his party to the ship and dominick returned with otto to court slumber in the golden cave    chapter six  shipwrecked emigrants and horrified conspirators  the scene which presented itself on the morning after the storm is not easily described and the change to the trio who had up to that time lived so peacefully on refuge islands reef was so great that they found it difficult at first to believe it was other than a dream  on awaking indeed otto saluted his brother with the exclamation  o dom ive had such a comical dream  indeed my boy said dominick i fear it was no dream but a reality  at this otto suddenly sprang up and ran out to relieve his mind on the point  a few seconds sufficed  on clearing the bushes he beheld the new wreck lying not far from the old one and saw from the crowds of people who were being put into the boats that the emigrant ship had been no mere creature of his imagination  it was evident that the boat which had just quitted the vessels side contained the first band of emigrants for the only people yet landed were a few men who busied themselves in putting up a rude shelter for the women and children and in kindling fires for the preparation of breakfast on a little mound between two and three hundred yards from the golden cave  by that time the storm had blown itself out and the rising sun was mounting into a cloudless blue sky and covering the sea with dazzling ripples which looked as if the very water were laughing with joy at the sudden change from darkness and fury to light and peace  conspicuous among those who worked on shore was the gigantic form of joe binney  considering him an old acquaintance  otto ran up to him and shook hands  how many emigrants are there of you he asked  three hundred more or less master but i aint rightly sure theres such a many that its difficult to count em when they are all amovin to and fro  here joe catch hold o this post an keep it steady till i make it fast said hugh morris the seaman who has been described as one of the most turbulent among the men  while joe assisted in the erection of the canvas booth or shelter he gave otto a good deal of information regarding the vessel the emigrants the crew and the misunderstandings which had occurred previous to the captains death  its well for one man that weve bin wrecked anyhow remarked morris stepping back with an artistic air to survey his handiwork  you mean the young doctor said joe  thats who i mean returned morris  doctor john marsh  hes the only man in the ship thats worth his salt but i fear hes a doomed man  i hope not hugh though there are one or two men on board worth more than their salt said joe with a peculiar smile as he returned to the care of a large kettle of beans from which the sailor had called him  on otto inquiring what was the matter with the doctor joe binney explained  hes been ill amost since we left england owin to a fall he had in tryin to save one o the childn as was tumblin down the afterhatch he saved the child but broke one or two of his own ribs an the broken ends must have damaged his lungs for ever since hes bin spittin blood an wearin away till we can hardly believe hes the same stout hearty active young feller that came aboord at gravesend  spite of his hurt hes bin goin among us quite cheerfullike doin the best he could for the sick but as morris says he looks like a doomed man praps gittin ashore may do him good  you see bein the only doctor in the ship he couldnt attend to hisself as well as might be mayhap  while joe and otto were conversing the first boat load of emigrants landed consisting chiefly of women and children  dr marsh was also among them in order that as he said with quiet pleasantry he might attend to the sanitary arrangements of the camp in the new land though all who saw him quit the wreck were under the sorrowful impression that the new land would prove to be in his case a last restingplace  there was something peculiarly attractive in the manly handsome face of this young disciple of aesculapius worn as it was by long sickness and suffering and otto fell in love with him at first sight  there can be no doubt that some human beings are so constituted as to powerfully attract others by their mere physical conformation and expression without reference to character or conductindeed before character or conduct can possibly be known  and when this peculiar conformation and expression is coupled with delicacy of health and obvious suffering the attractive influence becomes irresistible  let us thank god that such is the case  blind unreasoning affection is a grand foundation on which to build a mighty superstructure of good offices kindly acts and tender feelings mingled it may be with loving forbearance and occasional suffering which shall be good to the souls of the lover as well as the loved one  anyhow when otto saw dr marsh helped almost lifted out of the boat observed him give a pitiful little smile and heard him utter some mild pleasantry to those who assisted him he experienced a gush of feeling such as had never before inflated his reckless little bosom and something like waterto his great astonishmentcaused interference with his vision  running forward just as the widow lynch was officiously thrusting her warmhearted attentions on the invalid he accosted the doctor and offered to escort him to the golden cave  and we may here inform the reader that the involuntary affection of our little hero met with a suitable return for dr marsh also fell in love with otto at first sight  his feelings however were strongly mingled with surprise  my boy he said with painfully wideopen eyes from what part of the sky have you dropt  well not being a falling star or a rocketstick i cannot claim such high descentbut hasnt the mate told you about us returned otto  here widow lynch broke in with  towld him about you  av course he hasnt  he dont throuble his hid to tell much to any wan an sure wasnt the doctor slaapin whin he returned aboord i the night an wasnt i nursin of im and dee think any wan could git at im widout my lave  otto thought that certainly no one could easily accomplish that feat and was about to say so when dr marsh said remonstratively  now my dear widow lynch do leave me to the care of this new friend who i am sure is quite able to assist me and do you go and look after these poor women and children  they are quite helpless without your aid  look your favourite browneyes will be in the water if you dont run  the child of a poor widow which had been styled browneyes by the doctor because of its gorgeous optics was indeed on the point of taking an involuntary bath as he spoke  mrs lynch seeing the danger rushed tumultuously to the rescue leaving the doctor to ottos care  dont let me lean too heavily on you he said looking down im bigboned you see and longlegged though rather thin  pooh said otto looking up youre as light as a feather and im as strong as a horsea little horse at least  youd better not go to the camp yet they are not ready for you and that sweet little delicate creature you call widow lynch is quite able to manage them all  come up with me to the cave  but has nobody said a word about us  not a soul  as the widow told you i was asleep when the mate returned to the wreck  indeed it is not very long since i awoke  i did hear some mention in passing of a few people being on the island but i thought they referred to savages  perhaps they were not far wrong said otto with a laugh  i do feel pretty savage sometimes and dominick is awful when he is roused but we cant count pauline among the savages  dominick  pauline exclaimed the doctor  my good fellow explain yourself and let us sit down on this bank while you do so  im so stupidly weak that walking only a few yards knocks me up  well only two or three yards further will bring you to our cave which is just beyond that cluster of bushes but it may be as well to enlighten you a little before introducing you  in a few rapid sentences otto explained their circumstances and how they came to be there  he told his brief tale in sympathetic ears  and your own name asked the doctor is  otto rigonda  well otto my boy you and i shall be friends i know iti feel it  and im sure of it responded the enthusiastic boy grasping the hand of the invalid and shaking it almost too warmly  but come i want to present you to my sister  dominick is already among the emigrants for i saw him leave the cave and go down to the camp when you were disputing with that female grampus  come dont begin our friendship by speaking disrespectfully of one of my best friends said the doctor rising but for widow lynchs tender nursing i dont think i should be here now  ill respect and reverence her henceforth and for ever said otto but here we arethis is the golden cave  now youll have to stoop because our door was made for short men like meand for humble long ones like my brother  ill try to be a humble long one said the doctor as he stooped and followed otto into the cave  pauline was on her knees in front of the fire with her back to the door as they entered  she was stooping low and blowing at the flames vigorously  o otto she exclaimed without looking round this fire will break my heart  it wont light  more company pina said her brother  pauline sprang up and turned round with flushed countenance and disordered hair and again otto had the ineffable delight of seeing human beings suddenly reduced to that condition which is variously described as being stunned thunderstruck petrified and struck all of a heap with surprise  pauline was the first to recover selfpossession  really otto it is too bad of you to take one by surprise so  excuse me sirno doubt you are one of the unfortunates who have been wrecked  i have much pleasure in offering you the hospitality of our humble home  pauline spoke at first half jestingly but when she looked full at the thin worn countenance of the youth who stood speechless before her she forgot surprise and everything else in a feeling of pity  but you have been ill she continued sympathetically this wreck must havepray sit down  she placed a little stool for her visitor beside the fire  if dr john marsh had spoken the words that sprang to his lips he would have begun with angelic creature but he suppressed his feelings and only stammered  your bbrother miss rigonda must have a taste for taking people by surprise for he did not tell me thatthatii mean he did not prepare me forforyou are right  i think i had better sit down for i have as you perceive been very ill and am rather weak andand in the circumstances such an unexpecteda  at this critical moment dominick fortunately entered the cave and rescued the doctor from the quicksand in which he was floundering  oh you must be the very man i want he said grasping his visitor by the hand  that is strange returned the doctor with a languid smile seeing that you have never met me before  true my good sir nevertheless i may venture to say that i know you well for theres a termagant of an irish woman down at the camp going about wringing her hands shouting out your good qualities in the most pathetic tones and giving nobody a moments peace because she does not know what has become of you  having a suspicion that my brother must have found you and brought you here i came to see  but pray may i ask your name for the irish woman only describes you as doctor dear  allow me to introduce him cried otto as an old friend of minedr marsh  dominick looked at his brother in surprise  otto is right said the doctor with a laugh at least if feeling may be permitted to do duty for time in gauging the friendship  well dr marsh we are happy to make your acquaintance despite the sadness of the circumstances said dominick and will do all we can for you and your friends meanwhile may i ask you to come to the camp and relieve the mind of your worshipper for i can scarcely call her less  poor dr marsh feeling greatly exhausted by excitement as much as by exertion was on the point of excusing himself and begging his host to fetch the widow up to the cave when he was saved the trouble by the widow herself whose voice was just then heard outside  whats that yer sayin joe she exclaimed in a remonstrative tone ye seed im go into that rabbithole  never  dont tell me  arrah its on his hands an knees hed have to do it  the voice which replied was pitched in a much deeper and softer key but it was heard distinctly to say ay widdy lynch thats the door i seed him an a boy go through so yed better rap at it an inquire  faix an thats jist what ill do though i dont half belave ye  she was about to apply her large red knuckles to the door in question when her intention was frustrated and her doubts were scattered by the door opening and dominick presenting himself  come in mrs lynch come in  your doctor is here alive and well  well is itah  i wish he was  are ye there darlin  yes yes came from within in a laughing voice  here i am mrs lynch all right and comfortable  come in  being excessively tall the widow was obliged like others to stoop to enter but being also excessively broad she only got her head and shoulders through the doorway and then unlike others she stuck fast by dint however of a good pull from dominick and a gentle push from joe she was got inside without quite carrying away the structure which the gale of the preceding night had spared  och tis a quare place intirely and there is some disadvantage in bein bigthank ye kindly sirbut on the whole  she got no further for at that moment her sharp little grey eyes fell on pauline and once again ottos heart was stirred to its profoundest depths by the expressive glare that ensued  indeed dominick and marsh were equally affected and could not help laughing  ha ye may laugh said the widow with profound solemnity but if its not dramin i am what father macgrath says about ghosts is true and  i hope you dont take me for a ghost mrs lynch said pauline stepping forward with a kindly smile and holding out her hand  no cushla  i dont returned the widow accepting the hand tenderly sure its more like a ghost the doctor is in spite of his larfin but wonders ll niver cease  ill lave im wid an aisy mind for hes in good hands  now joe clear out o the door like a good man an let me through  theyll be wantin me at the camp  a good haul joe im tough no fear o me comin to pieces  och but its a poor cabin an irish pig wouldnt thank ye for it  murmuring similar uncomplimentary remarks mingled with expressions of surprise the voice of the woman gradually died away and the people in the golden cave were left to discuss their situation and form hasty plans for the present emergency  at first of course they could do little else than make each other partially acquainted with the circumstances which had so strangely thrown them together but dominick soon put an end to this desultory talk  you see it will take all our time he said between this and sunset to get the emigrants comfortably under canvas or some sort of shelter  true assented dr marsh and it would never do with so many women and children some of whom are on the sick list to leave them to the risk of exposure to another storm like that which has just passed  is your island subject to such  by no means answered dominick  it has a splendid climate  this gale is quite exceptional  nevertheless we cannot tell when the next may burst on us  come otto you and i will go down to the camp  now dr marsh you must remain here  i can see without being told that you are quite unfit to help us  i know that it is hard to be condemned to inaction when all around are busy but reflect how many patients you have solemnly warned that their recovery would depend on implicit obedience to the doctors orders  divide yourself in two now and as a doctor give yourself strict orders to remain quiet  hm  gladly would i divide myself was the doctors reply if while i left the patient half to act the invalid i could take the impatient half down to the camp to aid you  but i submit  the days of my once boasted strength are gone  i feel more helpless than a mouse  there was something quite pitiful in the halfhumorous look and the weary sigh with which the poor youth concluded his remarks and otto was so touched that he suddenly suggested the propriety of his staying behind and taking care of him  why you conceited creature cried dominick of what use could you be  besides dont you think that pina is a sufficiently good nurse  otto humbly admitted that she was  dr marsh glancing at her pretty face on which at the moment there beamed an expression of deep sympathy also admitted that she was but being a man of comparatively few words he said nothing  it was a busy day for dominick and his brother  not only had they to counsel and advise with the unfortunate emigrants as to the best position for the temporary encampment with reference to wood and water as well as to assist with their own hands in the erection of tents made of torn sails and huts and booths composed of broken planks and reeds but they had to answer innumerable questions from the inquisitive as to their own history from the anxious as to the probabilities of deliverance from the practical as to the resources of the islands and from the idiotic as to everything in general and nothing in particular in addition to which they had to encourage the timid to correct the mistaken and to remonstrate with or resist the obstinate also to romp a little with the children as they recovered their spirits quiet the babies as they recovered their powers of lung and do a little amateur doctoring for the sick in the absence of the medical man  in all these varied occupations they were much aided by the widow lynch who instead of proving to be as they had expected a troublesome termagant turned out to be a softhearted kindly enthusiastic sympathetic woman with a highly uneducated unbalanced mind a powerfully constituted and masculine frame and a will of her own  in this last particular she did not differ much from the rest of the human species but she was afflicted with an unusually strong desire to assert it  very like mrs lynch in the matters of kindly softheartedness and sympathy was mrs welsha poor gentle delicate englishwoman the wife of a great hulking crossgrained fellow named abel who was a carpenter by trade and an idler by preference  mrs welsh was particularly good as a sicknurse and a cook in which capacities she made herself extremely useful  about midday mrs welsh having prepared a glorious though simple meal for her section of the emigrant band and the other sections having been ministered to more or less successfully by their more or less capable cooks dominick and otto went up to the golden cave to dinner which they well knew the faithful pauline would have ready waiting for them  what a day we have had to be sure said dominick as they walked along and im as hungry as a kangaroo  without noticing the unreasonableness of supposing that longlegged creature to be the hungriest of animals otto declared that he was in the same condition if not more so  on opening the door they were checked by the expression of paulines face the speaking eyes of which and the silent mouth were concentrated into an unmistakable hushwhich was emphasised by a significant forefinger  whats wrong whispered dominick anxiously  sleeping murmured paulineshe was too good a nurse to whisper pointing to the invalid who overcome with the nights exposure and the mornings excitement had fallen into a profound slumber on ottos humble couch  this was a rather severe and unexpected trial to otto who had come up to the cave brimming over with camp news for paulines benefit  he felt that it was next to impossible to relate in a whisper all the doings and sayings comical and otherwise that he had seen and heard that day  to eat his dinner and say nothing seemed equally impossible  to awaken the wearied sleeper was out of the question  however there was nothing for it but to address himself to the suppression of his feelings  probably it was good for him to be thus selfdisciplined certainly it was painful  he suffered chiefly at the top of the noseinside behind his eyesthat being the part of the safetyvalve where bursts of laughter were checked and more than once while engaged in a whispering commentary on the amiable widow lynch the convulsions within bade fair to blow the nasal organ off his face altogether  laughter is catching  pauline and dominick ere long began to wish that otto would hold his tongue  at last some eccentricity of joe binney or his brother or mrs lynch we forget which raised the pressure to such a pitch that the safetyvalves of all three became ineffective  they all exploded in unison and poor marsh was brought to consciousness surprise and a sitting posture at the same instant  im afraid he said rather sheepishly that ive been sleeping  you have doctor and a right good sleep youve had said dominick rising and placing a stool for the invalid  we ought to apologise for disturbing you but come sit down and dine  you must be hungry by this time  indeed i am  the land air seems to have had a powerful effect on me already  truly it must remarked pauline else you could not have fallen asleep in the very middle of my glowing description of our island home  did i really do that said the doctor with an air of selfreproach  indeed you did but in the circumstances you are to be excused  and i hope added dominick that youll have many a good sleep in our golden cave  golden cave indeed echoed the invalid in thought for his mind was too much taken up just then with pauline to find vent in speech  a golden cave it will be to me for evermore  it is of no use mincing the matter dr john marsh after being regarded by his friends at home as hopelessly unimpressiblein short an absolute womanhaterhad found his fate on a desolate isle of the southern seas he had fallennay let us be justhad jumped over head and ears in love with pauline rigonda  dr marsh was no sentimental dieaway noodle who halfashamed halfproud of his condition displays it to the semicontemptuous world  no after disbelieving for many years in the power of woman to subdue him he suddenly and manfully gave insprang up high into the air spiritually and so to speak turning a sharp somersault went headlong down deep into the flood without the slightest intention of ever again returning to the surface  but of this mighty upheaval and overturning of his sentiments he betrayed no symptom whatever excepting two bright spotsone on either cheekwhich might easily have been mistaken for the effects of weakness or recent excitement or bad health or returning hunger calmly he set to work on the viands before him with unusual appetite conversing earnestly meanwhile with dominick and otto on the gravity of their situation and bestowing no more attention upon pauline than was barely consistent with good breeding insomuch that that pretty young creature began to feel somewhat aggrieved  considering all the care she had so recently bestowed on him she came to the conclusion in short that he was by no means as polite as at first she had supposed him to be  by degrees the conversation about the present began to give place to discussions as to the future and when dominick and otto returned for their evening meal at sunset bringing with them mr malines the mate and joe binney and his brother david and hugh morris as being representative men of the emigrants and ships crew the meeting resolved itself into a regular debating society  at this point pauline deserted them and went down to the camp to cultivate the acquaintance of the widow lynch mrs welsh and the other female and infantine members of the wrecked party  for my part said malines i shall take one o the boats launch it in the lagoon and go over to the big island follow me who may for it is clear that theres not room for us all on this strip of sand  i dont see that objected hugh morris  seems to me as theres space enough for all of us if were not too greedy  that shows ye knows nothin about land hugh said joe binney whats of it here is not only too little but too sandy  i votes for the big island  so does i said david binney  big island for me  thus incidentally was the large island named  but said hugh still objecting it wont be half so convenient to git things out o the wreck as where we are  pooh thats nothing said malines  it wont cost us much trouble to carry all we want across a spit of sand  seeing that the two men were getting angry with each other dominick interposed by blandly stating that he knew well the capabilities of the spot on which they were encamped and he was sure that such a party would require more ground if they meant to settle on it  well now master observed joe with a halflaugh we dont zactly mean for to settle on it but here we be an here we must be till a ship takes us off an we cant afford to starve ee know so well just plough the land an plant our seed an hope for good weather an heavy crops so i says big island  an so says ibig island for ever repeated his brother david  after a good deal more talk and altercation this was finally agreed to and the meeting dissolved itself  that night at the darkest hour another meeting was held in the darkest spot that could be found near the camp  it chanced unknown to the meeting to be the burialground at first discovered by the rigondas  unwittingly for it was very dark hugh morris seated himself on one of the old graves and about thirty likeminded men gathered round him little did they know that otto was one of the party  our little hero being sharp eyed and eared had seen and overheard enough in the camp that day to induce him to watch morris after he left the cave and follow him to the rendezvous  my lads said morris ive done my best to keep them to the reef but that blackguard malines wont hear of it  hes bent on takin em all to the big island so theyre sure to go and we wont get the help o the other men but no matter wi blocks an tackle well do it ourselves so we can afford to remain quiet till our opportunity comes im quite sure the ship lays in such a position that we can get her over the ledge into deep water and so be able to draw round into the open sea and then  hurrah for the black flag and the southern seas cried one of the party  no no jabez jenkins said morris we dont mean to be pirates only free rovers  hallo whats this exclaimed another of the party  a cross i do believe and this moundwhy its a grave  and heres another one said jabez in a hoarse whisper  seems to me weve got into a cannibal churchyard or  boooooo groaned otto at that moment in the most horribly sepulchral tone he could command  nothing more was wanted  with one consent the conspirators leapt up and fled from the dreadful spot in a frenzy of unutterable consternation    chapter seven  treats of big islanda great fight and a royal family  dominick said otto next morning after having solemnly and somewhat mysteriously led his brother to the old burialground would you believe me if i told you that last night when you and the like of you were sound asleep not to say snoring i saw some twenty or thirty men fly from this spot like maniacs at the howling of a ghost  no i would not believe you answered dominick with a bland smile  would you not believe me if i told you that i was the ghost and that hugh morris was the ringleader of the cowards  come otto be sensible and explain  otto became sensible and explained  thereupon dominick became serious and said oho  to which otto replied just so after which they became meditative  then dominick linked his arm in that of his little brother and leading him off to a wellknown and sequestered walk entered into an earnest confabulation  with the details of that confabulation we will not trouble the reader we will only repeat the concluding sentences  well then dom its agreed on that we are to go on as if we knew nothing about this matter and take no notice of it whatever to any onenot even to pina  yes otto thats it  of course i dont like to have any sort of secret from pina but it would be cruel in us to fill her mind with alarm for no good purpose  nomums the word  take no notice whatever  morris may repent  give him the benefit of the doubt or the hope  very well dom mum shall be the word  having thus for the time being disposed of a troublesome subject the brothers returned to the place where the emigrants were encamped  here all was wild confusion and harmony  lest this should appear contradictory we must explain that the confusion was only physical and addressed to the eye  the emigrants who were busy as ants had already disembarked large quantities of their goods which were scattered about in various heaps between the landingplace and the encampment  the harmony on the other hand was mental and spiritual for as yet there had been no time for conflicting interests to arise and the people were all so busy that they had not leisure to disagree  besides the weather being splendidly bright and warm was conducive to goodhumour  it will be remembered also that hugh morris and his friends had resolved to remain quiet for the present  perhaps the effect of the ghostly visitation might have had some influence in restraining their turbulent spirits  at all events be this as it may when dominick and otto came upon the scene everything was progressing pleasantly  the male emigrants were running between the beach and the camp with heavy burdens on their shoulders  the females were busy washing and mending garments which stood sorely in need of their attention or tending the sick and what otto styled the infantry  the sailors were engaged some in transporting goods from the wreck to the shore others in piloting two of the large boats through the reef into the lagoon and the larger children were romping joyously in the thickets and trying to climb the cocoanut trees while the smaller fry were rolling helplessly on the sandswatched more or less by mothers and big sisters  chief among those who piloted the large boats through the passage in the reef was hugh morris  he took careful observations and soundings as he went along not that such were needed for the safety of the boats but hugh morris had an eye to the ultimate destiny of the ship  youre mighty particular morris said malines with something of a sneer in his tone when the former drew up his boat inside the reef beside the other boat  one would think you were piloting a manofwar through instead of a little boat  what i was doin is none o your business malines returned hugh sternly  your command ceased when you lost your ship and i aint agoin to obey your orders no nor take any of your cheek  the emigrants chose to accept me as their commander at least for the present retorted malines fiercely  to this hugh replied with a laugh of scorn that the emigrants might make a commander of the ships monkey for all that he cared the emigrants were not his masters and he would do exactly as he pleased  as a number of his followers echoed the scornful laugh malines felt that he had not the power to carry things with a high hand  well well he returned in a tone of quiet indifference we shall see  it is quite clear to every one with a grain of sense that people cant live comfortably under two masters the people will have to decide that matter for themselves before long  ay that will they master remarked joe binney in a low but significant voice  seems to me however that as were all agreed about goin over to big island wed better go about it an leave disputation till afterwards  agreeing to this in silence the men set about loading the boats for the first trip  dominick and otto standing on the beach had witnessed this altercation  the seeds of much dissension and future trouble are there remarked the former  unless we prevent the growth of the seed said otto  true but how that is to be done does not appear obvious at present these men have strong wills and powerful frames and each has a large following i can see that  we must hope that among the emigrants there may be good and strong men enough to keep the crew in check  luckily two of the biggest and stoutest are also the most sensible said otto  you mean the brothers binney  yes dom  theyre firstrate men dont you think so  undoubtedly but very ignorant and evidently unaccustomed to lead or command men  what a pity exclaimed the boy with a flush of sudden inspiration that we couldnt make you king of the island  youre nearly as strong as the best of them and much cleverer  dominick received this compliment with a laugh and a shake of the head  no my boy i am not nearly as strong as malines or morris or the binneys  besides you forget that the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong and as to cleverness that does not consist in a superior education or a head crammed full of knowledge but in the right and ready application of knowledge  no i have no ambition to be a king  but it wont do for us to stand here talking else we shall be set down as idlers  come let us lend a helping hand  while the men were busy at the boats on the lagoon side of the reef pauline was winning golden opinions among the women at the camp by the hearty unaffected way in which she went about making herself generally useful  o blessed simplicity how adorable art thou in man and woman selfforgetfulness was a salient point in paulines character and being conjoined with strong powers of sympathy active goodwill to man and beast and more than the average of intellectual capacity with an undercurrent of rippling fun the girls influence quickly made itself felt  mrs lynch said she was a jewel and that was extraordinary praise from the strapping widow who seldom complimented her sex whatever she may have felt  mrs welsh said she was a dear pritty creetur and laughterloving little mrs nobbs the wife of a jovial harumscarum blacksmith pronounced her a perfect darling  as for the children after one hours acquaintance they adored her and would have bored her to death had that been possible  what the men thought of her we cannot tell for they spake not but furtively stared at her in a sort of reverential amazement and some of them in a state of mild enthusiasm gave murmured utterance to the sentence quoted above blessed simplicity for pauline rigonda was at first utterly unaware of the sensation she created  when the two boats were loaded down to the gunwales a select party of men embarked and rowed them over the calm lagoon to big island  of course they were well armed for no one could tell what they might meet with there  dominick and otto were of the party and being regarded in some measure as owners of the soil the former was tacitly recognised as leader on this their first visit  the distance they had to row was not more than a quarter of a mile so the lagoon was soon crossed  the spot at which they landed was a beautiful little bay with bushtopped cliffs on one side a thicket of luxuriant plants on the other and palm groves rising to a moderate height behind  the little beach on which they ran the boats was of pure white sand which induced one of them to name it silver bay  jumping out dominick with a dozen armed men advanced into the bushes with caution  nothing to be seen here of either friends or foes he said halting i felt sure that we should find no one and it is of no use taking so many of you from work therefore lads i would advise your returning to the boats and going to work at once  my little brother and i will ascend to the top of the cliff there from which we will be able to see all the neighbouring country and give you timely warning should any natives appear  pile your rifles on the beach so as to have them handy but youve nothing to fear  in a few minutes dominick and his brother each carrying a rifle and cutlass supplied by the wrecked party had mounted to the top of the neighbouring cliff while the men returned to aid in unloading the boats  what a splendid island exclaimed otto with intense delight as from the lofty outlook they gazed down upon a scene of the richest beauty from their position on the reef they had hitherto seen the island through the softening atmosphere of distance like a rounded mass of verdure but in this case distance had not lent enchantment to the view for now that they beheld it spread in all its luxuriance at their feet like a verdant gem resting on the breast of ocean it appeared infinitely more beautiful  not only was the mind charmed by the varied details of grove and bay thicket and grotto but the eye was attracted irresistibly to the magnificent trees and shrubs which stood prominent in their individualitysuch as the light and elegant aitotree the stately apape with its branchless trunk and light crown of pale green leaves resembling those of the english ash the splendid tamanu an evergreen with its laurelshaped leaves the imposing hututree with foliage resembling the magnolia and its large white flowers the petals of which are edged with bright pinkthese and many others with the feathery palm and several kinds of mimosa lining the seashore presented a display of form and colour such as the brothers had not up to that time even dreamed of  while otto gazed in silent wonder and admiration he was surprised to hear dominick give vent to a sigh and shake his head  dom he said remonstratively what do you mean by that  i mean that the place is such a paradise that the emigrants wont want to leave it and that will interfere with a little plan which had begun to form itself in my brain of late  i had been thinking that among so many tradesmen i should find men to help me to break up the wreck and out of the materials to build a small vessel with which to leave the islandfor to tell you the truth otto i have begun to fear that this place lies so far out of the track of ships that we may be left on it for many years like the mutineers of pitcairn island  humph  im sorry youre growing tired of it already said otto i thought you had more o the spirit of robinson crusoe in you dom and i never heard of the mutineers of pitcairn island but if  what did you never hear of the mutineers of the bounty  never  my education you know has been neglected  then ill tell you the story some time or other  its too long to begin just now but it beats that of your favourite robinson out of sight in my opinion  otto shook his head in grave unbelief  that he said is impossible but as to this island proving so attractive dont you think that such fellows as hugh morris and malines will take care to prevent it becoming too much of a paradise  dominick laughingly admitted that there was something in thatand he was right  there was even more in that than he had imagined for the party had not been a week in their new home when they began to differ as to the division of the island  that old old story of mighty men desiring to take possession of the land and push their weaker brethren to the wall soon began to be reenacted on this gem of the ocean and bade fair to convert the paradiselike the celebrated monte carlointo a magnificent pandemonium  at one of their stormy meetings of which the settlers had many the brothers binney and dominick were present  it was held on the shores of silver bay where the first boatloads had been discharged and around which quite a village of rude huts had sprung up like mushrooms  from those disputatious assemblies most of the women absented themselves but the widow lynch always remained holding herself in reserve for any emergency for she was well aware that her opinion carried much weight with many of the party  were a rough lot and would need tight handlin whispered the little man named redding to joe binney who sat on a bank beside him  the handlin will be tight enough before long returned joe with a decided little nod  listen the worst o the lots agoin to spout  this last remark had reference to malines who had just risen to reply to a fiery little man named buxley a tailor by trade who was possessed not only of good reasoning power but great animal courage as he had proved on more than one occasion on the voyage out  friends said the mate its all very well for buxley to talk about fair play and equal rights etcetera but i ask would it be fair play to give each of us an equal portion of land when its quite clear that somelike joe binney therecould cultivate twice as much as his share while a creature like buxley  no more a creature than yourself shouted the little tailor  could only work up half his lotif even so much continued the mate regardless of the interruption  hear hear from those who sympathised with malines  an what could you do with land demanded buxley in a tone of scorn a man thats ploughed nothing but salt water all his life  this was greeted with a laugh and thats so  hes only sowed wild oats as yet  pitch into him buckie  malines was fast losing temper under the little mans caustic remarks but succeeded in restraining himself and went on  its quite plain that the island is too small to let every man have an equal bit of land so i propose that it should be divided among those who have strength and knowledge to work it and  you aint one o them shouted the irate tailor  come come buxleylet him speak said joe binney fair play ye know  thats what you sticks up for aint it  let im speak  anyhow continued malines sharply i mean to keep the bit o ground ive staked off whether you like it or no  an so do i cried welsh who was what may be styled a growly man  sure an so does myself said teddy malone for ive staked off a bit about six feet long an two broad to plant mesilf in whin i give up the ghost  this mild pleasantry seemed to calm a little the rising wrath of contending parties much to dominicks satisfaction for he was exceedingly anxious to keep in the background and avoid interference during the week that had passed he had more than once been forced to have sharp words with malines and felt that if he was to act as a peacemakerwhich he earnestly wished to dohe must avoid quarrelling with him if possible  the hopes of those who wished to settle matters amicably however were dashed by the fiery tailor who still smarting under the contemptuous tones and words of the mate suddenly sprang to his feet and suggested that as malines knew nothing about agriculture no land at all should be apportioned to him but that he should be set to fishing or some such dirty work for the benefit of the community  this was too much for malines who strode towards buxley with clenched fists and furious looks evidently intending to knock him down  to the surprise and amusement of every one buxley threw himself into a pugilistic attitude and shouted defiantly come on  there is no saying how the thing would have ended if dominick had not quickly interposed  come mr malines he said it is not very creditable in you to threaten a man so very much smaller than yourself  out of my road shouted the mate fiercely we dont want gentlemen to lord it over us  no nor yet blackguards growled a voice in the crowd  this so angered malines that he dealt dominick a sounding slap on the cheek  for a moment there was dead silence as the two men glared at each other  if it had been a blow the youth might have stood it better but there was something so stinging as well as insulting in a slap that for a moment he felt as if his chest would explode  before he could act however joe binney thrust his bulky form between the men  leavem to me master he said quietly turning up his wristbands im used to this sort o thing an  no no said dominick in a deep decided voice listen  he grasped joe by the arm and whispered a few words in his ear  a smile broke over the mans face and he shook his head doubtfully  well it may be so he remarked an no doubt it would have a good effect  now then stand aside said dominick as he retreated a few paces and threw off his coat while malines still stood in a threatening attitude with an expression of contempt on his face  my friends he said as he slowly rolled up his shirtsleeves showing a pair of arms which although not bulky displayed an amount of sinews and muscle that was suggestive of knotted ropes under a fair skin  my friends he said somewhere in the bible it is written smite a scorner and the simple will beware  i have done my best to conciliate this scorner without success i shall now try to smite him  an brother david an me will see fair play remarked joe binney  if the combatants had been more equally matched the spectators would probably have encouraged dominick with a cheer but the difference in size was so apparent that astonishment kept them silent  dominick was indeed fully as tall as his opponent and his shoulders were nearly as broad but the massive weight of maliness figure seemed to render the chance of dominicks success highly improbable  the youth sprang at him however like lightning and hitting him a violent blow on the forehead leapt back out of his reach  the blow had the effect that was intended it roused the mates wrath to the utmost pitch causing him to rush at his opponent striking right and left with all his force  dominick however leapt about with such activity that only a few of the blows reached him and these not with their full force  the result was that the mate became what is styled winded in a few minutes and was compelled to pause to recover himself but dominick had no intention of allowing him time to recover himself without a moments hesitation he sprang in again and planted a severe lefthander between his opponents eyes  this roused the mate once more to white heat and he sought to close with his foe but the latter prevented that by leaping aside tripping him up and causing him to plunge forward on his hands and kneesassisting him to that position with a stiff rap on the right temple as he passed  then it was that malines discovered that he had drawn on himself the wrath of one who had been the champion boxer in a large public school and was quite as tough as himself in wind and limb though not so strong or so heavy  now it is not our intention to give a graphic account of that pugilistic encounter  yet is it needful to point out briefly how being a man of peace as well as a man of science dominick managed to bring this fight to as speedy a close as possible  instead then of striking his foe in all directions and producing a disgusting scene of bloodshed he confined his practice chiefly to one spot between the eyes close above the bridge of the nosevarying it a little with a shot now and then under each eye  this had the effect owing to constant repetition of gradually shutting up both maliness eyes so that he could not easily see  when in this condition dominick suddenly delivered first a left and then a right hander into what is sometimes called the breadbasket and stretched his adversary on the sand  dominick was not boastful or ungenerous  he did not crow over his fallen foe  on the contrary he offered to assist that smitten scorner to rise but malines preferred in the meantime to lie still  it is scarcely necessary to say that the emigrants watched this short but sharp encounter with keen interest and when it was ended gave vent to a cheer in which surprise was quite as clearly expressed as satisfaction  now i tell ee what it is lads said joe binney striking his great right fist into the palm of his left hand enthusiastically i never seed the likes o that since i was a leetle booy and ive got a motion for to propose as they say at meetins  its this that we makes master domnik riggundy capting over us all  up started teddy malone with a slap of his thigh  and its mesilf asll second that motiononly we should make him governor of the whole island if not king  hear hear shouted a decided majority of the party  let him be king  when silence had been partially restored dominick politely but firmly declined the honour giving it as his opinion that the fairest way would be to have a republic  a republic  no what we wants is a despotism said david binney who had up to this point remained silent a regular despota howtocratis what we wants to keep us in order  hump exclaimed hugh morris contemptuously if youd ony let malines have his way youd soon have a despot an a howtocrat as ud keep yer noses to the grindstone  mrs lynch whispered otto who had hitherto stood beside the widow watching the proceedings with inexpressible glee you get up an propose that pina should be queen  that this suggestion came upon the widow with a shock of surprise as well as approval was obvious from the wideeyed stare with which for a moment she regarded the boy and from her subsequent action  taking a bold and masculine stride to the front of the disputers she turned about and faced them  howld yer tongues now boys all of you and listen to what your grandmothers got to say  a shout of laughter cut her short for a few seconds  thats right old ooman out with it  sure if yed stop your noise id out wid it fast enough  now then here ye are nivver a man of ye able to agree wid the others an the raisins not far to seekfor yer all wrong togither  it would nivver do to make wan o you a kingnot even joe here for he knows nixt to nothin nor yet mister rig gundy though he can fight like a man for its not a kings business to fight  no take my word for it what ye want is a queen  a loud explosion of mirth drowned the rest  hurrah for queen lynch cried one  the royal blood of owld ireland for ivver shouted malone  i wouldnt said the widow indignantly condescind to reign over sitch a nation o pigs av ye was to go down on yer bare knees an scrape them to the bone  no its english blood or spanitch i dont rightly know which that im drivin at for where could ye find a better or honester or purtier queen than that swate creetur miss pauline rig gundy  the idea seemed to break upon the assembly as a light in a dark place for a moment they seemed struck dumb then there burst forth such a cheer as showed that the greater part of those present sympathised heartily with the proposal  i knowd yed agree to it  sure men always does when a sensible woman spakes  you see queen pauline the first  hurrah for queen pauline the first yelled the settlers with mingled cheers and laughter  queen pauline the first ye may be sure continued the widow would nivver try to kape order wid her fists nor yit wid shoutin or swearin  an then av coorse it would be aisy to make mister duminick or joe binney prime minister an little buxley chancler o the checkers or whatever they calls it  now think over it boys an good luck be wid ye  they did think over it then and there in real earnest and the possibility of an innocent sensible gentle just sympathetic and highminded queen reigning over them proved so captivating to these rough fellows that the idea which had been at first received in jest crystallised into a serious purpose  at this point otto ventured to raise his voice in this first deliberation of the embryo state  friends he said with an air of modesty which we fear was foreign to his nature although i can only appear before you as a boy my big brother has this day proved himself to be so much more than an ordinary man that i feel somehow as if i had a right to his surplus manhood being nextofkin and therefore i venture to address you as a sort of man  hear hear i merely wish to ask a question  may i ask to be the bearer of the news of this assemblys determination tothethe queen  yesyesof courseav course were the immediate replies  otto waited not for more but sped to their new hut in which the queen was busy preparing dinner at the time  pina exclaimed the boy bursting in will you consent to be the queen of big island  come otto dont talk nonsense  i hope dom is with you  dinner is much overdone already  no but im not talking nonsense cried otto  i say will you consent to be a queena real queenpina the first eh  hereupon he gave his wondering sister a graphic account of the recent meeting and fight and final decision  but they dont really mean it you know said pauline laughing  but they do really mean it returned otto and by the way if you become a queen wont that necessarily make me and dom princes  as dominick entered the hut at that moment he joined in the laugh which this question created and corroborated his brothers statement  in this cheerful frame of mind the new royal family sat down to dinner    chapter eight  the coronationcrownmaking deliberations ceremonials and catastrophes  there came a day not many weeks later in the history of our emigrants when great preparations were made for an important and unusual event  this was neither more nor less than the coronation of queen pauline the first  the great event had been delayed by the unfortunate illness of the elect queen herselfan illness brought on by reckless exposure in the pursuit of the picturesque and beautiful among the islets of the lagoon  in other words otto and she when off on a fishing and sketching excursion in the dinghy of the wreck had been caught in a storm and drenched to the skin  the result to otto was an increase of appetite to pauline a sharp attack of fever which confined her for some time to the palace as their little hut was now styled  here the widow lynchacting the united parts of nurse lady of the bedchamber mistress of the robes maid of honour chef de cuisine and any other office that the reader may recollect as belonging to royaltydid so conduct herself as to gain not only the approval but the affection and gratitude of her royal mistress  during the period of paulines convalescence considerable changes had taken place in the circumstances and condition of the community  the mere fact that a government had been fixed on the details of which were being wrought out by a committee of leading men appointed by the people tended to keep the turbulent spirits pretty quiet and enabled the welldisposed to devote all their strength of mind and body to the various duties that devolved upon them and the improving of their circumstances  busy workers are usually peaceful  they have no time to quarrel  it is only when turbulent idlers interfere with or oppress them that the industrious are compelled to show their teeth and set up their backs  during these weeks the appearance of the shores of big island began to change materially  all round the edge of silver bay a number of bright green patches were enclosed by rough but effective fences  these were the gardens of the community in which sweet potatoes yams etcetera grew spontaneously while some vegetables of the northern hemisphere had already been sown and were in some cases even beginning to show above ground  in these gardens when the important work of planting had been finished the people set about building huts of various shapes and sizes according to their varying taste and capacity  even at this early stage in the life of the little community the difficulties which necessarily surround a state of civilisation began to appear and came out at one of the frequent though informal meetings of the men on the sands of silver bay  it happened thus  it was evening  the younger and more lively men of the community having a large store of surplus energy unexhausted after the labours of the day began as is the wont of the young and lively to compete with one another in feats of agility and strength while a group of their elders stood sat or reclined on a bank discussing the affairs of the nation and some of them enjoying their pipesfor you see everything in the wreck having been saved they had among other bad things plenty of tobacco  dr marsh sat among the elders for although several weeks on shore had greatly restored his health he was still too weak to join in the athletics  a few of the women and children also looked on but they stood aside by themselves not feeling very much interested in the somewhat heated discussions of the men  by degrees these discussions degenerated into disputes and became at last so noisy that the young athletes were attracted and some of them took part in the debates  i tell ee what it is exclaimed nobbs the blacksmith raising his powerful voice above the other voices and lifting his huge fist in the air somethingll have to be done for i cant go on workin for nothin in this fashion  no more can i or my mates said abel welsh the carpenter  here comes the prime minister cried teddy malone  to behe aint prime minister yet growled jabez jenkins who being a secret ally of hugh morris was one of the disaffected and had besides a natural tendency to growl and object to everything  he is prime minister cried the fiery little buxley starting up and extending his hand with the air of one who is about to make a speech no doubt the queen aint crowned yet an hasnt therefore appointed any one to be her minister but we know she means to do it and were all agreed about it  no we aint interrupted jenkins angrily  well the most on us then retorted buxley  shut up you radical said nobbs giving the tailor a facetious slap on the back an lets hear what the prime minister himself has got to say about it  what is the subject under discussion inquired dominick who with otto joined the group of men at the moment and flung down a basket of fine fish which he had just caught in the lagoon  he turned to dr marsh for an answer  do you explain your difficulties said the doctor to the blacksmith  well sir said nobbs heres where it is  when i fust comed ashore an set up my anvil an bellows i went to work with a will enjyin the fun o the thing an the novelty of the sitivation an as wed lots of iron of all kinds i knocked off nails an hinges an all sorts o things for anybody as wanted em  similarly wen abel welsh comed ashore he went to work with his mates at the pitsaw an tossed off no end o planks etceterer  but you see sir arter a time we come for to find that were workin to the whole population for nothin and while everybody else is working away at his own hut or garden or what not our gardens is left to work themselves an our huts is nowhere now as weve got no money to pay for work with and as stones an shells wont answer the purpusseein theres a sight too much of em the question is whats to be done  not an easy question to answer nobbs said dominick and one that requires serious consideration  perhaps instead of trying to answer it at present we might find a temporary expedient for the difficulty until a committee of the houseif i may say soshall investigate the whole problem  hear hear from malone redding and buxley and a growl from jenkins i would suggest then in the meantime that while nobbs and welshwho are perhaps the most useful men among uscontinue to ply their trades for the benefit of the community every man in the community shall in turn devote a small portion of time to working in the gardens and building the huts of these two men  hear hear from a great many of the hearers and dissenting growls from a few but continued dominick as there are evidently some here who are not of an obliging disposition and as the principle of willing service lies at the root of all social felicity i would further suggest that until our queen is crowned and the government fairly set up all such labour shall be undertaken entirely by volunteers  this proposal was agreed to with boisterous acclaim and nearly the whole community volunteered on the spot  while this little difficulty was being overcome pauline lay sleeping in the palace hard by and the enthusiastic cheer with which the conclusion of dominicks speech was received awoke her  therei knowd theyd do it exclaimed the lady of the bedchamber fiercely lie still cushla an shut your purty eyes  maybe youll drop off again  a humorous smile beamed in paulines countenance and twinkled in her eyes  thank you dear nurse ive had enough of sleep  indeed i begin to feel so strong that i think i shall very soon be able to undergo that  pauline stopped and burst into a fit of merry laughter  its that caronation now yell be thinkin av said the widow lynch with a reproving look  faix its no laughin matter yell find it dear  its onaisy is the hid as wears a crown  why you talk nurse as if you had worn one yourself and knew all about its troubles  sure av i didnt me progenissors did in munster before you english konkered us an turned us topsyturvy  but nivver mind  i dont bear no illwill to ee darlint bekaise o the evil deeds o yer forefathers  im of a forgivin disposition  an its a good quane youll make too av ye dont let the men have too much o their own way  but i do think that you an me togitherll be more than a match for them all  dee think ye could stand the caronation now dear  yes i think i could  but really you know i find it so hard to believe it is not all a joke despite the grave deputations that have waited on me and the serious arguments they have used  the idea of making memea queen  again pauline rigonda gave way to merry laughter and again did her lady of the bedchamber administer a reproof by expressing the hope that she might take the matter as lightly a year hence  this pertinacious reference to possible trouble being mingled with the contemplated honour checked paulines disposition to laugh and she had quite recovered her gravity when her brother otto entered  pina ive come to tell you that theyve fixed the coronation for monday next if you feel up to it and that the new palace is beguna very different one let me tell you from this wretched affair with its tumbledown walls and low roof  indeedis it so very grand  grand  i should think it is  why it has got three roomsthree roomsthink o that  not countin a splendid outhouse stuck on behind about ten feet square and over six feet high  each of the three rooms is twelve feet long by ten broad seven feet high and papered with palm leaves  the middle one is the hall of audience and justice or injustice if you likethe council chamber the house of parliament the messroom and the drawingroom  the one on the right with two windows from which are magnificent views is your majestys sleepingroom and boudoir that on the left is the ditto of prime minister dominick and his chief secretary prince otto  the sort of hencoop stuck on behind is to be the abode of the court physician dr john marshwhom by the way youll have to knightand with whom is to be billeted the court jester manatarms manofallwork and general retainer little buxley  so you see its all cut and dry though of course it will take some little time to finish the palace in all its multitudinous details  meanwhile i have been sent to sound you as to monday next  will you be able and ready  if i could only get myself to believe answered pauline as she leaned on one elbow on her couch and toyed contemplatively with a fold of the shawl that covered her that the people are really in earnest i  really in earnest repeated otto  why pina never were people more in earnest in this world  if youd heard and seen them talking about it as i have youd not doubt their earnestness  besides you have no idea how needful you are to the community  the fact is it is composed of such rough and rowdy elementsthough of course there are some respectable and wellprincipled fellows among themthat nothing short of a power standing high above them and out o their reach will have any influence with them at all  there are so many strong determined and selfwilled men amongst them that theres no chance of their ever agreeing to submit to each other so you see you are a sort of good angel before whom they will be only too glad to bowa kind of superior being whom they will reverence and to whom they will submita human safetyvalve in short to prevent the community from blowing upa species ofof  here pauline burst into another of her irrepressible fits of laughter and being joined therein by prince otto called forth a remonstrance from mrs lynch who declared that if that was the way they were goin to manage the affairs of state she would be obliged to advise the settlers to change their minds and set up a republic  an sure mother said otto who was a privileged favourite nothing could be better with yourself as president  go along wid ye boy an do yer dooty  tell the people that miss pauline will be readywind an weather permittin  am i to take back that message pina asked otto with a look of glee  well i suppose you may  it was not in the nature of things that a coronation in the circumstances which we have described should take place without being more or less intermingled with the unavoidable absurdities which mark the coronations of older and more densely peopled lands  it was felt that as the act was a seriously meant reality and no mere joke it should be gone about and accomplished with all due solemnity and proper ceremonial somewhat after the patternas teddy malone suggestedof a lord mayors show a suggestion by the way which did not conduce to the solemnity of the preliminary discussions  there was one great difficulty however with which the embryo nation had to contend and this was that not one of the community had ever seen a coronation or knew how the details of the matter should be arranged  in these circumstances an assembly of the entire nation was convened to consider the matter  as this convention embraced the women except of course the queen elect it included the babies and as most of these were selfassertive and welldeveloped in chest and throat it was found necessary to relegate them and the women to an outer circle while the men in an inner circle tackled the problem  the widow lynch being quite irrepressible except by physical force and even by that with difficulty was admitted on sufferance to the inner circle and took part in the discussions  like most large assemblies this one was found so unmanageable that after an hour or two of hopeless wrangling buxley the tailor started up with dishevelled hair and glaring eyeballs and uttered a yell that produced a momentary silence  seizing the moment he said  i moves that we apint a committee to inquire into the whole matter an report  hear hear and well said shouted a multitude of voices  an i moves cried mrs lynch starting forward with both arms up and all her fingers rampant that  no no mother interrupted buxley you must second the motion  howld yer tongue ye dirty spalpeen  isnt it the second motion that im puttin  i moves that the committee is mr dumnik rig gundy an dr marsh  an mister nobbs shouted a voice  an mister joe binney said another  an little mister buxley be way of variashun cried teddy malone  an mistress lynch for a change growled jabez jenkins  hear hear  no no  hurrah  nonsense  howld yer tongue  be seriousgradually drowned in a confusion of tongues with a yelling accompaniment from infantry in the outer circle  it was finally agreed however that the arrangements for the coronation should be left entirely to a committee composed of dominick dr marsh joe binney and hugh morrisjoe being put forward as representing the agricultural interest and hugh the malcontents  teddy malone was added to make an odd number for theres luck in odd numbers as he himself remarked on accepting office  immediately after the general meeting broke up these five retired to the privacy of a neighbouring palm grove where seated on a verdant and flowering bank they proceeded calmly to discuss details  you see my friends said dominick it must be our most earnest endeavour to carry out this important matter in a serious and businesslike manner  already there is too much of a spirit of levity among the people who seem to look at the whole affair as a sort of game or joke playing as it were at national life whereas we actually are an independent nation  a small wan av coorse murmured malone  yes a small one but not the less real on that account so that we are entitled to manage our own affairs arrange our own government and generally to act according to our united will  these islands and their surroundings are unknownat least they are not put down on any chart i believe we have discovered them  there are no inhabitants to set up a counter claim therefore being entitled to act according to our will our appointment of a queen to rule usunder limited powers to be hereafter well considered and clearly written downis a reality not a mere play or semijest to be undone lightly when the fancy takes us that being so we must go to work with gravity and earnestness of purpose  teddy malone who was an impressionable creature here became so solemnised that his lengthening visage and seriously wrinkled brow rendered gravityespecially on the part of dr marshalmost impossible  overcoming his feelings with a powerful effort the doctor assented to what dominick said and suggested that some mild sort of ceremonial should be devised for the coronation in order to impress the beholders as well as to mark the event  thats so said teddy malone somethin quiet an orderly like an irish wake or  ah then ye neednt smile doctor  its the quietest an most comfortin thing in life is an irish wake whin its gone about properly  but we dont want comforting teddy said dominick it is rather a subject for rejoicing  well then whats to hinder us rejoicin in comfort returned teddy at all the wakes i ivver attinded there was more rejoicin than comfortin goin on but thats a matter of taste av coorse  therell have to be a crown o some sort remarked hugh morris  youre right lad said joe binney  it wouldnt do to make it o pasteboard would it  praps that ud be too like playin at a game an tin would be little better  what else can we make it of boys said malone weve got no goold hereworse luck but maybe the carpenter cud make wan o wood  with a lick o yellow paint it would look genuine  nonsense teddy said the doctor dont you see that in this life men should always be guided by circumstances and act with propriety  here we are on an island surrounded by coral reefs going to elect a queen what more appropriate than that her crown should be made of coral  the very thing doctor cried malone with emphasis och its the genius ye have  theres all kinds o coral red and white an we could mix it up wi some o that finecoloured seaweed to make it purty  it could be made pritty enough without seaweed said binney an its my notion that the womenfolk would be best at makin of it  right joe right so if you have no objection we will leave it to them said dominick and now as to the ceremonial  a pursession suggested joe binney  just so said hugh morris the very thing as was in my mind  and a throne cried malone there couldnt be a proper quane widout a throne you know  the carpenter can make that anyhow for theres wood galore on the islandred black an white  yis we must have a grand throne cut an carved an mounted high so as shell have two or three steps to climb up to it  in regard to the procession and the throne there was considerable difference of opinion but difficulties were got over and smoothed down at last by the tact and urbanity of dominick to whom finally the whole question of the coronation was committed  thus it frequently happens among men  in the multitude of counsellors there is wisdom enough usually to guide in the selection of the fittest man to take the helm in all important affairs  and that reminds us that it is high time to terminate this long digression and guide our readers back to the beginning of the chapter where we stated that the important day had at last arrived  happily in those highly favoured climes weather has not usually to be taken much into account  the sun arose out of the oceans breast with the same unclouded beauty that had marked his rise every morning for a week previously and would probably mark it for a week to come  the sweet scents of the wooded heights floated down on the silver strand the sharks ruffled the surface of the lagoon with their black fins the birds hopped or flew from palmtree to mimosabush and the waterfowl went about according to taste on lazy or whistling wings intent on daily business much as though nothing unusual were in the air  but it was otherwise with the human family on big island  unwonted excitement was visible on almost every face  bustle was in every action  preparations were going on all round and as some members of the community were bent on giving other members a surprise there was more or less of secrecy and consequent mystery in the behaviour of every one  by breakfasttime little mrs nobbs the blacksmiths laughterloving wife had nearly laughed herself into fits of delight at the crown which she assisted mrs welsh and the widow lynch to fabricate  the last had devised it mrs welsh had built it in the rough and mrs nobbs had finished it off with the pretty little wreath of red and white branching coral that formed its apex  apart from taste it was a stupendous erection  but dont you think that its too big and heavy cried mrs nobbs with a shrieking giggle and clapping of her hands as she ran back to have a distant view of it  pooh exclaimed mrs lynch contemptuously too heavy  no its nothin my dear to what the kings an quanes of munster wore  but miss pauline is neither a king nor a queen of munster an i do think its a bit overheavy objected mrs welsh as she lifted the structure with difficulty  well ye might take off the wreath was the widows reply  mrs nobbs removed the only part of the erection that was really pretty but still it was pronounced by mrs welsh to be too heavy especially for the fair and delicate brows of pauline rigonda  while they were thus engaged dr marsh entered the hut where for the sake of secrecy the crown had been prepared but dr marsh was a privileged man besides he was there professionally little browneyes was sicknot seriously but sufficiently so to warrant medical intervention  well what have we here ladies said the doctor blandly part of the throne eh  sure it is in a sort of way for its the crown answered mrs lynch an they think its overheavy  not at all by no means cried the doctor heartily  its splendid put the wreath onso  nothing could be finer  shall i carry it up for you  the coronation is fixed for noon you know so that we may have time to finish off with a grand feast  no no doctor dear  thank ee kindly but we must cover it up sos not to let the people see it till the right time  well see that youre not late with it  having caused browneyes to put out her little tongue and felt her pulse and nodded his head gravely once or twice without speaking all of which must have been highly comforting and beneficial to the child the doctor went out  not long afterwards the people began to assemble round the palace in front of which a wondrous throne had been erected  down in a dell behind a cliff some fifty men had assembled secretly with the crown on a cushion in their midst  they were headed by dr marsh who had been unanimously elected to place the crown on paulines head  in the palace pauline was being prepared by mrs lynch and mrs nobbs for the ceremony  on the top of a mound close to the palace a band of conspirators was assembled  these conspirators were screened from view by some thick bushes  otto rigonda was their ringleader teddy malone and little buxley formed the rest of the band  otto had found a dead tree  its trunk had been hollowed by decay  he and his fellowconspirators had sawn it off near to the ground and close to the root they had drilled a touchhole  this huge piece of ordnance they had loaded with a heavy charge of the ships gunpowder  otto now stood ready with a piece of slowmatch at the touchhole and another piece lighted in hand  suddenly about the hour of noon abel welsh the carpenter and nobbs the blacksmith issued from the palace with two long tin implements secretly for two weeks previously had these devoted men retired every night to the opposite extremity of big island and frightened into fits the birds and beasts of that region with the sounds they produced in practising on those instruments  applying the trumpets to their lips they sent forth a tremendous though not uniform blast  the surrounding crowd who expected something but knew not what replied with a cheer not unmixed with laughter for the two trumpets after the manner of asses had to make some ineffectual preliminary efforts before achieving a fulltoned bray  an answering note from the dell however repressed the laughter and awoke curiosity  next moment the doctor appeared carrying the crown and followed by his fifty men armed with muskets rifles fowlingpieces and revolvers  their appearance was so realistic and impressive that the people forgot to cheer  at the same moment the palace door was thrown open and dominick led the youthful queen to the foot of the throne  poor little pauline looked so modest and pretty and even timid and withal so angelically innocent in the simplicity of her attire that the people burst into an earnestly enthusiastic shout and began for the first time to feel that this was no game or play but a serious reality  things had been so arranged that pina and dr marsh reached the foot of the throne together  then the latter took the pretty coral wreath off the huge crown and to widow lynchs felt but not expressed indignation placed that on paulines head  pauline rigonda he said in a loud voice i have been appointed by the people of this island to crown you in their name and by their authority as queen of refuge islands in the full belief that your innocence and regard for truth and righteousness will be their best guarantee that you will select as your assistants the men whom you think best suited to aid you in the promotion of good government  the serious tone of the doctors voice and the genuine shouts of satisfaction from the people put the poor little queen in such a flutter that nearly all her courage forsook her and she could scarcely reply  nevertheless she had a mind of her own  doctor marsh and my dear people she said at last ii scarcely know how to reply  you overrate me altogether butbut if i rule at all i will do so by the blessed truths of this book she held up a bible andand before taking a single step further i appoint as mymy prime ministerif i may so call himjoe binney  for one moment there was the silence of amazement for neither dominick nor dr marsh knew of paulines intention  only the widow lynch had been aware of her resolve  next moment a hilarious cheer burst from the crowd and teddy malone from his retreat shouted god bliss the quane which infused hearty laughter into the cheer whereupon welsh and nobbs thinking the right time had come sent out of their tin tubes after a few ineffectual blurts two terrific brays  fearing to be too late one of the armed men let off his piece which was the signal for a grand feu de joie  now for it thought the chief conspirator in the bushes as he applied his light to the slowmatch  he thought nothing more just then for the slowmatch proved to be rather quick fired the powder at once and the monster cannon bursting with a hideous roar into a thousand pieces blew otto through the bushes and down the mound at the foot of which he lay as one dead  consternation was on every face  the queen dropping her crown sprang to his side dr marsh did the same but otto recovered almost immediately  that was a stunner he said with a confused look putting his hand to his head as they helped him to rise  strange to say he was none the worse of the misadventure but did his part nobly at the royal feast that followed  that night she who had risen with the sun as pauline rigonda laid her fair young head upon the pillow asthe island queen    chapter nine  shows how they were tormented by an old familiar fiend how they killed him and what befell the queen and otto while in the pursuit of legitimate pleasure  when the widow lynch told pauline that onaisy is the hid as wears a crown she stated a great truth which was borne in upon the poor queen at the very commencement of her reign  up to that time malines had quietly kept possession of the key of the ships liquorroom knowing full well what extreme danger lay in letting men have unrestrained command of strong drink  but when the royal feast referred to in the last chapter was pending he could not well refuse to issue an allowance of grog  he did so however on the understanding that only a small quantity was to be taken for the occasion and that he should himself open and lock the door for them  he made this stipulation because he knew well enough the men who wanted to drink would break the door open if he refused to give up the key and his fears were justified for some of the more mutinous among the men under the leadership of jabez jenkins and morris seized the key from the mate when he produced it carried all the spirit and wine casks to the shore ferried them over the lagoon to big island and set them up ostentatiously and conspicuously in a row not far from the palace  as this was understood by the people to be in connection with the coronation festivities no particular notice was taken of it  but the result soon began to be felt for after the festivities were over and most of the settlers had retired to rest a group of kindred souls gathered round the spirit casks and went in for what one of them termed a regular spree  at first they drank and chatted with moderate noise but as the fumes of the terrible firewater mounted to their brains they began to shout and sing then to quarrel and fight and finally the wonted silence of the night was wildly disturbed by the oaths and fiendish yells and idiotic laughter of maniacs  this wont do said dominick issuing from his room in the palace and meeting the doctor  i had just come to the same conclusion said the latter and was about to consult you as to what we should do  collect some of our best men and put a stop to it returned dominick but here comes the prime ministerroused no doubt as we have been what say you joe shall we attempt to quell them  well master that depends  theres a braw lot on em an if they beant far gone dee see they might gie us a deal o trouble  if they be far gone id advise ye to let em alone the drinkll quell em soon enough  arter that well know what to do  just as he spoke a woman was seen rushing frantically towards them  it was little mrs nobbs  poor thing  all her wonted merriment had fled from her comely face and been supplanted by a look of horror  o sirs she cried clasping her hands and gasping as she spoke come come quick my john has falled an broke his pledge an hes goin to murder some of em  i know hell do it hes got hold o the forehammer  oh come quick  they required no urging  running down to the scene of the orgies they found that the blacksmith who had hitherto been consideredand really wasone of the quietest men of the party was now among the drunkards he stood in the midst of the rioters his large frame swaying to and fro while he held the ponderous forehammer threateningly in his hands and insanity gleamed in his eyes as he glared fiercely at jabez jenkins  on jabez the liquor had a different effect his temperament being totally different  he was a rather phlegmatic man and having drunk enough to have driven two men like the blacksmith raving mad he only stood before him with a dull heavy look of stupidity mingled with an idiotic sneer of defiance  fiend shouted nobbs gnashing his teeth you have got me to do it and now ill smash in your thick skullill  he stopped abruptly for a moment  joe binney came up behind and gently laid a hand on his shoulder  come john you aint agoin to do it  you knows youre not  the quiet tone the gentle yet fearless look and above all the sensible kindly expression on his friends countenance effectually subdued the blacksmith for a few seconds but the fury soon returned though the channel in which it flowed was changed for jabez was forgotten having slunk away  ha he shouted grasping joe by the hand and arm ive had it again you dont know how it shoots through my veins  iive tried to break with it tootriedtried  dee know what it is to try joe to try trytry till your blood curdles an your marrow boils and your nerves tinglebut i gained the victory onceiha ha yes i took the pledge an kep it an ive bin all righttill tonight  my mary knows that shell tell you its truefor months and months and months andbut ill keep it yet  he shouted his last words in a tone of fierce defiance let go his friend caught up the sledgehammer and whirling it round his head as if it had been a mere toy turned to rush towards the sea  but joes strong arm arrested him  well did he understand the nature of the awful fiend with which the blacksmith was fighting  the scene enacting was with modifications somewhat familiar to him for he had dwelt near a great city where many a comrade had fallen in the same fight never more to rise in this life  joes superior strength told for a moment and he held the struggling madman fast but before dominick and the doctor could spring to his aid nobbs had burst from him  the brief check however seemed to have changed his intentions  possibly he was affected by some hazy notion that it would be a quicker end to leap headlong from the neighbouring cliffs than to plunge into the sea  at all events he ran like a deer up towards the woods  a bonfire round which the revellers had made merry lay in his path  he went straight through it scattering the firebrands right and left  no one attempted no one dared to stop him but god put a check in his way  the course he had taken brought him straight up to the row of casks which stood on the other side of the fire and again his wild mood was changed  with a yell of triumph he brought the sledgehammer down on one of the casks drove in the head and overturned it with the same blow and the liquor gushing out flowed into the fire where it went up in a magnificent roar of flame  the effect on those of the rioters who were not too drunk to understand anything was to draw forth a series of wild cheers but high above these rang the triumphant shout of the blacksmith as he gazed at the destruction of his enemy  by this time all the people in the settlement had turned out and were looking on in excitement alarm or horror according to temperament among them of course was the widow lynch who was quick to note that events were taking a favourable turn  springing boldly to the side of the smith and in her wild dishevelment of hair and attire seeming a not unfit companion she cried  dont spare them john sure theres another inimy close at yer back  nobbs had sense enough left to observe something of the ludicrous in the woman and her advice  he turned at once uttered a wildly jovial laugh and driving in the head of another cask overturned it  as before the spirit rushed down the hill and was set ablaze but the poor madman did not pause now to look at the result  his great enemy was in his power his spirit was roused  like one of the fabled heroes of old he laid about him with his ponderous weapon right and left until every cask was smashed and every drop of the accursed liquid was rushing down the hillside to the sea or flaming out its fierce existence in the air  the people looked on awestricken and in silence while the madman fought  it was not with the senseless casks or the inanimate liquor that poor john nobbs waged war that night it was with a real fiend who in days gone by had many a time tripped him up and laid him low who had nearly crushed the heart of his naturally cheerful little wife who had ruined his business broken up his home alienated his friends and finally driven him into exilea fiend from whom for many months under the influence of the pledge he had been free and who he had fondly hoped was quite dead  this sudden revival of the old foe and this unexpected surprise and fall had roused this strong mans spirit to its utmost ferocity and in mighty wrath he plied his hammer like a second thor  but the very strength and nervous power of the man constituted his weakness when brought under the subtle influence of the old tempter and it is probable that on his recovery with nerves shaken old cravings awakened and selfrespect gone he would have fallen again and again if god had not made use of the paroxysm of rage to destroy the opportunity and the cause of evil  nobbs did not know at that time though he learned it afterwards that safety from the drinksinas from all other sinlies not in strongman resolutions or temperance pledges though both are useful aids but in jesus the saviour from sin  some of those who witnessed the wholesale destruction of the liquor would fain have made an effort to prevent it but fortunately for the community most of them were too drunk to care and the others to interfere while all were so taken by surprise that the deed was done and the grand conflagration ended before they had realised the full significance of the blacksmiths act  when the last head had been driven in and the last gallon of spirit summarily dismissed by the fire nobbs threw up his arms and looking upward gave vent to a cheer which ended in a prolonged cry  for a moment he stood thus then the hammer dropt from his grasp and he fell back insensible  poor little mrs nobbs was by his side on her knees in a moment parting the dark hair from his broad brow kissing his swart cheeks and chafing his strong hands  o john darling john she cried come backcome backdont die you never was hard or cruel to me  even the drink could not do that come back john  dr marsh here gently restrained her  dont be alarmed he said as he undid the smiths necktie hell be all right presently  stand back dont crowd round him and you go fetch a cup of water mrs nobbs  the reassuring tones and the necessity for action did much to calm the excited woman  before she had returned with the water her husband had partially recovered  they carried him to his hut and left him to sleep off the effects while his poor little wife watched by his side  when left quite alone she went down on her knees beside him and prayed for his deliverance with all her heart  then she rose and sat down with a calm contented look muttering yes he is the hearer and answerer of prayer  he will answer me  she might have gone further and said he has answered me for was not the destruction of the liquor an answer to the petition before it was put up  before they call i will answer  pina said otto the following day in a tone almost of reproach during a private audience with the queen pina how came you to do such an insane thing as choose joe binney for your premier  why didnt you choose dom  you know well enough that hes fifty times cleverer than joe and even in the matter of strength though hes not so strong im very sure that with his pugilistic powers he could keep order quite as well  besides all the people had made up their minds as a matter of course that dom was to be premier and thenhes a gentleman  im thankful that you are not one of the privy council otto returned pauline with a laugh  you put several questions and a string of commentary and suggestion in the same breath  let me answer you in detail beginning with your last remark  joe is a gentleman in the highest sense of that word  he is gentle as a lamb by nature and a man every inch of him  but more than this i have noticed that he is a peculiarly wise man with a calm pool head on all occasions and not too ready to use his great physical power in the settlement of disputes i have observed too that when asked for his advice he usually thinks well before he gives it and when his advice is followed things almost always go well  still further joe has the thorough confidence of the people and i am not so sure that dom has  besides if i had appointed dom some of the ungenerous among them might have said it was done from mere favouritism  then as to the people making up their minds that i would appoint dom continued pauline what have i to do with that  why everything to do with it returned otto with a surprised look were you not made queen for the purpose of carrying out their wishes  certainly not answered pauline i was made queen for the purpose of ruling  they told me they had confidence in my judgment not in my readiness to carry out their wishes  if my judgment coupled with that of my advisers does not suit them it is open to them to unmake me as they made me and appoint a king or a president but my judgment i cannot alter  otto listened to these gravely stated opinions of the new queen with increasing astonishment  then you awful despot he said do you mean to tell me that you are going to have no regard for the will of the people  no i dont mean to tell you that you presumptuous little subject  i intend always to have the utmost regard for the will of my people and to weigh it well and consult with my advisers about it and when our united judgment says that their will is good i will act in accordance with it when we think it bad i will reject it  i have been made queen to rule and i mean to rule  thats fair isnt it  if they dont like my ruling they can dethrone me  thats also fair isnt it  you wouldnt have me become a mere puppeta jumping jack or jinniewould you for the people to pull the string of  well i never exclaimed otto gazing with distended eyes at the soft fair face and at the pretty little innocent mouth that gave vent to these vigorous sentiments  and what may it be your majestys pleasure to do next  it is my pleasure that you sir shall go down to the beach and prepare the dinghy for immediate service  i have already directed the prime minister in conjunction with dom and our court physician to draw up a constitution and code of laws while they are thus employed you and i will go afishing  very good i suppose im bound to obey but i thought your majesty preferred to go asketching  we will do both  be off sirrah  otto was not long in launching and getting ready the little punt or dinghy belonging to the wreck which being too small for carrying goods to the island had been made over to pauline as a royal barge for her special amusement and already had she and her little brother enjoyed several charming expeditions among the sheltered islets of the lagoon when otto devoted himself chiefly to rowing and fishing while his sister sketched with pencil and watercolours  being expert with both she took great pleasure therein  it is so pleasant and so very engrossing she murmured busying herself with a sketch of otto as he rowed gently towards one of the smaller islets  i cant tell you how much i delightturn your head a little more to the leftsoand do keep your nose quiet if you can  impossible said otto  theres a little fly that has made up its mind to go into my nose  i can neither drive it away nor catch it while both hands are engaged with the oars so theres no resource left but to screw my nose about  but what were you going to say you delighted in  inin drawing replied the queen very slowly while her pretty little head went up and down as she glanced alternately at her sitter and the sketchbook on her knee itit takes ones mindsooff  the cares of state said otto  yes i can easily understand what arereha hksh he gave way to a convulsive sneeze there it went up at last and that little flys doom is sealed  i should think it was said pauline laughingly  to be blown from a cannons mouth must be nothing to that  now do keep still just for one minute  for considerably more than a minute she went on sketching busily while her brother pulled along very gently as if unwilling to break the pleasant silence  everything around was calculated to foster a dreamy languid peaceful state of mind  the weather was pleasantly cooljust cool enough to render the brilliant sunshine most enjoyable  not a zephyr disturbed the glassy surface of the sea outside or the lagoon within or broke the perfect reflections of the islets among which they moved  the silence would have been even oppressive had it not been for the soft plaintive cries of wildfowl and the occasional whistling of wings as they hurried to and fro and the solemn boom of the great breakers as they fell at slow regular intervals on the reef  doesnt it sound said pauline looking up from her sketch with a flush of delight like the deep soft voice of the ocean speaking peace to all mankind  what the breakers asked otto  yes dropping with a soft deep roar as they do in the midst of the universal silence  well it doesnt quite strike me in that light pina  my imagination isnt so lively as yours  seems to me more like the snoring of a sleeping giant whom it is best to let lie still like a sleeping dog for hes apt to do considerable damage when roused  the soft influences around soon reduced the pair to silence again after a time it was broken by pauline  what are you thinking of otto  i was thinking your majesty that it seems unfair after making joe prime minister dom a privy councillor the doctor court physician and general humbug that you should give me no definite position in the royal household  what would you say to being commander of the forces asked pauline dreamily as she put in a few finishing touches for then you see you might adopt the title which you have unfairly bestowed on the doctor general humbug  otto shook his head  wouldnt do my dear queen  not being a correct description your bestowing it would compromise your majestys wellknown character for truthfulness  what dyou say to make me a pagepage in waiting  youll have to turn over a new leaf if i do for a page is supposed to be quiet respectful polite obedient ready  no use to go further pina  im not cut out for a page  will you land on this islet  they were gliding softly past one of the most picturesque and verdant gems of the lagoon at the time  no ive taken a fancy to make a sketch from that one nearer to the shore of big island  you see there is not only a very picturesque group of trees on it just at that place but the background happens to be filled up by a distant view of the prettiest part of our settlement where joe binneys garden lies close to mrs lynchs garden with its wonderfully shaped and curious hut no wonder built by herself and a corner of the palace rising just behind the new schoolhouse  mind your eye queen else you go souse overboard when we strike said otto not without reason for next moment the dinghys keel grated on the sand of the islet and pauline having risen in her eagerness to go to work almost fulfilled the boys prediction  but tell me pina what do you mean to do with that schoolhouse when it is built asked otto as he walked beside his sister to the picturesque spot above referred to  to teach in it of course  whatyourself  well yes to some extent  of course i cannot do much in that way  i understandthe affairs of state said otto will not permit etcetera  put it so if you please returned pauline laughing  here sit down help me to arrange my things and ill explain  you cannot fail to have been impressed with the fact that the children of the settlers are dreadfully ignorant  hm  i suppose you are right but i have been more deeply impressed with the fact that they are dreadfully dirty and desperately quarrelsome and deplorably mischievous  just so resumed pauline  now i intend to get your friend redding who was once a schoolmaster to take these children in hand when the schoolroom is finished and teach them what he can superintended by dr marsh who volunteered his services the moment i mentioned the school in the evenings i will take the mothers in hand and teach them their duties to their children and the community  being yourself such an old and experienced mother said otto  silence sir you ought to remember that we have a dear darling mother at home whose character is engraven on my memory and whom i can hold up as a model  true pina  the dear old mother returned otto a burst of homefeeling interfering for a moment with his levity  just you paint her portrait fair and true and if they come anything within a hundred miles o the mark yours will be a kingdqueendom i meanof amazin mothers  i sometimes fear continued the boy becoming grave it may be a long time before we set eyes on mother again  i used to fear the same said pauline but i have become more hopeful on that point since dr marsh said he was determined to have a small schooner built out of the wreck and attempt with a few sailors to reach england in her and report our condition here  why that would do you out of your kingdom pina  it does not follow  and what if it did  it would be a pity  not pleasant you know to be dethroned  but to return to mother  dyou think the old cat will have learned to speak by this time  to this pauline replied that she feared not that although the cat might have mastered the consonants it could never have managed the vowels  dear mother she added in a more earnest tone i am quite sure that though the cat may not speak to her she will not have ceased to speak to the cat  now go away otto youre beginning to make me talk nonsense  but what about the schoolhouse persisted the boy while the girl began to sketch the view  you have not finished that subject  truewell besides teaching the mothers i have great hopes of inducing dom to set up a sundayschool in which those who feel inclined might be taught out of the bible and that might in time lead to our making a church of it on sundays and having regular services for there are some earnest christians among the men who i feel quite sure would be ready to help in the work  then as to an army  an army echoed otto what do we want with an army who have we to fight against  little did otto or pauline think that at the very time they were conversing thus pleasantly on that beautiful islet the presence of a friendly army was urgently required for there in the bushes close behind them listening to every sentence but understanding never a word lay a group of tattooed and armed savages  in the prosecution of evil designs the nature of which was best known to themselves these savages had arrived at refuge islands the night before  instantly they became aware of the presence of the white men and took measures to observe them closely without being themselves observed  carrying their warcanoe over the reef in the dark and launching it on the lagoon they advanced as near to the settlement as possible landed a small party on an islet and then retired with the canoe  it was this party which lay in ambush so near to our little hero and heroine  they had been watching the settlers since daybreak and were not a little surprised as well as gratified by the unexpected arrival of the little boat  the savage who lay there grinning like a cheshire cat and peeping through the long grass not ten feet from where the brother and sister sat was a huge man tattooed all over so that his face resembled carved mahogany his most prominent feature being a great flat nose with a blue spot on the point of it  suddenly otto caught sight of the glitter of this mans eyes and teeth  now the power of selfrestraint was a prominent feature in ottos character at least in circumstances of danger though in the matter of fun and mischief he was rather weak  no sign did otto give of his discovery although his heart seemed to jump into his mouth  he did not even check or alter the tone of his conversation but he changed the subject with surprising abruptness  he had brought up one of the dinghys oars on his shoulder as a sort of plaything or vaultingpole suddenly asking pauline if she had ever seen him balance an oar on his chin he proceeded to perform the feat much to her amusement  in doing so he turned his back completely on the savage in ambush whose cattish grin increased as the boy staggered about  but there was purpose in ottos staggering  he gradually lessened the distance between himself and the savage  when near enough for his purpose he grasped the oar with both hands wheeled sharply round and brought the heavy handle of it down with such a whack on the bridge of the savages bluespotted nose that he suddenly ceased to grin and dropped his proboscis in the dust  at the same instant to the horror and surprise of the brother and sister up sprang half a dozen hideous natives who seized them placed their black hands on their mouths and bore them swiftly away  the warcanoe putting off from its concealment received the party along with the fallen leader and made for the reef  high on the cliffs of big island dr john marsh had been smilingly watching the proceedings of the queen and her brother in the dinghy when he witnessed the last act of the play however the smile vanished with a bound that would have done credit to a kangaroo and a roar that would have shamed a lion he sprang over the cliffs ran towards the beach and was followedyellingby all the men at handsome armed and some not  they leaped into the largest boat on the shore put out the ten oars bent to them with a will and skimmed over the lagoon in fierce pursuit  soon the savages gained the reef carried their canoe swiftly over and launched on the open sea cutting through the great rollers like a rocket or a fishtorpedo  heavy timbers and stout planks could not be treated thus nevertheless the white men were so wild and strong that when the boat finally gained the open sea it was not very far behind the canoe    chapter ten  describes a rescue a conspiracy and a trial  proverbially a stern chase is a long one  happily there are exceptions to proverbs as well as rules  the chase of the warcanoe however with the captured queen on board did not promise to be exceptional at first for the canoe was light and sharp and powerfully manned so that the savages could relieve each other frequently whereas the settlers boat was heavy and blunt and not by any means too full of men  it soon became apparent that the latter was no match for the former under oars the distance between the two visibly increased  dr marsh steered  he was deadly pale and there was a peculiarly intense expression of anxiety in the steady gaze with which he watched the everdiminishing canoe  no chance muttered jabez jenkins who happened to form one of the crew and pulled the bow oar  no chance repeated dominick who also pulled one of the oars theres every chance  were sure to tire them out  ho lads give way with a will  although labouring already with all his might indignation at jenkinss remark enabled him to put on a spurt which the others imitated  still the distance between boat and canoe increased  they are three to one growled malines who up to that time had been doing his best  silence thundered the doctor drawing a revolver from his pocket and cocking it  beads of perspiration stood on the doctors brow and there was something so terrible in the look of his white face that no one ventured to utter another word but all pulled as if for their lives  for some minutes no sound was heard save the regular rattle of the oars in the rowlocks the swish of the foam as it flew from the cutwater and the occasional sob or gasp of the men as they exerted themselves to the utmost limit of their powers in the hopeless pursuit  suddenly teddy malone cried eagerly look outastarn  all turned their gaze as directed and observed a dark line on the horizon  thank god murmured the doctor a breeze  it was indeed true  just at this critical moment of profound despair a gleam of hope was sent to sustain them  is it not often thus in the dealings of god with man  there was no relaxation of effort however on the part of the crew until the breeze bore down on them  then the mate and hugh morrison drawing in their oars set up the mast and hoisted the sails  instantly the good craft bent over as if bowing submissively to her rightful lord and the gurgling water rolled swiftly from her prow  still the men plied the oars but now with the strength of hope until the breeze freshened so much as to render their further use unnecessary  now indeed the tables are turned said dominick with a great sigh of relief as he drew in his oar  yes if the wind holds said the doctor glancing back anxiously  itll howld said malone firmly  who made you so sure a judge of weather demanded jenkins  sure it isnt me as is judge  its the widdy  she says to me this mornin says she thell be a stiff breeze afore night teddy an i nivver found the widdy wrong in her forecasts o the weather  the distance decreases rapidly  hurrah boys well catch them yet cried dominick  this was obviously the case  with her large sails filled by a stiff breeze almost directly astern the boat went through the water like a thing of life  the savages perceiving this redoubled their efforts but in vain  the pursuers gained on them rapidly  an exclamation of surprise burst from those in the boat as they observed two splashes one on either side of the canoe as if some one had fallen or leaped overboard  a great shout from the savages followed and they suddenly ceased to paddle  the canoe was still too far off for the pursuers to make out what had occurred but in another minute they observed that two round black objects emerged from the water some distance astern of the canoe  the savages also saw these and uttered a frightful yell as they backed their craft towards them  theyve jumped overboard exclaimed dominick  now boysready with your guns  no need for this order  all were ready in a second but none dared to fire for fear of hitting the swimmers  just then a savage rose in the stern of the canoe and poised a short spear  instantly every gun in the boat was pointed  not a shot shouted dr marsh as he sprang forward with a doublebarrelled rifle in his hand  keep her away two points he cried as he knelt to take aim  every one was well aware of the doctors power of shooting and waited the result with bated breath  the savage seemed to bend backward for the cast of the spear  at that moment the crack of the doctors rifle was heard and the right arm of the savage fell  another savage caught up the spear and urged his comrades apparently to back the canoe still further but they had got a fright and were evidently unwilling to do so  before they could make up their minds another shot from the doctors rifle sent the second savage headlong into the bottom of the canoe  give them a volley now lads he said turning round and resuming his place at the helm but fire high  the rattling volley which followed and the whistle of the leaden hail over their heads quickly settled the savage minds  one of their paddles which chanced to be held aloft at the moment was shot into splinters and precipitated their decision  with a howl of rage and terror they dipped their paddles into the sea and flew ahead  be ready there cried the doctor as he anxiously guided the boat  teddy malone morris dominick and jabez leaned eagerly over the bows with outstretched arms and clawlike fingers  another moment and queen pina with otto were rescued from the deep as well as from several sharks which doubtless had been licking their lips at the prospect of the royal feast in store for them  aint you goin to carry on an sink the varmints exclaimed jabez in surprise as the doctor put the helm hard down and prepared to return home  no replied the doctor sharply  during the voyage out the crew of the wrecked ship had become intimately acquainted with the doctors qualities among others that there was a certain quiet tone in his no which was final  to put the belligerents of the party more at rest however dominick backed his friend up by adding that he had no illwill to the miserable savages that they had been punished enough already that they had got all they wanted from them and that as their own party consisted chiefly of settlers not warriors there was no occasion for fighting  speak for yourself dom cried otto as he wrung the water out of his garments  if i was in that canoe with a good carvingknife id be warrior enough to give a settler to the baboon wi the swelled nose who crammed me into a  the remainder of the speech was drowned in laughter for otto spoke with intense indignation as he thought of the injuries and indignities he had so recently suffered  why what did they do to you otto asked his brother  oh  i cant tell you replied the other im too mad  tell em pina  queen pina who had also been engaged for some minutes in wringing the water from her skirts sat down and in the sweetest of voices told how they had been surprised on the islet how otto had flattened a chiefs nose with an oar and how they had afterwards been carried off  then she added when they saw that you were unable to overtake them the chief with the swelled nose began to beat poor otto and pull his hair savagely  i do believe he would have killed him if a man who seemed to be the leader of them all had not ordered him to desist when you put up the sail and began to overtake us the chief with the swelled nose got out a rough kind of sack and tried to thrust otto into it  while he was struggling with this chief  fighting interrupted otto fighting with the baboon  well fighting if you prefer ithe asked me if i was brave  no i didnt i said game  wellif i was game to jump overboard at the same moment that he did i quickly said yes  he twisted himself out of the mans  baboons baboons  wellbaboons grasp and went over the side like an eel and  and she interrupted otto she went plump on the other side like a sack of potatoes and we met under the canoe and dived well astern before coming up for breath  you know what pains you took with our swimming and diving dom it helped us then i can tell you and so here we are all alive and hearty  but i saw the black fellow goin to send a spear at pina and cant think why he didnt let fly  praps he did and missed  no he didnt for dr marsh shot him in the arm said dominick and thus saved paulines life  three cheers for the queen cried little buxley who had done good service at the oar and whose little bosom was filled with enthusiasm at the recital of this adventure  the invitation was heartily responded to  an wan more for the doctor shouted malone  in this rejoicing frame of mind they returned to big island where pauline was received with a warm embrace by the widow lynch who had been dancing about the settlement in a more or less deranged state ever since the boat left  that same evening two meetings of considerable importance took place in the palace  the first was a cabinet council in the hall the other a meeting of conspirators in the backkitchen  both were brief for each was interrupted  we will take the cabinet council first  the ministers present at it were the premier dominick and dr marsh both of whom joe had called to his aid  now my dear queen said the premier we have met to consider the constitution but before saying a word about it myself i would like to hear what your majesty has to say about it  im not sure said the queen gravely that i have the faintest notion as to how a constitution should begin or end  but i will give you a motto to set in the forefront of our constitution which may also form the foundation on which it is to be builtthe pattern to which its parts must conform  it is this whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them  i will set that down with pleasure said dominick who acted as clerk but before he could write a line a knock at the door interrupted them then the door opened and ottos head appeared with eagerness in the eyes and a beckoning hand in advance  dominick rose and went out  ive just overheard morris and jabez in the backkitchen making an appointment  shall i tell our squad to be ready  where is the appointed place asked dominick  on the reef  they start this very night for the wind suits and i heard hugh say that all was ready  good  i didnt think the game was so nearly played out  well for us that we are prepared  yes call up the squad  well give them checkmate tonight  it must be explained here that ever since the night of the discovery of the plot organised by morris to seize and carry off the wrecked ship otto and his brother had kept a close watch on the men and were aware of all their plans and intended movements  they had also communicated their knowledge to a select few whom otto styled the squad who had pledged themselves to be ready at a moments notice to do their best to circumvent the conspirators  among other things otto had discovered that malines had agreed to join them professing himself quite willing to act as second in command under morris  it may also be explained that though we have hitherto spoken of the vessel which had been cast on the reef as a wreck it was in reality very slightly injured about the hull and much of the damage done to the spars and rigging had been quietly repaired by the conspirators  when darkness shrouded land and sea two expeditions started from the settlement that nightone following the other  the conspirators in the largest boat set off first  as it was no unusual thing for a night expedition to the reef in order to transport supplies from the wreck in the morning the departure of the large boat attracted little notice  when it had got well away a smaller boat set off containing the squad which numbered among its members dominick the doctor otto joe and his brother david teddy malone little buxley john nobbs the blacksmith and others all of whom were armed with revolvers  they steered for a different part of the reef so as to avoid being seen by the conspirators  on landing they passed through the old burialground and made for the golden cave  this place had since the settlement on big island been given over entirely to paulines use and being styled the queens seaside palace no one ever thought of entering it without permission  hence the party of observation knew that it would be a secure place of ambush  when safe inside dominick and otto were deputed to go out as quietly as possible note what morris and his men were doing and bring back a report  for said the doctor if we interrupt them too soon they may pretend that this is one of their ordinary visits to the ship for supplies and if we are too late they may get clear away in spite of us  we must strike when the iron is hot  yes said otto looking back as he followed his brother well look well to the heating process and let you know when theyre white hot so have your revolvers ready my braves  och shut your tatietrap cried malone but otto having shut the door lost the advice  the night was neither decidedly light nor dark  there might indeed to have been moonlight but clouds veiled the light though they could not altogether obscure it thus there was just enough to render objects dimly visible  all the better whispered dominick as they turned the point of rock that hid the wreck from view  well go down by the thicket  keep close to my heels boy and drop on your hands and knees when you see me do so  all right captain  gliding cautiously down in the direction indicated they came at length to the seaward edge of the thicket where the bushes being less dense permitted them to partially see the wreck  here dominick went on allfours appearing as he crept slowly forward like some sort of huge bear with no tail and its hind feet turned the wrong way  otto followed like a little bear with similar undignified peculiarities having advanced far enough to obtain a clear view of the wreck the spies sank into the grass and crept forward a little way  then they lay still a few moments and listened  they then raised their heads cautiously and looked  what they heard and saw puzzled them not a little  first they noted that the wreck did not seem to lie in the position with which they had been so long familiar  then as their eyes became accustomed to the faint light they observed that a small boat was moving busily about the vessels bow and that a group of dark scarcedistinguishable forms of men was standing on the shore presently there was heard a low yet not unfamiliar growl  this was followed by a high yet not unfamiliar shriek accompanied by a grating sound  lions and cockatoos whispered otto who had crept up alongside of his brother by that time what can they be about  is that a line i see athwart the sky asked dominick lookjust between the wreck and the big ledge there  said otto its more than a line  i see it  half a dozen lines at least and something like a round lump in the middle of em  dont you see itagainst the sky like a black moon  hush boythe growl again  ay man also the cockatoo  oh  i have it now whispered dominick with a low laugh theyve rove blocks and tackle from the ship to the rocks and are working them softly  evildoers fear to be overheard even when theres no chance of being so  your lion otto is the subdued yoheaveho of the men  i see said otto with a grin so broad that his white teeth glistened even in the dark and my cockatoo is the unsubdued screeching of the blocksheaves  they must be trying to get the ship off the reef  a heavy plunge at that moment told that the conspirators were not only trying but had succeeded for the plunge was followed by an irresistible though powerfully suppressed cheer  we have not a moment to lose otto whispered dominick  the ship is free and they will only take time to carry the tackle aboard before embarking  do you run back and bring the squad down at the double  i will keep our friends here in play till they come  not a word did otto reply  he had acquired that first of requisites in a soldier or servantthe habit of prompt obedience  somewhat like a north american savage he sank into the grass and wriggled from the scene  a few moments later dominick rose and walked down towards the conspirators with the easy offhand manner of a man who saunters forth to enjoy the night air  so busy were they getting the tackle into the boat that he was not observed until quite close to them  you seem busy tonight friends he said in his usual pleasant tones as he took his stand close beside hugh morris who was near the bow of the boat  mr rigonda exclaimed malines in great surprise coming forward at the moment  why are you surprised  it is not unusual for me to take a row on a fine night  this reply seeming to imply that dominick had come to the reef alone perhaps in the dinghyemboldened the men some of them laughed  well i confess to being a little surprised sir replied the mate for it so happened that we were preparing something in the nature of a surprise for you and the rest of the settlers  yes i see returned dominick in the same pleasant tone  youve managed to get the ship off the ledge in a very creditable manner and you mean to take her into the lagoon and cast anchor off the settlement  again the men laughed lightly  no sir we dont broke in hugh morris at this point we intend to take her in quite the opposite direction and clear off to sea with her  oh no you dont hugh returned dominick with an agreeable smile which was a little perplexing as well as exasperating  you are going into the lagoon you know you are and i have come to help you  but i say we are not retorted morris in rising wrath and whats more youll have to go along with us now that youve had the illluck to fall in with us  quite right hugh didnt i say that i came off on purpose to go along with you  as he spoke there was heard a rushing sound of feet and a number of dark forms were seen approaching from the bushes  betrayed shouted malines  jump in lads and shove off  he sprang forward but was instantly arrested by the muzzle of a revolver within a foot of his head  its of no use boys said dominick laying his hand on the bow of the boat  youll have to enter it as dead men if you do so without my permission  had the men been armed it might have gone hard with dominick at that moment but so sure had they been of accomplishing their purpose unmolested that the idea of arming had never crossed their minds before they could recover from the surprise or decide what to do the armed squad was upon them  halt boys cried joe binney when close to the boat  now look ee here  it warnt o my seekin that i was made prime minister but now that its bin done ill stick to it an do my duty  if ye knock under like good boys ill recommend ye to the queens marcy  if not ill have ee strung up every man jack of ee  moreover the first man as disobeys my orders ill blow his brains out  now jump aboard boys turning to his own men an keep your revolvers handy  you lads as wanted to run away will follow  the mixture of humour and resolution in joes manner coupled with his wellknown decision of character and his commanding size had its effect  the squad instantly jumped into the boat and the conspirators meekly followed without a word  they sawas hugh afterwards expressed itthat the game was up and made up their minds to submit to the inevitable  the conspirators were ordered to take the oars  afterwards they were made to work the ship round into the channel leading to the lagoon while their armed friends mounted guard over them  it was daybreak when the ship sailed calmly over the lagoon towards silver bay  och man said teddy malone in a low voice to jabez jenkins who stood near him why did ye want to run away wid the owld ship  it wor a sneakin sort o thing warnt it seein that the poor little childers an the women depind so much on whats inside of her  to tell ee the truth teddy replied the man an improved expression coming suddenly over his face i aint sorry that weve bin stopped in this business and wots more i believe that most of us aint sorry we was more than half led into it dee see by lies as to what the leaders was goin to do an arterwards we didnt like to draw back  im sorry for yez returned malone for im afeared well have to skrag the wan half of ye to keep the other half in order  in a spik an span noo settlement where ivvery wan thinks he may do as he likes the laws has to be pritty stiff  weve wan comfort howivverthe quane is marciful  the irishman was right in both his views on this subject as the sequel will show  great was the surprise and joy among the settlers that morning when the fine ship in which they had traversed the ocean sailed grandly over the lagoon and let go her anchor in silver bay  some viewed her as a means of continuing the voyage and escaping from a secluded life of which they were beginning to tire  others thought of her as a means of reopening intercourse with home while not a few thought only of the convenience of having her and her useful cargo so near to them  but great was their surprise when malines morris jabez and the rest of them were landed with their hands bound behind their backs and still greater was that surprise when in open court that is in the midst of the entire colony in the open air these men were charged with their crime  a regular criminal court was instituted on the spot as regular at least as was possible considering the almost total ignorance of all concerned in regard to matters of law  queen pauline appointed dr marsh to be judge he being supposed to be the best acquainted with or least ignorant of legal matters and forms  a jury of twelve men were selected by lot and little buxley was appointed public prosecutor  in justice to the prisoners it was thought that they ought to have an advocate to defend them but as no one would undertake the duty that also was settled by lot and the lot fell upon redding who being a gentle and meek man was perhaps best suited for it  we may not go into the details of this celebrated trial which lasted the greater part of the day and was watched with intense eagerness by the entire population including some of the older children who had become impressed with the delightfullyhorrible idea that a hanging or shooting if not flaying and roasting of some of the criminals would be the certain result  suffice it to say that there was grievous irregularity in the proceedings the public prosecutor not only proved the guilt of the men but in the fervour of his indignation suggested the nature of their punishment the jury not only listened to the facts of the case but commented on them freely throughout and usurping the judges office pronounced sentence on the criminals three or four times over while the judge himself had the greatest possible difficulty in keeping anything like order all round  the only man who performed his duty calmly was redding who in a speech that quite surprised and transfixed the hearers sought to point out that the men on trial had not actually committed the crime with which they had been charged that of seizing the ship but had only contemplated it as had been alleged though even that had not been clearly proved that supposing the crime to have been committed it was a first offence and that justice should always be tempered with mercy as was taught in that best of all lawbooks the bible  the pleading of this man had considerable effect but it could not turn the tide of feeling in favour of the principal prisoners for more than one reason  they had been domineering turbulent fellows all along they had meditated a crime which would have robbed the settlers of many of the necessaries and all the luxuries of life and this displayed a meanness of spirit which they thought deserved severe punishment  accordingly after they had been pronounced guilty by the unanimous voice of the jury and after the judge had consulted earnestly with some members of the privy council malines and morris were condemned to a fortnights imprisonment on short allowance of the poorest food and the other criminals to the same for a week  when malines had been seized and bound on board the ship he had submitted partly from prudence and partly from a belief that the whole affair was a sort of half joke but when he found himself rebound after the trial and cast with his companions into a solid wooden building with a strong door and no window which had been erected as a sort of fortress in which to put the women and children in case of attack by the savages and there provided with maize and water for food and straw for bed he began to realise the fact that he had indeed fallen into the hands of resolute men and under the power of law  i wouldnt mind it so much if theyd only not cut off our baccy he groaned on the afternoon of the following day after a prolonged fit of sullen silence  after all it sarves us right growled hugh morris  speak for yourself said jabez jenkins sulkily  thats just what i do retorted hugh  hear hear from some of the others  what this conversation might have grown to no one can tell for it was interrupted by the opening of the prison door and the entrance of a party of armed men  i am directed said otto who was in command of the party to bring you fellows before the queen so come along  half amused by and half contemptuous of the leader who gave his orders as if he were a powerful giant the prisoners rose and marched out  while this scene was taking place in the jail the widow lynch was holding a private interview with the queen in the palace    chapter eleven  shows how the queen conducted herself in trying circumstances and was finally dethroned  now darlin said mrs lynch to queen pauline as she sat on the side of her bed looking contemplatively at the floor thim rascalsll be in the hall in two minits so take me advice and give them more nor theyve got  but my object in sending for them is not to add to their punishment said the queen  mores the pity for they need it an the coort was too tinder wi them intirely  two weeks why two months would do them more good anyhow see that ye give them a fearful blowin up  ill do what i can for them returned pina with a pleasant laugh as she rose and passed into the audience hall where the prisoners and as many of the settlers as could find room were already gathered  here a slight change of feeling seemed to have taken place in the people  perhaps the sight of hugh and malinestwo men who had up till that time carried matters with rather a high handbound humbled helpless and with bits of straw which had been given them as bedding sticking to their garments induced a touch of pity  at all events there was none of that riotous demand for vengeance which had characterised them when under the influence of excitement at the trial evidently a slight reaction in favour of the culprits had set in and the entrance of the queen therefore took place in solemn silence no one knowing why she had sent for the men or what were her intentions poor pauline was much embarrassed by the silence and by the situation in which she found herself  being a girl of mind and not a mere human machine made and content to run always on beaten paths she had resolved to try an experiment and braced herself to the duty  it was by no means a new experiment on the contrary it was older than this worlds history though new to pauline in the particular circumstancesbeing an application of the law of mercy  my friends said pina in a somewhat tremulous voice which however became firmer as she proceeded this is the first trial that has taken place in our little colony and as crime must be firmly repressed  punished my dearputt it stronger came in a whisper from the side door where widow lynch was listening but fortunately none of the audience heard her  i feel continued pauline taking no notice of the advice that it becomes me as your chosen queen to do what i think will be best for the interests of the community  hear hear exclaimed some of the audience but they gave no further expression to their feelings being still uncertain as to the queens leanings  no doubt continued pina trying not quite successfully to swallow the lump in her throat the punishment which you have awarded these men is in strict accordance with your ideas of justice and being utterly ignorant of law i will not presume to doubt the wisdom of your decision nor would i interfere either by increasing or decreasing the punishment did i not feel that this case is peculiar very peculiar it is as i have said the beginning of crime in our kingdom and little beginnings you all know often lead to great results  a small leak may sink a ship  then in the second place this is the first offence committed by these men and first offences require peculiar treatment  thats so my dearpowerful treatment  give it em hot inaudibly whispered the widow  turning to that book continued pauline which shall be my guide in every act of life i find that god delighteth in mercy  can i go wrong in following humbly in his footsteps  i think not  therefore i venture to exercise the privilege of my position and extend mercy to these men  the law has been vindicated by their trial and condemnation i now in accordance with constitutional right bestow on them a free pardon  this being rapidly uttered quite took the people by surprise and caused them to burst into a ringing cheer above which the no longer inaudible voice of the widow was heard to exclaim  free parding indeed in tones of indignant contempt as she shut the door with a bang and retired in disgust from the scene  i do not know said the queen when silence was restored on what particular officer of my household a confused little smile and blush here falls the duty of setting crimi mean forgiven men free so i now order the prime minister to cut their bonds  amid some laughter joe readily drew forth an enormous claspknife and obeyed this command  then the queen stepping forward held out her hand with a bright smile to hugh morris  none but an utterly abandoned wretch could have resisted that  hugh gave in at onceseized the hand and not only shook it but kissed it heartily  so did malines and so did the others and then they all dispersedteddy malone signalling his exit with a cheer and a shout to the following effect  hooroo boysshes ivvery inch a quane an two or three eighths overcut an dry readymade hot off the irons  were in luckeh boys arent we  the latter remark was made with a hearty slap on the back to little buxley who turning at once and grasping malone in his arms went in for a vigorous wrestle by way of relieving his feelings  whatever may be thought of this matter by men deep in the learning of human law we feel bound to put on record that this plan of queen pauline the first proved a great success for from that day forward malines and morris and all the other conspirators became excellent members of the communitygave up all ideas of piracy on the high seas set to work like men to fence in their properties cultivate their farms prosecute their fisheries and otherwise to make themselves useful  another result was that silver bay settlement began to flourish  similar results usually happen when men give up quarrelling and take to working  the schoolroom was soon finished  the queen had her bible classesplenty of bibles having been found in the shipand dominick even went the length of venturing to conduct special services on sundays  but strange to say the more things prospered on the island the more pensive became the queen as well as otto and his brother  it was not so with dr marsh however  some unknown influence seemed to keep him always in a hearty frame of mind  i cant help it dom said the queen as she walked on the white shore of silver bay one evening while the sun was descending in a golden blaze i cant bear to think of them  poor paulines mind was running on a cheery bald little old gentleman in java and a mild little spectacled old lady with knitting proclivities in england whose chief solace in a humble way was an elderly female cat  am i never to see them again she added as she sat down on a coral rock buried her fair face in her hands and wept  dominick tried to comfort her but in vain  its all very well what you say dom but here we are settling down as if we meant to stay for ever  even otto talks less than he used to about robinson crusoe and no ships ever come near us and the sailors dont want to quit the islands so we cant even use the ship we have got andando darling mother and dear dear papa  if queen pina who broke down at this point had only known that about the time she was speaking the dear papa was running for his life covered with mud from head to foot in the midst of thunder and fire and smoke she might have mingled horror with loving emphasis as she mentioned his name  at the time of which we write the island of java in the malay archipelago was convulsed by one of those tremendous earthquakes which have at irregular intervals from time immemorial shattered its mountains overwhelmed some of its fairest lands and killed thousands of its inhabitants  it is not our intention however to touch on this subject more than will suffice to elucidate our tale  deeply interesting is it at times to note the intimate connection that sometimes exists between places and events which seem exceedingly remote  one would imagine that the eruption of a volcanic mountain in java could not have much influence on the life or fortunes of people living on an island nearly a thousand miles distant from the same  yet so it was in a double sense too as we shall see  the great shock in java which overturned the bald little old gentlemans chair causing him to spring up and exclaim to his partner hallo brooks passed through the intervening earth losing much of its power on the way caused refuge islands to tremble and pauline to look up suddenly with the exclamation  whats that dom  it is marvellously like an earthquake pina  strange to say brooks in java made precisely the same remark at about the same moment to his senior partner  thereafter old mr rigonda who didnt like earthquakes said to brookswho didnt mind earthquakes being used to them  ill start off for england immediately  he did start off even more immediately than he had intended for the neighbouring volcano as if angered by his remark sent up a shock that shook the surrounding houses to their foundations  the senior partner rushed out in terror and was just in time to receive a shower of mud and ashes while he fled away through fire and smoke as already mentioned  the volcano went to sleep again for a short time after that little indication of its power and you may be sure that old rigonda did not wait for its reawakening  one of his own ships was on the point of sailing that very day  he went on boardafter cleaning himselfgot brooks to wind up their business relations in the cabin and left for england with a fair wind  and well was it for the bald little old gentleman that he did so for a few days later strange sounds and appearances were in the air and on the sea  fine ashes filled the sky so that noon became like midnight and everything betokened that something unusually violent must have occurred in the land which they had left  nothing more serious however befell our voyager  in due course he reached england hastened home and without warning burst in upon his wife while that dear little old lady was in the act of remarking to the middleaged cat in a very dolorous tone that she feared something must have happened to the ship for her darlings could never have been so long of writing if all had gone well  it was while the cat gazed contemplatively at the everlasting socks as if meditating a reply that old rigonda burst in  starting up with amazing activity and a cry of joy the old lady swept her feline friend from the tableinadvertently of courseand rushed into her husbands arms while the outraged animal sought refuge on top of the bookcase whence it glared at the happy meeting with feelings that may be more easily understood than described  of course the old mans joy was turned into grief and anxiety when he heard of the departure of his children and was told of their prolonged silence but with that we have nothing to do at present  we return to silver bay where a sense of insecurity had been aroused in the community ever since the tremors of the earth to which we have just referred  with the slumbering of the javanese mountains however these tremors and the consequent fears subsided and were almost forgotten in another source of anxiety  one morning while teddy malone was walking on the beach of silver bay he observed a small object running and stumbling towards him as if in great haste or fear  hurrying forward to meet this object he soon perceived that it was little browneyes of whom he was very fond  whats wrong me darlint he asked catching the child up and kissing her  oh such funny tings me sawdoder side de rocks replied browneyes panting come wid me an see dem  come kik  funny things eh mavourneen what sort of things  oh like beasts  come kik  they wasnt sarpints was they said malone seating the child on his shoulder and hastening towards the rocky point which separated silver bay from the land beyond  no nonot saapints  long beasts like mans only hims not stand and walk but lie down and crawl  much impressed with the childs eager manner the irishman hurried towards the point of rocks filled with curiosity as to what the creatures could be  what sort o hids have they darlint he asked as he neared the point  hids same as mans and faces like you but more uglier all scratched over an dey try to catch me but me runned away  teddy malones hitherto obtuse faculties were awakened  he stopped suddenly being by that time convinced that he stood unarmed within spearthrow of savages in ambush  to advance supposing his conjecture to be right he knew would be certain death  to turn and fly would probably be the same for naked savages could easily overtake him even if unburdened with browneyes whom of course he could not forsake and he was too far from the settlement to shout an alarm  perspiration burst from poor teddys brow for even delay he knew would be fatal as the savages would suspect him of having discovered them  suddenly he put browneyes down on the sand and twisting his figure into a comical position began to hop like a frog  his device had the desired effect browneyes burst into a hearty fit of laughter forgot for the moment the funny beasts and cried do it agin  the poor man did it again thinking intensely all the time what he should do next  would you like to see me dance darlint he asked suddenly  oh yis  thereupon teddy malone began to dance an irish jig to his own whistling although being much agitated he found it no easy matter to whistle in tune or time but that was unimportant  as he danced he took care to back in a homeward direction  the child naturally followed  thus by slow degrees he got beyond what he considered spearthrow and feeling boldness return with security he caught the child up and danced with her on his shoulder  then he set her down and pretended to chase her he even went the length of chasing her a little way in the wrong direction in order to throw the savages more completely off their guard  by degrees he got near to the settlement and there was met by otto  you seem jolly today ted said the boy  whist lad returned the other without intermitting his exercise look as if ye was admirin me  theres lot of them tattooed monkeys savagesbeyant the pint  they dont know ive found it out  slink up an gather the boys an look alive  ill amuse em here till you come back  an i say dont forgit to bring me revolver an cutlash  all right was ottos brief reply as he sauntered slowly up towards the bushes  no sooner was he screened by these however than he ran like a hare to the palace  halloo  dom joe hughall of youthe savages again  armquick  it needed no urging to hasten the movements of all who heard the boys voice  ever since the first appearance of the savages dominick and the doctor had put all the men of the settlement under daily training in drill for an hour or so that they might be better able to act promptly and in concert if occasion should again occur  the arms had been collected and such of them as were not in use stored in a handy position so that in two minutes an armed company was proceeding at a run towards the spot on the shore where malone was still performing his antics to the inexpressible delight of browneyes  where are the spalpeens asked the widow lynch who had followed the men  beyant the rocks mother answered malone as he received his weapons from otto and fell into his place in the ranks yed as well take the child home or shell be sure to followshes nigh as wild as yerself  the widow was indeed fond of seeing as she used to say all the fun that was goin but on this occasion she consented to carry browneyes out of danger while the settlers moved at a quick step towards the point  behind that point of rocks a band of savages lay concealed as malone had rightly conjectured  there were about forty of them all armed with clubs and spears evidently bent on attacking the settlement  of course they meant to do it by surprise and had concealed themselves among the bushes behind the point where they probably would have lain till nightfall if browneyes in her wanderings had not discovered them their chief would have instantly caught and silenced the poor child had she not run so far clear of the point that he would infallibly have revealed himself to teddy malone in doing so  when that worthy drew near to the rocks as described the chief got ready a spear for his reception  when malone took to dancing the chief condescended to smile or grin hideously  when he retreated out of range the chief consoled himself with the reflection that it was just as well night being the best time for attack  when however he beheld a band of men moving towards him armed with the terrible things that spouted smoke fire and stones a change came over the spirit of his dream  after a hasty consultation with his comrades he glided off in the direction of their canoe  the rest followed and when our settlers at last turned the point they saw the foe paddling at full speed across the lagoon  firing a volley of disappointment after them both in words and bullets they ran to their boats and gave chase but as on the former occasion the canoe proved too swift for the boats under oars and the savages got away  the anxiety that naturally filled the breasts of queen pauline and her councillors at this event was speedily forgotten in a recurrence of the earthquake which had previously alarmed them so much  it happened on a calm bright morning when the widow lynch chanced to be washing garments in the palace beside the queen  you see they had not much regard for stateceremonial or etiquette at the court of pauline the first even in public much less in private so that while the widow was deep in the washtub at one end of the hall the queen was busy at the other end patching ottos garments  at first there occurred a slight trembling of the earth which the widow attributing to giddiness in her own cranium recognised with a remonstrative ohone  did you feel that exclaimed pauline pausing in her work and looking up with a slight feeling of alarm  what dearie demanded the widow clearing the soapsuds from her red rolypoly arms  before pauline could answer the earthquake took the liberty of reply by giving an abrupt shake to the whole island which not only set chairs and tables rocking in an alarming manner but drove the entire population from their houses in consternation  among other effects it caused mrs lynch to stagger and catch hold of the washtub which far from supporting her let her fall to the ground and fell on the top of her  to most of the settlers the sensation of a trembling earth was quite new and exceedingly alarming  they stopped abruptly after the first rush and then looked about with pale faces not knowing what to do  malines however was cool and collected  he had been in various volcanic regions of the world and undertook to comfort them  dont be afraid he said when the most of the people had gathered round him  ive often seen this sort o thing on the coast o south america and among the malay islands  it passes away after a while and often without doin much damagethough i have seen a town shook almost to pieces in about five minutes  and what did they do asked jabez jenkins  och whirrihoo shouted teddy malone for at that moment another shock was felt more violent than the preceding  the earth seemed absolutely to roll and one or two of the huts that had been carelessly built fell asunder in partial ruin  where is my brotherand the doctor demanded pauline running up to the group at the moment  theyre away up the mountain with joe and otto answered little buxley i saw em start soon after daybreakto explore they said  what do you think should be done asked pina turning naturally to the mate as being the most intelligent of those around her  if its goin to be bad said malines i would advise you all to git on board the ship as fast as ye can for the land isnt so safe as the water when it takes to quakin  you seem to have had some experience of it  is it going to be bad think you  earthquakes are deceptiveno man can tell  well then we must do our best at once said the queen with an air of calm decision worthy of her rank  go mr malines with your sailors and get all the boats ready  and you my people carry down what you esteem most valuable and get on board the ship without loss of timefor the rest we are in the hands of a loving and merciful god  while these events were enacting on the shore dominick otto the doctor and joe binney were seated near the summit of the highest peak enjoying a cold breakfast  it was their first visit to that particular peak which had a slight hollow or basin of perhaps fifty feet diameter in the centre  just before the first tremulous shock the doctor had been explaining to the prime minister the nature of volcanoes and stating his opinion that the cuplike hollow before them was an extinct crater  the slight shock stopped him in his discourse and caused the party to look at each other with serious faces  its not extinct yet exclaimed otto excitedly pointing to the hollow the earth of which had suddenly cracked in several places and was emitting puffs of sulphurous smoke and steam  they all started up  wed better hasten home said dominick  yestheyll be terribly scared said the doctor hastily beginning to pack up the remains of their breakfast  but before this could be done the second convulsion took place violent trembling occurred for a few seconds then the ground in the old crater burst open and with a terrible explosion fire and smoke belched forth sending huge fragments of rock and showers of ashes into the air which latter fell around the explorers in all directions fortunately without doing them injury  they waited no longer  without even uttering a word they all turned and ran down the hill at full speed  being a considerable distance from the settlement it was upwards of an hour before they arrived  by that time most of the women and children had been sent off to the ship  pauline however had remained on shore to direct and encourage the rest as well as to await the return of her brothers  rightrightyou couldnt have done better said dominick when pauline hastily explained how she had acted  it was mr malines not i who suggested the plan returned the queen  hadnt you better go on board yourself said the doctor and leave us to manage  no i am not a mere puppet sir answered pauline with a little smile yet firmly  my place is here till all my subjects are safe and your duty is to assist in the embarkation not to offer advice to your queen  with a laugh the doctor went off to do his duty muttering my queen indeed fervently  for some time the volcano which had thus sprung into sudden activity partially subsided yet there were occasional tremulous motions of the earth and low growlings in the heart of the mountain on big island while several minor explosions occurred in the crater so that the thoroughly alarmed settlers hastened the embarkation with all despatch before night had closed in they were all safely on board with most of their lighter valuables and tools though necessarily much of their heavier property was left behind  where life is threatened however men are not apt to mind such losses  it now became a question whether they should remain at anchor where they were and abide the issue or proceed at once to sea  some were for remaining others were for putting off to sea  there was much wrangling over it at first and the people seemed in their anxiety to have quite forgotten their queen when she stepped forward and raising her clear silvery voice produced a dead calm at once  joe she said go down to the cabin and await me there  the prime minister obeyed instantly  now said pauline turning to the people choose among you six of your number to consult with me and do it at once  of course the men wellknown as the best among the settlers were instantly named we need scarcely add that among them were dominick the doctor and malines  while these were engaged in consultation below a terrible outburst of the volcano settled the matter for them and brought them all hastily on deck  the summit of the crater seemed to have been blown up into the air with a most terrific noise while a dense mass of smoke steam and ashes was hurled upwards and seemed to blot out the sky  twilight which had been deepening was converted into blackest night in a moment and darkness profound would undoubtedly have continued had it not been for the lurid glare of the fires which flashed at intervals from the crater suddenly the waters of the sea became agitated  the ship rocked uneasily and jerked at her cable while the terrified people clung to shrouds and ropes and belayingpins  then the fire on the mountaintop increased tenfold in volume and intensity  another moment and several large holes opened in the mountainside nearest to them from which streams of molten lava burst forth and began to descend towards the deserted settlement  at that moment there was a great shout  it had been discovered that in the confusion little browneyes had been forgotten  a small boat hung at the davits on the port side  it was manned instantly  the doctor jumped to the helm otto followed and before any could interpose the queen suddenly stepped in  you are mad cried the doctor  lower away said pina as if she had been a trained seacaptain all her life  instantly the ropes were eased off and in a few seconds the boat was in the sea and on the shore  they found little browneyes sound asleep in her crib with a river of redhot lava stretching its fiery tongues towards her as if eager for a meal  supplelimbed otto was first he seized the child and bore her off to the boat  another terrible explosion occurred just then  ashes and masses of rock began to rain around them  a falling stone struck paulines head and she fell  the doctor who held her hand seized her in his arms and bore her away  a few minutes more and they were all safe on board again  but there was no time for congratulations  the sea which had before been agitated now heaved in wild waves though there was no wind  it was then seen that big island was actually crumblingsinking into the water  the continuous rumbling of the volcano was terrible intermittent explosions were frequent  to add to the horrors of the scene the darkness deepened  as the island went down the sea rushed tumultuously in to overwhelm it  then it was that the stout cable under god saved them from immediate destruction  the ship was hurled from side to side like a cork on the boiling flood  but no cable could long withstand such a strain  the chain snapped at last and they seemed to be rushing with railway speed to their fate amid surrounding fire and overwhelming water and roaring thunders and raining ashes when suddenly there was a perceptible diminution in the turmoil and gradually the waves calmed down  with feelings of intense thankfulness the terrified people let go their second anchor though the darkness was by that time so thick that they could barely see each other  it may be imagined what a night of anxiety they spent  with pauline and some others it was a night of earnest prayer  when the light of day at last broke faintly in the east it revealed the fact that refuge islands had actually and totally disappeared and that our settlers were floating on the bosom of the open sea    chapter twelve  last chapter  an island queen no longer pauline rigonda sits on the quarterdeck of the emigrant ship gazing pensively over the side at the sunlit sea dethroned by the irresistible influences of fire and water our heroine has retired into the seclusion of private life  after escaping from the volcano as described in the last chapter the settlers resolved to proceed under the guidance of malines as captain and morris as mate to the port for which they had originally been bound when the disaster on refuge islands had arrested them  of course this was a great disappointment to poor pauline and her brothers who as may be imagined were burning with anxiety to get back to england  feeling however that it would be unreasonable as well as selfish to expect the emigrants to give up their longdelayed plans merely to meet their wishes they made up their minds to accept the situation with a good grace  you see said otto to the exqueenfor he was becoming very wise in his own eyes and somewhat oracular in the midst of all these excitementswhen a fellow cant help himself hes bound to make the best of a bad business  dont you think it would be better to say he is bound to accept trustingly what god arranges believing that it will be all for the best returned pauline  how can a bad business be for the best demanded otto with the air of one who has put an unanswerable question  his sister looked at him with an expression of perplexity  well it is not easy to explain she said yet i can believe that all is for the best  ha pina returned the boy with a little touch of pride its all very well for you to say that but you wont get men to believe things in that way  otto said dr marsh who was standing near and listening to the conversation it is not so difficult as you think to prove that what we call a bad business may after all be for the best  i remember at this moment a case in point  comeill tell you a story  once upon a time i knew a gentleman with a stern face and a greedy soul who believed in nothing almost except in the wickedness of mankind and in his own capacity to take advantage of that wickedness in order to make money money was his god  he spent all his time and all his strength in making it and he was successful  he had many ships on the sea and much gold in the bank  he had also a charming little wife who prayed in secret that god would deliver her husband from his false god and he had a dear little daughter who loved him to distraction in spite of his business habits  well one year there came a commercial crisis  mr getall eagerly risked his money and overspeculated  that same year was disastrous in the way of storms and wrecks  among the wrecks were several of mr getalls finest ships  a fire reduced one of his warehouses to ashes and worse still one of his most confidential and trusted clerks absconded with some thousands of pounds  all that was a very bad business wasnt it  it was assented otto go on  the upshot was a crash  whatof the burning warehouse  no of the whole business and the getalls were reduced to comparative beggary  the shock threw the poor little wife who had always been rather delicate into bad health rendering a warm climate necessary for her at a time when they could not afford to travel  moreover little evas education was entirely stopped at perhaps the most important period of her life  that was a bad business wasnt it  that was a much worse business asserted otto  well when mr getall was at the lowest stage of despair and had taken more than one look over the parapet of london bridge with a view to suicide he received a letter from a longneglected brother who had for many years dwelt on the continent partly for economy and partly for a sons health  the brother offered him a home in the south of france for the winter as it would do his wife good he said and he had room in his house for them all and wanted their company very much to keep him from being dull in that land of warmth and sunshine  getall was not the man to refuse such an offer  he went  the brother was an earnest christian  his influence at that critical time of sore distress was the means in the holy spirits hands of rescuing the misers soul and transferring his heart from gold to the saviour  a joy which he had never before dreamed of took possession of him and he began timidly at first to commend jesus to others  joy they say is curative  the effect of her husbands conversion did so much good to little mrs getalls spirit that her body began steadily to mend and in time she was restored to better health than she had enjoyed in england  the brotherinlaw who was a retired schoolmaster undertook the education of eva and being a clever man as well as good trained her probably much better than she would have been trained had she remained at home at last they returned to england and mr getall with the assistance of friends started afresh in business  he never again became a rich man in the worldly sense but he became rich enough to pay off all his creditors to the last farthing rich enough to have something to spare for a friend in distress rich enough to lay past something for evas dower and rich enough to contribute liberally to the funds of those whose business it is to consider the poor  all that you see being the result of what you have admitted my boy was a bad business  true but then objected otto who was of an argumentative turn if all that hadnt resulted it would have been a bad business still  not necessarilyit might have turned out to be a good business in some other way or for somebody else  the mere fact that we cant see how is no argument against the theory that everything is constrained to work for good by him who rules the universe  what even sin asked otto in surprise  even sin returned the doctor  dont you see that it was getalls sin of greed and overspeculation and the clerks sin of embezzlement which led to all these good results but of course as neither of them had any desire or intention to achieve the good results which god brought about they were none the less guilty and were entitled to no credit but on the contrary to condign punishment  what i wish to prove is that god causes all things to work out his will yet leaves the freewill of man untouched  this is a great mystery at the same time it is a great fact and therefore i contend that we have every reason to trust our loving father knowing that whatever happens to us will be for the bestnot perhaps for our present pleasure or gratification but for our ultimate best  butbutbut said otto while premature wrinkles rippled for a minute over his smooth brow at that rate is it fair to blame sinners when their very sins are made to bring about gods will  now otto dont run away with a false idea  for you to sin with a view to bring about good is one thingand a very wicked thing which is severely condemned in scripturebut for god to cause good to result from your sin and in spite of you is a totally different thing think of a pirate my boy a bloodyhanded villain who has spent his life of crime in gathering together enormous wealth with which to retire into selfish enjoyment at last  but he is captured  his wealth is taken from him and with it good men establish almshouses for the aged poor hospitals for the sick free libraries and free baths everywhere and many other good and beneficent works  the pirates labours have in gods providence been turned into this channel  is the pirate less guilty or less deserving of punishment on that account  further discussion on this point was interrupted by a sharp order from malines to reduce sail and the consequent bustling about of the sailors  going to blow think you asked dominick who came on deck at the moment  cant tell yet replied the mate but the glass has fallen suddenly and one must be prepared all the more that the ship has been more severely strained on the reef than i had thought  would miss pauline be prepared he added in a lower tone to receive the deputation this afternoon  yes she is quite prepared returned dominick in the same low tone though she is much perplexed not being able to understand what can be wanted of her  is it so profound a secret that i may not know it  you shall both know it in good time the mate replied as he turned to give fresh directions to the man at the wheel  that afternoon the assembly in the cabin could hardly be styled a deputation for it consisted of as many of the emigrants as could squeeze in  it was led by joe binney who stood to the front with a document in his hand  pauline with some trepidation and much surprise expressed on her pretty face was seated on the captains chair with an extra cushion placed thereon to give it a more thronelike dignity  she was supported by dominick on one side and otto on the other  joe advanced a few paces stooping his tall form partly in reverence and partly to avoid the deckbeams  clearing his throat and with a slightly awkward air he read from the document as follows  dear miss pauline may it please yer majesty for we all regards you yet as our lawful queen ive bin appinted as prime minister of our communitywhich aint yet broke upto express our wishes likewise our sentiments  thats sogo it joe broke in a soft whisper from teddy malone  we wishes first of all continued the premier to say as how were very sorry that your majestys kingdom has bin blowed up an sunk to the bottom o the sea worse luck from mrs lynchbut we congratulate you an ourselves that we the people are all alivean kickin softly from malonehush silence from several othersan as loyal an devoted as ever we was  more so and hear hear  since the time you queen pauline took up the reins of guvermint it has bin plain to us all that you has done your best to rule in the fear o god in justice truthfulness an lovin kindness  an we want to tell you in partikler that your readins out of the bible to us an the childnwhich was no part o your royal dooty so to speakhas done us all a power o good an there was some of us big uns as needed a lot o good to be done us as well as the childn sure an thats true annyhow from teddy  now what weve got to say continued joe clearing his throat again and taking a long breath is thisthe land were agoin to aint thickly popilated as we knows on an we would take it kindly if youd consent to stop there with us an continue to be our queen so as we may all stick together an be rightly ruled on the lines o lovin kindnesswith a taste o the broomstick now an then from teddy if your majesty agrees to this we promise you loyal submission an sarvice  moreover we will be glad that your brother mister dominick should be prime minister an mister otto his scritairy or wotever else you please  also that dr marsh should be the chansler o the checkers or anything else you like as well as sawbonesingineral to the community  an this our petition concluded joe humbly laying the document at paulines feet has bin signed by every man in the ship except teddy malone  thats a lie shouted the amazed teddy  who continued joe regardless of the interruption not bein able to write has put his cross to it  hear hear cried the relieved irishman while the rest laughed loudlybut not long for it was observed that pauline had put her handkerchief to her eyes  what the exqueen said in reply we need not put down in detail  of course she expressed her gratitude for kind expressions and her thankfulness for what had been said about her sabbathschool work  she also explained that her dear mother in england as well as their old father in java must be filled with deepest anxiety on account of herself and her brothers by that time and that therefore she was obliged most unwillingly to decline the honour proposed to her  och exclaimed the disappointed widow lynch cudnt ye sind for yer mother to come out to yez an the ould man in javy too  theyd be heartily welcome an sure wed find em some sitivation under guvermint to kape their pot bilin  but these strong inducements failed to change the exqueens mind  now while this was going on in the cabin a change was taking place in the sky  the bad weather which malines had predicted came down both suddenly and severely and did the ship so much damage as to render refitting absolutely necessary  there was no regular port within hundreds of miles of them but malines said he knew of one of the eastern isles where there was a safe harbour good anchorage and plenty of timber  it would not take long to get there though considering the damaged state of the ship it might take some months before they could get her into a fit state to continue the voyage  accordingly they altered their course with heavy hearts for the emigrants were disappointed at having their voyage again interrupted while the rigondas were depressed at the thought of the prolonged anxiety of their parents  now this is a bad business isnt it said otto to the doctor with a groan when the course was decided  looks like it my boy but it isnt replied the doctor who nevertheless being himself but a frail mortal was so depressed that he did not feel inclined to say more  in this gloomy state of matters pinas sweet tones broke upon them like a voice from the better landas in truth it wassaying i will trust and not be afraid  about this time the cloud which hung over the emigrant ship was darkened still more by a visit from the angel of death  the mother of browneyes died  at that time pauline was indeed an angel of mercy to mother and child  after the remains of the mother were committed to the deep the poor orphan clung so piteously to pauline that it was scarcely possible to tear her away  it was agreed at last that as the child had now no natural protector except an uncle and aunt who seemed to think they had already too many children of their own pauline should adopt her  when the emigrants reached the islandharbour without further mishap they were surprised to find a large steamer at anchor  the captain of it soon explained that extensive damage to the machinery had compelled him to run in there for shelter while the necessary repairs were being effected  where are you bound for asked dominick who with dr marsh and otto had accompanied malines on board the steamer  for england  for england almost shouted dominick and otto in the same breath  yes  our repairs are completed we set off tomorrow  have you room for two or three passengers  yes plenty of room  we shall have to put several ashore at the cape where i hope to get a doctor too for our doctor died soon after we left port and we are much in want of one having a good many sick men on board  otto whispered dr marsh our having been diverted from our course has not turned out such a bad business after all has it  on the contrary the very best that could have happened  ill never give way to unbelief again  poor otto  he did not at that time know how deeply doubt and unbelief are ingrained in the human heart  he did not know that man has to be convinced again and again and over again before he learns to hope against hope and to believe heartily at all times that he doeth all things well  it was with very mingled feelings that the rigondas dr marsh and browneyes parted next day from the friends with whom they had associated so long  it is no exaggeration to say that there was scarcely a dry eye in the two vessels for while the settlers wept for sorrow the crews and passengers wept more or less from sympathy  even the deadeyes of the ship according to malone shed tears  as for poor browneyes who was a prime favourite with many of her old friends male and female before she got away she had been almost crushed out of existence by strong arms and her eyes might have been peagreen or pink for anything you could tell so lost were they in the swollen lids long after the vessels had separated the settlers continued to shout words of goodwill and blessing well never forgit ye miss pauline came rolling after them in the strong tones of joe binney  god bless you miss came not less heartily from hugh morris  we loves ye darlint followed clear and shrill from the vigorous throat of the widow lynch and a wild hooray from teddy endorsed the sentiment nobbs the blacksmith and little buxley ran up the rigging to make the waving of their caps more conspicuous and when faces could no longer be distinguished and voices no longer be heard the waving of kerchiefs continued until the rounding of a cape suddenly shut them all out from view for ever  thank god said dr marsh with a voice deepened and tremulous from emotion that though they have lost their queen they shall never lose the sweet influences she has left behind her  the great ocean steamer had now cleared the land her mighty engines seemed to throb with joy at being permitted once more to go ahead full speed and soon she was cleaving her way grandly through the broadbacked billows of the southern seahomeward bound  let us leap on in advance of her  the little old lady with the gold spectacles and neat black cap and smooth braided hair is seated in her old armchair with the old sock apparentlythough it must have been the latest born of many hundreds of sockson the needles and the unfailing cat at her elbow  the aspect of the pair gives the impression that if a french revolution or a chili earthquake were to visit england they would clickandgaze on with imperturbable serenity through it all  but the little old lady is not alone now  old mr rigonda sits at the table opposite to her with his forehead in his hands as though he sought to squeeze ideas into his head from a book which lies open before him on the table  vain hope for the book is upside down  profound silence reigns with the exception of the clicking needles and the purring cat  my dear at length exclaimed the bald old gentleman looking up with a weary sigh  yes john  such is his romantic christian name  i cant stand it maggie  such is her ditto  it is indeed hard to bear john  if we only knew for certain that they areare gone it seems as if we could bow to his will but this terrible and wearing uncertainty is awful  did you make inquiry at lloyds today  lloyds  you seem to think lloyds can tell everything about all that happens on the sea  no its of no use inquiring anywhere or doing anything  we can only sit still and groan  in pursuance of this remaining consolation the poor old gentleman groaned heavily and squeezed his forehead tighter and gazed at the reversed book more sternly while the old lady heaved several deep sighs  even the cat introduced a feeble mew as of sympathy into the midst of its purrthe hypocrite  it was the earthquake that did it cried mr rigonda starting up and pacing the room wildly im convinced of that  how can that be john dear when you were in java at the time and our darlings were far away upon the sea  how can i tell how it could be maggie  do you take me for a geological philosopher who can give reasons for every earthly thing he asserts  all i know is that these abominable earthquakes go half through the world sometimes  pity they dont go through the other half split the world in two and get rid of the subterranean fires altogether  john my dear  well maggie dont be hard on me for gettin irascible now and then if you only knew what i suffer whenbut forgive me  you do know what i sufferthere  he stooped and kissed the old ladys forehead  the cat uncertain apparently whether an assault was meant arched its back and tall and glared slightly  seeing however that nothing more was done it subsided  just then the wheels of a cab were heard rattling towards the front door as if in haste  the vehicle stopped suddenly  then there was impatient thundering at the knocker and wild ringing of the bell  fire gasped the halfpetrified mrs rigonda  no smell said her halfparalysed spouse  loud voices in the passage stumbling feet on the stairs suppressed female shrieks bass masculine exclamations room door burst open old couple in alarm on their feet cat in horror on the top of the bookcase  mother mother  o fatheryelled rather than spoken  another moment and the bald little old man was wrestling in the exqueens arms the little old lady was engulfed by dominick and otto dr john marsh and browneyes stood transfixed and smiling with idiotic joy at the door while the cattwice its size with every hair erect glared and evolved miniature volcanoes in its stomach  it was an impressive sight  much too much so to dwell on  passing it over let us look in on that happy home when toned down to a condition of reasonable felicity  its a dreamall a wild unbelievable dream sighed the old gentleman as with flushed face and dishevelled hair he spread himself out in an easy chair with queen pina on his knee and browneyes at his feet  hush all of youwait a bit  there was dead silence and some surprise for a few seconds while mr rigonda shut his eyes tight and remained perfectly still during which brief lull the volcanic action in the cat ceased and its fur slowly collapsed  dreams shift and change so murmured the sceptical man gradually opening his eyes againwhat youre there yet pina  of course i am darling daddy  here pinch me on the arm dominickthe tender part else ill not waken up sufficiently to dispel it  a fresh outburst of hilarity which started the stomachic volcanoes and hair afresh while pauline flung her arms round her fathers neck for the fiftieth time and smothered him  when he was released and partially recovered otto demanded to know if he really wanted the dream dispelled  certainly not my boy certainly not if its real but it would be so dreadfully dismal to awake and find you all gone that id prefer to dream it out and turn to something else if possible before waking ii  here the old gentleman suddenly seized his handkerchief with a view to wipe his eyes but changing his mind blew his nose instead  just then the door opened and a small domestic entered with that eminently sociable meal tea  with a final explosion worthy of hecla or vesuvius the cat shot through the doorway as if from a catapult and found refuge in the darkest recesses of the familiar coalhole  but who said mr rigonda casting his eyes suddenly downward who is this charming little browneyed maid that you have brought with you from the isles of the southern seas  a nativea little fiji princesseh  hush father whispered pauline in his ear shes a dear little orphan who has adopted me as her mother and would not be persuaded to leave me  so you see ive brought her home  quite right quite right returned the old man stooping to kiss the little one  ive often thought youd be the better of a sister pina so perhaps a daughter will do as well  now then tea is ready draw in your chairs darlings said mrs rigonda with a quavering voice  the truth is that all the voices quavered that night more or less and it was a matter of uncertainty several times whether the quavering would culminate in laughter or in tears  why do you so often call pina a queen dear boy asked mrs rigonda of her volatile son otto  why replied the youth whose excitement did not by any means injure his appetiteto judge from the manner in which he disposed of muffins and toast sandwiched now and then with wedges of cakewhy because she is a queenat least she was not long ago  an incredulous smile playing on the good ladys little mouth pauline was obliged to corroborate ottos statement  and what were you queen of asked her father who was plainly under the impression that his children were jesting  of refuge islands daddy said pina pass the toast otto i think i never was so hungry  coming home obviously improves ones appetite  you forget the open boat pina  ah true returned pauline i did for a moment forget that  yes we were fearfully hungry that time  of course this led to further inquiry and to dominick clearing his throat at last and sayingcome ill give you a short outline of our adventures since we left home  it must only be a mere sketch of course because it would take days and weeks to give you all the details  dont be prosy dom said otto helping himself to a fifth if not a tenth muffin  prosiness is one of your weak points when left to your own promptings  but before you begin dom said old mr rigonda tell us where refuge islands are  in the southern pacific father  yes observed otto at the bottom of the southern pacific  indeed exclaimed the old gentleman whose incredulity was fast taking the form of sarcasm  not far i suppose from that celebrated island which was the last home and refuge of our famous ancestor the spanish pirate who was distantly related through a first cousin of his mother to don quixote  you doubt us daddy i see said pauline laughing but i do assure you we are telling you the simple truth  i appeal to dr marsh  dr marsh who had chiefly acted the part of observant listener up to that moment now assured mr rigonda with so much sincerity that what had been told him was true that he felt bound to believe him  yes indeed said dr marsh your daughter was in truth a queen and i was one of her subjects  indeed i may say that in one sense she is a queen still but she has been dethroned by fire and water as you shall presently hear though she still reigns in the affections of her people and can never be dethroned again  this speech was greeted with some merriment for the doctor said it with much enthusiasm  then dominick began to give an account of their adventures interrupted and corrected not infrequently by his pert brother otto who being still afflicted with his southseaisland appetite remained unsatisfied until the last slice of toast and the last muffin and the last wedge of cake had disappeared from the table  dominicks intentions were undoubtedly good and when he asserted that it was his purpose to give his father and mother merely an outline of their adventures he was unquestionably sincere but the outline became so extended and assumed such a variety of complex convolutions that there seemed to be no end to the storyas there certainly seemed to be no end to the patience of the listeners  so dominick went on and on and on as storybooks put it until the fire in the grate began to burn low until otto had consumed the contents of the teapot and the creamjug and the sugarbasin and had even gathered up economically the crumbs of the cake until the still eager audience had begun to yawn considerately with shut mouths until the household cat lost in amazement at prolonged neglect had ventured to creep from the coalhole and take up a modest position on the floor in the shadow of its little old mistress  there is no saying how long this state of things would have gone on if it had not been for the exuberant spirits of otto who under an impulse of maternal affection sprang to his mothers side with intent to embrace her and unwittingly planted his foot on the cats tail  then indeed the convoluted outline came to an abrupt end for with a volcanic explosion suggestive of thunder and lightning inlaid with dynamite the hapless creature sprang from the room followed by a shriek from its mistress and a roar of laughter from all the rest  it is not certainly known where that cat spent the following fortnight the only thing about it that remains on record is the fact that at the end of that space of time it returned to its old haunts deeply humbled and much reduced that it gradually became accustomed to the new state of things and even mounted the table and sat blinking in its old position and grew visibly fatter while the old lady revived old times by stroking it as she had been wont to and communicating to it some of her thoughts and fancies  ay pussy she said on one of these occasions when they chanced to be alone together little did you and i think when we used to be sitting so comfortably here that our darlings were being tossed about and starved in open boats on the stormy sea  ah pussy pussy we little knewbut its all well that ends well as a great writer that you know nothing about has said and you and i can never never be thankful enough for getting back safe and sound our dear old man and our darling boys and ourour little pauline the island queen  the end
