merchant of bristol england landed at the little seaport town of newbury mass  we generally speak of a mans descent in the case of james russell lowells ancestry it was rather an ascent through eight generations percival lowles son john lowell was a worthy cooper in old newbury his greatgrandson was a shoemaker his greatgreatgrandson was the rev john lowell of newburyport the father of the hon john lowell who is regarded as the author of the clause in the massachusetts constitution abolishing slavery  judge lowells son charles was a unitarian minister learned saintly and discreet he married miss harriet traill spence of portsmoutha woman of superior mind of great wit vivacity and an impetuosity that reached eccentricity she was of keltic blood of a family that came from the orkneys and claimed descent from the sir patrick spens of the grand old ballad several of her family were connected with the american navy her father was keith spence purser of the frigate philadelphia and a prisoner at tripoli  by ancestry on both sides and by connections with the russells and other distinguished families lowell was a good type of the new england gentleman  he was born on the 22d of february 1819 at elmwood not far from brattle street cambridge  this threestoried colonial mansion of wood was built in 1767 by thomas oliver the last royal lieutenantgovernor before the revolution1 like other houses in tory row it was abandoned by its owners soon afterwards it came into possession of elbridge gerry governor of massachusetts and fifth vicepresident of the united states whose memory and name are kept alive by the term gerrymander it next became the property of dr lowell about a year before the birth of his youngest child and it was the home of the poet until his death    footnote 1 thomas oliver was graduated from harvard      college in the class of 1758 he was a gentleman of fortune      and lived first in roxbury he bought the property on      elmwood avenue in 1766 when he accepted the royal      commission of lieutenantgovernor he became president of      the council appointed by the king on sept 2 1774 about      four thousand middlesex freeholders assembled at cambridge      and compelled the mandamus councillors to resign the      president of the council urged the propriety of delay but      the committee would not spare him he was forced to sign an      agreement as a man of honor and a christian that he would      never hereafter upon any terms whatsoever accept a seat at      said board on the present novel and oppressive form of      government he immediately quitted cambridge and when the      british troops evacuated boston he accompanied them by an      odd coincidence he went to reside at bristol england where      he died at the age of eightytwo years in 1815 shortly      before the lowells who were of bristol origin took      possession of his former home in underwoods sketch of      lowell thomas oliver is confused with chief justice peter      oliver a man of a very different type of character  lowells early education was obtained mainly at a school kept nearly opposite elmwood by a retired publisher an englishman mr william wells he also studied in the classical school of mr danial g ingraham in boston he was graduated from harvard college in the class of 1838 he is reported as declaring that he read almost everything except the classbooks prescribed by the faculty lowell says in one of his early poems referring to harvard          tho lightly prized the ribboned parchments three          yet collegisse juvat i am glad          that here what colleging was mine i had  he was secretary of the hasty pudding society and one of the editors of the college periodical harvardiana to which he contributed various articles in prose and verse his neglect of prescribed studies and disregard of college discipline resulted in his rustication just before commencement in 1838 he was sent to concord where he resided in the family of barzillai frost and made the acquaintance of emerson then beginning to rouse the ire of conservative unitarianism by his transcendental philosophy of the brilliant but overestimated margaret fuller who afterwards severely criticised lowells verse and of other wellknown residents of the pretty town he had been elected poet of his class his removal from college prevented him from delivering the poem which was afterwards published anonymously for private distribution it contained a satire on abolitionists and reformers i know the village he writes long afterwards in the person of hosea biglow esquire          i know the village though was sent there once          aschoolin cause to home i played the dunce  on his return to cambridge he took up the study of law and in 1840 received the degree of llb he even went so far as to open an office in boston but it is a question whether there was any actual basis of fact in a whimsical sketch of his entitled my first client published in the shortlived boston miscellany edited by nathan hale  several things engrossed lowells attention to the exclusion of law society at cambridge was particularly attractive at that time allston the painter was living at cambridgeport judge storys pleasant home was on brattle street the fays then occupied the house which has since become the seat of radcliffe college longfellow described as a slender blond young professor was established in the craigie house the famous names of dr palfrey professor andrews norton father of lowells friend and biographer the saintly henry ware and others will occur to the reader he was fond of walking and knew every inch of the beautiful ground then called sweet auburn now turned by the hand of misguided man into that most distressing of monstrositiesa modern cemetery he haunted the poetic shades of the waverley oaks heard the charming music of beaver brook and climbed the hills of belmont and arlington  he himself took his turn in establishing a magazine in january 1843 he started the pioneer to which hawthorne john neal miss barrett poe whittier story parsons and others contributed and which in spite of such an array of talent perished untimely during the winds of march  he had already published in 1841 a little volume of poems entitled a years life they were marked by no great originality betrayed little promise of future eminence and margaret fuller who reviewed them was quite right in asserting that neither the imagery nor the music of lowells verses was his own the first sonnet in the present volume page 1 practically acknowledges the force of this criticism the influence of wordsworth and tennyson may be distinctly traced in most of them but many of the lines were harsh and many of the rhymes were careless lowells later and correcter taste omitted most of them from his collected works  not far from elmwood but in the adjoining village of watertown lived one of lowells classmates whose sister maria white a slender delicate girl with a poetic genius in some respects more regulated and lofty than his own early inspired him with a true and saving love speaking of the influences that moulded his life george william curtis says       the first and most enduring was an early and happy passion      for a lovely and highminded woman who became his wifethe      egeria who exalted his youth and confirmed his noblest      aspirations a heaveneyed counsellor of the serener air      who filled his mind with peace and his life with joy  the young ladys prudent father objected to the marriage until the newly fledged lawyer should be in a position to support a wife  shortly after the shipwreck of the pioneer lowell was offered a hundred dollars by grahams monthly for ten poems when pegasus is able to earn such princely sums there seems no reason why love should be kept waiting at the cottage door in 1844 lowell published a new edition of his poems and married miss white it was her influence that decided him to cast in his lot with the abolitionists it was her refined taste that shaped and tempered his impetuous verse a volume of her poems was in 1855 in an edition of fifty copies privately printed and is now very rare it is an odd circumstance that in lowells library from which harvard college was allowed to select any volumes not in gore hall neither this book nor any of lowells own early poems was to be found  the young couple took up their residence at elmwood and here were born three daughters and a son all but one of his children died in infancy many of the tenderest of his poems refer with touching pathos to his bereavement such for instance are the changeling and the first snowfall  in 1845 appeared the vision of sir launfala genuine inspiration composed in two days in a sort of ecstasy of poetic fervor that more than anything established his fame he recognized that he was dedicated to the muses  in 1846 he wrote       if i have any vocation it is the making of verse when i      take my pen for that the world opens itself ungrudgingly      before me everything seems clear and easy as it seems      sinking to the bottom could be as one leans over the edge of      his boat in one of those dear coves at fresh pond my      true place is to serve the cause as a poet then my heart      leaps before me into the conflict  the same year he began his biglow papers in the boston courier such jeux desprit are apt to be ephemeral lowells are immortal they preserved in literary form a fastfading dialect they caught and embalmed the mighty issues of a tremendous worldproblem their influence was incalculable he gathered them into a volume in 1848 and became corresponding editor of the antislavery standard fortunate man who throws himself into an unpopular cause which is in harmony with the right how different from wordsworth who attacked the ballot and took sides against reform  lowells penchant for satire was exemplified again the same year in his fable for critics  in this lowell with no sparing hand laid on his portraits most droll and amusing colors it is a comic portrait gallery a series of caricatures whose greatest value as in all good caricatures lies in the accurate presentation of characteristic features he did not spare himself    there is lowell whos striving parnassus to climb   with a whole bale of isms tied together with rhyme   he might get on alone spite of troubles and bowlders   but he cant with that bundle he has on his shoulders   the top of the hill he will neer come nigh reaching   till he learns the distinctions twixt singing and preaching   his lyre has some chords that would ring pretty well   but hed rather by half make a drum of the shell   and rattle away till hes old as methusalem   at the head of a march to the last new jerusalem  some of his thrusts left embittered feelings but in general the tone was so goodnatured that only the thinskinned could object and it must be confessed many of his judgments have been confirmed by time  in 1851 lowell visited europe and spent upwards of a year widening his acquaintance with the polite languages but it is remarkable that lowell gave the world almost no metrical translations shortly after his return his wife died oct 27 1853 after a slow decline in reference to this bereavement longfellow wrote his beautiful poem the two angels  the following year longfellow resigned the smith professorship of the french and spanish languages and literature and belles lettres and lowell was appointed his successor with two years leave of absence he had won his spurs he had collected his poems in two volumes not including a years life the biglow papers or the fable for critics he was known as one of the most brilliant contributors to putnams monthly and other magazines  in 1854 he delivered a series of twelve lectures on english poetry before the lowell institute ten years before he had published a volume of conversations on the poets the contrast between the two works is no less pronounced than that between his earlier and later poems  in both however there is a tendency toward a confusing overelaborationmetaphors trample on the heels of similes and quaint and often grotesque conceits sometimes pall upon the taste just as in the poems a flash of incongruous wit sometimes disturbs the serenity that is desirable  on his return from europe mr lowell occupied the chair which he adorned by his brilliant attainments and made memorable by his fame he lectured on dante shakespeare chaucer and cervantes and delighted his audiences at the same time he was editor of the atlantic monthly for several years from 1863 until 1872 he was associated with professor charles eliot norton in the conduct of the north american review  in 1857 he married miss frances dunlap of portland me a cultivated lady who had been the governess of his daughter she had unerring literary taste and sound judgment and mr lowell soon came to entrust to her the management of his financial affairs she was enabled to make their comparatively small income more than meet the exigencies of an exacting position  the second series of the biglow papers relating to the war of the rebellion were first published in the atlantic they were collected into a volume in 1865 that year was rendered notable by his commemoration ode the worthy crowning of one of the grandest poetic opportunities ever granted to man under the willows appeared in 1869 the cathedral in 1870  in 1864 he had issued a collection of his early descriptive articles under the title fireside travels in 1870 came among my books the second series followed in 1876 my study windows was published in 1871 all these prose works were marked by an exuberant vivid poetic impassioned style the tropical efflorescence of imagery was characteristic of them all he ought to have remembered his own words          overornament ruins both poem and prose  in 1876 appeared three memorial poems that read at concord april 19 1875 that read at cambridge under the washington elm july 3 1875 and the fourth of july ode of 1876 this year mr lowell was appointed one of the presidential electors and the following year president hayes first offered him the austrian mission and on his refusal of that gave him the honorary post at madrid which had been adorned by everett irving and prescott he was there three years and on the retirement of mr welsh in 1880 was transferred to the court of st james or as one of the english papers expressed it he became his excellency the ambassador of american literature to the court of shakespeare  he was extremely popular known in private as one of the most marvellous of storytellers he became the lion of many public occasions the london news spoke of the extraordinary felicity of his occasional speeches at birmingham he delivered a noble address on democracy he was selected to deliver the oration at the dedication of the dean stanley memorial he spoke on fielding at taunton on coleridge at westminster abbey on gray at cambridge he was president of the wordsworth society all sorts of honors were heaped upon him both at home and abroad  he returned to america in 1885 and once more occupied the somewhat dilapidated historic mansion at elmwood  once more he moved amid his rare and precious books and heard the birds singing in the elms that his father had planted or in the clustered bushes back of the house he took a deep interest in the struggle for international copyright he was president of the american copyright league and wrote the memorable lines    in vain we call old notions fudge     and bend our conscience to our dealing   the ten commandments will not budge     and stealing will continue stealing  he used the leisure of his failing health in revising his works his last volume of poems was entitled hearts ease and rue one of his latest poems my book appeared in the christmas number of the new york ledger in 1890 in the december number of the atlantic his hand was visible in the anonymous contributors club  during the last years his health was a matter of grave anxiety to his friends in the spring of 1891 he seemed better he was engaged in writing a life of nathaniel hawthorne when the present writer call to see him one beautiful spring day he found him in his library at that moment engaged in making suggestions for the inscriptions on the new boston public library his manner was the perfection of courtesy and high breeding his keen eyes seemed to read the very soul simplicity and beautiful dignity tempered by evident feebleness of health made him a memorable figure  toward the end of the summer he suddenly grew more seriously ill he suffered severely and his last words were oh why dont you let me die  he drew his last breath in the early morning of aug 12 1891 he was buried at mount auburn in the shadow of indian ridge not far from longfellows grave in a lot unenclosed and marked by no monument  memorial services were held in many places lord tennyson cabled a message of sympathy england and america will mourn mr lowells death they loved him and he loved them the queen publicly expressed her respect and sorrow  few men have left a deeper impress on their age few men have used noble powers more nobly in private life and public station there is not a shadow to stain the whiteness of his fame  as a poet he stands in the front rank of those who have yet appeared in america as a critic he was generous and just as a humorist he used his shafts of ridicule only to wound wrong as a statesman and diplomat he was actuated by broad farseeing views as a man he was a type to be upheld and followed america has just cause to reverence his memory and the whole englishspeaking world without geographical distinction claims him as its own                                       nathan haskell dole                      early poems

whitehaired he stood   whitebearded and with eyes that looked afar   from their still region of perpetual snow   over the little smokes and stirs of men   his head was bowed with gathered flakes of years   as winter bends the seaforeboding pine   but something triumphed in his brow and eye   which whoso saw it could not see and crouch   loud rang the emptied beakers as he mused   brooding his eyried thoughts then as an eagle   circles smoothwinged above the windvexed woods   so wheeled his soul into the air of song   high oer the stormy hall and thus he sang    the fletcher for his

that thou art nigh   the chance look of thine eye   are more to me than all marian   and will be till i die    as the last quiver of a bell   doth fade into the air   with a subsiding swell   that dies we know not where   so my hope melted and was gone   i raised mine eyes to bless the star   that shared its light with me so far   below its silver throne   and gloom and chilling vacancy   were all was left to me   in the dark bleak night i was alone   alone in the blessed earth marian   for what were all to me   its love and light and mirth marian   if i were not with thee    my heart will not forget thee   more than the moaning brine   forgets the moon when she is set   the gush when first i met thee   that thrilled my brain like wine   doth thrill as madly yet   my heart cannot forget thee   though it may droop and pine   too deeply it had set thee   in every love of mine   no new moon ever cometh   no flower ever bloometh   no twilight ever gloometh   but im more only thine   oh look not on me marian   thine eyes are wild and deep   and they have won me marian   from peacefulness and sleep   the sunlight doth not sun me   the meek moonshine doth shun me   all sweetest voices stun me   there is no rest   within my breast   and i can only weep marian    as a landbird far at sea   doth wander through the sleet   and drooping downward wearily   finds no rest for her feet   so wandereth my memory   oer the years when we did meet   i used to say that everything   partook a share of thee   that not a little bird could sing   or green leaf flutter on a tree   that nothing could be beautiful   save part of thee were there   that from thy soul so clear and full   all bright and blessèd things did cull   the charm to make them fair   and now i know   that it was so   thy spirit through the earth doth flow   and face me wheresoeer i go   what right hath perfectness to give   such weary weight of woe   unto the soul which cannot live   on anything more low   oh leave me leave me marian   theres no fair thing i see   but doth deceive me marian   into sad dreams of thee    a cold snake gnaws my heart   and crushes round my brain   and i should glory but to part   so bitterly again   feeling the slow tears start   and fall in fiery rain   theres a wide ring round the moon   the ghostlike clouds glide by   and i hear the sad winds croon   a dirge to the lowering sky   theres nothing soft or mild   in the pale moons sickly light   but all looks strange and wild   through the dim foreboding night   i think thou must be dead   in some dark and lonely place   with candles at thy head   and a pall above thee spread   to hide thy dead cold face   but i can see thee underneath   so pale and still and fair   thine eyes closed smoothly and a wreath   of flowers in thy hair   i never saw thy face so clear   when thou wast with the living   as now beneath the pall so drear   and stiff and unforgiving   i cannot flee thee marian   i cannot turn away   mine eyes must see thee marian   through salt tears night and day                 a dirge     poet lonely is thy bed   and the turf is overhead     cold earth is thy cover   but thy heart hath found release   and it slumbers full of peace   neath the rustle of green trees   and the warm hum of the bees     mid the drowsy clover   through thy chamber still as death   a smooth gurgle wandereth   as the blue stream murmureth     to the blue sky over   three paces from the silver strand   gently in the fine white sand   with a lily in thy hand     pale as snow they laid thee   in no coarse earth wast thou hid   and no gloomy coffinlid     darkly overweighed thee   silently as snowflakes drift   the smooth sand did sift and sift     oer the bed they made thee   all sweet birds did come and sing   at thy sunny burying   choristers unbidden   and beloved of sun and dew   meek forgetmenots upgrew   where thine eyes so large and blue    neath the turf were hidden    where thy stainless clay doth lie   blue and open is the sky   and the white clouds wander by   dreams of summer silently     darkening the river   thou hearest the clear water run   and the ripples every one   scattering the golden sun     through thy silence quiver   vines trail down upon the stream   into its smooth and glassy dream     a green stillness spreading   and the shiner perch and bream   through the shadowed waters gleam    gainst the current heading    white as snow thy winding sheet   shelters thee from head to feet     save thy pale face only   thy face is turned toward the skies   the lids lie meekly oer thine eyes   and the lowvoiced pinetree sighs     oer thy bed so lonely   all thy life thou lovdst its shade   underneath it thou art laid     in an endless shelter   thou hearest it forever sigh   as the winds vague longings die   in its branches dim and high   thou hearst the waters gliding by     slumberously welter    thou wast full of love and truth   of forgiveness and ruth   thy great heart with hope and youth     tided to oerflowing   thou didst dwell in mysteries   and there lingered on thine eyes   shadows of serener skies   awfully wild memories     that were like foreknowing   through the earth thou wouldst have gone   lighted from within alone   seeds from flowers in heaven grown     with a free hand sowing    thou didst remember well and long   some fragments of thine angelsong   and strive through want of woe and wrong     to win the world unto it   thy sin it was to see and hear   beyond todays dim hemisphere   beyond all mists of hope and fear   into a life more true and clear     and dearly thou didst rue it   light of the new world thou hadst won   oerflooded by a purer sun   slowly fates ship came drifting on   and through the dark save thou not one     caught of the land a token   thou stoodst upon the farthest prow   something within thy soul said now   and leaping forth with eager brow     thou fellst on shore heartbroken    long time thy brethren stood in fear   only the breakers far and near   white with their anger they could hear   the sounds of land which thy quick ear     caught long ago they heard not   and when at last they reached the strand   they found thee lying on the sand   with some wild flowers in thy hand     but thy cold bosom stirred not   they listened but they heard no sound   save from the glad life all around     a low contented murmur   the long grass flowed adown the hill   a hum rose from a hidden rill   but thy glad heart that knew no ill   but too much love lay dead and still   the only thing that sent a chill     into the heart of summer    thou didst not seek the poets wreath     but too soon didst win it   without twas green but underneath   were scorn and loneliness and death   gnawing the brain with burning teeth     and making mock within it   thou who wast full of nobleness   whose very lifeblood twas to bless     whose souls one law was giving   must bandy words with wickedness   haggle with hunger and distress   to win that death which worldliness     calls bitterly a living    thou sowst no gold and shalt not reap   muttered earth turning in her sleep   come home to the eternal deep   murmured a voice and a wide sweep   of wings through thy souls hush did creep     as of thy doom oerflying   it seemd that thy strong heart would leap   out of thy breast and thou didst weep     but not with fear of dying   men could not fathom thy deep fears   they could not understand thy tears   the hoarded agony of years     of bitter selfdenying   so once when high above the spheres   thy spirit sought its starry peers   it came not back to face the jeers     of brothers who denied it   starcrowned thou dost possess the deeps   of god and thy white body sleeps   where the lone pine forever keeps     patient watch beside it    poet underneath the turf     soft thou sleepest free from morrow   thou hast struggled through the surf     of wild thoughts and want and sorrow   now beneath the moaning pine     full of rest thy body lieth   while far up is clear sunshine   underneath a sky divine     her loosed wings thy spirit trieth   oft she strove to spread them here   but they were too white and clear   for our dingy atmosphere    thy body findeth ample room   in its still and grassy tomb     by the silent river   but thy spirit found the earth   narrow for the mighty birth     which it dreamed of ever   thou wast guilty of a rhyme   learned in a benigner clime   and of that more grievous crime   an ideal too sublime   for the lowhung sky of time    the calm spot where thy body lies   gladdens thy soul in paradise     it is so still and holy   thy body sleeps serenely there   and well for it thy soul may care   it was so beautiful and fair     lily white so wholly   from so pure and sweet a frame   thy spirit parted as it came     gentle as a maiden   now it lieth full of rest   sods are lighter on its breast   than the great prophetic guest     wherewith it was laden            fancies about a rosebud    pressed in an old copy of spenser     who prest you here the past can tell     when summer skies were bright above   and some full heart

warm and true    when with his soul brimful of morn     he looked beyond the vale of time   nor saw therein the dullard scorn     that made his heavenliness a crime    when musing oer the poets olden     his soul did like a sun upstart   to shoot its arrows clear and golden     through slaverys cold and darksome heart    alas too soon the veil is lifted     that hangs between the soul and pain   too soon the morningred hath drifted     into dull cloud or fallen in rain    or were you prest by one who nurst     bleak memories of love gone by   whose heart like a star fallen burst     in dark and erring vacancy    to him you still were fresh and green     as when you grew upon the stalk   and many a breezy summer scene     came backand many a moonlit walk    and there would be a hum of bees     a smell of childhood in the air   and old fresh feelings cooled the breeze     that like loved fingers stirred his hair    then would you suddenly be blasted     by the keen wind of one dark thought   one nameless woe that had outlasted     the sudden blow whereby twas brought    or were you prest here by two lovers     who seemed to read these verses rare   but found between the antique covers     what spenser could not prison there    songs which his glorious soul had heard     but his dull pen could never write   which flew like some goldwingèd bird     through the blue heaven out

memory of that blessed day   to smile on it or overweep it     when she and spring are far away    ah me i needs must droop my head     and brush away a happy tear   for they are gone and dry and dead     the rosebud lies before me here    yet is it in no strangers hand     for i will guard it tenderly   and it shall be a magic wand     to bring mine own true love to me    my heart runs oer with sweet surmises   the while my fancy weaves her rhyme   kind hopes and musical surprises   throng round me from the olden time    i do not care to know who prest you   enough for me to feel and know

beneath the clear and frosty moon   and the cold stars as if it took delight   in its own silent whiteness the hushed earth   sleeps in the soft arms of the embracing blue   secure as if angelic squadrons yet   encamped about her and each watching star   gained double brightness from the flashing arms   of wingèd and unsleeping sentinels   upward the calm of infinite silence deepens   the sea that flows between high heaven and earth   musing by whose smooth brink we sometimes find   a stray leaf floated from those happier shores   and hope perchance not vainly that some flower   which we had watered with our holiest tears   pale blooms and yet our scanty gardens best   oer the same ocean piloted by love   may find a haven at the feet of god   and be not wholly worthless in his sight

i    the sunset scarce had dimmed away   into the twilights doubtful gray   one long cloud oer the horizon lay   neath which a streak of bluish white   wavered between the day and night   over the pine trees on the hill   the trembly eveningstar did thrill   and the new moon with slender rim   through the elm arches gleaming dim   filled memorys chalice to the brim                     ii    on such an eve the heart doth grow   full of surmise and scarce can know   if it be now or long ago   or if indeed it doth exist   a wonderful enchanted mist   from the new moon doth wander out   wrapping all things in mystic doubt   so that this world doth seem untrue   and all our fancies to take hue   from some life ages since gone through                    iii    the maiden sat and heard the flow   of the west wind so soft and low   the leaves scarce quivered to and fro   unbound her heavy golden hair   rippled across her bosom bare   which gleamed with thrilling snowy white   far through the magical moonlight   the breeze rose with a rustling swell   and from afar there came the smell   of a longforgotten lilybell                     iv    the dim moon rested on the hill   but silent without thought or will   where sat the dreamy maiden still   and now the moons tip like a star   drew down below the horizons bar   to her black noon the night hath grown   yet still the maiden sits alone   pale as a corpse beneath a stream   and her white bosom still doth gleam   through the deep midnight like a dream                      v    cloudless the morning came and fair   and lavishly the sun doth share   his gold among her golden hair   kindling it all till slowly so   a glory round her head doth glow   a withered flower is in her hand   that grew in some far distant land   and silently transfigurèd   with wide calm eyes and undrooped head   they found the strangermaiden dead                     vi    a youth that morn neath other skies   felt sudden tears burn in his eyes   and his heart throng with memories   all things without him seemed to win   strange brotherhood with things within   and he forever felt that he   walked in the midst of mystery   and thenceforth why he could not tell   his heart would curdle at the smell   of his oncecherished lilybell                    vii    something from him had passed away   some shifting trembles of clear day   through starry crannies in his clay   grew bright and steadfast more and more   where all had been dull earth before   and through these chinks like him of old   his spirit converse high did hold   with clearer loves and wider powers   that brought him dewy fruits and flowers   from far elysian groves and bowers                   viii    just on the farther bound of sense   unproved by outward evidence   but known by a deep influence   which through our grosser clay doth shine   with light unwaning and divine   beyond where highest thought can fly   stretcheth the world of mystery   and they not greatly overween   who deem that nothing true hath been   save the unspeakable unseen                     ix    one step beyond lifes workday things   one more beat of the souls broad wings   one deeper sorrow sometimes brings   the spirit into that great vast   where neither future is nor past   none knoweth how he entered there   but waking finds his spirit where   he thought an angel could not soar   and what he called false dreams before   the very air about his door                      x    these outward seemings are but shows   whereby the body sees and knows   far down beneath forever flows   a stream of subtlest sympathies   that make our spirits strangely wise   in awe and fearful bodings dim   which from the senses outer rim   stretch forth beyond our thought and sight   fine arteries of circling light   pulsed outward from the infinite                 opening poem to              a years life     hope first the youthful poet leads   and he is glad to follow her   kind is she and to all his needs   with a free hand doth minister    but when sweet hope at last hath fled   cometh her sister memory   she wreathes hopes garlands round her head   and strives to seem as fair as she    then hope comes back and by the hand   she leads a child most fair to see   who with a joyous face doth stand   uniting hope and memory    so brighter grew the earth around   and bluer grew the sky above   the poet now his guide hath found   and follows in the steps of love                    dedication        to volume of poems entitled              a years life     the

and slow   let our song be soft and low   as the voice of other years   let our hearts within us melt   to gentleness as if we felt   the dropping of our mothers tears      lady now our song is bringing   back again thy childhoods hours   hearest thou the humbee singing   drowsily among the flowers   sleepily sleepily   in the noontide swayeth he   half rested on the slender stalks   that edge those wellknown garden walks   hearest thou the fitful whirring   of the humbirds viewless wings   feelst not round thy heart the stirring   of childhoods halfforgotten things      seest thou the dear old dwelling   with the woodbine round the door   brothers soft her breast is swelling   with the busy thoughts of yore   lowly sing ye sing ye mildly   house her spirit not so wildly   lest she sleep not any more   tis the pleasant summertide   open stands the window wide   whose voices lady art thou drinking   who sings the best belovèd tune   in a clear note rising sinking   like a thrushs song in june   whose laugh is that which rings so clear   and joyous in thine eager ear      lower brothers yet more low   weave the song in mazy twines   she heareth now the west wind blow   at evening through the clump of pines   o mournful is their tune   as of a crazèd thing   who to herself alone   is ever murmuring   through the night and through the day   for something that hath passed away   often lady hast thou listened   often have thy blue eyes glistened   where the summer evening breeze   moaned sadly through those lonely trees   or with the fierce wind from the north   wrung their mournful music forth   ever the river floweth   in an unbroken stream   ever the west wind bloweth   murmuring as he goeth   and mingling with her dream   onward still the river sweepeth   with a sound of longagone   lowly brothers lo she weepeth   she is now no more alone   longloved forms and longloved faces   round about her pillow throng   through her memorys desert places   flow the waters of our song   lady if thy life be holy   as when thou wert yet a child   though our song be melancholy   it will stir no anguish wild   for the soul that hath lived well   for the soul that childlike is   there is quiet in the spell   that brings back early memories                      song                      i    lift up the curtains of thine eyes     and let their light outshine   let me adore the mysteries     of those mild orbs of thine   which ever queenly calm do roll   attunèd to an ordered soul                     ii    open thy lips yet once again     and while my soul doth hush   with awe pour forth that holy strain     which seemeth me to gush   a fount of music running oer   from thy deep spirits inmost core                    iii    the melody that dwells in thee     begets in me as well   a spiritual harmony     a mild and blessèd spell   far far above earths atmosphere   i rise wheneer thy voice i hear                 the departed       not they alone are the departed   who have laid them down to sleep   in the grave narrow and lonely   not for them only do i vigils keep   not for them only am i heavyhearted   not for them only      many many there are many   who no more are with me here   as cherished as beloved as any   whom i have seen upon the bier   i weep to think of those old faces   to see them in their grief or mirth   i weepfor there are empty places   around my hearts once crowded hearth   the cold ground doth not cover them   the grass hath not grown over them   yet are they gone from me on earth   o how more bitter is this weeping   than for those lost ones who are sleeping   where sun will shine and flowers blow   where gentle winds will whisper low   and the stars have them in their keeping   wherefore from me who loved you so   o wherefore did ye go   i have shed full many a tear   i have wrestled oft in prayer   but ye do not come again   how could anything so dear   how could anything so fair   vanish like the summer rain   no no it cannot be   but ye are still with me      and yet o where art thou   childhood with sunny brow   and floating hair   where art thou hiding now   i have sought thee everywhere   all among the shrubs and flowers   of those gardenwalks of ours   thou art not there   when the shadow of nights wings   hath darkened all the earth   i listen for thy gambolings   beside the cheerful hearth   thou art not there   i listen to the faroff bell   i murmur oer the little songs   which thou didst love so well   pleasant memories come in throngs   and mine eyes are blurred with tears   but no glimpse of thee appears   lonely am i in the winter lonely in the spring   summer and harvest bring no trace of thee   oh whither whither art thou wandering   thou who didst once so cleave to me      and love is gone   i have seen him come   i have seen him too depart   leaving desolate his home   his bright home in my heart   i am alone   cold cold is his hearthstone   wide open stands the door   the frolic and the gentle one   shall i see no more no more   at the fount the bowl is broken   i shall drink it not again   all my longing prayers are spoken   and felt ah woe is me in vain   oh childish hopes and childish fancies   whither have ye fled away   i long for you in mournful trances   i long for you by night and day   beautiful thoughts that once were mine   might i but win you back once more   might ye about my being twine   and cluster as ye did of yore   o do not let me pray in vain   how good and happy i should be   how free from every shade of pain   if ye would come again to me   o come again come come again   hath the sun forgot its brightness   have the stars forgot to shine   that they bring not their wonted lightness   to this weary heart of mine   tis not the sun that shone on thee   happy childhood long ago   not the same stars silently   looking on the same bright snow   not the same that love and i   together watched in days gone by   no not the same alas for me      would god that those who early went   to the house dark and low   for whom our mourning heads were bent   for whom our steps were slow   o would that these alone had left us   that fate of these alone had reft us   would god indeed that it were so   many leaves too soon must wither   many flowers too soon must die   many bright ones wandering hither   we know not whence we know not why   like the leaves and like the flowers   vanish ere the summer hours   that brought them to us have gone by      o for the hopes and for the feelings   childhood that i shared with thee   the high resolves the bright revealings   of the souls might which thou gavst me   gentle love woe worth the day   woe worth the hour when thou wert born   woe worth the day thou fledst away   a shade across the windwaved corn   a dewdrop falling from the leaves   chanceshaken in a summers morn   woe woe is me my sick heart grieves   companionless and anguishworn   i know it well our manly years   must be baptized in bitter tears   full many fountains must run dry   that youth has dreamed for long hours by   choked by conventions siroc blast   or drifting sands of many cares

i lie and drink thy jargoning   my soul is full with melodies   one drop would overflow it   and send the tears into mine eyes   but what carst thou to know it   thy heart is free as mountain air   and of thy lays thou hast no care   scattering them gayly everywhere   happy unconscious poet      upon a tuft of meadow grass   while thy lovedone tends the nest   thou swayest as the breezes pass   unburthening thine oerfull breast   of the crowded songs that fill it   just as joy may choose to will it   lord of thy love and liberty   the blithest bird of merry may   thou turnest thy bright eyes on me   that say as plain as eye can say   here sit we here in the summer weather   i and my modest mate together   whatever your wise thoughts may be   under that gloomy old pine tree   we do not

squandered   the man would die ere hed forget   o hours that frosty eld deemed wasted   nodding his gray head toward my books   i dearer prize the lore i tasted   with you among the trees and brooks   than all that i have gained since then   from learnèd books or studywithered men   nature thy soul was one with mine   and as a sister by a younger brother   is loved each flowing to the other   such

their pleasant tune   felt i no heart in dim and solemn woods   no lovedones voice in lonely solitudes   yes yes unhoodwinked then my spirits eyes   blind leaders had not taught me to be wise      dear hours which now again i overlive   hearing and seeing with the ears and eyes   of childhood ye were bees that to the hive   of my young heart came laden with rich prize   gathered in fields and woods and sunny dells to be   my spirits food in days more wintery   yea yet again ye come ye come   and like a child once more at home   after long sojourning in alien climes   i lie upon my mothers

ye find   with evergrowing wonder   man is not all in all to ye   go with a meek and humble soul   then shall the scales of self unroll   from off your eyesthe weary packs   drop from your heavyladen backs   and ye shall see   with reverent and hopeful eyes   glowing with newborn energies   how great a thing it is to be                 forgetfulness     theres a haven of sure rest     from the loud worlds bewildering stress   as a bird dreaming on her nest   as dew hid in a roses breast   as hesper in the glowing west       so the heart sleeps       in thy calm deeps     serene forgetfulness    no sorrow in that place may be     the noise of life grows less and less   as moss far down within the sea   as in white lily caves a bee   as life in a hazy reverie       so the

the soundless depths of soul   which gaze on him with meaning eyes     full of the mighty whole   yet will no word of healing speak     although he pray nightlong   o help me save me i am weak     and ye are wondrous strong   who in the midnight dark and deep     hath felt a voice of might   come echoing through the halls of sleep     from the lone heart of night   and starting from his restless bed     hath watched and wept to know   what meant that oracle of dread     that stirred his being so   he who hath felt how strong and great     this godlike soul of man   and looked full in the eyes of fate     since life and thought began   the armor of whose moveless trust     knoweth no spot of weakness   who hath trod fear into the dust     beneath the feet of meekness   he who hath calmly borne his cross     knowing himself the king   of time nor counted it a loss     to learn by suffering   and who hath worshipped woman still     with a pure soul and lowly   nor ever hath in deed or will     profaned her temple holy   he is the poet him unto     the gift of song is given   whose life is lofty strong and true   he is the poet from his lips     to live forevermore   majestical as

a pleasant ramble home   freshstored with quiet thoughts i come   i pluck some wayside flower   and press it in the choicest nook   of a muchloved and oftread book   and when upon its leaves i look   in a less happy hour   dear memory bears me far away   unto her fairy bower   and on her breast my head i lay   while in a motherly sweet strain   she sings me gently back again   to bygone feelings until they   seem children born of yesterday                     ii      yes many a story of past hours   i read in these dear withered flowers   and once again i seem to be   lying beneath the old oak tree   and looking up into the sky   through thick leaves rifted fitfully   lulled by the rustling of the vine   or the faint low of faroff kine   and once again i seem   to watch the whirling bubbles flee   through shade and gleam alternately   down the vinebowered stream   or neath the odorous linden trees   when summer twilight lingers long   to hear the flowing of the breeze   and unseen insects slumberous song   that mingle into one and seem   like dim murmurs of a dream   fair faces too i seem to see   smiling from pleasant eyes at me   and voices sweet i hear   that like remembered melody   flow through my spirits ear                    iii      a poem every flower is   and every leaf a line   and with delicious memories   they fill this heart of mine   no living blossoms are so clear   as these dead relics treasured here   one tells of love of friendship one   loves quiet aftersunset time   when the alldazzling light is gone   and with the souls low

ye all   by the dear faces ye recall                     iv      upon the banks of lifes deep streams   full many a flower groweth   which with a wondrous fragrance teems   and in the silent water gleams   and trembles as the water floweth   many a one the wave upteareth   washing ever the roots away   and far upon its bosom beareth   to bloom no more in youths glad may   as farther on the river runs   flowing more deep and strong   only a few pale scattered ones   are seen the dreary banks along   and where those flowers do not grow   the river floweth dark and chill   its voice is sad and with its flow   mingles ever a sense of ill   then poet thou who gather dost   of lifes best flowers the brightest   o take good heed they be not lost   while with the angry flood thou fightest                      v      in the cool grottos of the soul   whence flows thoughts crystal river   whence songs of joy forever roll   to him who is the giver   there store thou them where fresh and green   their leaves and blossoms may be seen   a spring of joy that faileth never   there store thou them and they shall be   a blessing and a peace to thee   and in their youth and purity   thou shalt be young forever   then with their fragrance rich and rare   thy living shall be rife   strength shall be thine thy cross to bear   and they shall be a chaplet fair   breathing a pure and holy air   to crown thy holy life                     vi      o poet above all men blest   take heed that thus thou store them   love hope and faith shall ever rest   sweet birds upon how sweet a nest   watchfully brooding oer them   and from those flowers of paradise   scatter thou many a blessèd seed   wherefrom an offspring may arise   to cheer the hearts and light the eyes   of aftervoyagers in their need   they shall not fall on stony ground   but yielding all their hundredfold   shall shed a peacefulness around   whose strengthening joy may not be told   so shall thy name be blest of all   and thy remembrance never die   for of that seed shall surely fall   in the fair garden of eternity   exult then in the nobleness   of this thy work so holy   yet be not thou one jot the less   humble and meek and lowly   but let thine exultation be   the reverence of a bended knee   and by thy life a poem write   built strongly day by day   and on the rock of truth and right   its deep foundations lay                    vii      it is thy duty guard it well   for unto thee hath much been given   and thou canst make this life a hell   or jacobsladder up to heaven   let not thy baptism in lifes wave   make thee like him whom homer sings   a sleeper in a living grave   callous and hard to outward things   but open all thy soul and sense   to every blessèd influence   that from the heart of nature springs   then shall thy lifeflowers be to thee   when thy best years are told   as much as these have been to me   yea more a thousandfold                 the lover                      i

a gentle lover be   sitting at my lovedones side   she giveth her whole soul to me   without a wish or thought of pride   and she shall be my cherished bride                    iii      no show of gaudiness hath she   she doth not flash with jewels rare   in beautiful simplicity   she weareth leafy garlands fair   or modest flowers in her hair                     iv      sometimes she dons a robe of green   sometimes a robe of snowy white   but in whatever garb shes seen   it seems most beautiful and right   and is the loveliest to my sight                      v      not i her lover am alone   yet unto all she doth suffice   none jealous is and every one   reads love and truth within her eyes   and deemeth her his own dear prize                     vi      and so thou art eternal

gleamedst a moment and wert gone   and yet i long shall bear in mind   the pleasant thoughts thou leftst behind      thou madst me happy with thine eyes   and happy with thine open smile   and as i write sweet memories   come thronging round me all the while   thou madst me happy with thine eyes   and gentle feelings long forgot   looked up and oped their eyes   like violets when they see a spot   of summer in the skies      around thy playful lips did glitter   heatlightnings of a girlish scorn   harmless they were for nothing bitter   in thy dear heart was ever born   that merry heart that could not lie   within its warm nest quietly   but ever from each full dark eye   was looking kindly night and morn      there was an archness in thine eyes   born of the gentlest mockeries   and thy light laughter rang as clear   as waterdrops i loved to hear   in days of boyhood as they fell   tinkling far down the dim still well   and with its sound come back once more   the feelings of my early years   and half aloud i murmured oer   sure i have heard that sound before   it is so pleasant in mine ears      whenever thou didst look on me   i thought of merry birds   and something of springs melody   came to me in thy words   thy thoughts did dance and bound along   like happy children in their play   whose hearts run over into song   for gladness of the summers day   and mine grew dizzy with the sight   still feeling lighter and more light   till joining hands they whirled away   as blithe and merrily as they      i bound a larchtwig round with flowers   which thou didst twine among thy hair   and gladsome were the few short hours   when i was with thee there   so now that thou art far away   safenestled in thy warmer clime   in memory of a happier day   i twine this simple wreath of rhyme      dost mind how she whom thou dost love   more than in light words may be said   a coronal of amaranth wove   about thy dulysobered head   which kept itself a moment still   that she might have her gentle will   thy childlike grace and purity   o keep forevermore   and as thou art still strive to be   that on the farther shore   of times dark waters ye may meet   and she may twine around thy brow   a wreath of those bright flowers that grow   where blessèd angels set their feet                   isabel       as the leaf upon the tree   fluttering gleaming constantly   such a lightsome thing was she   my gay and gentle isabel   her heart was fed with lovesprings sweet   and in her face youd see it beat   to hear the sound of welcome feet   and were not mine so isabel      she knew it not but she was fair   and like a moonbeam was her hair   that falls where flowing ripples are   in summer evenings isabel   her heart and tongue were scarce apart   unwittingly her lips would part   and love came gushing from her heart   the womans heart of isabel      so pure her fleshgarb and like dew   that in her features glimmered through   each working of her spirit true   in wondrous beauty isabel   a sunbeam struggling through thick leaves   a reapers song mid yellow sheaves   less gladsome weremy spirit grieves   to think of thee mild isabel      i know not when i loved thee first   not loving i had been accurst   yet having loved my heart will burst   longing for thee dear isabel   with silent tears my cheeks are wet   i would be calm i would forget   but thy blue eyes gaze on me yet   when stars have risen isabel      the winds mourn for thee isabel   the flowers expect thee in the dell   thy gentle spirit loved them well   and i for thy sake isabel   the sunsets seem less lovely now   than when leaf checkered on thy brow   they fell as lovingly as thou   lingeredst till moonrise isabel      at dead of night i seem to see   thy fair pale features constantly   upturned in silent prayer for me   oer moveless clasped hands isabel   i call thee thou dost not reply   the stars gleam coldly on thine eye   as like a dream thou flittest by   and leavst me weeping isabel                      music                      i    i seem to lie with drooping eyes     dreaming sweet dreams   half longings and half memories     in woods where streams   with trembling shades and whirling gleams     many and bright     in song and light     are ever ever flowing   while the wind if we list to the rustling grass   which numbers his footsteps as they pass     seems scarcely to be blowing   and the farheard voice of spring   from sunny slopes comes wandering   calling the violets from the sleep   that bound them under snowdrifts deep   to open their childlike asking eyes   on the new summers paradise   and mingled with the gurgling waters   as the dreamy witchery   of acheloüs silvervoiced daughters     rose and fell with the heaving sea     whose great heart swelled with ecstasy   the song of many a floating bird     winding through the rifted trees   is dreamily halfheard   a sister stream of melodies   rippled by the flutterings   of rapturequivered wings                     ii    and now beside a cataract   i lie and through my soul   from over me and under   the neverceasing thunder   arousingly doth roll   through the darkness all compact   through the trackless sea of gloom   sad and deep i hear it boom   at intervals the cloud is cracked   and a livid flash doth hiss     downward from its floating home   lighting up the precipice     and the neverresting foam   with a dim and ghastly glare   which for a heartbeat in the air     shows the sweeping shrouds     of the midnight clouds   and their wildlyscattered hair                    iii    now listening to a womans tone   in a wood i sit alone   alone because our souls are one   all around my heart it flows   lulling me in deep repose   i fear to speak i fear to move   lest i should break the spell i love   low and gentle calm and clear   into my inmost soul it goes     as if my brother dear     who is no longer here     had bended from the sky     and murmured in my ear   a strain of that high harmony     which they may sing alone     who worship round the throne                     iv    now in a fairy boat     on the bright waves of song     full merrily i float     merrily float along     my helm is veered i care not how     my white sail bellies over me   and bright as gold the ripples be   that plash beneath the bow     before behind     they feel the wind     and they are dancing joyously   while faintly heard along the faroff shore   the surf goes plunging with a lingering roar     or anchored in a shadowy cove       entranced with harmonies       slowly i sink and rise     as the slow waves of music move                      v    now softly dashing   bubbling plashing   mazy dreamy   faint and streamy   ripples into ripples melt   not so strongly heard as felt   now rapid and quick   while the heart beats thick   the music silver wavelets crowd   distinct and clear but never loud   and now all solemnly and slow   in mild deep tones they warble low   like the glad song of angels when   they sang good will and peace to men   now faintly heard and far     as if the spirits ears   had caught the anthem of a star     chanting with his brotherspheres   in the midnight dark and deep   when the body is asleep   and wondrous shadows pour in streams   from the twofold gate of dreams   now onward roll the billows swelling   with a tempestsound of might   as of voices doom foretelling     to the silent ear of night   and now a mingled ecstasy     of all sweet sounds it is   o who may tell the agony     of rapture such as this                     vi    i have drunk of the drink of immortals     i have drunk of the lifegiving wine   and now i may pass the bright portals     that open into a realm divine   i have drunk it through mine ears     in the ecstasy of song   when mine eyes would fill with tears     that its life were not more long   i have drunk it through mine eyes     in beautys every shape   and now around my soul it lies     no juice of earthly grape   wings wings are given to me     i can flutter i can rise   like a new life gushing through me     sweep the heavenly harmonies                        song     o i must look on that sweet face once more before i die   god grant that it may lighten up with joy when i draw nigh   god grant that she may look on me as kindly as she seems   in the long night the restless night i the sunny land of dreams    i hoped i thought she loved me once and yet i know not why   there is a coldness in her speech and a coldness in her eye   something that in anothers look would not seem cold to me   and yet like ice i feel it chill the heart of memory    she does not come to greet me so frankly as she did   and in her utmost openness i feel theres something hid   she almost seems to shun me as if she thought that i   might win her gentle heart again to feelings long gone by    i sought the first springbuds for her the fairest and the best   and she wore them for their loveliness upon her spotless breast   the bloodroot and the violet the frail anemone   she wore them and alas i deemed it was for love of me    as flowers in a darksome place stretch forward to the light   so to the memory of her i turn by day and night   as flowers in a darksome place grow thin and pale and wan   so is it with my darkened heart now that her light is gone    the thousand little things that love doth treasure up for aye   and brood upon with moistened eyes when she thats loveds away   the word the look the smile the blush the ribbon that she wore   each day they grow more dear to me and pain me more and more    my face i cover with my hands and bitterly i weep   that the quickgathering sands of life should choke a love so deep   and that the stream so pure and bright must turn it from its track   or to the heartsprings whence it rose roll its full waters back    as calm as doth the lily float close by the lakelets brim   so calm and spotless down times stream her peaceful days did swim   and i had longed and dreamed and prayed that closely by her side   down to a haven still and sure my happy life might glide    but now alas those golden days of youth and hope are oer   and i must dream those dreams of joy those guiltless dreams no more   yet there is something in my heart that whispers ceaselessly   would god that i might see that face once more before i die                      ianthe                      i          there is a light within her eyes       like gleams of wandering fireflies       from light to shade it leaps and moves       whenever in her soul arise       the holy shapes of things she loves       fitful it shines and changes ever       like starlit ripples on a river       or summer sunshine on the eaves       of silvertrembling poplar leaves       where the lingering dewdrops quiver       i may not tell the blessedness       her mild eyes send to mine       the sunsettinted haziness       of their mysterious shine       the dim and holy mournfulness       of their mellow light divine       the shadow of the lashes lie       over them so lovingly       that they seem to melt away       in a doubtful twilightgray       while i watch the stars arise       in the evening of her eyes       i love it yet i almost dread       to think what it foreshadoweth       and when i muse how i have read       that such strange light betokened death       instead of firefly gleams i see       wild corpselights gliding waveringly                     ii          with wayward thoughts her eyes are bright       like shiftings of the northernlight       hither thither swiftly glance they       in a mazy twining dance they       like ripply lights the sunshine weaves       thrown backward from a shaken nook       below some tumbling waterbrook       on the oerarching platanleaves       all through her glowing face they flit       and rest in their deep dwellingplace       those fathomless blue eyes of hers       till from her burning soul relit       while her upheaving bosom stirs       they stream again across her face       and with such hope and glory fill it       death could not have the heart to chill it       yet when their wild light fades again       i feel a sudden sense of pain       as if while yet her eyes were gleaming       and like a shower of sunlit rain       bright fancies from her face were streaming       her trembling soul might flit away       as swift and suddenly as they                    iii        a wild inspirèd earnestness         her inmost being fills       and eager selfforgetfulness         that speaks not what it wills       but what unto her soul is given       a living oracle from heaven       which scarcely in her breast is born       when on her trembling lips it thrills       and like a burst of golden skies       through stormclouds on a sudden torn       like a glory of the morn       beams marvellously from her eyes       and then like a springswollen river   roll the deep waves of her fullhearted thought       crested with sunlit spray       her wild lips curve and quiver   and my rapt soul on the strong tide upcaught       unwittingly is borne away       lulled by a dreamful music ever       farthrough the solemn twilightgray       of hoary woodsthrough valleys green   which the trailing vine embowers   and where the purpleclustered grapes are seen   deepglowing through rich clumps of waving flowers       now over foaming rapids swept       and with maddening rapture shook   now gliding where the waterplants have slept       for ages in a mossrimmed nook       enwoven by a wildeyed band         of earthforgetting dreams       i float to a delicious land       by a sunset heaven spanned         and musical with streams       around the calm majestic forms   and godlike eyes of early greece i see       or listen till my spirit warms       to songs of courtly chivalry   or weep unmindful if my tears be seen   for the meek suffering love of poor undine                     iv          her thoughts are never memories       but ever changeful ever new       fresh and beautiful as dew       that in a dell at noontide lies       or at the close of summer day       the pleasant breath of newmown hay       swiftly they come and pass       as golden birds across the sun       as lightgleams on tall meadowgrass       which the wind just breathes upon       and when she speaks her eyes i see   downgushing through their silken lattices       like stars that quiver tremblingly       through leafy branches of the trees       and her pale cheeks do flush and glow       with speaking flashes bright and rare   as crimson northlights on newfallen snow       from out the veiling of her hair   her careless hair that scatters down       on either side her eyes   a waterfall leaftinged with brown       and lit with the sunrise                      v        when first i saw her not of earth     but heavenly both in grief and mirth     i thought her she did seem     as fair and full of mystery     as bodiless as forms we see     in the rememberings of a dream     a moonlit mist a strange dim light     circled her spirit from my sight     each day more beautiful she grew       more earthly every day     yet that mysterious moony hue       faded not all away     she has a sisters sympathy     with all the wanderers of the sky     but most ive seen her bosom stir       when moonlight round her fell     for the mild moon it loveth her       she loveth it as well     and of their love perchance this grace     was born into her wondrous face     i cannot tell how it may be     for both methinks can scarce be true     still as she earthly grew to me     she grew more heavenly too       she seems one born in heaven         with earthly feelings       for while unto her soul are given         more pure revealings       of holiest love and truth     yet is the mildness of her eyes     made up of quickest sympathies       of kindliness and ruth     so though some shade of awe doth stir     our souls for one so far above us     we feel secure that she will love us     and cannot keep from loving her     she is a poem which to me     in speech and look is written bright     and to her lifes rich harmony     doth ever sing itself aright     dear glorious creature       with eyes so dewy bright         and tenderest feeling         itself revealing       in every look and feature       welcome as a homestead light   to one longwandering in a clouded night       o lovelier for her womans weakness         which yet is strongly mailed       in armor of courageous meekness         and faith that never failed                     vi          early and late at her souls gate       sits chastity in warderwise       no thoughts unchallenged small or great       go thence into her eyes       nor may a low unworthy thought       beyond that virgin warder win       nor one whose password is not ought       may go without or enter in       i call her seeing those pure eyes       the eve of a new paradise       which she by gentle word and deed       and look no less doth still create       about her for her great thoughts breed       a calm that lifts us from our fallen state   and makes us while with her both good and great       nor is their memory wanting in our need       with stronger loving every hour       turneth my heart to this frail flower       which thoughtless of the world hath grown       to beauty

make rich offerings to that one                    ii     twas garlanded with purest thought   and crowned with fancys flowers bright   with choicest gems twas all inwrought   of truth and feeling in my sight   it seemed a spot of cloudless light                    iii      yet when i made my offering there   like cains the incense would not rise   back on my heart downsank the prayer   and altarstone and sacrifice   grew hateful in my teardimmed eyes                     iv      oergrown with ages mosses green   the little altar firmly stands   it is not as it once hath been   a selfish

and with an even current flows   calmer and calmer to the close                     vi      the love that in those early days   girt round my spirit like a wall   hath faded like a morning haze   and flames unpent by selfs mean thrall   rise clearly to the perfect all                 impartiality                     i      i cannot say a scene is fair   because it is beloved of thee   but i shall love to linger there   for sake of thy dear memory   i would not be so coldly just   as to love only what i must                    ii      i cannot say a thought is good   because thou foundest joy in it   each soul must choose its proper food   which nature hath decreed most fit   but i shall ever deem it so   because it made thy heart oerflow                   iii      i love thee for that thou art fair   and that thy spirit joys in aught   createth a new beauty there   with thine own dearest image fraught   and love for others sake that springs   gives half their charm to lovely things

types of my godlike being   high thoughts are swelling in my heart     and rushing through my brain   may i never more lose part     in my souls realm again   all things fair whereer they be   in earth or air in sky or sea   i have loved them all and taken   all within my throbbing breast   no more my spirit can be shaken   from its calm and kingly rest   love hath shed its light around me   love hath pierced the shades that bound me   mine eyes are opened i can see   the universes mystery     the mighty heart and core     of after and before   i see and i am weak no more

thousand isles of thousand hues   how bright how beautiful how rare   into my spirit they infuse   a purer a diviner air   the earth is growing dimmer   and now the last faint glimmer     hath faded from the hill   but in my higher atmosphere   the sunlight streameth red and clear     fringing the islets still   love lifts us to the sunlight   though the whole world would be dark   love wide love is the one light   all else is but a fading spark   love is the nectar which doth fill   our souls cup even to overflowing   and warming heart and thought and will   doth lie within us mildly glowing   from its own centre raying out   beauty and truth on all without                   iii      each on his golden throne   full royally alone   i see the stars above me   with sceptre and with diadem

roll   but search the depths of soul   and in those mighty depths they see   the germs of all futurity   waiting but the fitting time   to burst and ripen into prime   as in the womb of mother earth   the seeds of plants and forests lie   age upon age and never die   so in the souls of all men wait   undyingly the seeds of fate   chance breaks the clod and forth they spring   filling blind men with wondering   eternal stars with holy awe   as if a present god i saw   i look into those mighty eyes   and see great destinies arise   as in those of mortal men   feelings glow and fade again   all things below all things above   are open to the eyes of love                    iv      of knowledge love is masterkey   knowledge of beauty passing dear   is each to each and mutually   each one doth make the other clear   beauty is love and what we love   straightway is beautiful   so is the circle round and full   and so dear love doth live and move     and have his being   finding his proper food     by sure inseeing   in all things pure and good   which he at will doth cull   like a joyous butterfly   hiving in the sunny bowers   of the souls fairest flowers   or between the earth and sky   wandering at liberty   for happy happy hours                     v      the thoughts of love are poesy   as this fair earth and all we see   are the thoughts of deity   and love is ours by our birthright   he hath cleared mine inward sight   glorious shapes with glorious eyes   round about my spirit glance   shedding a mild and golden light   on the shadowy face of night   to unearthly melodies   hand in hand they weave their dance   while a deep ambrosial lustre     from their rounded limbs doth shine   through many a rich and golden cluster   of streaming hair divine   in our gross and earthly hours   we cannot see the lovegiven powers   which ever round the soul await     to do its sovereign will   when in its moments calm and still   it reassumes its royal state   nor longer sits with eyes downcast   a beggar dreaming of the past   at its own palacegate                   vi      i too am a maker and a poet   through my whole soul i feel it and know it   my veins are fired with ecstasy     allmother earth     did neer give birth   to one who shall be matched with me   the lustre of my coronal   shall cast a dimness over all   alas alas what have i spoken   my strong my eagle wings are broken   and back again to earth i fall             something natural                     i      when first i saw thy souldeep eyes   my heart yearned to thee instantly   strange longing in my soul did rise   i cannot tell the reason why   but i must love thee till i die                    ii      the sight of thee hath wellnigh grown   as needful to me as the light

thy brightness move   and cannot well contented be   save thou shouldst shine alone for me                    iv      we should love beauty even as flowers   for all tis said they bud and blow   they are the worlds as well as ours   but thoualas god made thee grow   so fair i cannot love thee so                   a feeling       the flowers and the grass to me   are eloquent reproachfully   for would they wave so pleasantly   or look so fresh and fair   if a man cunning hollow mean   or one in anywise unclean   were looking on them there      no he hath grown so foolishwise   he cannot see with childhoods eyes   he hath forgot that purity   and lowliness which are the key   of natures mysteries   no he hath wandered off so long   from his own place of birth   that he hath lost his mothertongue   and like one come from faroff lands   forgetting and forgot he stands   beside his mothers hearth               the lost child                     i    i wandered down the sunny glade     and ever mused my love of thee   my thoughts like little children played     as gayly and as guilelessly                    ii    if any chanced to go astray     moaning in fear of coming harms   hope brought the wanderer back alway     safe nestled in her snowy arms                   iii    from that soft nest the happy one     looked up at me and calmly smiled   its hair shone golden in the sun     and made it seem a heavenly child                    iv    dear hopes blue eyes smiled mildly down     and blest it with a love so deep   that like a nursling of her own     it clasped her neck and fell asleep                   the church                     i    i love the rites of englands church     i love to hear and see   the priest and people reading slow     the solemn litany   i love to hear the glorious swell     of chanted psalm and prayer   and the deep organs bursting heart     throb through the shivering air                   ii    chants that a thousand years have heard     i love to hear again   for visions of the olden time     are wakened by the strain   with gorgeous hues the windowglass     seems suddenly to glow   and rich and red the streams of light     down through the chancel flow                   iii    and then i murmur surely god     delighteth here to dwell   this is the temple of his son     whom he doth love so well   but when i hear the creed which saith     this church alone is his   i feel within my soul that he     hath purer shrines than this                    iv    for his is not the builded church     nor organshaken dome   in every thing that lovely is     he loves and hath his home   and most in soul that loveth well     all things which he hath made   knowing no creed but simple faith     that may not be gainsaid                     v    his church is universal love     and whoso dwells therein   shall need no customed sacrifice     to wash away his sin   and music in its aisles shall swell     of lives upright and true   sweet as dreamed sounds of angelharps     downquivering through the blue                   vi    they shall not ask a litany     the souls that worship there   but every look shall be a hymn     and every word a prayer   their service shall be written bright     in calm and holy eyes   and every day from fragrant hearts     fit incense shall arise                 the unlovely       the pretty things that others wear   look strange and out of place on me   i never seem dressed tastefully     because i am not fair   and when i would most pleasing seem   and deck myself with joyful care   i find it is an idle dream     because i am not fair      if i put roses in my hair   they bloom as if in mockery   nature denies her sympathy     because i am not fair   alas i have a warm true heart   but when i show it people stare   i must forever dwell apart     because i am not fair      i am least happy being where   the hearts of others are most light   and strive to keep me out of sight     because i am not fair   the glad ones often give a glance   as i am sitting lonely there   that asks me why i do not dance     because i am not fair      and if to smile on them i dare   for that my heart with love runs oer   they say what is she laughing for     because i am not fair   love scorned or misinterpreted   it is the hardest thing to bear   i often wish that i were dead     because i am not fair      in joy or grief i must not share   for neither smiles nor tears on me   will ever look becomingly     because i am not fair   whole days i sit alone and cry   and in my grave i wish i were   yet none will weep me if i die     because i am not fair      my grave will be so lone and bare   i fear to think of those dark hours   for none will plant it oer with flowers     because i am not fair   they will not in the summer come   and speak kind words above me there   to me the grave will be no home     because i am not fair               lovesong       nearer to thy motherheart

    gleaming through   the halfunfolded eglantine   long ago long ago   but i feel that i am only   yet more sad and yet more lonely      then i turn to blueeyed hope   and beg of her that she will ope   her golden gates for me   she is fair and full of grace   but she hath the form and face   of her mother memory   clear as air her glad voice ringeth   joyous are the songs she singeth   yet i hear them mournfully   they are songs her mother taught her   crooning to her infant daughter   as she lay upon her knee   many little ones she bore me   woe is me in bygone hours   who danced along and sang before me   scattering my way with flowers        one by one        they are gone   and their silent graves are seen   shining fresh with mosses green   where the rising sunbeams slope   oer the dewy land of hope      but when sweet memory faileth   and hope looks strange and cold   when youth no more availeth   and grief grows over bold   when softest winds are dreary   and summer sunlight weary   and sweetest things uncheery        we know not why   when the crown of our desires   weighs upon the brow and tires        and we would die   die for ah we know not what   something we seem to have forgot   something we had and now have not   when the present is a weight   and the future seems our foe   and with shrinking eyes we wait   as one who dreads a sudden blow   in the dark he knows not whence   when love at last his bright eye closes   and the bloom upon his face   that lends him such a living grace   is a shadow from the roses   wherewith we have decked his bier   because he once was passing dear   when we feel a leaden sense   of nothingness and impotence          till we grow mad        then the body saith       theres but one true faith          all things

eternal spring     so that winter half forgets     everything but that thou art     and in his bewildered heart     dreameth of the violets     or those bluer flowers that ope     flowers of steadfast love and hope     watered by the living wells   of memories dear and dearer prophecies     when young spring forever dwells     in the sunshine of thine eyes      i have most holy dreams of thee      all night i have such dreams     and when i awake reality      no whit the darker seems   through the twin gates of hope and memory     they pour in crystal streams     from out an angels calmèd eyes     who from twilight till sunrise     far away in the upper deep     poised upon his shining wings     over us his watch doth keep     and as he watcheth ever sings      through the still night i hear him sing      downlooking on our sleep     i hear his clear clear harpstrings ring     and as the golden notes take wing     gently downward hovering      for very joy i weep     he singeth songs of holy love     that quiver through the depths afar     where the blessèd spirits are     and lingeringly from above     shower till the morning star     his silver shield hath buckled on     and sentinels the dawn alone     quivering his gleamy spear     through the dusky atmosphere      almost my love i fear the morn     when that blessèd voice shall cease     lest it should leave me quite forlorn     stript of my snowy robe of peace     and yet the bright reality     is fairer than all dreams can be     for through my spirit all day long     ring echoes of that angelsong     in melodious thoughts of thee     and well i know it cannot die     till eternal morn shall break     for through lifes slumber thou and i     will keep it for each others sake   and it shall not be

and deep     murmurs over in her sleep   doubtfully pausing and murmuring still      evermore         thus on lifes weary sea         heareth the marinere         voices sweet from far and near         ever singing low and clear         ever singing longingly      is it not better here to be   than to be toiling late and soon   in the dreary night to see   nothing but the bloodred moon   go up and down into the sea   or in the loneliness of day     to see the still seals only   solemnly lift their faces gray     making it yet more lonely   is it not better than to hear   only the sliding of the wave   beneath the plank and feel so near   a cold and lonely grave   a restless grave where thou shalt lie   even in death unquietly   look down beneath thy waveworn bark     lean over the side and see   the leaden eye of the sidelong shark       upturnèd patiently     ever waiting there for thee   look down and see those shapeless forms     which ever keep their dreamless sleep   far down within the gloomy deep   and only stir themselves in storms   rising like islands from beneath   and snorting through the angry spray   as the frail vessel perisheth   in the whirls of their unwieldy play       look down look down   upon the seaweed slimy and dark   that waves its arms so lank and brown     beckoning for thee   look down beneath thy waveworn bark     into the cold depth of the sea       look down look down         thus on lifes lonely sea         heareth the marinere         voices sad from far and near         ever singing full of fear         ever singing drearfully      here all is pleasant as a dream   the wind scarce shaketh down the dew   the green grass floweth like a stream         into the oceans blue           listen o listen   here is a gush of many streams     a song of many birds   and every wish and longing seems   lulled to a numbered flow of words           listen o listen   here ever hum the golden bees   underneath fullblossomed trees   at once with glowing fruit and flowers crowned   the sand is so smooth the yellow sand   that thy keel will not grate as it touches the land   all around with a slumberous sound   the singing waves slide up the strand   and there where the smooth wet pebbles be   the waters gurgle longingly   as if they fain would seek the shore   to be at rest from the ceaseless roar   to be at rest forevermore       forevermore           thus on lifes gloomy sea           heareth the marinere           voices sweet from far and near           ever singing in his ear           here is rest and peace for thee      nantasket july 1840                       irenÉ       hers is a spirit deep and crystalclear   calmly beneath her earnest face it lies   free without boldness meek without a fear   quicker to look than speak its sympathies   far down into her large and patient eyes   i gaze deepdrinking of the infinite   as in the midwatch of a clear still night   i look into the fathomless blue skies      so circled lives she with loves holy light   that from the shade of self she walketh free   the garden of her soul still keepeth she   an eden where the snake did never enter   she hath a natural wise sincerity   a simple truthfulness and these have lent her   a dignity as moveless as the centre   so that no influence of earth can stir   her steadfast courage nor can take away   the holy peacefulness which night and day   unto her queenly soul doth minister      most gentle is she her large charity   an all unwitting childlike gift in her   not freer is to give than meek to bear   and though herself not unacquaint with care   hath in her heart wide room for all that be   her heart that hath no secrets of its own   but open is as eglantine full blown   cloudless forever is her brow serene   speaking calm hope and trust within her whence   welleth a noiseless spring of patience   that keepeth all her life so fresh so green   and full of holiness that every look   the greatness of her womans soul revealing   unto me bringeth blessing and a feeling   as when i read in gods own holy book      a graciousness in giving that doth make   the smallst gift greatest and a sense most meek   of worthiness that doth not fear to take   from others but which always fears to speak   its thanks in utterance for the givers sake   the deep religion of a thankful heart   which rests instinctively in heavens law   with a full peace that never can depart   from its own steadfastnessa holy awe   for holy thingsnot those which men call holy   but such as are revealèd to the eyes   of a true womans soul bent down and lowly   before the face of daily mysteries   a love that blossoms soon but ripens slowly   to the full goldenness of fruitful prime   enduring with a firmness that defies   all shallow tricks of circumstance and time   by a sure insight knowing where to cling   and where it clingeth never withering   these are irenés dowry which no fate   can shake from their serene deepbuilded state      inseeing sympathy is hers which chasteneth   no less than loveth scorning to be bound   with fear of blame and yet which ever hasteneth   to pour the balm of kind looks on the wound   if they be wounds which such sweet teaching makes   giving itself a pang for others sakes   no want of faith that chills with sidelong eye   hath she no jealousy no levite pride   that passeth by upon the other side   for in her soul there never dwelt a lie   right from the hand of god her spirit came   unstained and she hath neer forgotten whence   it came nor wandered far from thence   but laboreth to keep her still the same   near to her place of birth that she may not   soil her white raiment with an earthly spot      yet sets she not her soul so steadily   above that she forgets her ties to earth   but her whole thought would almost seem to be   how to make glad one lowly human hearth   for with a gentle courage she doth strive   in thought and word and feeling so to live   as to make earth next heaven and her heart   herein doth show its most exceeding worth   that bearing in our frailty her just part   she hath not shrunk from evils of this life   but hath gone calmly forth into the strife   and all its sins and sorrows hath withstood   with lofty strength of patient womanhood   for this i love her great soul more than all   that being bound like us with earthly thrall   she walks so bright and heavenlike therein   too wise too meek too womanly to sin      like a lone star through riven stormclouds seen   by sailors tempesttossd upon the sea   telling of rest and peaceful heavens nigh   unto my soul her starlike soul hath been   her sight as full of hope and calm to me   for she unto herself hath builded high   a home serene wherein to lay her head

glorious fancies come from far   beneath the silver eveningstar   and yet her heart is ever near                  ii    great feelings hath she of her own   which lesser souls may never know   god giveth them to her alone   and sweet they are as any tone   wherewith the wind may choose to blow                  iii    yet in herself she dwelleth not   although no home were half so fair   no simplest duty is forgot   life hath no dim and lowly spot   that doth not in her sunshine share                  iv    she doeth little kindnesses   which most leave undone or despise   for naught

heart entwines and clings   and patiently she folds her wings   to tread the humble paths of earth                  vi    blessing she is god made her so   and deeds of weekday holiness   fall from her noiseless as the snow   nor hath she ever chanced to know   that aught were easier than to bless                 vii    she is most fair and thereunto   her life doth rightly harmonize   feeling

high tower and lowly mill   goes wandering at its own will   and yet doth ever flow aright                   x    and on its full deep breast serene   like quiet isles my duties lie   it flows around them and between   and makes them fresh and fair and green   sweet homes wherein to live and die      1840                   summer storm         untremulous in the river clear   toward the skys image hangs the imaged bridge       so still the air that i can hear   the slender clarion of the unseen midge       out of the stillness with a gathering creep   like rising wind in leaves which now decreases   now lulls now swells and all the while increases     the huddling trample of a drove of sheep   tilts the loose planks and then as gradually ceases     in dust on the other side lifes emblem deep   a confused noise between two silences   finding at last in dust precarious peace   on the wide marsh the purpleblossomed grasses     soak up the sunshine sleeps the brimming tide   save when the wedgeshaped wake in silence passes     of some slow waterrat whose sinuous glide     wavers the long green sedges shade from side to side   but up the west like a rockshivered surge     climbs a great cloud edged with sunwhitened spray   huge whirls of foam boil toppling oer its verge     and falling still it seems and yet it climbs alway        suddenly all the sky is hid       as with the shutting of a lid     one by one great drops are falling         doubtful and slow   down the pane they are crookedly crawling         and the wind breathes low   slowly the circles widen on the river     widen and mingle one and all   here and there the slenderer flowers shiver     struck by an icy raindrops fall    now on the hills i hear the thunder mutter       the wind is gathering in the west   the upturned leaves first whiten and flutter       then droop to a fitful rest   up from the stream with sluggish flap     struggles the gull and floats away   nearer and nearer rolls the thunderclap     we shall not see the sun go down today   now leaps the wind on the sleepy marsh     and tramples the grass with terrified feet   the startled river turns leaden and harsh     you can hear the quick heart of the tempest beat        look look that livid flash   and instantly follows the rattling thunder   as if some cloudcrag split asunder       fell splintering with a ruinous crash   on the earth which crouches in silence under     and now a solid gray wall of rain   shuts off the landscape mile by mile     for a breaths space i see the blue wood again   and ere the next heartbeat the windhurled pile     that seemed but now a league aloof     bursts crackling oer the sunparched roof   against the windows the storm comes dashing   through tattered foliage the hail tears crashing         the blue lightning flashes         the rapid hail clashes       the white waves are tumbling         and in one baffled roar       like the toothless sea mumbling         a rockbristled shore       the thunder is rumbling       and crashing and crumbling     will silence return never more          hush still as death         the tempest holds his breath       as from a sudden will     the rain stops short but from the eaves     you see it drop and hear it from the leaves       all is so bodingly still         again now now again     plashes the rain in heavy gouts         the crinkled lightning         seems ever brightening           and loud and long     again the thunder shouts           his battlesong         one quivering flash         one wildering crash     followed by silence dead and dull       as if the cloud let go       leapt bodily below   to whelm the earth in one mad overthrow       and then a total lull          gone gone so soon       no more my halfcrazed fancy there       can shape a giant in the air       no more i see his streaming hair     the writhing portent of his form         the pale and quiet moon       makes her calm forehead bare     and the last fragments of the storm   like shattered rigging from a fight at sea   silent and few are drifting over me      1839                         love     true love is but a humble lowborn thing   and hath its food served up in earthen ware   it is a thing to walk with hand in hand   through the everydayness of this workday world   baring its tender feet to every roughness   yet letting not one heartbeat go astray   from beautys law of plainness and content   a simple fireside thing whose quiet smile   can warm earths poorest hovel to a home   which when our autumn cometh as it must   and life in the chill wind shivers bare and leafless   shall still be blest with indiansummer youth   in bleak november and with thankful heart   smile on its ample stores of garnered fruit   as full of sunshine to our aged eyes   as when it nursed the blossoms of our spring   such is true love which steals into the heart   with feet as silent as the lightsome dawn   that kisses smooth the rough brows of the dark   and hath its will through blissful gentleness   not like a rocket which with savage glare   whirrs suddenly up then bursts and leaves the night   painfully quivering on the dazèd eyes   a love that gives and takes that seeth faults   not with flawseeking eyes like needle points   but lovingkindly ever looks them down   with the oercoming faith of meek forgiveness   a love that shall be new and fresh each hour   as is the golden mystery of sunset   or the sweet coming of the evening star   alike and yet most unlike every day   and seeming ever best and fairest now   a love that doth not kneel for what it seeks   but faces truth and beauty as their peer   showing its worthiness of noble thoughts   by a clear sense of inward nobleness   a love that in its object findeth not   all grace and beauty and enough to sate   its thirst of blessing but in all of good   found there it sees but heavengranted types   of good and beauty in the soul of man   and traces in the simplest heart that beats   a familylikeness to its chosen one   that claims of it the rights of brotherhood   for love is blind but with the fleshly eye   that so its inner sight may be more clear   and outward shows of beauty only so   are needful at the first as is a hand   to guide and to uphold an infants steps   great spirits need them not their earnest look   pierces the bodys mask of thin disguise   and beauty ever is to them revealed   behind the unshapeliest meanest lump of clay   with arms outstretched and eager face ablaze   yearning to be but understood and loved      1840               to perdita singing     thy voice is like a fountain     leaping up in clear moonshine   silver silver ever mounting       ever sinking       without thinking     to that brimful heart of thine    every sad and happy feeling   thou hast had in bygone years   through thy lips come stealing stealing         clear and low     all thy smiles and all thy tears       in thy voice awaken       and sweetness wove of joy and woe         from their teaching it hath taken     feeling and music move together     like a swan and shadow ever     heaving on a skyblue river     in a day of cloudless weather      it hath caught a touch of sadness         yet it is not sad     it hath tones of clearest gladness         yet it is not glad   a dim sweet twilight voice it is     where todays accustomed blue   is overgrayed with memories     with starry feelings quivered through      thy voice is like a fountain   leaping up in sunshine bright     and i never weary counting   its clear droppings lone and single   or when in one full gush they mingle     shooting in melodious light      thine is music such as yields     feelings of old brooks and fields     and around this pentup room     sheds a woodland free perfume       o thus forever sing to me         o thus forever   the green bright grass of childhood bring to me     flowing like an emerald river     and the bright blue skies above     o sing them back as fresh as ever     into the bosom of my love     the sunshine and the merriment     the unsought evergreen content       of that never cold time     the joy that like a clear breeze went       through and through the old time      peace sits within thine eyes     with white hands crossed in joyful rest     while through thy lips and face arise     the melodies from out thy breast         she sits and sings         with folded wings         and white arms crost      weep not for passed things         they are not lost     the beauty which the summer time     oer thine opening spirit shed     the forest oracles sublime     that filled thy soul with joyous dread     the scent of every smallest flower     that made thy heart sweet for an hour     yea every holy influence     flowing to thee thou knewest not whence     in thine eyes today is seen     fresh as it hath ever been     promptings of nature beckonings sweet     whatever led thy childish feet     still will linger unawares     the guiders of thy silver hairs     every look and every word     which thou givest forth today     tell of the singing of the bird     whose music stilled thy boyish play      thy voice is like a fountain     twinkling up in sharp starlight     when the moon behind the mountain     dims the low east with faintest white         ever darkling         ever sparkling     we know not if tis dark or bright   but when the great moon hath rolled round     and suddenslow its solemn power   grows from behind its black clearedged bound     no spot of dark the fountain keepeth     but swift as opening eyelids leapeth     into a waving silver flower      1841                 the moon       my soul was like the sea     before the moon was made   moaning in vague immensity     of its own strength afraid     unrestful and unstaid    through every rift it foamed in vain     about its earthly prison   seeking some unknown thing in pain   and sinking restless back again     for yet no moon had risen   its only voice a vast dumb moan     of utterless anguish speaking   it lay unhopefully alone     and lived but in an aimless seeking    so was my soul but whentwas full     of unrest to oerloading   a voice of something beautiful     whispered a dim foreboding   and yet so soft so sweet so low   it had not more of joy than woe   and as the sea doth oft lie still     making its waters meet   as if by an unconscious will     for the moons silver feet   so lay my soul within mine eyes   when thou its guardian moon didst rise   and now howeer its waves above     may toss and seem uneaseful   one strong eternal law of love     with guidance sure and peaceful   as calm and natural as breath   moves its great deeps through life and death               remembered music               a fragment     thickrushing like an ocean vast     of bisons the far prairie shaking   the notes crowd heavily and fast   as surfs one plunging while the last     draws seaward from its foamy breaking    or in low murmurs they began     rising and rising momently   as oer a harp Æolian   a fitful breeze until they ran     up to a sudden ecstasy    and then like minute drops of rain     ringing in water silvery   they lingering dropped and dropped again   till it was almost like a pain     to listen when the next would be      1840                       song                   to m l     a lily thou wast when i saw thee first     a lilybud not opened quite     that hourly grew more pure and white   by morning and noontide and evening nursed     in all of nature thou hadst thy share       thou wast waited on       by the wind and sun     the rain and the dew for thee took care     it seemed thou never couldst be more fair    a lily thou wast when i saw thee first     a lilybud but o how strange     how full of wonder was the change   when ripe with all sweetness thy full bloom burst     how did the tears to my glad eyes start       when the womanflower       reached its blossoming hour   and i saw the warm deeps of thy golden heart    glad death may pluck thee but never before     the gold dust of thy bloom divine     hath dropped from thy heart into mine   to quicken its faint germs of heavenly lore     for no breeze comes nigh thee but carries away       some impulses bright       of fragrance and light   which fall upon souls that are lone and astray   to plant fruitful hopes of the flower of day                     allegra     i would more natures were like thine     that never casts a glance before   thou hebe who thy hearts bright wine     so lavishly to all dost pour   that we who drink forget to pine     and can but dream of bliss in store    thou canst not see a shade in life     with sunward instinct thou dost rise   and leaving clouds below at strife     gazest undazzled at the skies   with all their blazing splendors rife     a songful lark with eagles eyes    thou wast some foundling whom the hours     nursed laughing with the milk of mirth   some influence more gay than ours     hath ruled thy nature from its birth   as if thy natal stars were flowers     that shook their seeds round thee on earth    and thou to lull thine infant rest     wast cradled like an indian child   all pleasant winds from south and west     with lullabies thine ears beguiled   rocking thee in thine orioles nest     till nature looked at thee and smiled    thine every fancy seems to borrow     a sunlight from thy childish years   making a golden cloud of sorrow     a hopelit rainbow out of tears   thy heart is certain of tomorrow     though yond today it never peers    i would more natures were like thine     so innocently wild and free   whose sad thoughts even leap and shine     like sunny wavelets in the sea   making us mindless of the brine     in gazing on the brilliancy         the fountain     into the sunshine     full of the light   leaping and flashing     from morn till night    into the moonlight     whiter than snow   waving so flowerlike     when the winds blow    into the starlight     rushing in spray   happy at midnight     happy by day    ever in motion     blithesome and cheery   still climbing heavenward     never aweary    glad of all weathers     still seeming best   upward or downward     motion thy rest    full of a nature     nothing can tame   changed every moment     ever the same    ceaseless aspiring     ceaseless content   darkness or sunshine     thy element    glorious fountain     let my heart be   fresh changeful constant     upward like thee

outward shell and skin of daily life   nothing to him were fleeting time and fashion     his soul was led by the eternal law   there was in him no hope of fame no passion     but with calm godlike eyes he only saw   he did not sigh oer heroes dead and buried     chiefmourner at the golden ages hearse   nor deem that souls whom charon grim had ferried     alone were fitting themes of epic verse   he could believe the promise of tomorrow     and feel the wondrous meaning of today   he had a deeper faith in holy sorrow     than the worlds seeming loss could take away   to know the heart of all things was his duty     all things did sing to him to make him wise   and with a sorrowful and conquering beauty     the soul of all looked grandly from his eyes   he gazed on all within him and without him     he watched the flowing of times steady tide   and shapes of glory floated all about him     and whispered to him and he prophesied   than all men he more fearless was and freer     and all his brethren cried with one accord   behold the holy man behold the seer     him who hath spoken with the unseen lord   he to his heart with large embrace had taken     the universal sorrow of mankind   and from that root a shelter never shaken     the tree of wisdom grew with sturdy rind   he could interpret well the wondrous voices     which to the calm and silent spirit come   he knew that the one soul no more rejoices     in the stars anthem than the insects hum   he in his heart was ever meek and humble     and yet with kingly pomp his numbers ran   as he foresaw how all things false should crumble     before the free uplifted soul of man   and when he was made full to overflowing     with all the loveliness of heaven and earth   out rushed his song like molten iron glowing     to show god sitting by the humblest hearth   with calmest courage he was ever ready     to teach that action was the truth of thought   and with strong arm and purpose firm and steady     an anchor for the drifting world he wrought   so did he make the meanest man partaker     of all his brothergods unto him gave   all souls did reverence him and name him maker     and when he died heaped temples on his grave   and still his deathless words of light are swimming     serene throughout the great deep infinite   of human soul unwaning and undimming     to cheer and guide the mariner at night                           ii    but now the poet is an empty rhymer     who lies with idle elbow on the grass   and fits his singing like a cunning timer     to all mens prides and fancies as they pass   not his the song which in its metre holy     chimes with the music of the eternal stars   humbling the tyrant lifting up the lowly     and sending sun through the souls prisonbars   maker

hath pampered     who as the clear northwestern wind is free   who walks with forms observances unhampered     and follows the one will obediently   whose eyes like windows on a breezy summit     control a lovely prospect every way   who doth not sound gods sea with earthly plummet     and find a bottom still of worthless clay   who heeds not how the lower gusts are working     knowing that one sure wind blows on above   and sees beneath the foulest faces lurking     one godbuilt shrine of reverence and love   who sees all stars that wheel their shining marches     around the centre fixed of destiny   where the encircling soul serene oerarches     the moving globe of being like a sky   who feels that god and heavens great deeps are nearer     him to whose heart his fellowman is nigh   who doth not hold his souls own freedom dearer     than that of all his brethren low or high   who to the right can feel himself the truer     for being gently patient with the wrong   who sees

drives whistling down the lonely street     and stiffens on the pavement bare    the streetlamps flare and struggle dim     through the white sleetclouds as they pass   or governed by a boisterous whim     drop down and rattle on the glass    one poor heartbroken outcast girl     faces the eastwinds searching flaws   and as about her heart they whirl     her tattered cloak more tightly draws    the flat brick walls look cold and bleak     her bare feet to the sidewalk freeze   yet dares she not a shelter seek     though faint with hunger and disease    the sharp storm cuts her forehead bare     and piercing through her garments thin   beats on her shrunken breast and there     makes colder the cold heart within    she lingers where a ruddy glow     streams outward through an open shutter   adding more bitterness to woe     more loneness to desertion utter    one half the cold she had not felt     until she saw this gush of light   spread warmly forth and seem to melt     its slow way through the deadening night    she hears a womans voice within     singing sweet words her childhood knew   and years of misery and sin     furl off and leave her heaven blue    her freezing heart like one who sinks     outwearied in the drifting snow   drowses to deadly sleep and thinks     no longer of its hopeless woe    old fields and clear blue summer days     old meadows green with grass and trees   that shimmer through the trembling haze     and whiten in the western breeze    old facesall the friendly past     rises within her heart again   and sunshine from her childhood cast     makes summer of the icy rain    enhaloed by a mild warm glow     from all humanity apart   she hears old footsteps wandering slow     through the lone chambers of her heart    outside the porch before the door     her cheek upon the cold hard stone   she lies no longer foul and poor     no longer dreary and alone    next morning something heavily     against the opening door did weigh   and there from sin and sorrow free     a woman on the threshold lay    a smile upon the wan lips told     that she had found a calm release   and that from out the want and cold     the song had borne her soul in peace    for whom the heart of man shuts out     sometimes the heart of god takes in   and fences them all round about     with silence mid the worlds loud din    and one of his great charities     is music and it doth not scorn   to close the lids upon the eyes     of the polluted and forlorn    far was she from her childhoods home     farther in guilt had wandered thence   yet thither it had

doth glide   spreading its ghostlike billows     silently far and wide    a vague and starry magic     makes all things mysteries   and lures the earths dumb spirit     up to the longing skies   i seem to hear dim whispers     and tremulous replies    the fireflies oer the meadow     in pulses come and go   the elmtrees heavy shadow     weighs on the grass below   and faintly from the distance     the dreaming cock doth crow    all things look strange and mystic     the very bushes swell   and take wild shapes and motions     as if beneath a spell   they seem not the same lilacs     from childhood known so well    the snow of deepest silence     oer everything doth fall   so beautiful and quiet     and yet so like a pall   as if all life were ended     and rest were come to all    o

  god do not let my loved one die     but rather wait until the time   that i am grown in purity     enough to enter thy pure clime   then take me i will gladly go     so that my love remain below    o let her stay she is by birth     what i through death must learn to be   we need her more on our poor earth     than thou canst need in heaven with thee   she hath her wings already i   must burst

                 i    in his tower sat the poet     gazing on the roaring sea   take this rose he sighed and throw it     where theres none that loveth me   on the rock the billow bursteth     and sinks back into the seas   but in vain my spirit thirsteth     so to burst and be at ease   take o sea the tender blossom     that hath lain against my breast   on thy black and angry bosom     it will find a surer rest   life is vain and love is hollow     ugly death stands there behind   hate and scorn and hunger follow     him that toileth for his kind   forth into the night he hurled it     and with bitter smile did mark   how the surly tempest whirled it     swift into the hungry dark   foam and spray drive back to leeward     and the gale with dreary moan   drifts the helpless blossom seaward     through the breakers all alone                    ii    stands a maiden on the morrow     musing by the wavebeat strand   half in hope and half in sorrow     tracing words upon the sand   shall i ever then behold him     who hath been my life so long   ever to this sick heart fold him     be the spirit of his song   touch not sea the blessed letters     i have traced upon thy shore   spare his name whose spirit fetters     mine with love forevermore   swells the tide and overflows it     but with omen pure and meet   brings a little rose and throws it     humbly at the maidens feet   full of bliss she takes the token     and upon her snowy breast   soothes the ruffled petals broken     with the oceans fierce unrest   love is thine o heart and surely     peace shall also be thine own   for the heart that trusteth purely     never long can pine alone                   iii    in his tower sits the poet     blisses new and strange to him   fill his heart and overflow it     with a wonder sweet and dim   up the beach the ocean slideth     with a whisper of delight   and the noon in silence glideth     through the peaceful blue of night   rippling oer the poets shoulder     flows a maidens golden hair   maidenlips with love grown bolder     kiss his moonlit forehead bare   life is joy and love is power     death all fetters doth unbind   strength and wisdom only flower

  fair as a summer dream was margaret     such dream as in a poets soul might start   musing of old loves while the moon doth set     her hair was not more sunny than her heart   though like a natural golden coronet     it circled her dear head with careless art   mocking the sunshine that would fain have lent   to its frank grace a richer ornament                        ii    his loved ones eyes could poet ever speak     so kind so dewy and so deep were hers   but while he strives the choicest phrase too weak     their glad reflection in his spirit blurs   as one may see a dream dissolve and break     out of his grasp when he to tell it stirs   like that sad dryad doomed no more to bless   the mortal who revealed her loveliness                       iii    she dwelt forever in a region bright     peopled with living fancies of her own   where naught could come but visions of delight     far far aloof from earths eternal moan   a summer cloud thrilled through with rosy light     floating beneath the blue sky all alone   her spirit wandered by itself and won   a golden edge from some unsetting sun                        iv    the heart grows richer that its lot is poor     god blesses want with larger sympathies   love enters gladliest at the humble door     and makes the cot a palace with his eyes   so margarets heart a softer beauty wore     and grew in gentleness and patience wise   for she was but a simple herdsmans child   a lily chancesown in the rugged wild                         v    there was no beauty of the wood or field     but she its fragrant bosomsecret knew   nor any but to her would freely yield     some grace that in her soul took root and grew   nature to her glowed ever newrevealed     all rosy fresh with innocent morning dew   and looked into her heart with dim sweet eyes   that left it full of sylvan memories                        vi    o what a face was hers to brighten light     and give back sunshine with an added glow   to wile each moment with a fresh delight     and part of memorys best contentment grow   o how her voice as with an inmates right     into the strangest heart would welcome go   and make it sweet and ready to become   of white and gracious thoughts the chosen home                       vii    none looked upon her but he straightway thought     of all the greenest depths of country cheer   and into each ones heart was freshly brought     what was to him the sweetest time of year   so was her every look and motion fraught     with outofdoor delights and forest lere   not the first violet on a woodland lea   seemed a more visible gift of spring than she                      viii    is love learned only out of poets books     is there not somewhat in the dropping flood   and in the nunneries of silent nooks     and in the murmured longing of the wood   that could make margaret dream of lovelorn looks     and stir a thrilling mystery in her blood   more trembly secret than auroras tear   shed in the bosom of an eglatere                        ix    full many a sweet forewarning hath the mind     full many a whispering of vague desire   ere comes the nature destined to unbind     its virgin zone and all its deeps inspire   low stirrings in the leaves before the wind     wakes all the green strings of the forest lyre   faint heatings in the calyx ere the rose   its warm voluptuous breast doth all unclose                         x    long in its dim recesses pines the spirit     wildered and dark despairingly alone   though many a shape of beauty wander near it     and many a wild and halfremembered tone   tremble from the divine abyss to cheer it     yet still it knows that there is only one   before whom it can kneel and tribute bring   at once a happy vassal and a king                        xi    to feel a want yet scarce know what it is     to seek one nature that is always new   whose glance is warmer than anothers kiss     whom we can bare our inmost beauty to   nor feel deserted afterwardsfor this     but with our destined comate we can do   such longing instinct fills the mighty scope   of the young soul with one mysterious hope                        xii    so margarets heart grew brimming with the lore     of loves enticing secrets and although   she had found none to cast it down before     yet oft to fancys chapel she would go   to pay her vows and count the rosary oer     of her loves promised graceshaply so   mirandas hope had pictured ferdinand   long ere the gaunt wave tossed him on the strand                       xiii    a newmade star that swims the lonely gloom     unwedded yet and longing for the sun   whose beams the bridegifts of the lavish groom     blithely to crown the virgin planet run   her being was watching to see the bloom     of loves fresh sunrise roofing one by one   its clouds with gold a triumpharch to be   for him who came to hold her heart in fee                        xiv    not far from margarets cottage dwelt a knight     of the proud templars a sworn celibate   whose heart in secret fed upon the light     and dew of her ripe beauty through the grate   of his close vow catching what gleams he might     of the free heaven and cursingall too late   the cruel faith whose black walls hemmed him in   and turned lifes crowning bliss to deadly sin                        xv    for he had met her in the wood by chance     and having drunk her beautys wildering spell   his heart shook like the pennon of a lance     that quivers in a breezes sudden swell   and thenceforth in a closeenfolded trance     from mistily golden deep to deep he fell   till earth did waver and fade far away   beneath the hope in whose warm arms he lay                       xvi    a dark proud man he was whose halfblown youth     had shed its blossoms even in opening   leaving a few that with more winning ruth     trembling around grave manhoods stem might cling   more sad than cheery making in good sooth     like the fringed gentian a late autumn spring   a twilight nature braided light and gloom   a youth halfsmiling by an open tomb                       xvii    fair as an angel who yet inly wore     a wrinkled heart foreboding his near fall   who saw him always wished to know him more     as if he were some fates defiant thrall   and nursed a dreaded secret at its core     little he loved but power most of all   and that he seemed to scorn as one who knew   by what foul paths men choose to crawl thereto                      xviii    he had been noble but some great deceit     had turned his better instinct to a vice   he strove to think the world was all a cheat     that power and fame were cheap at any price   that the sure way of being shortly great     was even to play lifes game with loaded dice   since he had tried the honest play and found   that vice and virtue differed but in sound                       xix    yet margarets sight redeemed him for a space     from his own thraldom man could never be   a hypocrite when first such maiden grace     smiled in upon his heart the agony   of wearing all day long a lying face     fell lightly from him and a moment free   erect with wakened faith his spirit stood   and scorned the weakness of its demonmood                        xx    like a sweet windharp to him was her thought     which would not let the common air come near   till from its dim enchantment it had caught     a musical tenderness that brimmed his ear   with sweetness more ethereal than aught     save silverdropping snatches that whilere   rained down from some sad angels faithful harp   to cool her fallen lovers anguish sharp                       xxi    deep in the forest was a little dell     high overarchèd with the leafy sweep   of a broad oak through whose gnarled roots there fell     a slender rill that sung itself asleep   where its continuous toil had scooped a well     to please the fairy folk breathlessly deep   the stillness was save when the dreaming brook   from its small urn a drizzly murmur shook                      xxii    the wooded hills sloped upward all around     with gradual rise and made an even rim   so that it seemed a mighty casque unbound     from some huge titans brow to lighten him   ages ago and left upon the ground     where the slow soil had mossed it to the brim   till after countless centuries it grew   into this dell the haunt of noontide dew                     xxiii    dim vistas sprinkled oer with sunflecked green     wound through the thickset trunks on every side   and toward the west in fancy might be seen     a gothic window in its blazing pride   when the low sun two arching elms between     lit up the leaves beyond which autumndyed   with lavish hues would into splendor start   shaming the labored panes of richest art                      xxiv    here leaning once against the old oaks trunk     mordred for such was the young templars name   saw margaret come unseen the falcon shrunk     from the meek dove sharp thrills of tingling flame   made him forget that he was vowed a monk     and all the outworks of his pride oercame   flooded he seemed with bright delicious

her head     she drooped and made her golden hair her veil   through which a glow of rosiest lustre spread     then faded and anon she stood all pale   as snow oer which a blush of northernlight   suddenly reddens and as soon grows white                    xxvii    she thought of tristrem and of lancilot     of all her dreams and of kind fairies might   and how that dell was deemed a haunted spot     until there grew a mist before her sight   and where the present was she half forgot     borne backward through the realms of old delight   then starting up awake she would have gone   yet almost wished it might not be alone                   xxviii    how they went home together through the wood     and how all life seemed focussed into one   thoughtdazzling spot that set ablaze the blood     what need to tell fit language there is none   for the hearts deepest things who ever wooed     as in his boyish hope he would have done   for when the soul is fullest the hushed tongue   voicelessly trembles like a lute unstrung                    xxix    but all things carry the hearts messages     and know it not nor doth the heart well know   but nature hath her will even as the

the bliss     which but in giving truly is their own   she had no dreams of barter asked not his     but gave hers freely as she would have thrown   a rose to him or as that rose gives forth   its generous fragrance thoughtless of its worth                     xxxi    her summer nature felt a need to bless     and a like longing to be blest again   so from her skylike spirit gentleness     dropt ever like a sunlit fall of rain   and his beneath drank in the bright caress     as thirstily as would a parchèd plain   that long hath watched the showers of sloping gray   forever ever falling far away                    xxxii    how should she dream of ill the heart filled quite     with sunshine like the shepherdsclock at noon   closes its leaves around its warm delight     whateer in life is harsh or out of tune   is all shut out no boding shade of light     can pierce the opiate ether of its swoon   love is but blind as thoughtful justice is   but naught can be so wantonblind as bliss                   xxxiii    all beauty and all life he was to her     she questioned not his love she only knew   that she loved him and not a pulse could stir     in her whole frame but quivered through and through   with this glad thought and was a minister     to do him fealty and service true   like golden ripples hasting to the land   to wreck their freight of sunshine on the strand                    xxxiv    o dewy dawn of love o hopes that are   hung high like the cliffswallows perilous nest   most like to fall when fullest and that jar   with every heavier billow o unrest   than balmiest deeps of quiet sweeter far   how did ye triumph now in margarets breast   making it readier to shrink and start   than quivering gold of the pondlilys heart                     xxxv    here let us pause o would the soul might ever     achieve its immortality in youth   when nothing yet hath damped its high endeavor     after the starry energy of truth   here let us pause and for a moment sever     this gleam of sunshine from the days unruth   that sometime come to all for it is good   to lengthen to the last a sunny mood                    part second                         i    as one who from the sunshine and the green     enters the solid darkness of a cave   nor knows what precipice or pit unseen     may yawn before him with its sudden grave   and with hushed breath doth often forward lean     dreaming he hears the plashing of a wave   dimly below or feels a damper air   from out some dreary chasm he knows not where                        ii    so from the sunshine and the green of love     we enter on our storys darker part   and though the horror of it well may move     an impulse of repugnance in the heart   yet let us think that as theres naught above     the allembracing atmosphere of art   so also there is naught that falls below   her generous reach though grimed with guilt and woe                        iii    her fittest triumph is to show that good     lurks in the heart of evil evermore   that love though scorned and outcast and withstood     can without end forgive and yet have store   gods love and mans are of the selfsame blood     and he can see that always at the door   of foulest hearts the angelnature yet   knocks to return and cancel all its debt                        iv    it ever is weak falsehoods destiny     that her thick mask turns crystal to let through   the unsuspicious eyes of honesty     but margarets heart was too sincere and true   aught but plain truth and faithfulness to see     and mordreds for a time a little grew   to be like hers won by the mild reproof   of those kind eyes that kept all doubt aloof                         v    full oft they met as dawn and twilight meet     in northern climes she full of growing day   as he of darkness which before her feet     shrank gradual and faded quite away   soon to return for power had made love sweet     to him and when his will had gained full sway   the taste began to pall for never power   can sate the hungry soul beyond an hour                        vi    he fell as doth the tempter ever fall     even in the gaining of his loathsome end   god doth not work as man works but makes all     the crooked paths of ill to goodness tend   let him judge margaret if to be the thrall     of love and faith too generous to defend   its very life from him she loved be sin   what hope of grace may the seducer win                        vii    grimhearted world that lookst with levite eyes     on those poor fallen by too much faith in man   she that upon thy freezing threshold lies     starved to more sinning by thy savage ban   seeking that refuge because foulest vice     more godlike than thy virtue is whose span   shuts out the wretched onlyis more free   to enter heaven than thou wilt ever be                       viii    thou wilt not let her wash thy dainty feet     with such salt things as tears or with rude hair   dry them soft pharisee that sitst at meat     with him who made her such and speakst him fair   leaving gods wandering lamb the while to bleat     unheeded shivering in the pitiless air   thou hast made prisoned virtue show more wan   and haggard than a vice to look upon                        ix    now many months flew by and weary grew     to margaret the sight of happy things   blight fell on all her flowers instead of dew     shut round her heart were now the joyous wings   wherewith it wont to soar yet not untrue     though tempted much her womans nature clings   to its first pure belief and with sad eyes   looks backward oer the gate of paradise                         x    and so though altered mordred came less oft     and winter frowned where spring had laughed before   in his strange eyes yet half her sadness doffed     and in her silent patience loved him more   sorrow had made her soft heart yet more soft     and a new life within her own she bore   which made her tenderer as she felt it move   beneath her breast a refuge for her love                        xi    this babe she thought would surely bring him back     and be a bond forever them between   before its eyes the sullen tempestrack     would fade and leave the face of heaven serene   and loves return doth more than fill the lack     which in his absence withered the hearts green   and yet a dim foreboding still would flit   between her and her hope to darken it                        xii    she could not figure forth a happy fate     even for this life from heaven so newly come   the earth must needs be doubly desolate     to him scarce parted from a fairer home   such boding heavier on her bosom sate     one night as standing in the twilight gloam   she strained her eyes beyond that dizzy verge   at whose foot faintly breaks the futures surge                       xiii    poor little spirit naught but shame and woe     nurse the sick heart whose lifeblood nurses thine   yet not those only love hath triumphed so     as for thy sake makes sorrow more divine   and yet though thou be pure the world is foe     to purity if born in such a shrine   and having trampled it for struggling thence   smiles to itself and calls it providence                        xiv    as thus she mused a shadow seemed to rise     from out her thought and turn to dreariness   all blissful hopes and sunny memories     and the quick blood doth curdle up and press   about her heart which seemed to shut its eyes     and hush itself as who with shuddering guess   harks through the gloom and dreads een now to feel   through his hot breast the icy slide of steel                        xv    but at the heartbeat while in dread she was     in the low wind the honeysuckles gleam   a dewy thrill flits through the heavy grass     and looking forth she saw as in a dream   within the wood the moonlights shadowy mass     nights starry heart yearning to hers doth seem   and the deep sky fullhearted with the moon   folds round her all the happiness of june                        xvi    what fear could face a heaven and earth like this     what silveriest cloud could hang neath such a sky   a tide of wondrous and unwonted bliss     rolls back through all her pulses suddenly   as if some seraph who had learned to kiss     from the fair daughters of the world gone by   had wedded so his fallen light with hers   such sweet strange joy through soul and body stirs                       xvii    now seek we mordred he who did not fear     the crime yet fears the latent consequence   if it should reach a brother templars ear     it haply might be made a good pretence   to cheat him of the hope he held most dear     for he had spared no thoughts or deeds expense   that byandby might help his wish to clip   its darling bridethe high grand mastership                       xviii    the apathy ere a crime resolved is done     is scarce less dreadful than remorse for crime   by no allurement can the soul be won     from brooding oer the weary creep of time   mordred stole forth into the happy sun     striving to hum a scrap of breton rhyme   but the sky struck him speechless and he tried   in vain to summon up his callous pride                        xix    in the courtyard a fountain leaped alway     a triton blowing jewels through his shell   into the sunshine mordred turned away     weary because the stone face did not tell   of weariness nor could he bear today     heartsick to hear the patient sink and swell   of winds among the leaves or golden bees   drowsily humming in the orangetrees                        xx    all happy sights and sounds now came to him     like a reproach he wandered far and wide   following the lead of his unquiet whim     but still there went a something at his side   that made the cool breeze hot the sunshine dim     it would not flee it could not be defied   he could not see it but he felt it there   by the damp chill that crept among his hair                        xxi    day wore at last the evening star arose     and throbbing in the sky grew red and set   then with a guilty wavering step he goes     to the hid nook where they so oft had met   in happier season for his heart well knows     that he is sure to find poor margaret   watching and waiting there with lovelorn breast   around her young dreams rudely scattered nest                       xxii    why follow here that grim old chronicle     which counts the daggerstrokes and drops of blood   enough that margaret by his mad steel fell     unmoved by murder from her trusting mood   smiling on him as heaven smiles on hell     with a sad love remembering when he stood   not fallen yet the unsealer of her heart   of all her holy dreams the holiest part                       xxiii    his crime complete scarce knowing what he did     so goes the tale beneath the altar there   in the high church the stiffening corpse he hid     and then to scape that suffocating air   like a scared ghoul out of the porch he slid     but his strained eyes saw bloodspots everywhere   and ghastly faces thrust themselves between   his soul and hopes of peace with blasting mien                       xxiv    his heart went out within him like a spark     dropt in the sea wherever he made bold   to turn his eyes he saw all stiff and stark     pale margaret lying dead the lavish gold   of her loose hair seemed in the cloudy dark     to spread a glory and a thousandfold   more strangely pale and beautiful she grew   her silence stabbed his conscience through and through                        xxv    or visions of past daysa mothers eyes     that smiled down on the fair boy at her knee   whose happy upturned face to hers replies     he saw sometimes or margaret mournfully   gazed on him full of doubt as one who tries     to crush belief that does love injury   then she would wring her hands but soon again   loves patience glimmered out through cloudy pain                       xxvi    meanwhile he dared not go and steal away     the silent deadcold witness of his sin   he had not feared the life but that dull clay     those open eyes that showed the death within   would surely stare him mad yet all the day     a dreadful impulse whence his will could win   no refuge made him linger in the aisle   freezing with his wan look each greeting smile                      xxvii    now on the second day there was to be     a festival in church from far and near   came flocking in the sunburnt peasantry     and knights and dames with stately antique cheer   blazing with pomp as if all faërie     had emptied her quaint halls or as it were   the illuminated marge of some old book   while we were gazing life and motion took                      xxviii    when all were entered and the roving eyes     of all were staid some upon faces bright   some on the priests some on the traceries     that decked the slumber of a marble knight   and all the rustlings over that arise     from recognizing tokens of delight   when friendly glances meetthen silent ease   spread oer the multitude by slow degrees                       xxix    then swelled the organ up through choir and nave     the music trembled with an inward thrill   of bliss at its own grandeur wave on wave     its flood of mellow thunder rose until   the hushed air shivered with the throb it gave     then poising for a moment it stood still   and sank and rose again to burst in spray   that wandered into silence far away                        xxx    like to a mighty heart the music seemed     that yearns with melodies it cannot speak   until in grand despair of what it dreamed     in the agony of effort it doth break   yet triumphs breaking on it rushed and streamed     and wantoned in its might as when a lake   long pent among the mountains bursts its walls   and in one crowding gush leaps forth and falls                        xxxi    deeper and deeper shudders shook the air     as the huge bass kept gathering heavily   like thunder when it rouses in its lair     and with its hoarse growl shakes the lowhung sky   it grew up like a darkness everywhere     filling the vast cathedralsuddenly   from the dense mass a boys clear treble broke   like lightning and the fulltoned choir awoke                       xxxii    through gorgeous windows shone the sun aslant     brimming the church with gold and purple mist   meet atmosphere to bosom that rich chant     where fifty voices in one strand did twist   their varicolored tones and left no want     to the delighted soul which sank abyssed   in the warm music cloud while far below   the organ heaved its surges to and fro                       xxxiii    as if a lark should suddenly drop dead     while the blue air yet trembled with its song   so snapped at once that musics golden thread     struck by a nameless fear that leapt along   from heart to heart and like a shadow spread     with instantaneous shiver through the throng   so that some glanced behind as half aware   a hideous shape of dread were standing there                       xxxiv    as when a crowd of pale men gather round     watching an eddy in the leaden deep   from which they deem the body of one drowned     will be cast forth from face to face doth creep   an eager dread that holds all tongues fast bound     until the horror with a ghastly leap   starts up its dead blue arms stretched aimlessly   heaved with the swinging of the careless sea                        xxxv    so in the faces of all these there grew     as by one impulse a dark freezing awe   which with a fearful fascination drew     all eyes toward the altar damp and raw   the air grew suddenly and no man knew     whether perchance his silent neighbor saw   the dreadful thing which all were sure would rise   to scare the strained lids wider from their eyes                       xxxvi    the incense trembled as it upward sent     its slow uncertain thread of wandering blue   as t were the only living element     in all the church so deep the stillness grew   it seemed one might have heard it as it went     give out an audible rustle curling through   the midnight silence of that awestruck air   more hushed than death though so much life was there                       xxxvii    nothing they saw but a low voice was heard     threading the ominous silence of that fear   gentle and terrorless as if a bird     wakened by some volcanos glare should cheer   the murk air with his song yet every word     in the cathedrals farthest arch seemed near   as if it spoke to every one apart   like the clear voice of conscience in each heart                      xxxviii    o rest to weary hearts thou art most dear     o silence after lifes bewildering din   thou art most welcome whether in the sear     days of our age thou comest or we win   thy poppywreath in youth then wherefore here     linger i yet once free to enter in   at that wished gate which gentle death doth ope   into the boundless realm of strength and hope                       xxxix    think not in death my love could ever cease     if thou wast false more need there is for me   still to be true that slumber were not peace     if t were unvisited with dreams of thee   and thou hadst never heard such words as these     save that in heaven i must ever be   most comfortless and wretched seeing this   our unbaptizèd babe shut out from bliss                        xl    this little spirit with imploring eyes     wanders alone the dreary wild of space   the shadow of his pain forever lies     upon my soul in this new dwellingplace   his loneliness makes me in paradise     more lonely and unless i see his face   even here for grief could i lie down and die   save for my curse of immortality                        xli    world after world he sees around him swim     crowded with happy souls that take no heed   of the sad eyes that from the nights faint rim     gaze sick with longing on them as they speed   with golden gates that only shut out him     and shapes sometimes from hells abysses freed   flap darkly by him with enormous sweep   of wings that roughen wide the pitchy deep                       xlii    i am a motherspirits do not shake     this much of earth from themand i must pine   till i can feel his little hands and take     his weary head upon this heart of mine   and might it be full gladly for his sake     would i this solitude of bliss resign   and be shut out of heaven to dwell with him   forever in that silence drear and dim                       xliii    i strove to hush my soul and would not speak     at first for thy dear sake a womans love   is mighty but a mothers heart is weak     and by its weakness overcomes i strove   to smother bitter thoughts with patience meek     but still in the abyss my soul would rove   seeking my child and drove me here to claim   the rite that gives him peace in christs dear name                       xliv    i sit and weep while blessed spirits sing     i can but long and pine the while they praise   and leaning oer the wall of heaven i fling     my voice to where i deem my infant strays   like a robbed bird that cries in vain to bring     her nestlings back beneath her wings embrace   but still he answers not and i but know   that heaven and earth are both alike in woe                        xlv    then the pale priests with ceremony due     baptized the child within its dreadful tomb   beneath that mothers heart whose instinct true     starlike had battled down the triple gloom   of sorrow love and death young maidens too     strewed the pale corpse with many a milkwhite bloom   and parted the bright hair and on the breast   crossed the unconscious hands in sign of rest                       xlvi    some said that when the priest had sprinkled oer     the consecrated drops they seemed to hear   a sigh as of some heart from travail sore     released and then two voices singing clear   misereatur deus more and more     fading far upward and their ghastly fear   fell from them with that sound as bodies fall   from souls upspringing to celestial hall                         prometheus       one after one the stars have risen and set   sparkling upon the hoarfrost on my chain   the bear that prowled all night about the fold   of the northstar hath shrunk into his den   scared by the blithesome footsteps of the dawn   whose blushing smile floods all the orient   and now bright lucifer grows less and less   into the heavens blue quiet deepwithdrawn   sunless and starless all the desert sky   arches above me empty as this heart   for ages hath been empty of all joy   except to brood upon its silent hope   as oer its hope of day the sky doth now   all night have i heard voices deeper yet   the deep low breathing of the silence grew   while all about muffled in awe there stood   shadows or forms or both clearfelt at heart   but when i turned to front them far along   only a shudder through the midnight ran   and the dense stillness walled me closer round   but still i heard them wander up and down   that solitude and flappings of dusk wings   did mingle with them whether of those hags   let slip upon me once from hades deep   or of yet direr torments if such be   i could but guess and then toward me came   a shape as of a woman very pale   it was and calm its cold eyes did not move   and mine moved not but only stared on them   their fixed awe went through my brain like ice   a skeleton hand seemed clutching at my heart   and a sharp chill as if a dank night fog   suddenly closed me in was all i felt   and then methought i heard a freezing sigh   a long deep shivering sigh as from blue lips   stiffening in death close to mine ear i thought   some doom was close upon me and i looked   and saw the red moon through the heavy mist   just setting and it seemed as if it were falling   or reeling to its fall so dim and dead   and palsystruck it looked then all sounds merged   into the rising surges of the pines   which leagues below me clothing the gaunt loins   of ancient caucasus with hairy strength   sent up a murmur in the morning wind   sad as the wail that from the populous earth   all day and night to high olympus soars   fit incense to thy wicked throne o jove      thy hated name is tossed once more in scorn   from off my lips for i will tell thy doom   and are these tears nay do not triumph jove   they are wrung from me but by the agonies   of prophecy like those sparse drops which fall   from clouds in travail of the lightning when   the great wave of the storm highcurled and black   rolls steadily onward to its thunderous break   why art thou made a god of thou poor type   of anger and revenge and cunning force   true power was never born of brutish strength   nor sweet truth suckled at the shaggy dugs   of that old shewolf are thy thunderbolts   that quell the darkness for a space so strong   as the prevailing patience of meek light   who with the invincible tenderness of peace   wins it to be a portion of herself   why art thou made a god of thou who hast   the neversleeping terror at thy heart   that birthright of all tyrants worse to bear   than this thy ravening bird on which i smile   thou swearst to free me if i will unfold   what kind of doom it is whose omen flits   across thy heart as oer a troop of doves   the fearful shadow of the kite what need   to know that truth whose knowledge cannot save   evil its errand hath as well as good   when thine is finished thou art known no more   there is a higher purity than thou   and higher purity is greater strength   thy nature is thy doom at which thy heart   trembles behind the thick wall of thy might   let man but hope and thou art straightway chilled   with thought of that drear silence and deep night   which like a dream shall swallow thee and thine   let man but will and thou art god no more   more capable of ruin than the gold   and ivory that image thee on earth   he who hurled down the monstrous titanbrood   blinded with lightnings with rough thunders stunned   is

precipitous crag that overhangs   the abyss of doom and in that depth to see   as in a glass the features dim and vast   of things to come the shadows as it seems   of what have been death ever fronts the wise   not fearfully but with clear promises   of larger life on whose broad vans upborne   their outlook widens and they see beyond   the horizon of the present and the past   even to the very source and end of things   such am i now immortal woe hath made   my heart a seer and my soul a judge   between the substance and the shadow of truth   the sure supremeness of the beautiful   by all the martyrdoms made doubly sure   of such as i am this is my revenge   which of my wrongs builds a triumphal arch   through which i see a sceptre and a throne   the pipings of glad shepherds on the hills   tending the flocks no more to bleed for thee   the songs of maidens pressing with white feet   the vintage on thine altars poured no more   the murmurous bliss of lovers underneath   dim grapevine bowers whose rosy bunches press   not half so closely their warm cheeks unpaled   by thoughts of thy brute lustthe hivelike hum   of peaceful commonwealths where sunburnt toil   reaps for itself the rich earth made its own   by its own labor lightened with glad hymns   to an omnipotence which thy mad bolts   would cope with as a spark with the vast sea   even the spirit of free love and peace   dutys sure recompense through life and death   these are such harvests as all masterspirits   reap haply not on earth but reap no less   because the sheaves are bound by hands not theirs   these are the bloodless daggers wherewithal   they stab fallen tyrants this their high revenge   for their best part of life on earth is when   long after death prisoned and pent no more   their thoughts their wild dreams even have become   part of the necessary air men breathe   when like the moon herself behind a cloud   they shed down light before us on lifes sea   that cheers us to steer onward still in hope   earth with her twining memories ivies oer   their holy sepulchres the chainless sea   in tempest or wide calm repeats their thoughts   the lightning and the thunder all free things   have legends of them for the ears of men   all other glories are as falling stars   but universal nature watches theirs   such strength is won by love of human kind      not that i feel that hunger after fame   which souls of a halfgreatness are beset with   but that the memory of noble deeds   cries shame upon the idle and the vile   and keeps the heart of man forever up   to the heroic level of old time   to be forgot at first is little pain   to a heart conscious of such high intent   as must be deathless on the lips of men   but having been a name to sink and be   a something which the world can do without   which having been or not would never change   the lightest pulse of fatethis is indeed   a cup of bitterness the worst to taste   and this thy heart shall empty to the dregs   endless despair shall be thy caucasus   and memory thy vulture thou wilt find   oblivion far lonelier than this peak   behold thy destiny thou thinkst it much   that i should brave thee miserable god   but i have braved a mightier than thou   even the tempting of this soaring heart   which might have made me scarcely less than thou   a god among my brethren weak and blind   scarce less than thou a pitiable thing   to be downtrodden into darkness soon   but now i am above thee for thou art   the bungling workmanship of fear the block   that awes the swart barbarian but i   am what myself have madea nature wise   with finding in itself the types of all   with watching from the dim verge of the time   what things to be are visible in the gleams   thrown forward on them from the luminous past   wise with the history of its own frail heart   with reverence and sorrow and with love   broad as the world for freedom and for man      thou and all strength shall crumble except love   by whom and for whose glory ye shall cease   and when thou art but a dim moaning heard   from out the pitiless glooms of chaos i   shall be a power and a memory   a name to fright all tyrants with a light   unsetting as the polestar a great voice   heard in the breathless pauses of the fight   by truth and freedom ever waged with wrong   clear as a silver trumpet to awake   huge echoes that from age to age live on   in kindred spirits giving them a sense   of boundless power from boundless suffering wrung   and many a glazing eye shall smile to see   the memory of my triumph for to meet   wrong with endurance and to overcome   the present with a heart that looks beyond   are triumph like a prophet eagle perch   upon the sacred banner of the right   evil springs up and flowers and bears no seed   and feeds the green earth with its swift decay   leaving it richer for the growth of truth   but good once put in action or in thought   like a strong oak doth from its boughs shed down   the ripe germs of a forest thou weak god   shalt fade and be forgotten but this soul   freshliving still in the serene abyss   in every heaving shall partake that grows   from heart to heart among the sons of men   as the ominous hum before the earthquake runs   far through the Ægean from roused isle to isle   foreboding wreck to palaces and shrines   and mighty rents in many a cavernous error   that darkens the free light to manthis heart   unscarred by thy grim vulture as the truth   grows but more lovely neath the beaks and claws   of harpies blind that fain would soil it shall   in all the throbbing exultations share   that wait on freedoms triumphs and in all   the glorious agonies of martyrspirits   sharp lightningthroes to split the jagged clouds   that veil the future showing them the end   pains thorny crown for constancy and truth   girding the temples like a wreath of stars   this is a thought that like a fabled laurel   makes my faith thunderproof and thy dread bolts   fall on me like the silent flakes of snow   on the hoar brows of aged caucasus   but o thought far more blissful they can rend   this cloud of flesh and make my soul a star      unleash thy crouching thunders now o jove   free this high heart which a poor captive long   doth knock to be let forth this heart which still   in its invincible manhood overtops   thy puny godship as this mountain doth   the pines that moss its roots o even now   while from my peak of suffering i look down   beholding with a farspread gush of hope   the sunrise of that beauty in whose face   shone all around with love no man shall look   but straightway like a god he is uplift   unto the throne long empty for his sake   and clearly oft foreshadowed in wide dreams   by his free inward nature which nor thou   nor any anarch after thee can bind   from working its great doomnow now set free   this essence not to die but to become   part of that awful presence which doth haunt   the palaces of tyrants to hunt off   with its grim eyes and fearful whisperings   and hideous sense of utter loneliness   all hope of safety all desire of peace   all but the loathed forefeeling of blank death   part of that spirit which doth ever brood   in patient calm on the unpilfered nest   of mans deep heart till mighty thoughts grow fledged   to sail with darkening shadow oer the world   filling with dread such souls as dare not trust   in the unfailing energy of good   until they swoop and their pale quarry make   of some oerbloated wrongthat spirit which   scatters great hopes in the seedfield of man   like acorns among grain to grow and be   a roof for freedom in all coming time      but no this cannot be for ages yet   in solitude unbroken shall i hear   the angry caspian to the euxine shout   and euxine answer with a muffled roar   on either side storming the giant walls   of caucasus with leagues of climbing foam   less from my height than flakes of downy snow   that draw back baffled but to hurl again   snatched up in wrath and horrible turmoil   mountain on mountain as the titans erst   my brethren scaling the high seat of jove   heaved pelion upon ossas shoulders broad   in vain emprise the moon will come and go   with her monotonous vicissitude   once beautiful when i was free to walk   among my fellows and to interchange   the influence benign of loving eyes   but now by aged use grown wearisome   false thought most false for how could i endure   these crawling centuries of lonely woe   unshamed by weak complaining but for thee   loneliest save me of all created things   mildeyed astarte my best comforter   with thy pale smile of sad benignity      year after year will pass away and seem   to me in mine eternal agony   but as the shadows of dumb summer clouds   which i have watched so often darkening oer   the vast sarmatian plain leaguewide at first   but with still swiftness lessening on and on   till cloud and shadow meet and mingle where   the gray horizon fades into the sky   far far to the northward yes for ages yet   must i lie here upon my altar huge   a sacrifice for man sorrow will be   as it hath been his portion endless doom   while the immortal with the mortal linked   dreams of its wings and pines for what it dreams   with upward yearn unceasing better so   for wisdom is meek sorrows patient child   and empire over self and all the deep   strong charities that make men seem like gods   and love that makes them be gods from her breasts   sucks in the milk that makes mankind one blood   good never comes unmixed or so it seems   having two faces as some images   are carved of foolish gods one face is ill   but one heart lies beneath and that is good   as are all hearts when we explore their depths   therefore great heart bear up thou art but type   of what all lofty spirits endure that fain   would win men back to strength and peace through love   each hath his lonely peak and on each heart   envy or scorn or hatred tears lifelong   with vulture beak yet the high soul is left   and faith which is but hope grown wise and love   and patience which at last shall overcome      1843                   song

  as the moss is in the sea      thy little heart that hath with love     grown colored like the sky above     on which thou lookest ever       can it know       all the woe   of hope for what returneth never   all the sorrow and the longing   to these hearts of ours belonging        out on it no foolish pining         for the sky         dims thine eye       or for the stars so calmly

thou lookdst on me all yesternight   thine eyes were blue thy hair was bright   as when we murmured our trothplight   beneath the thick stars rosaline   thy hair was braided on thy head   as on the day we two were wed   mine eyes scarce knew if thou wert dead   but my shrunk heart knew rosaline    the deathwatch ticked behind the wall   the blackness rustled like a pall   the moaning wind did rise and fall   among the bleak pines rosaline   my heart beat thickly in mine ears   the lids may shut out fleshly fears   but still the spirit sees and hears   its eyes are lidless rosaline    a wildness rushing suddenly   a knowing some illshape is nigh   a wish for death a fear to die   is not this vengeance rosaline   a loneliness that is not lone   a love quite withered up and gone   a strong soul trampled from its throne   what wouldst thou further rosaline    tis drear such moonless nights as these   strange sounds are out upon the breeze   and the leaves shiver in the trees   and then thou comest rosaline   i seem to hear the mourners go   with long black garments trailing slow   and plumes anodding to and fro   as once i heard them rosaline    thy shroud is all of snowy white   and in the middle of the night   thou standest moveless and upright   gazing upon me rosaline   there is no sorrow in thine eyes   but evermore that meek surprise   o god thy gentle spirit tries   to deem me guiltless rosaline    above thy grave the robin sings   and swarms of bright and happy things   flit all about with sunlit wings   but i am cheerless rosaline   the violets on the hillock toss   the gravestone is oergrown with moss   for nature feels not any loss   but i am cheerless rosaline    i did not know when thou wast dead   a blackbird whistling overhead   thrilled through my brain i would have fled   but dared not leave thee rosaline   the sun rolled down and very soon   like a great fire the awful moon   rose stained with blood and then a swoon   crept chilly oer me rosaline    the stars came out and one by one   each angel from his silver throne   looked down and saw what i had done   i dared not hide me rosaline   i crouched i feared thy corpse would cry   against me to gods quiet sky   i thought i saw the blue lips try   to utter something rosaline    i waited with a maddened grin   to hear that voice all icy thin   slide forth and tell my deadly sin   to hell and heaven rosaline   but no voice came and then it seemed   that if the very corpse had screamed   the sound like sunshine glad had streamed   through that dark stillness rosaline    and then amid the silent night   i screamed with horrible delight   and in my brain an awful light   did seem to crackle rosaline   it is my curse sweet memories fall   from me like snowand only all   of that one night like cold worms crawl   my doomed heart over rosaline    why wilt thou haunt me with thine eyes   wherein such blessed memories   such pitying forgiveness lies   than hate more bitter rosaline   woes me i know that love so high   as thine true soul could never die   and with mean clay in churchyard lie   would it might be so rosaline      1841       the shepherd of king admetus     there came a youth upon the earth     some thousand years ago   whose slender hands were nothing worth   whether to plough or reap or sow    upon an empty tortoiseshell     he stretched some chords and drew   music that made mens bosoms swell   fearless or brimmed their eyes with dew    then king admetus one who had     pure taste by right divine   decreed his singing not too bad   to hear between the cups of wine    and so wellpleased with being soothed     into a sweet halfsleep   three times his kingly beard he smoothed   and made him viceroy oer his sheep    his words were simple words enough     and yet he used them so   that what in other mouths was rough   in his seemed musical and low    men called him but a shiftless youth     in whom no good they saw   and yet unwittingly in truth   they made his careless words their law    they knew not how he learned at all     for idly hour by hour   he sat and watched the dead leaves fall   or mused upon a common flower    it seemed the loveliness of things     did teach him all their use   for in mere weeds and stones and springs   he found a healing power profuse    men granted that his speech was wise     but when a glance they caught   of his slim grace and womans eyes   they laughed and called him goodfornaught    yet after he was dead and gone     and een his memory dim   earth seemed more sweet to live upon

stir my hearts blood far below   its shortlived waves of joy and woe    lips must fade and roses wither     all sweet times be oer   they only smile and murmuring thither     stay with us no more   and yet ofttimes a look or smile   forgotten in a kisss while   years after from the dark will start   and flash across the trembling heart    thou hast given me many roses     but never one like this   oerfloods both sense and spirit     with such a deep wild bliss   we must have instincts that glean up   sparse drops of this life in the cup   whose taste shall give us all that we   can prove of immortality    earths stablest things are shadows     and in the life to come   haply some chancesaved trifle   may tell of this old home   as now sometimes we seem to find   in a dark crevice of the

one   whose heart was made of manly simple stuff      as homespun as their own      and when he read they forward leaned     drinking with thirsty hearts and ears   his brooklike songs whom glory never weaned      from humble smiles and tears      slowly there grew a tender awe     sunlike oer faces brown and hard   as if in him who read they felt and saw      some presence of the bard      it was a sight for sin and wrong     and slavish tyranny to see   a sight to make our faith more pure and strong      in high humanity      i thought these men will carry hence     promptings their former life above   and something of a finer reverence      for beauty truth and love      god scatters love on every side     freely among his children all   and always hearts are lying open wide      wherein some grains may fall      there is no wind but soweth seeds     of a more true and open life   which burst unlookedfor into highsouled deeds      with wayside beauty rife      we find within these souls of ours     some wild germs of a higher birth   which in the poets tropic heart bear flowers      whose fragrance fills the earth      within the hearts of all men lie     these promises of wider bliss   which blossom into hopes that cannot die      in sunny hours like this      all that hath been majestical     in life or death since time began   is native in the simple heart of all      the angel heart of man      and thus among the untaught poor     great deeds and feelings find a home   that cast in shadow all the golden lore      of classic greece and rome      o mighty brothersoul of man     whereer thou art in low or high   thy skiey arches with exulting span      oerroof infinity      all thoughts that mould the age begin     deep down within the primitive soul   and from the many slowly upward win      to one who grasps the whole      in his wide brain the feeling deep     that struggled on the manys tongue   swells to a tide of thought whose surges leap      oer the weak thrones of wrong      all thought begins in feelingwide     in the great mass its base is hid   and narrowing up to thought stands glorified      a moveless pyramid      nor is he far astray who deems     that every hope which rises and grows broad   in the worlds heart by ordered impulse streams      from the great heart of god      god wills man hopes in common souls     hope is but vague and undefined   till from the poets tongue the message rolls      a blessing to his kind      never did poesy appear     so full of heaven to me as when   i saw how it would pierce through pride and fear      to the lives of coarsest men      it may be glorious to write     thoughts that shall glad the two or three   high souls like those far stars that come in sight      once in a century      but better far it is to speak     one simple word which now and then   shall waken their free nature in the weak      and friendless sons of men      to write some earnest verse or line     which seeking not the praise of art   shall make a clearer faith and manhood shine      in the untutored heart      he who doth this in verse or prose     may be forgotten in his day   but surely shall be crowned at last with those      who live and speak for aye      1842                       rhŒcus       god sends his teachers unto every age   to every clime and every race of men   with revelations fitted to their growth   and shape of mind nor gives the realm of truth   into the selfish rule of one sole race   therefore each form of worship that hath swayed   the life of man and given it to grasp   the masterkey of knowledge reverence   enfolds some germs of goodness and of right   else never had the eager soul which loathes   the slothful down of pampered ignorance   found in it even a moments fitful rest      there is an instinct in the human heart   which makes that all the fables it hath coined   to justify the reign of its belief   and strengthen it by beautys right divine   veil in their inner cells a mystic gift   which like the hazel twig in faithful hands   points surely to the hidden springs of truth   for as in nature naught is made in vain   but all things have within their hull of use   a wisdom and a meaning which may speak   of spiritual secrets to the ear   of spirit so in whatsoeer the heart   hath fashioned for a solace to itself   to make its inspirations suit its creed   and from the niggard hands of falsehood wring   its needful food of truth there ever is   a sympathy with nature which reveals   not less than her own works pure gleams of light   and earnest parables of inward lore   hear now this fairy legend of old greece   as full of freedom youth and beauty still   as the immortal freshness of that grace   carved for all ages on some attic frieze      a youth named rhœcus wandering in the wood   saw an old oak just trembling to its fall   and feeling pity of so fair a tree   he propped its gray trunk with admiring care   and with a thoughtless footstep loitered on   but as he turned he heard a voice behind   that murmured rhœcus twas as if the leaves   stirred by a passing breath had murmured it   and while he paused bewildered yet again   it murmured rhœcus softer than a breeze   he started and beheld with dizzy eyes   what seemed the substance of a happy dream   stand there before him spreading a warm glow   within the green glooms of the shadowy oak   it seemed a womans shape yet all too fair   to be a woman and with eyes too meek   for any that were wont to mate with gods   all naked like a goddess stood she there   and like a goddess all too beautiful   to feel the guiltborn earthliness of shame   rhœcus i am the dryad of this tree   thus she began dropping her lowtoned words   serene and full and clear as drops of dew   and with it i am doomed to live and die   the rain and sunshine are my caterers   nor have i other bliss than simple life   now ask me what thou wilt that i can give   and with a thankful joy it shall be thine      then rhœcus with a flutter at the heart   yet by the prompting of such beauty bold   answered what is there that can satisfy   the endless craving of the soul but love   give me thy love or but the hope of that   which must be evermore my spirits goal   after a little pause she said again   but with a glimpse of sadness in her tone   i give it rhœcus though a perilous gift   an hour before the sunset meet me here   and straightway there was nothing he could see   but the green glooms beneath the shadowy oak   and not a sound came to his straining ears   but the low trickling rustle of the leaves   and far away upon an emerald slope   the falter of an idle shepherds pipe      now in those days of simpleness and faith   men did not think that happy things were dreams   because they overstepped the narrow bourne   of likelihood but reverently deemed   nothing too wondrous or too beautiful   to be the guerdon of a daring heart   so rhœcus made no doubt that he was blest   and all along unto the citys gate   earth seemed to spring beneath him as he walked   the clear broad sky looked bluer than its wont   and he could scarce believe he had not wings   such sunshine seemed to glitter through his veins   instead of blood so light he felt and strange      young rhœcus had a faithful heart enough   but one that in the present dwelt too much   and taking with blithe welcome whatsoeer   chance gave of joy was wholly bound in that   like the contented peasant of a vale   deemed it the world and never looked beyond   so haply meeting in the afternoon   some comrades who were playing at the dice   he joined them and forgot all else beside      the dice were rattling at the merriest   and rhœcus who had met but sorry luck   just laughed in triumph at a happy throw   when through the room there hummed a yellow bee   that buzzed about his ear with downdropped legs   as if to light and rhœcus laughed and said   feeling how red and flushed he was with loss   by venus does he take me for a rose   and brushed him off with rough impatient hand   but still the bee came back and thrice again   rhœcus did beat him off with growing wrath   then through the window flew the wounded bee   and rhœcus tracking him with angry eyes   saw a sharp mountainpeak of thessaly   against the red disc of the setting sun   and instantly the blood sank from his heart   as if its very walls had caved away   without a word he turned and rushing forth   ran madly through the city and the gate   and oer the plain which now the woods long shade   by the low sun thrown forward broad and dim   darkened wellnigh unto the citys wall      quite spent and out of breath he reached the tree   and listening fearfully he heard once more   the low voice murmur rhœcus close at hand   whereat he looked around him but could see   naught but the deepening glooms beneath the oak   then sighed the voice oh rhœcus nevermore   shalt thou behold me or by day or night   me who would fain have blessed thee with a love   more ripe and bounteous than ever yet   filled up with nectar any mortal heart   but thou didst scorn my humble messenger   and sentst him back to me with bruisèd wings   we spirits only show to gentle eyes   we ever ask an undivided love   and he who scorns the least of natures works   is thenceforth exiled and shut out from all   farewell for thou canst never see me more      then rhœcus beat his breast and groaned aloud   and cried be pitiful forgive me yet   this once and i shall never need it more   alas the voice returned t is thou art blind   not i unmerciful i can forgive   but have no skill to heal thy spirits eyes   only the soul hath power oer itself   with that again there murmured nevermore   and rhœcus after heard no other sound   except the rattling of the oaks crisp leaves   like the long surf upon a distant shore   raking the seaworn pebbles up and down   the night had gathered round him oer the plain   the city sparkled with its thousand lights   and sounds of revel fell upon his ear   harshly and like a curse above the sky   with all its bright sublimity of stars   deepened and on his forehead smote the breeze   beauty was all around him and delight   but from that eve he was alone on earth                   the falcon     i know a falcon swift and peerless     as eer was cradled in the pine   no bird had ever eye so fearless     or wings so strong as this of mine    the winds not better love to pilot     a cloud with molten gold oerrun   than him a little burning islet     a star above the coming sun    for with a larks heart he doth tower     by a glorious upward instinct drawn   no bee nestles deeper in the flower     than he in the bursting rose of dawn    no harmless dove no bird that singeth     shudders to see him overhead   the rush of his fierce swooping bringeth     to innocent hearts no thrill of dread    let fraud and wrong and baseness shiver     for still between them and the sky   the falcon truth hangs poised forever     and marks them with his vengeful eye                       trial                       i    whether the idle prisoner through his grate   watches the waving of the grasstuft small   which having colonized its rift i the wall   takes its free risk of good or evil fate   and from the skys just helmet draws its lot   daily of

  and yet so gently kind   thou seemedst but to body     a breath of summer wind    into the eternal shadow     that girds our life around   into the infinite silence     wherewith deaths shore is bound   thou hast gone forth belovèd     and i were mean to weep   that thou hast left lifes shallows     and dost possess the deep    thou liest low and silent     thy heart is cold and still   thine eyes are shut forever     and death hath had his will   he loved and would have taken     i loved and would have kept   we stroveand he was stronger     and i have never wept    let him possess thy body     thy soul is still with me   more sunny and more gladsome     than it was wont to be   thy body was a fetter     that bound me to the flesh   thank god that it is broken     and now i live afresh    now i can see thee clearly     the dusky cloud of clay   that hid thy starry spirit     is rent and blown away   to earth i give thy body     thy spirit to the sky   i saw its bright wings growing     and knew that thou must fly    now i can love thee truly     for nothing comes between   the senses and the spirit     the seen and the unseen   lifts the eternal shadow     the silence bursts apart   and the souls boundless future     is present in my heart                 a parable     worn and footsore was the prophet     when he gained the holy hill   god has left the earth he murmured    here his presence lingers still    god of all the olden prophets     wilt thou speak with men no more   have i not as truly served thee     as thy chosen ones of yore    hear me guider of my fathers     lo a humble heart is mine   by thy mercy i beseech thee     grant thy servant but a sign    bowing then his head he listened     for an answer to his prayer   no loud burst of thunder followed     not a murmur stirred the air    but the tuft of moss before him     opened while he waited yet   and from out the rocks hard bosom     sprang a tender violet    god i thank thee said the prophet    hard of heart and blind was i   looking to the holy mountain     for the gift of prophecy    still thou speakest with thy children     freely as in eld sublime   humbleness and love and patience     still give empire over time    had i trusted in my nature     and had faith in lowly things   thou thyself wouldst then have sought me     and set free my spirits wings    but i looked for signs and wonders     that oer men should give me sway   thirsting to be more than mortal     i was even less than clay    ere i entered on my journey     as i girt my loins to start   ran to me my little daughter     the beloved of my heart    in her hand she held a flower     like to this as like may be   which beside my very threshold     she had plucked and brought to me      1842           a glance behind the curtain       we see but half the causes of our deeds   seeking them wholly in the outer life   and heedless of the encircling spiritworld   which though unseen is felt and sows in us   all germs of pure and worldwide purposes   from one stage of our being to the next   we pass unconscious oer a slender bridge   the momentary work of unseen hands   which crumbles down behind us looking back   we see the other shore the gulf between   and marvelling how we won to where we stand   content ourselves to call the builder chance   we trace the wisdom to the apples fall   not to the birththroes of a mighty truth   which for long ages in blank chaos dumb   yet yearned to be incarnate and had found   at last a spirit meet to be the womb   from which it might be born to bless mankind   not to the soul of newton ripe with all   the hoarded thoughtfulness of earnest years   and waiting but one ray of sunlight more   to blossom fully                     but whence came that ray   we call our sorrows destiny but ought   rather to name our high successes so   only the instincts of great souls are fate   and have predestined sway all other things   except by leave of us could never be   for destiny is but the breath of god   still moving in us the last fragment left   of our unfallen nature waking oft   within our thought to beckon us beyond   the narrow circle of the seen and known   and always tending to a noble end   as all things must that overrule the soul   and for a space unseat the helmsman will   the fate of england and of freedom once   seemed wavering in the heart of one plain man   one step of his and the great dialhand   that marks the destined progress of the world   in the eternal round from wisdom on   to higher wisdom had been made to pause   a hundred years that step he did not take   he knew not why nor we but only god   and lived to make his simple oaken chair   more terrible and grandly beautiful   more full of majesty than any throne   before or after of a british king      upon the pier stood two sternvisaged men   looking to where a little craft lay moored   swayed by the lazy current of the thames   which weltered by in muddy listlessness   grave men they were and battlings of fierce thought   had trampled out all softness from their brows   and ploughed rough furrows there before their time   for another crop than such as homebred peace   sows broadcast in the willing soil of youth   care not of self but of the commonweal   had robbed their eyes of youth and left instead   a look of patient power and iron will   and something fiercer too that gave broad hint   of the plain weapons girded at their sides   the younger had an aspect of command   not such as trickles down a slender stream   in the shrunk channel of a great descent   but such as lies entowered in heart and head   and an arm prompt to do the hests of both   his was a brow where gold were out of place   and yet it seemed right worthy of a crown   though he despised such were it only made   of iron or some serviceable stuff   that would have matched his sinewy brown face   the elder although he hardly seemed   care makes so little of some five short years   had a clear honest face whose roughhewn strength   was mildened by the scholars wiser heart   to sober courage such as best befits   the unsullied temper of a welltaught mind   yet so remained that one could plainly guess   the hushed volcano smouldering underneath   he spoke the other hearing kept his gaze   still fixed as on some problem in the sky      o cromwell we are fallen on evil times   there was a day when england had wide room   for honest men as well as foolish kings   but now the uneasy stomach of the time   turns squeamish at them both therefore let us   seek out that savage clime where men as yet   are free there sleeps the vessel on the tide   her languid canvas drooping for the wind   give us but that and what need we to fear   this order of the council the free waves   will not say no to please a wayward king   nor will the winds turn traitors at his beck   all things are fitly cared for and the lord   will watch as kindly oer the exodus   of us his servants now as in old time   we have no cloud or fire and haply we   may not pass dryshod through the oceanstream   but saved or lost all things are in his hand   so spake he and meantime the other stood   with wide gray eyes still reading the blank air   as if upon the skys blue wall he saw   some mystic sentence written by a hand   such as of old made pale the assyrian king   girt with his satraps in the blazing feast      hampden a moment since my purpose was   to fly with theefor i will call it flight   nor flatter it with any smoother name   but something in me bids me not to go   and i am one thou knowest who unmoved   by what the weak deem omens yet give heed   and reverence due to whatsoeer my soul   whispers of warning to the inner ear   moreover as i know that god brings round   his purposes in ways undreamed by us   and makes the wicked but his instruments   to hasten on their swift and sudden fall   i see the beauty of his providence   in the kings order blind he will not let   his doom part from him but must bid it stay   as t were a cricket whose enlivening chirp   he loved to hear beneath his very hearth   why should we fly nay why not rather stay   and rear again our zions crumbled walls   not as of old the walls of thebes were built   by minstrel twanging but if need should be   with the more potent music of our swords   thinkst thou that score of men beyond the sea   claim more gods care than all of england here   no when he moves his arm it is to aid   whole peoples heedless if a few be crushed   as some are ever when the destiny   of man takes one stride onward nearer home   believe it tis the mass of men he loves   and where there is most sorrow and most want   where the high heart of man is trodden down   the most tis not because he hides his face   from them in wrath as purblind teachers prate   not so there most is he for there is he   most needed men who seek for fate abroad   are not so near his heart as they who dare   frankly to face her where she faces them   on their own threshold where their souls are strong   to grapple with and throw her as i once   being yet a boy did cast this puny king   who now has grown so dotard as to deem   that he can wrestle with an angry realm   and throw the brawned antæus of mens rights   no hampden they have halfway conquered fate   who go halfway to meet heras will i   freedom hath yet a work for me to do   so speaks that inward voice which never yet   spake falsely when it urged the spirit on   to noble deeds for country and mankind   and for success i ask no more than this   to bear unflinching witness to the truth   all true whole men succeed for what is worth   successs name unless it be the thought   the inward surety to have carried out   a noble purpose to a noble end   although it be the gallows or the block   tis only falsehood that doth ever need   these outward shows of gain to bolster her   be it we prove the weaker with our swords   truth only needs to be for once spoke out   and theres such music in her such strange rhythm   as makes mens memories her joyous slaves   and clings around the soul as the sky clings   round the mute earth forever beautiful   and if oerclouded only to burst forth   more allembracingly divine and clear   get but the truth once uttered and tis like   a star newborn that drops into its place   and which once circling in its placid round   not all the tumult of the earth can shake      what should we do in that small colony   of pinched fanatics who would rather choose   freedom to clip an inch more from their hair   than the great chance of setting england free   not there amid the stormy wilderness   should we learn wisdom or if learned what room   to put it into actelse worse than naught   we learn our souls more tossing for an hour   upon this huge and evervexèd sea   of human thought where kingdoms go to wreck   like fragile bubbles yonder in the stream   than in a cycle of new england sloth   broke only by some petty indian war   or quarrel for a letter more or less   in some hard word which spelt in either way   not their most learned clerks can understand   new times demand new measures and new men   the world advances and in time outgrows   the laws that in our fathers day were best   and doubtless after us some purer scheme   will be shaped out by wiser men than we   made wiser by the steady growth of truth   we cannot bring utopia by force   but better almost be at work in sin   than in a brute inaction browse and sleep   no man is born into the world whose work   is not born with him there is always work   and tools to work withal for those who will   and blessèd are the horny hands of toil   the busy world shoves angrily aside   the man who stands with arms akimbo set   until occasion tells him what to do   and he who waits to have his task marked out   shall die and leave his errand unfulfilled   our time is one that calls for earnest deeds   reason and government like two broad seas   yearn for each other with outstretched arms   across this narrow isthmus of the throne   and roll their white surf higher every day   one age moves onward and the next builds up   cities and gorgeous palaces where stood   the rude log huts of those who tamed the wild   rearing from out the forests they had felled   the goodly framework of a fairer state   the builders trowel and the settlers axe   are seldom wielded by the selfsame hand   ours is the harder task yet not the less   shall we receive the blessing for our toil   from the choice spirits of the aftertime   my soul is not a palace of the past   where outworn creeds like romes gray senate quake   hearing afar the vandals trumpet hoarse   that shakes old systems with a thunderfit   the time is ripe and rottenripe for change   then let it come i have no dread of what   is called for by the instinct of mankind   nor think i that gods world will fall apart   because we tear a parchment more or less   truth is eternal but her effluence   with endless change is fitted to the hour   her mirror is turned forward to reflect   the promise of the future not the past   he who would win the name of truly great   must understand his own age and the next   and make the present ready to fulfil   its prophecy and with the future merge   gently and peacefully as wave with wave   the future works out great mens destinies   the present is enough for common souls   who never looking forward are indeed   mere clay wherein the footprints of their age   are petrified forever better those   who lead the blind old giant by the hand   from out the pathless desert where he gropes   and set him onward in his darksome way   i do not fear to follow out the truth   albeit along the precipices edge   let us speak plain there is more force in names   than most men dream of and a lie may keep   its throne a whole age longer if it skulk   behind the shield of some fairseeming name   let us call tyrants tyrants and maintain   that only freedom comes by grace of god   and all that comes not by his grace must fall   for men in earnest have no time to waste   in patching figleaves for the naked truth      i will have one more grapple with the man   charles stuart whom the boy oercame   the man stands not in awe of i perchance   am one raised up by the almighty arm   to witness some great truth to all the world   souls destined to oerleap the vulgar lot   and mould the world unto the scheme of god   have a foreconsciousness of their high doom   as men are known to shiver at the heart   when the cold shadow of some coming ill   creeps slowly oer their spirits unawares   hath good less power of prophecy than ill   how else could men whom god hath called to sway   earths rudder and to steer the bark of truth   beating against the tempest towrd her port   bear all the mean and buzzing grievances   the petty martyrdoms wherewith sin strives   to weary out the tethered hope of faith   the sneers the unrecognizing look of friends   who worship the dead corpse of old king custom   where it doth lie in state within the church   striving to cover up the mighty ocean   with a mans palm and making even the truth   lie for them holding up the glass reversed   to make the hope of man seem farther off   my god when i read oer the bitter lives   of men whose eager hearts were quite too great   to beat beneath the cramped mode of the day   and see them mocked at by the world they love   haggling with prejudice for pennyworths   of that reform which their hard toil will make   the common birthright of the age to come   when i see this spite of my faith in god   i marvel how their hearts bear up so long   nor could they but for this same prophecy   this inward feeling of the glorious end      deem me not fond but in my warmer youth   ere my hearts bloom was soiled and brushed away   i had great dreams of mighty things to come   of conquest whether by the sword or pen   i knew not but some conquest i would have   or else swift death now wiser grown in years   i find youths dreams are but the flutterings   of those strong wings whereon the soul shall soar   in aftertime to win a starry throne   and so i cherish them for they were lots   which i a boy cast in the helm of fate   now will i draw them since a mans right hand   a right hand guided by an earnest soul   with a true instinct takes the golden prize   from out a thousand blanks what men call luck   is the prerogative of valiant souls   the fealty life pays its rightful kings   the helm is shaking now and i will stay   to pluck my lot forth it were sin to flee      so they two turned together one to die   fighting for freedom on the bloody field   the other far more happy to become   a name earth wears

algic researches of henry r      schoolcraft esq       the old chief feeling now wellnigh his end   called his two eldest children to his side   and gave them in few words his parting charge   my son and daughter me ye see no more   the happy huntinggrounds await me green   with change of spring and summer through the year   but for remembrance after i am gone   be kind to little sheemah for my sake   weakling he is and young and knows not yet   to set the trap or draw the seasoned bow   therefore of both your loves he hath more need   and he who needeth love to love hath right   it is not like our furs and stores of corn   whereto we claim sole title by our toil   but the great spirit plants it in our hearts   and waters it and gives it sun to be   the common stock and heritage of all   therefore be kind to sheemah that yourselves   may not be left deserted in your need      alone beside a lake their wigwam stood   far from the other dwellings of their tribe   and after many moons the loneliness   wearied the elder brother and he said   why should i dwell here all alone shut out   from the free natural joys that fit my age   lo i am tall and strong well skilled to hunt   patient of toil and hunger and not yet   have seen the danger which i dared not look   full in the face what hinders me to be   a mighty brave and chief among my kin   so taking up his arrows and his bow   as if to hunt he journeyed swiftly on   until he gained the wigwams of his tribe   where choosing out a bride he soon forgot   in all the fret and bustle of new life   the little sheemah and his fathers charge      now when the sister found her brother gone   and that for many days he came not back   she wept for sheemah more than for herself   for love bides longest in a womans heart   and flutters many times before he flies   and then doth perch so nearly that a word   may lure him back as swift and glad as light   and duty lingers even when love is gone   oft looking out in hope of his return   and after duty hath been driven forth   then selfishness creeps in the last of all   warming her lean hands at the lonely hearth   and crouching oer the embers to shut out   whatever paltry warmth and light are left   with avaricious greed from all beside   so for long months the sister hunted wide   and cared for little sheemah tenderly   but daily more and more the loneliness   grew wearisome and to herself she sighed   am i not fair at least the glassy pool   that hath no cause to flatter tells me so   but o how flat and meaningless the tale   unless it tremble on a lovers tongue   beauty hath no true glass except it be   in the sweet privacy of loving eyes   thus deemed she idly and forgot the lore   which she had learned of nature and the woods   that beautys chief reward is to itself   and that the eyes of love reflect alone   the inward fairness which is blurred and lost   unless kept clear and white by dutys care   so she went forth and sought the haunts of men   and being wedded in her household cares   soon like the elder brother quite forgot   the little sheemah and her fathers charge      but sheemah left alone within the lodge   waited and waited with a shrinking heart   thinking each rustle was his sisters step   till hope grew less and less and then went out   and every sound was changed from hope to fear   few sounds there werethe dropping of a nut   the squirrels chirrup and the jays harsh scream   autumns sad remnants of blithe summers cheer   heard at long intervals seemed but to make   the dreadful void of silence silenter   soon what small store his sister left was gone   and through the autumn he made shift to live   on roots and berries gathered in much fear   of wolves whose ghastly howl he heard ofttimes   hollow and hungry at the dead of night   but winter came at last and when the snow   thickheaped for gleaming leagues oer hill and plain   spread its unbroken silence over all   made bold by hunger he was fain to glean   more sick at heart than ruth and all alone   after the harvest of the merciless wolf   grim boaz who sharpribbed and gaunt yet feared   a thing more wild and starving than himself   till by degrees the wolf and he grew friends   and shared together all the winter through      late in the spring when all the ice was gone   the elder brother fishing in the lake   upon whose edge his fathers wigwam stood   heard a low moaning noise upon the shore   half like a child it seemed half like a wolf   and straightway there was something in his heart   that said it is thy brother sheemahs voice   so paddling swiftly to the bank he saw   within a little thicket close at hand   a child that seemed fast changing to a wolf   from the neck downward gray with shaggy hair   that still crept on and upward as he looked   the face was turned away but well he knew   that it was sheemahs even his brothers face   then with his trembling hands he hid his eyes   and bowed his head so that he might not see   the first look of his brothers eyes and cried   o sheemah o my brother speak to me   dost thou not know me that i am thy brother   come to me little sheemah thou shalt dwell   with me henceforth and know no care or want   sheemah was silent for a space as if   t were hard to summon up a human voice   and when he spake the sound was of a wolfs   i know thee not nor art thou what thou sayst   i have none other brethren than the wolves   and till thy heart be changed from what it is   thou art not worthy to be called their kin   then groaned the other with a choking tongue   alas my heart is changed right bitterly   tis shrunk and parched within me even now   and looking upward fearfully he saw   only a wolf that shrank away and ran   ugly and fierce to hide among the woods           stanzas on freedom     men whose boast it is that ye   come of fathers brave and free   if there breathe on earth a slave   are ye truly free and brave   if ye do not feel the chain

scholars lamp and heard mens steps   in the far hurry of the outward world   pass dimly forth and back sounds heard in dream   as ganymede by the eagle was snatched up   from the gross sod to be joves cupbearer   so was i lifted by my great design   and who hath trod olympus from his eye   fades not that broader outlook of the gods   his lifes low valleys overbrow earths clouds   and that olympian spectre of the past   looms towering up in sovereign memory   beckoning his soul from meaner heights of doom   had but the shadow of the thunderers bird   flashing athwart my spirit made of me   a swiftbetraying visions ganymede   yet to have greatly dreamed precludes low ends   great days have ever such a morningred   on such a base great futures are built up   and aspiration though not put in act   comes back to ask its plighted troth again   still watches round its grave the unlaid ghost   of a dead virtue and makes other hopes   save that implacable one seem thin and bleak   as shadows of bare trees upon the snow   bound freezing there by the unpitying moon    while other youths perplexed their mandolins   praying that thetis would her fingers twine   in the loose glories of her lovers hair   and wile another kiss to keep back day   i stretched beneath the manycenturied shade   of some writhed oak the woods laocoön   did of my hope a dryad mistress make   whom i would woo to meet me privily   or underneath the stars or when the moon   flecked all the forest floor with scattered pearls   o days whose memory tames to fawning down   the surly fell of oceans bristled neck    i know not when this hope enthralled me first   but from my boyhood up i loved to hear   the tallpineforests of the apennine   murmur their hoary legends of the sea   which hearing i in vision clear beheld   the sudden dark of tropic night shut down   oer the huge whisper of great watery wastes   the while a pair of herons trailingly   flapped inland where some leaguewide river hurled   the yellow spoil of unconjectured realms   far through a gulfs green silence never scarred   by any but the northwinds hurrying keels   and not the pines alone all sights and sounds   to my worldseeking heart paid fealty   and catered for it as the cretan bees   brought honey to the baby jupiter   who in his soft hand crushed a violet   godlike foremusing the rough thunders gripe   then did i entertain the poets song   my great ideas guest and passing oer   that iron bridge the tuscan built to hell   i heard ulysses tell of mountainchains   whose adamantine links his manacles   the western main shook growling and still gnawed   i brooded on the wise athenians tale   of happy atlantis and heard björnes keel   crunch the gray pebbles of the vinland shore   for i believed the poets it is they   who utter wisdom from the central deep   and listening to the inner flow of things   speak to the age out of eternity    ah me old hermits sought for solitude   in caves and desert places of the earth   where their own heartbeat was the only stir   of living thing that comforted the year   but the bald pillartop of simeon   in midnights blankest waste were populous   matched with the isolation drear and deep   of him who pines among the swarm of men   at once a new thoughts king and prisoner   feeling the truer life within his life   the fountain of his spirits prophecy   sinking away and wasting drop by drop   in the ungrateful sands of sceptic ears   he in the palaceaisles of untrod woods   doth walk a king for him the pentup cell   widens beyond the circles of the stars   and all the sceptred spirits of the past   come thronging in to greet him as their peer   but in the marketplaces glare and throng   he sits apart an exile and his brow   aches with the mocking memory of its crown   but to the spirit select there is no choice   he cannot say this will i do or that   for the cheap means putting heavens ends in pawn   and bartering his bleak rocks the freehold stern   of destinys firstborn for smoother fields   that yield no crop of selfdenying will   a hand is stretched to him from out the dark   which grasping without question he is led   where there is work that he must do for god   the trial still is the strengths complement   and the uncertain dizzy path that scales   the sheer heights of supremest purposes   is steeper to the angel than the child   chances have laws as fixed as planets have   and disappointments dry and bitter root   envys harsh berries and the choking pool   of the worlds scorn are the right mothermilk   to the tough hearts that pioneer their kind   and break a pathway to those unknown realms   that in the earths broad shadow lie enthralled   endurance is the crowning quality   and patience all the passion of great hearts   these are their stay and when the leaden world   sets its hard face against their fateful thought   and brute strength like a scornful conqueror   clangs his huge mace down in the other scale   the inspired soul but flings his patience in   and slowly that outweighs the ponderous globe   one faith against a whole earths unbelief   one soul against the flesh of all mankind    thus ever seems it when my soul can hear   the voice that errs not then my triumph gleams   oer the blank ocean beckoning and all night   my heart flies on before me as i sail   far on i see my lifelong enterprise   which rose like ganges mid the freezing snows   of a worlds sordidness sweep broadening down   and gathering to itself a thousand streams   grow sacred ere it mingle with the sea   i see the ungated wall of chaos old   with blocks cyclopean hewn of solid night   fade like a wreath of unreturning mist   before the irreversible feet of light   and lo with what clear omen in the east   on days gray threshold stands the eager dawn   like young leander rosy from the sea   glowing at heros lattice                               one day more   these muttering shoalbrains leave the helm to me   god let me not in their dull ooze be stranded   let not this one frail bark to hollow which   i have dug out the pith and sinewy heart   of my aspiring lifes fair trunk be so   cast up to warp and blacken in the sun   just as the opposing wind gins whistle off   his cheekswollen mates and from the leaning mast   fortunes full sail strains forward                                      one

incident of the fire at hamburg     the tower of old saint nicholas soared upward to the skies   like some huge piece of natures make the growth of centuries   you could not deem its crowding spires a work of human art   they seemed to struggle lightward from a sturdy living heart    not natures self more freely speaks in crystal or in oak   than through the pious builders hand in that gray pile she spoke   and as from acorn springs the oak so freely and alone   sprang from his heart this hymn to god sung in obedient stone    it seemed a wondrous freak of chance so perfect yet so rough   a whim of nature crystallized slowly in granite tough   the thick spires yearned towards the sky in quaint harmonious lines   and in broad sunlight basked and slept like a grove of blasted pines    never did rock or stream or tree lay claim with better right   to all the adorning sympathies of shadow and of light   and in that forest petrified as forester there dwells   stout herman the old sacristan sole lord of all its bells    surge leaping after surge the fire roared onward red as blood   till half of hamburg lay engulfed beneath the eddying flood   for miles away the fiery spray poured down its deadly rain   and back and forth the billows sucked and paused and burst again    from square to square with tiger leaps panted the lustful fire   the air to leeward shuddered with the gasps of its desire   and church and palace which even now stood whelmed but to the knee   lift their black roofs like breakers lone amid the whirling sea    up in his tower old herman sat and watched with quiet look   his soul had trusted god too long to be at last forsook   he could not fear for surely god a pathway would unfold   through this red sea for faithful hearts as once he did of old    but scarcely can he cross himself or on his good saint call   before the sacrilegious flood oerleaped the churchyard wall   and ere a pater half was said mid smoke and crackling glare   his island tower scarce juts its head above the wide despair    upon the perils desperate peak his heart stood up sublime   his first thought was for god above his next was for his chime   sing now and make your voices heard in hymns of praise cried he   as did the israelites of old safe walking through the sea    through this red sea our god hath made the pathway safe to shore   our promised land stands full in sight shout now as neer before   and as the tower came crushing down the bells in clear accord   pealed forth the grand old german hymnall good souls praise the     lord                 the sower     i saw a sower walking slow     across the earth from east to west   his hair was white as mountain snow     his head drooped forward on his breast    with shrivelled hands he flung his seed     nor ever turned to look behind   of sight or sound he took no heed     it seemed he was both deaf and blind    his dim face showed no soul beneath     yet in my heart i felt a stir   as if i looked upon the sheath     that once had clasped excalibur    i heard as still the seed he cast     how crooning to himself he sung   i sow again the holy past     the happy days when i was young    then all was wheat without a tare     then all was righteous fair and true   and i am he whose thoughtful care     shall plant the old world in the new    the fruitful germs i scatter free     with busy hand while all men sleep   in europe now from sea to sea     the nations bless me as they reap    then i looked back along his path     and heard the clash of steel on steel   where man faced man in deadly wrath     while clanged the tocsins hurrying peal    the sky with burning towns flared red     nearer the noise of fighting rolled   and brothers blood by brothers shed     crept curdling over pavements cold    then marked i how each germ of truth     which through the dotards fingers ran   was mated with a dragons tooth     whence there sprang up an armed man    i shouted but he could not hear     made signs but these he could not see   and still without a doubt or fear     broadcast he scattered anarchy    long to my straining ears the blast     brought faintly back the words he sung   i sow

influence fleet   that bowed my heart like barley bending      as in bare fields the searching bees   pilot to blooms beyond our finding     it led me on by sweet degrees   joys simple honeycells unbinding      those graces were that seemed grim fates   with nearer love the sky leaned oer me     the longsought secrets golden gates   on musical hinges swung before me      i saw the brimmed bowl in her grasp   thrilling with godhood like a lover     i sprang the proffered life to clasp   the beaker fell the luck was over      the earth has drunk the vintage up   what boots it patch the goblets splinters     can summer fill the icy cup   whose treacherous crystal is but winters      o spendthrift haste await the gods   their nectar crowns the lips of patience     haste scatters on

of honor                     the search           i went to seek for christ         and nature seemed so fair   that first the woods and fields my youth enticed       and i was sure to find him there         the temple i forsook         and to the solitude   allegiance paid but winter came and shook       the crown and purple from my wood   his snows like desert sands with scornful drift     besieged the columned aisle and palacegate   my thebes cut deep with many a solemn rift     but epitaphed her own sepulchred state   then i remembered whom i went to seek   and blessed blunt winter for his counsel bleak          back to the world i turned         for christ i said is king   so the cramped alley and the hut i spurned       as far beneath his sojourning         mid power and wealth i sought         but found no trace of him   and all the costly offerings i had brought       with sudden rust and mould grew dim   i found his tomb indeed where by their laws     all must on stated days themselves imprison   mocking with bread a dead creeds grinning jaws     witless how long the life had thence arisen   due sacrifice to this they set apart   prizing it more than christs own living heart          so from my feet the dust         of the proud world i shook   then came dear love and shared with me his crust      and half my sorrows burden took         after the worlds soft bed         its rich and dainty fare   like down seemed loves coarse pillow to my head       his cheap food seemed as manna rare   freshtrodden prints of bare and bleeding feet     turned to the heedless city whence i came   hard by i saw and springs of worship sweet     gushed from my cleft heart smitten by the same   love looked me in the face and spake no words   but straight i knew those footprints were the lords          i followed where they led         and in a hovel rude   with naught to fence the weather from his head       the king i sought for meekly stood         a naked hungry child         clung round his gracious knee   and a poor hunted slave looked up and smiled       to bless the smile that set him free   new miracles i saw his presence do     no more i knew the hovel bare and poor   the gathered chips into a woodpile grew     the broken morsel swelled to goodly store   i knelt and wept my christ no more i seek   his throne is with the outcast and the weak                             the present crisis     when a deed is done for freedom through the broad earths aching breast   runs a thrill of joy prophetic trembling on from east to west   and the slave whereer he cowers feels the soul within him climb   to the awful verge of manhood as the energy sublime   of a century bursts fullblossomed on the thorny stem of time    through the walls of hut and

year puts on     when falling leaves falter through motionless air      or numbly cling and shiver to be gone     how shimmer the low flats and pastures bare      as with her nectar hebe autumn fills      the bowl between me and those distant hills   and smiles and shakes abroad her misty tremulous hair       no more the landscape holds its wealth apart     making me poorer in my poverty      but mingles with my senses and my heart     my own projected spirit seems to me      in her own reverie the world to steep      tis she that waves to sympathetic sleep   moving as she is moved each field and hill and tree       how fuse and mix with what unfelt degrees     clasped by the faint horizons languid arms      each into each the hazy distances     the softened season all the landscape charms      those hills my native village that embay      in waves of dreamier purple roll away   and floating in mirage seem all the glimmering farms       far distant sounds the hidden chickadee     close at my side far distant sound the leaves      the fields seem fields of dream where memory     wanders like gleaning ruth and as the sheaves      of wheat and barley wavered in the eye      of boaz as the maidens glow went by   so tremble and seem remote all things the sense receives       the cocks shrill trump that tells of scattered corn     passed breezily on by all his flapping mates

with downward eye and ear      then drops his nut and with a chipping bound      whisks to his winding fastness underground   the clouds like swans drift down the streaming atmosphere       oer yon bare knoll the pointed cedar shadows     drowse on the crisp gray moss the ploughmans call      creeps faint as smoke from black freshfurrowed meadows     the single crow a single caw lets fall      and all around me every bush and tree      says autumn s here and winter soon will be   who snows his soft white sleep and silence over all       the birch most shy and ladylike of trees     her poverty as best she may retrieves      and hints at her foregone gentilities     with some saved relics of her wealth of leaves      the swampoak with his royal purple on      glares red as blood across the sinking sun   as one who proudlier to a falling fortune cleaves       he looks a sachem in red blanket wrapt     who mid some council of the sadgarbed whites      erect and stern in his own

undwindled rights       the redoak softergrained yields all for lost     and with his crumpled foliage stiff and dry      after the first betrayal of the frost     rebuffs the kiss of the relenting

and sadly breaking not the general hush      the mapleswamps glow like a sunset sea     each leaf a ripple with its separate flush      all round the woods edge creeps the skirting blaze      of bushes low as when on cloudy days   ere the rain falls the cautious farmer burns his brush       oer yon low wall which guards one unkempt zone     where vines and weeds and scruboaks intertwine      safe from the plough whose rough discordant stone     is massed to one soft gray by lichens fine      the tangled blackberry crossed and recrossed weaves      a prickly network of ensanguined leaves   hard by with coral beads the prim blackalders shine       pillaring with flame this crumbling boundary     whose loose blocks topple neath the ploughboys foot      who with each sense shut fast except

stands mute       below the charlesa stripe of nether sky     now hid by rounded appletrees between      whose gaps the misplaced sail sweeps bellying by     now flickering golden through a woodland screen      then spreading out at his next turn beyond      a silver circle like an inland pond   slips seaward silently through marshes purple and green       dear marshes vain to him the gift of sight     who cannot in their various incomes share      from every season drawn of shade and light     who sees in them but levels brown and bare      each change of storm or sunshine scatters free      on them its largesse of variety   for nature with cheap means still works her wonders rare       in spring they lie one broad expanse of green     oer which the light winds run with glimmering feet      here yellower stripes track out the creek unseen     there darker growths oer hidden ditches meet      and purpler stains show where the blossoms crowd      as if the silent shadow of a cloud   hung there becalmed with the next breath to fleet       all round upon the rivers slippery edge     witching to deeper calm the drowsy tide      whispers and leans the breezeentangling sedge     through emerald glooms the lingering waters slide      or sometimes wavering throw back the sun      and the stiff banks in eddies melt and run   of dimpling light and with the current seem to glide       in summer tis a blithesome sight to see     as step by step with measured swing they pass      the wideranked mowers wading to the knee     their sharp scythes panting through the thickset grass      then stretched beneath a ricks shade in a ring      their nooning take while one begins to sing   a stave that droops and dies neath the close sky of brass       meanwhile the devilmaycare the bobolink     remembering duty in midquaver stops      just ere he sweeps oer raptures tremulous brink     and twixt the winrows most demurely drops      a decorous bird of business who provides      for his brown mate and fledglings six besides   and looks from right to left a farmer mid his crops       another change subdues them in the fall     but saddens not they still show merrier tints      though sober russet seems to cover all     when the first sunshine through their dewdrops glints      look how the yellow clearness streamed across      redeems with rarer hues the seasons loss   as dawns feet there had touched and left their rosy prints       or come when sunset gives its freshened zest     lean oer the bridge and let the ruddy thrill      while the shorn sun swells down the hazy west     glow oppositethe marshes drink their fill      and swoon with purple veins then slowly fade      through pink to brown as eastward moves the shade   lengthening with stealthy creep of simonds darkening hill       later and yet ere winter wholly shuts     ere through the first dry snow the runner grates      and the loath cartwheel screams in slippery ruts     while firmer ice the eager boy awaits      trying each buckle and strap beside the fire      and until bedtime plays with his desire   twenty times putting on and off his newbought skates       then every morn the rivers banks shine bright     with smooth platearmor treacherous and frail      by the frosts clinking hammers forged at night    gainst which the lances of the sun prevail      giving a pretty emblem of the day      when guiltier arms in light shall melt away   and states shall move freelimbed loosed from wars cramping mail       and now those waterfalls the ebbing river     twice every day creates on either side      tinkle as through their freshsparred grots they shiver     in grassarched channels to the sun denied      high flaps in sparkling blue the farheard crow      the silvered flats gleam frostily below   suddenly drops the gull and breaks the glassy tide       but crowned in turn by vying seasons three     their winter halo hath a fuller ring      this glory seems to rest immovably     the others were too fleet and vanishing      when the hid tide is at its highest flow      oer marsh and stream one breathless trance of snow   with brooding fulness awes and hushes everything       the sunshine seems blown off by the bleak wind     as pale as formal candles lit by day      gropes to the sea the river dumb and blind     the brown ricks snowthatched by the storm in play      show pearly breakers combing oer their lee      white crests as of some just enchanted sea   checked in their maddest leap and hanging poised midway       but when the eastern blow with rain aslant     from midseas prairies green and rolling plains      drives in his wallowing herds of billows gaunt     and the roused charles remembers in his veins      old oceans blood and snaps his gyves of frost      that tyrannous silence on the shores is tost   in dreary wreck and crumbling desolation reigns       edgewise or flat in druidlike device     with leaden pools between or gullies bare      the blocks lie strewn a bleak stonehenge of ice     no life no sound to break the grim despair      save sullen plunge as through the sedges stiff      down crackles riverward some thawsapped cliff   or when the closewedged fields of ice crunch here and there       but let me turn from fancypictured scenes     to that whose pastoral calm before me lies      here nothing harsh or rugged intervenes     the early evening with her misty dyes      smooths off the ravelled edges of the nigh      relieves the distant with her cooler sky   and tones the landscape down and soothes the wearied eyes

glorifies the eve of summer day      and when the westering sun halfsunken burns      the motethick air to deepest orange turns   the westward horseman rides through clouds of gold away       so palpable ive seen those unshorn few     the six old willows at the causeys end      such trees paul potter never dreamed nor drew     through this dry mist their checkering shadows send      striped here and there with many a longdrawn thread      where streamed through leafy chinks the trembling red   past which in one bright trail the hangbirds flashes blend       yes dearer far thy dust than all that eer     beneath the awarded crown of victory      gilded the blown olympic charioteer     though lightly prized the ribboned parchments three      yet collegisse juvat i am glad      that here what colleging was mine i had   it linked another tie dear native town with thee       nearer art thou than simply native earth     my dust with thine concedes a deeper tie      a closer claim thy soil may well put forth     something of kindred more than sympathy      for in thy bounds i reverently laid away      that blinding anguish of forsaken clay   that title i seemed to have in earth and sea and sky       that portion of my life more choice to me     though brief yet in itself so round and whole      than all the imperfect residue can be     the artist saw his statue of the soul      was perfect so with one regretful stroke      the earthen model into fragments broke   and without her the impoverished seasons roll             the growth of the legend                a fragment     a legend that grew in the forests hush   slowly as teardrops gather and gush   when a word some poet chanced to say   ages ago in his careless way   brings our youth back to us out of its shroud   clearly as under yon thundercloud   i see that white seagull it grew and grew   from the pinetrees gathering a sombre hue   till it seems a mere murmur out of the vast   norwegian forests of the past   and it grew itself like a true northern pine   first a little slender line   like a mermaids green eyelash and then anon   a stem that a tower might rest upon   standing spearstraight in the waistdeep moss   its bony roots clutching around and across   as if they would tear up earths heart in their grasp   ere the storm should uproot them or make them unclasp   its cloudy boughs singing as suiteth the pine   to shrunk snowbearded seakings old songs of the brine   till they straightened and let their staves fall to the floor   hearing waves moan again on the perilous shore   of vinland perhaps while their prow groped its way   twixt the frothy gnashed tusks of some shipcrunching bay    so pinelike the legend grew stronglimbed and tall   as the gipsy child grows that eats crusts in the hall   it sucked the whole strength of the earth and the sky   spring summer fall winter all brought it supply   twas a natural growth and stood fearlessly there   a true part of the landscape as sea land and air   for it grew in good times ere the fashion it was   to force up these wild births of the woods under glass   and so if tis told as it should be told   though t were sung under venices moonlight of gold   you would hear the old voice of its mother the pine   murmur sealike and northern through every line   and the verses should hang selfsustained and free   round the vibrating stem of the melody   like the lithe sunsteeped limbs of the parent tree    yes the pine is the mother of legends what food   for their grim roots is left when the thousandyeared wood   the dimaisled cathedral whose tall arches spring   light sinewy graceful firmset as the wing   from michaels white shoulderis hewn and defaced   by iconoclast axes in desperate waste   and its wrecks seek the ocean it prophesied long   cassandralike crooning its mystical song   then the legends go with themeven yet on the sea   a wild virtue is left in the touch of the tree   and the sailors nightwatches are thrilled to the core   with the lineal offspring of odin and thor    yes wherever the pinewood has never let in   since the day of creation the light and the din   of manifold life but has safely conveyed   from the midnight primeval its armful of shade   and has kept the weird past with its sagas alive   mid the hum and the stir of todays busy hive   there the legend takes root in the agegathered gloom   and its murmurous boughs for their tossing find room    where aroostook farheard seems to sob as he goes   groping down to the sea neath his mountainous snows   where the lakes frore sahara of nevertracked white   when the crack shoots across it complains to the night   with a long lonely moan that leagues northward is lost   as the ice shrinks away from the tread of the frost   where the lumberers sit by the logfires which throw   their own threatening shadows far round oer the snow   when the wolf howls aloof and the wavering glare   flashes out from the blackness the eyes of the bear   when the woods huge recesses halflighted supply   a canvas where fancy her mad brush may try   blotting in giant horrors that venture not down   through the rightangled streets of the brisk whitewashed town   but skulk in the depths of the measureless wood   mid the darks creeping whispers that curdle the blood   when the eye glanced in dread oer the shoulder may dream   ere it shrinks to the campfires companioning gleam   that it saw the fierce ghost of the red man crouch back   to the shroud of the treetrunks invincible black   there the old shapes crowd thick round the pineshadowed camp   which shun the keen gleam of the scholarly lamp   and the seed of the legend finds true norland ground   while the bordertales told and the canteen flits round                 a contrast     thy love thou sentest oft to me     and still as oft i thrust it back   thy messengers i could not see     in those who everything did lack     the poor the outcast and the black    pride held his hand before mine eyes     the world with flattery stuffed mine ears   i looked to see a monarchs guise     nor dreamed thy love would knock for years     poor naked fettered full of tears    yet when i sent my love to thee     thou with a smile didst take it in   and entertaindst it royally     though grimed with earth with hunger thin     and leprous with the taint of sin    now every day thy love i meet     as oer the earth it wanders wide   with weary step and bleeding feet     still knocking at the heart of pride     and offering grace though still denied                 extreme unction     go leave me priest my soul would be     alone with the consoler death   far sadder eyes than thine will see     this crumbling clay yield up its breath

faith   fenced round about with the lord thus saith   to himself he fitted the doorways size   meted the light to the need of his eyes   and knew by a sure and inward sign   that the work of his fingers was divine    then ambrose said all those shall die   the eternal death who believe not as i   and some were boiled some burned in fire   some sawn in twain that his hearts desire   for the good of mens souls might be satisfied   by the drawing of all to the righteous side    one day as ambrose was seeking the truth   in his lonely walk he saw a youth   resting himself in the shade of a tree   it had never been given him to see   so shining a face and the good man thought   t were pity he should not believe as he ought    so he set himself by the young mans side   and the state of his soul with questions tried   but the heart of the stranger was hardened indeed   nor received the stamp of the one true creed   and the spirit of ambrose waxed sore to find   such face the porch of so narrow a mind    as each beholds in cloud and fire   the shape that answers his own desire   so each said the youth in the law shall find   the figure and features of his mind   and to each in his mercy hath god allowed   his several pillar of fire and cloud    the soul of ambrose burned with zeal   and holy wrath for the young mans weal   believest thou then most wretched youth   cried he a dividual essence in truth   i fear me thy heart is too cramped with sin   to take the lord in his glory in    now there bubbled beside them where they stood   a fountain of waters sweet and good   the youth to the streamlets brink drew near   saying ambrose thou maker of creeds look here   six vases of crystal then he took   and set them along the edge of the brook    as into these vessels the water i pour   there shall one hold less another more   and the water unchanged in every case   shall put on the figure of the vase   o thou who wouldst unity make through strife   canst thou fit this sign to the water of life    when ambrose looked up he stood alone   the youth and the stream and the vases were gone   but he knew by a sense of humbled grace   he had talked with an angel face to face   and felt his heart change inwardly   as he fell on his knees beneath the tree               above and below                     i    o dwellers in the valleyland     who in deep twilight grope

all the thirsty east with gold   but we who in the shadow sit     know also when the day is nigh   seeing thy shining forehead lit     with his inspiring prophecy    thou hast thine office we have ours     god lacks not early service here   but what are thine eleventh hours     he counts with us for morning cheer   our day for him is long enough     and when he giveth work to do   the bruisèd reed is amply tough     to pierce the shield of error through    but not the less do thou aspire     lights earlier messages to preach   keep back no syllable of fire     plunge deep the rowels of thy

the hour of trysting     but she lingered for him still   like a child the eager streamlet     leaped and laughed adown the hill   happy to be free at twilight     from its toiling at the mill    then the great moon on a sudden     ominous and red as blood   startling as a new creation     oer the eastern hilltop stood   casting deep and deeper shadows     through the mystery of the wood    dread closed huge and vague about her     and her thoughts turned fearfully   to her heart if there some shelter     from the silence there might be   like bare cedars leaning inland     from the blighting of the sea    yet he came not and the stillness     dampened round her like a tomb   she could feel cold eyes of spirits     looking on her through the gloom   she could hear the groping footsteps     of some blind gigantic doom    suddenly the silence wavered     like a light mist in the wind   for a voice broke gently through it     felt like sunshine by the blind   and the dread like mist in sunshine     furled serenely from her mind    once my love my love forever     flesh or spirit still the same   if i missed the hour of trysting     do not think my faith to blame   i alas was made a captive     as from holy land i came    on a green spot in the desert     gleaming like an emerald star   where a palmtree in lone silence     yearning for its mate afar   droops above a silver runnel     slender as a scimitar    there thoult find the humble postern     to the castle of my foe   if thy love burn clear and faithful     strike the gateway green and low   ask to enter and the warder     surely will not say thee no    slept again the aspen silence     but her loneliness was oer   round her heart a motherly patience     wrapt its arms for evermore   from her soul ebbed back the sorrow     leaving smooth the golden shore    donned she now the pilgrim scallop     took the pilgrim staff in hand   like a cloudshade flitting eastward     wandered she oer sea and land   and her footsteps in the desert     fell like cool rain on the sand    soon beneath the palmtrees shadow     knelt she at the postern low   and thereat she knocketh gently     fearing much the warders no   all her heart stood still and listened     as the door swung backward slow    there she saw no surly warder     with an eye like bolt and bar   through her soul a sense of music     throbbedand like a guardian lar   on the threshold stood an angel     bright and silent as a star    fairest seemed he of gods seraphs     and her spirit lilywise   blossomed when he turned upon her     the deep welcome of his eyes   sending upward to that sunlight     all its dew for sacrifice    then she heard a voice come onward     singing with a rapture new   as eve heard the songs in eden     dropping earthward with the dew   well she knew the happy singer     well the happy song she knew    forward leaped she oer the threshold     eager as a glancing surf   fell from her the spirits languor     fell from

slumberous moonshine   holds up its leaves in happy happy silence   waiting the dew with breath and pulse suspended   i hear afar thy whispering gleamy islands   and track thee wakeful still amid the widehung silence    upon the brink of some woodnestled lakelet   thy foliage like the tresses of a dryad   dripping about thy slim white stem whose shadow   slopes quivering down the waters dusky quiet   thou shrinkst as on her baths edge would some startled dryad    thou art the gobetween of rustic lovers   thy white bark has their secrets in its keeping   reuben writes here the happy name of patience   and thy lithe boughs hang murmuring and weeping   above her as she steals the mystery from thy keeping    thou art to me like my beloved maiden   so frankly coy so full of trembly confidences   thy shadow scarce seems shade thy pattering leaflets   sprinkle their gathered sunshine oer my senses   and nature gives me all her summer confidences    whether my heart with hope or sorrow tremble   thou sympathizest still wild and unquiet   i fling me down thy ripple like a river   flows valleyward where calmness is and by it   my heart is floated down into the land of quiet         an interview with miles standish     i sat one evening in my room     in that sweet hour of twilight   when blended thoughts half light half gloom     throng through the spirits skylight   the flames by fits curled round the bars     or up the chimney crinkled   while embers dropped like falling stars     and in the ashes tinkled    i sat and mused the fire burned low     and oer my senses stealing   crept something of the ruddy glow     that bloomed on wall and ceiling   my pictures they are very few     the heads of ancient wise men   smoothed down their knotted fronts and grew     as rosy as excisemen    my antique highbacked spanish chair     felt thrills through wood and leather   that had been strangers since whilere     mid andalusian heather   the oak that made its sturdy

slippery seats     but those slant precipices   of ice the northern voyager meets     less slippery are than this is   to cling therein would pass the wit     of royal man or woman   and whatsoeer can stay in it     is more or less than human    i offer to all bores this perch     dear wellintentioned people   with heads as void as weekday church     tongues longer than the steeple   to folks with missions whose gaunt eyes     see golden ages rising   salt of the earth in what queer guys     thourt fond of crystallizing    my wonder then was not unmixed     with merciful suggestion   when as my roving eyes grew fixed     upon the chair in question   i saw its trembling arms enclose     a figure grim and rusty   whose doublet plain and plainer hose     were something worn and dusty    now even such men as nature forms     merely to fill the street with   once turned to ghosts by hungry worms     are serious things to meet with   your penitent spirits are no jokes     and though im not

mild face oft had i mused   of calm and peace and deep forgetfulness   of folded hands closed eye and heart at rest   and slumber sound beneath a flowery turf   of faults forgotten and an inner place   kept sacred for us in the heart of friends   but these were idle fancies satisfied   with the mere husk of this great mystery   and dwelling in the outward shows of things   heaven is not mounted to

ladder up   whose golden rounds are our calamities   whereon our firm feet planting nearer god   the spirit climbs and hath its eyes unsealed    true is it that deaths face seems stern and cold   when

an overplus of life   and yet the one dear heart lies cold and still   it is most strange when the great miracle   hath for our sakes been done when we have had   our inwardest experience of god   when with his presence still the room expands   and is awed after him that naught is changed   that natures face looks unacknowledging   and the mad world still dances heedless on   after its butterflies and gives no sign   tis hard at first to see it all aright   in vain faith blows her trump to summon back   her scattered troop yet through the clouded glass   of our own bitter tears we learn to look   undazzled on the kindness of gods face   earth is too dark and heaven alone shines through   it is no little thing when a fresh soul   and a fresh heart with their unmeasured scope

some dim wise divine   the depth of his infinite patience     to this wayward soul of mine    i know not how others saw her     but to me she was wholly fair   and the light of the heaven she came from     still lingered and gleamed in her hair   for it was as wavy and golden     and as many changes took   as the shadows of sungilt ripples     on the yellow bed of a brook    to what can i liken her smiling     upon me her kneeling lover   how it leaped from her lips to her eyelids     and dimpled her wholly over   till her outstretched hands smiled also     and i almost seemed to see   the very heart of her mother     sending sun through her veins to me    she had been with us scarce a twelvemonth     and it hardly seemed a day   when a troop of wandering angels     stole my little

which one was eer so dear so kind     so beautiful as longing   the thing we long for that we are     for one transcendent moment   before the present poor and bare     can make its sneering comment    still through our paltry stir and strife     glows down the wished ideal   and longing moulds in clay what life     carves in the marble real   to let the new life in we know     desire must ope the portal   perhaps the longing to be so     helps make the soul immortal    longing is gods fresh heavenward will     with our poor earthward striving   we quench it that we may be still     content with merely living   but would we learn that hearts full scope     which we are hourly wronging   our lives must climb from hope to hope     and realize our longing    ah let us hope that to our

the children of earth    then said the chief priests and rulers and kings   behold now the giver of all good things   go to let us welcome with pomp and state   him who alone is mighty and great    with carpets of gold the ground they spread   wherever the son of man should tread   and in palacechambers lofty and rare   they lodged him and served him with kingly fare    great organs surged through arches dim   their jubilant floods in praise of him   and in church and palace and judgmenthall   he saw his image high over all    but still wherever his steps they led   the lord in sorrow bent down his head   and from under the heavy foundationstones   the son of mary heard bitter groans    and in church and palace and judgmenthall   he marked great fissures that rent the wall   and opened wider and yet more wide   as the living foundation heaved and sighed    have ye founded your thrones and altars then   on the bodies and souls of living men   and think ye that building shall endure   which shelters the noble and crushes the poor    with gates of silver and bars of gold   ye have fenced my sheep from their fathers fold   i have heard the dropping of their tears   in heaven these eighteen hundred years    o lord and master not ours the guilt   we build but as our fathers built   behold thine images how they stand   sovereign and sole through all our land    our task is

    gathering itself for a mighty leap    north east and south there are reefs and breakers     you would never dream of in smooth weather   that toss and gore the sea for acres     bellowing and

 lifting himself up silently   high and huge oer the lighthouse top   with hands of wavering spray outspread     groping after the little tower     that seems to shrink and shorten and cower   till the monsters arms of a sudden drop     and silently and fruitlessly     he sinks again into the sea    you meanwhile where drenched you stand     awaken once more to the rush and roar   and on the

sink the whole island once for all   or watch the silenter stealthier seas     feeling their way to you more and more   if they once should clutch you high as the knees   they would whirl you down

let worthier hands than these thy wreath entwine   upon thy hearse i shed no useless tear     for us weep rather thou in calm divine      1842                to the memory of hood     another star neath times horizon dropped     to gleam oer unknown lands and seas   another heart that beat for freedom stopped     what mournful words are these    o love divine that claspest our tired earth     and lullest it upon thy heart   thou knowest how much a gentle soul is worth     to teach men what thou art    his was a spirit that to all thy poor     was kind as slumber after pain   why ope so soon thy heavendeep quiets door     and call him home again    freedom needs all her poets it is they     who give her aspirations wings   and to the wiser law of music sway     her wild imaginings    yet thou hast called him nor art thou unkind     o love divine for tis thy will   that gracious natures leave their love behind     to work for freedom still    let laurelled marbles weigh on other tombs     let anthems peal for other dead   rustling the bannered depth of minsterglooms     with their exulting spread    his epitaph shall mock the shortlived stone     no lichen shall its lines efface   he needs these few and simple lines alone     to mark his restingplace    here lies a poet stranger if to thee     his claim to memory be obscure   if thou wouldst learn how truly great was

they have not taken sympathy from thee   nor made thee any other than thou wast   save as some tree which in a sudden blast   sheddeth those blossoms that are weakly grown   upon the air but keepeth every one   whose strength gives warrant of good fruit at last   so thou hast shed some blooms of gayety   but never one of steadfast cheerfulness   nor hath thy knowledge of adversity   robbed thee of any faith in happiness   but rather cleared thy inner eyes to see   how many simple ways there are to bless      1840                        ii    what were i love if i were stripped of thee   if thine eyes shut me out whereby i live   thou who unto my calmer soul dost give   knowledge and truth and holy mystery   wherein truth mainly lies for those who see   beyond the earthly and the fugitive   who in the grandeur of the soul believe   and only in the infinite are free   without thee i were naked bleak and bare   as yon dead cedar on the seacliffs brow   and natures teachings which come to me now   common and beautiful as light and air   would be as fruitless as a stream which still   slips through the wheel of some old ruined mill      1841                        iii    i would not have this perfect love of ours   grow from a single root a single stem   bearing no goodly fruit but only flowers   that idly hide lifes iron diadem   it should grow alway like that eastern tree   whose limbs take root and spread forth constantly   that love for one from which there doth not spring   wide love for all it is but a worthless thing   not in another world as poets prate   dwell we apart above the tide of things   high floating oer earths clouds on faery wings   but our pure love doth ever elevate   into a holy bond of brotherhood   all earthly things making them pure and good      1840                        iv    for this true nobleness i seek in vain   in woman and in man i find it not   i almost weary of my earthly lot   my lifesprings are dried up with burning pain   thou findst it not i pray thee look again   look inward through the depths of thine own soul   how is it with thee art thou sound and whole   doth narrow search show thee no earthly stain   be noble and the nobleness that lies   in other men sleeping but never dead   will rise in majesty to meet thine own   then wilt thou see it gleam in many eyes   then will pure light around thy path be shed   and thou wilt never more be sad and lone      1840                         v              to the spirit of keats    great soul thou sittest with me in my room   uplifting me with thy vast quiet eyes   on whose full orbs with kindly lustre lies   the twilight warmth of ruddy embergloom   thy clear strong tones will oft bring sudden bloom   of hope secure to him who lonely cries   wrestling with the young poets agonies   neglect and scorn which seem a certain doom   yes the few words which like great thunderdrops   thy large heart down to earth shook doubtfully   thrilled by the inward lightning of its might   serene and pure like gushing joy of light   shall track the eternal chords of destiny   after the moonled pulse of ocean stops      1841                        vi    great truths are portions of the soul of man   great souls are portions of eternity   each drop of blood that eer through true heart ran   with lofty message ran for thee and me   for gods law since the starry song began   hath been and still for evermore must be   that every deed which shall outlast times span   must goad the soul to be erect and free   slave is no word of deathless lineage sprung   too many noble souls have thought and died   too many mighty poets have lived and sung   and our good saxon from lips purified   with martyrfire throughout the world hath rung   too long to have gods holy cause denied      1841                        vii    i ask not for those thoughts that sudden leap   from beings sea like the isleseeming kraken   with whose great rise the ocean all is shaken   and a hearttremble quivers through the deep   give me that growth which some perchance deem sleep   wherewith the steadfast coralstems uprise   which by the toil of gathering energies   their upward way into clear sunshine keep   until by heavens sweetest influences   slowly and slowly spreads a speck of green   into a pleasant island in the seas   where mid tall palms the caneroofed home is seen   and wearied men shall sit at sunsets hour   hearing the leaves and loving gods dear power      1841                       viii            to m w on her birthday    maiden when such a soul as thine is born   the morning stars their ancient music make   and joyful once again their song awake   long silent now with melancholy scorn   and thou not mindless of so blest a morn   by no least deed its harmony shalt break   but shalt to that high chime thy footsteps take   through lifes most darksome passes unforlorn   therefore from thy pure faith thou shalt not fall   therefore shalt thou be ever fair and free   and in thine every motion musical   as summer air majestic as the sea   a mystery to those who creep and crawl   through time and part it from eternity      1841                        ix    my love i have no fear that thou shouldst die   albeit i ask no fairer life than this   whose numberingclock is still thy gentle kiss   while time and peace with hands enlockèd fly   yet care i not where in eternity   we live and love well knowing that there is   no backward step for those who feel the bliss   of faith as their most lofty yearnings high   love hath so purified my beings core   meseems i scarcely should be startled even   to find some morn that thou hadst gone before   since with thy love this knowledge too was given   which each calm day doth strengthen more and more   that they who love are but one step from heaven      1841                         x    i cannot think that thou shouldst pass away   whose life to mine is an eternal law   a piece of nature that can have no flaw   a new and certain sunrise every day   but if thou art to be another ray   about the sun of life and art to live   free from all of thee that was fugitive   the debt of love i will more fully pay   not downcast with the thought of thee so high   but rather raised to be a nobler man   and more divine in my humanity   as knowing that the waiting eyes which scan   my life are lighted by a purer being   and ask meek calmbrowed deeds with it agreeing      1841                        xi    there never yet was flower fair in vain   let classic poets rhyme it as they will   the seasons

crescit    the hope of truth grows stronger day by day   i hear the soul of man around me waking   like a great sea its frozen fetters breaking   and flinging up to heaven its sunlit spray   tossing huge continents in scornful play   and crushing them with din of grinding thunder   that makes old emptinesses stare in wonder   the memory of a glory passed away   lingers in every heart as in the shell   resounds the bygone freedom of the sea   and every hour new signs of promise tell   that the great soul shall once again be free   for high and yet more high the murmurs swell   of inward strife for truth and liberty      1841                       xiii    belovèd in the noisy city here   the thought of thee can make all turmoil cease   around my spirit folds thy spirit clear   its still soft arms and circles it with peace   there is no room for any doubt or fear   in souls so overfilled with loves increase   there is no memory of the bygone year   but growth in hearts and spirits perfect ease   how hath our love half nebulous at first   rounded itself into a fullorbed sun   how have our lives and wills as haply erst   they were ere this forgetfulness begun   through all their earthly distantness outburst   and melted like two rays of light in one      1842                        xiv    on reading wordsworths sonnets in defence of               capital punishment

earnestly believeth   life from the universal heart doth flow   whereby some conquest of the eternal woe   by instinct of gods nature he achieveth   a fuller pulse of this allpowerful beauty   into the poets gulflike heart doth tide   and he more keenly feels the glorious duty   of serving truth despised and crucified   happy unknowing sect or creed to rest   and feel god flow forever through

truth the coward heart of death   woe if such spirit thwart its errand high   and mock with lies the longing soul of man   yet one age longer must true culture lie   soothing her bitter fetters as she

and to the law of meekness faith and ruth   by inward sympathy shall all be won   this thou shouldst know who from the painted feature   of shifting fashion couldst thy brethren turn   unto the love of everyouthful nature   and of a beauty fadeless and eterne   and always tis the saddest sight to see   an old man faithless in humanity                       xvii              the same continued    a poet cannot strive for despotism   his harp falls shattered for it still must be   the instinct of great spirits to be free   and the sworn foes of cunning barbarism   he who has deepest searched the wide abysm   of that lifegiving soul which men call fate   knows that to put more faith in lies and hate   than truth and love is the true atheism   upward the soul forever turns her eyes   the next hour always shames the hour before   one beauty at its highest prophesies   that by whose side it shall seem mean and poor   no godlike thing knows aught of less and less   but widens to the boundless perfectness                       xviii              the same continued    therefore think not the past is wise alone   for yesterday knows nothing of the best   and thou shalt love it only as the nest   whence glorywingèd things to heaven have flown   to the great soul alone are all things known   present and future are to her as past   while she in glorious madness doth forecast   that perfect bud which seems a flower fullblown   to each new prophet and yet always opes   fuller and fuller with each day and hour   heartening the soul with odor of fresh hopes   and longings high and gushings of wide power   yet never is or shall be fully blown   save in the forethought of the eternal one                        xix               the same concluded    far yond this narrow parapet

thine eyes   save there the rain in dreamy clouds doth stay   as loath to fall out of those happy skies   yet sure my love thou art most like to may   that comes with steady sun when april dies

not from rocks and woods   her womb and cradle are the human heart   and she can find a nobler theme for song   in the most loathsome man that blasts the sight   than in the broad expanse of sea and shore   between the frozen deserts of the poles   all nations have their message from on high   each the messiah of some central thought   for the fulfilment and delight of man   one has to teach that labor is divine   another freedom and another mind   and all that god is openeyed and just   the happy centre and calm heart of all      are then our woods our mountains and our streams   needful to teach our poets how to sing   o maiden rare far other thoughts were ours   when we have sat by oceans foaming marge   and watched the waves leap roaring on the rocks   than young leander and his hero had   gazing from sestos to the other shore   the moon looks down and ocean worships her   stars rise and set and seasons come and go   even as they did in homers elder time   but we behold them not

none but god   these are realities which make the shows   of outward nature be they neer so grand   seem small and worthless and contemptible   these are the mountainsummits for our bards   which

morningstar   silvers the murk face of slowyielding night   the herald of a fuller truth than yet   hath gleamed upon the upraisèd face of man   since the earth glittered in her stainless prime   of a more glorious sunrise than of old   drew wondrous melodies from memnon huge   yea draws them still though now he sits waistdeep   in the engulfing flood of whirling sand   and looks across the wastes of endless gray   sole wreck where once his hundredgated thebes   pained with her mighty hum the calm blue heaven   shall the dull stone pay grateful orisons   and we till noonday bar the splendor out   lest it reproach and chide our sluggard hearts   warmnestled in the down of prejudice   and be content though clad with angelwings   closeclipped to hop about from perch to perch   in paltry cages of dead mens dead thoughts   o rather like the skylark soar and sing   and let our gushing songs befit the dawn   and sunrise and the yet unshaken dew   brimming the chalice of each fullblown hope   whose blithe front turns to greet the growing day   never had poets such high call before   never can poets hope for higher one   and if they be but faithful to their trust   earth will remember them with love and joy   and o far better god will not forget   for he who settles freedoms principles   writes the deathwarrant of all tyranny   who speaks the truth stabs falsehood to the heart   and his

that loneliest solitude   the silent desert of a great new thought   though loud niagara were today struck dumb   yet would this cataract of boiling life   rush plunging on and on to endless deeps   and utter thunder till the world shall cease   a thunder worthy of the poets song   and which alone can fill it with true life   the high evangel to our country granted   could make apostles yea with tongues of fire   of hearts halfdarkened back again to clay   tis the soul only that is national   and he who pays true loyalty to that   alone can claim the wreath of patriotism      beloved if i wander far and oft   from that which i believe and feel and know   thou wilt forgive not with a sorrowing heart   but with a strengthened hope of better things   knowing that i though often blind and false   to those i love and o more false than all   unto myself have been most true to thee   and that whoso in one thing hath been true   can be as true in all therefore thy hope   may yet not prove unfruitful and thy love   meet day by day with less unworthy thanks   whether as now we journey hand in hand   or parted in the body yet are one   in spirit and the love of holy things           the

priest hath his fee who comes and shrives us     we bargain for the graves we lie in   at the devils booth are all things sold   each ounce of dross costs its ounce of gold     for a cap and bells our

poorest comer    and what is so rare as a day in june     then if ever come perfect days   then heaven tries the earth if it be in tune     and over it softly her warm ear lays   whether we look or whether we listen   we hear life murmur or see it glisten   every clod feels a stir of might     an instinct within it that reaches and towers   and groping blindly above it for light     climbs to a soul in grass and flowers   the flush of life may well be seen     thrilling back over hills and valleys   the cowslip startles in meadows green     the buttercup catches the sun in its chalice   and theres never a leaf nor a blade too mean     to be some happy creatures palace   the little bird sits at his door in the sun     atilt like a blossom among the leaves   and lets his illumined being oerrun     with the deluge of summer it receives   his mate feels the eggs beneath her wings   and the heart in her dumb breast flutters and sings   he sings to the wide world and she to her nest   in the nice ear of nature which song is the best    now is the hightide of the year     and whatever of life hath ebbed away   comes flooding back with a ripply cheer     into every bare inlet and creek and bay   now the heart is so full that a drop overfills it   we are happy now because god wills it   no matter how barren the past may have been   tis enough for us now that the leaves are green   we sit in the warm shade and feel right well   how the sap creeps up and the blossoms swell   we may shut our eyes but we cannot help knowing   that skies are clear and grass is growing   the breeze comes whispering in our ear   that dandelions are blossoming near     that maize has sprouted that streams are flowing   that the river is bluer than the sky   that the robin is plastering his house hard by   and if the breeze kept the good news back   for other couriers we should not lack     we could guess it all by yon heifers lowing   and hark how clear bold chanticleer   warmed with the new wine of the year     tells all in his lusty crowing    joy comes grief goes we know not how   everything is happy now     everything is upward striving   tis as easy now for the heart to be true   as for grass to be green or skies to be blue    tis the natural way of living   who knows whither the clouds have fled     in the unscarred heaven they leave no wake   and the eyes forget the tears they have shed     the heart forgets its sorrow and ache   the soul partakes the seasons youth     and the sulphurous rifts of passion and woe   lie deep neath a silence pure and smooth     like burntout craters healed with snow   what wonder if sir launfal now   remembered the keeping of his vow               part first                    i    my golden spurs now bring to me     and bring to me my richest mail   for tomorrow i go over land and sea     in search of the holy grail   shall never a bed for me be spread   nor shall a pillow be under my head   till i begin my vow to keep   here on the rushes will i sleep   and perchance there may come a vision true   ere day create the world anew     slowly sir launfals eyes grew dim     slumber fell like a cloud on him   and into his soul the vision flew                    ii    the crows flapped over by twos and threes   in the pool drowsed the cattle up to their knees     the little birds sang as if it were     the one day of summer in all the year   and the very leaves seemed to sing on the trees   the castle alone in the landscape lay   like an outpost of winter dull and gray   twas the proudest hall in the north countree   and never its gates might opened be   save to lord or lady of high degree   summer besieged it on every side   but the churlish stone her assaults defied   she could not scale the chilly wall   though round it for leagues her pavilions tall   stretched left and right   over the hills and out of sight     green and broad was every tent     and out of each a murmur went   till the breeze fell off at night                    iii    the drawbridge dropped with a surly clang   and through the dark arch a charger sprang   bearing sir launfal the maiden knight   in his gilded mail that flamed so bright   it seemed the dark castle had gathered all   those shafts the fierce sun had shot over its wall     in his siege of three hundred summers long   and binding them all in one blazing sheaf     had cast them forth so young and strong   and lightsome as a locustleaf   sir launfal flashed forth in his unscarred mail   to seek in all climes for the holy grail                    iv    it was morning on hill and stream and tree     and morning in the young knights heart   only the castle moodily   rebuffed the gifts of the sunshine free     and gloomed by itself apart   the season brimmed all other things up   full as the rain fills the pitcherplants cup                    v    as sir launfal made morn through the darksome gate     he was ware of a leper crouched by the same   who begged with his hand and moaned as he sate     and a loathing over sir launfal came   the sunshine went out of his soul with a thrill     the flesh neath his armor gan shrink and crawl   and midway its leap his heart stood still     like a frozen waterfall   for this man so foul and bent of stature   rasped harshly against his dainty nature   and seemed the one blot on the summer morn   so he tossed him a piece of gold in scorn                    vi    the leper raised not the gold from the dust   better to me the poor mans crust   better the blessing of the poor   though i turn me empty from his door   that is no true alms which the hand can hold   he gives nothing but worthless gold     who gives from a sense of duty   but he who gives a slender mite   and gives to that which is out of sight     that thread of the allsustaining beauty   which runs through all and doth all unite   the hand cannot clasp the whole of his alms   the heart outstretches its eager palms   for a god goes with it and makes it store   to the soul that was starving in darkness before             prelude to part second    down swept the chill wind from the mountain peak     from the snow five thousand summers old   on open wold and hilltop bleak     it had gathered all the cold   and whirled it like sleet on the wanderers cheek   it carried a shiver everywhere   from the unleafed boughs and pastures bare   the little brook heard it and built a roof   neath which he could house him winterproof   all night by the white stars frosty gleams   he groined his arches and matched his beams   slender and clear were his crystal spars   as the lashes of light that trim the stars   he sculptured every summer delight   in his halls and chambers out of sight   sometimes his tinkling waters slipt   down through a frostleaved forestcrypt   long sparkling aisles of steelstemmed trees   bending to counterfeit a breeze   sometimes the roof no fretwork knew   but silvery mosses that downward grew   sometimes it was carved in sharp relief   with quaint arabesques of icefern leaf   sometimes it was simply smooth and clear   for the gladness of heaven to shine through and here   he had caught the nodding bulrushtops   and hung them thickly with diamond drops   that crystalled the beams of moon and sun   and made a star of every one   no mortal builders most rare device   could match this winterpalace of ice   twas as if every image that mirrored lay   in his depths serene through the summer day   each fleeting shadow of earth and sky     lest the happy model should be lost   had been mimicked in fairy masonry     by the elfin builders of the frost    within the hall are song and laughter     the cheeks of christmas glow red and jolly   and sprouting is every corbel and rafter     with lightsome green of ivy and holly   through the deep gulf of the chimney wide   wallows the yulelogs roaring tide   the broad flamepennons droop and flap     and belly and tug as a flag in the wind   like a locust shrills the imprisoned sap     hunted to death in its galleries blind   and swift little troops of silent sparks     now pausing now scattering away as in fear   go threading the sootforests tangled darks     like herds of startled deer    but the wind without was eager and sharp   of sir launfals gray hair it makes a harp      and rattles and wrings      the icy strings     singing in dreary monotone     a christmas carol of its own     whose burden still as he might guess     wasshelterless shelterless shelterless    the voice of the seneschal flared like a torch   as he shouted the wanderer away from the porch   and he sat in the gateway and saw all night     the great hallfire so cheery and bold     through the windowslits of the castle old   build out its piers of ruddy light   against the drift of the cold               part second                    i    there was never a leaf on bush or tree   the bare boughs rattled shudderingly   the river was numb and could not speak     for the weaver winter its shroud had spun   a single crow on the treetop bleak     from his shining feathers shed off the cold sun   again it was morning but shrunk and cold   as if her veins were sapless and old   and she rose up decrepitly   for a last dim look at earth and sea                    ii    sir launfal turned from his own hard gate   for another heir in his earldom sate   an old bent man worn out and frail   he came back from seeking the holy grail   little he recked of his earldoms loss   no more on his surcoat was blazoned the cross   but deep in his soul the sign he wore   the badge of the suffering and the poor                    iii    sir launfals raiment thin and spare   was idle mail gainst the barbèd air   for it was just at the christmas time   so he mused as he sat of a sunnier clime   and sought for a shelter from cold and snow   in the light and warmth of longago   he sees the snakelike caravan crawl   oer the edge of the desert black and small   then nearer and nearer till one by one   he can count the camels in the sun   as over the redhot sands they pass   to where in its slender necklace of grass   the little spring laughed and leapt in the shade   and with its own self like an infant played   and waved its signal of palms                    iv    for christs sweet sake i beg an alms   the happy camels may reach the spring   but sir launfal sees only the grewsome thing   the leper lank as the rainblanched bone   that cowers beside him a thing as lone   and white as the iceisles of northern seas   in the desolate horror of his disease                     v    and sir launfal saidi behold in thee   an image of him who died on the tree   thou also hast had thy crown of thorns   thou also hast had the worlds buffets and scorns   and to thy life were not denied   the wounds in the hands and feet and side   mild marys son acknowledge me   behold through him i give to thee                    vi    then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes     and looked at sir launfal and straightway he   remembered in what a haughtier guise     he had flung an alms to leprosie   when he girt his young life up in gilded mail   and set forth in search of the holy grail   the heart within him was ashes and dust   he parted in twain his single crust   he broke the ice on the streamlets brink   and gave the leper to eat and drink   twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread     twas water out of a wooden bowl   yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed     and twas red wine he drank with his thirsty soul                    vii    as sir launfal mused with a downcast face   a light shone round about the place   the leper no longer crouched at his side   but stood before him glorified   shining and tall and fair and straight   as the pillar that stood by the beautiful gate   himself the gate whereby men can   enter the temple of god in man                   viii    his words were shed softer than leaves from the pine   and they fell on sir launfal as snows on the brine   which mingle their softness and quiet in one   with the shaggy unrest they float down upon   and the voice that was calmer than silence said   lo it is i be not afraid   in many climes without avail   thou hast spent thy life for the holy grail   behold it is herethis cup which thou   didst fill at the streamlet for me but now   this crust is my body broken for thee   this water his blood that died on the tree   the holy supper is kept indeed   in whatso we share with anothers need   not what we give but what we share   for the gift without the giver is bare   who gives himself with his alms feeds three   himself his hungering neighbor and me                    ix    sir launfal awoke as from a swound   the grail in my castle here is found   hang my idle armor up on the wall   let it be the spiders banquet hall   he must be fenced with stronger mail   who would seek and find the holy grail                     x    the castle gate stands open now     and the wanderer is welcome to the hall   as the hangbird is to the elmtree bough     no longer scowl the turrets tall   the summers long siege at last is oer   when the first poor outcast went in at the door   she entered with him in disguise   and mastered the fortress by surprise   there is no spot she loves so well on ground   she lingers and smiles there the whole year round   the meanest serf on sir launfals land   has hall and bower at his command   and theres no poor man in the north countree   but is lord of the earldom as much as he        noteaccording to the mythology of the romancers the      san greal or holy grail was the cup out of which jesus      partook of the last supper with his disciples it was      brought into england by joseph of arimathea and remained      there an object of pilgrimage and adoration for many years      in the keeping of his lineal descendants it was incumbent      upon those who had charge of it to be chaste in thought      word and deed but one of the keepers having broken this      condition the holy grail disappeared from that time it was      a favorite enterprise of the knights of arthurs court to go      in search of it sir galahad was at last successful in      finding it as we may read in the seventeenth book of the      romance of king arthur tennyson has made sir galahad the      subject of one of the most exquisite of his poems       the plot if i may give that name to anything so slight of      the foregoing poem is my own and to serve its purposes i      have enlarged the circle of competition in search of the      miraculous cup in such a manner as to include not only      other persons than the heroes of the round table but also a      period of time subsequent to the date of king arthurs      reign           reader walk up at once it will soon be too late               and buy at a perfectly ruinous rate                                    a                           fable for critics                               or better    i like as a thing that the readers first fancy may strike                     an oldfashioned titlepage     such as presents a tabular view of the volumes contents                                a glance                   at a few of our literary progenies                        mrs malaprops word                                  from                        the tub of diogenes                      a vocal and musical medley                                that is                           a series of jokes                        by a wonderful quiz          who accompanies himself with a rubadubdub full of                 spirit and grace on the top of the tub                    set forth in october the 31st day                 in the year 48 g p putnam broadway     it being the commonest mode of procedure i premise a few candid remarks  to the reader  this trifle begun to please only myself and my own private fancy was laid on the shelf but some friends who had seen it induced me by dint of saying they liked it to put it in print that is having come to that very conclusion i consulted them when it could make no confusion for though in the gentlest of ways they had hinted it was scarce worth the while i should doubtless have printed it  i began it intending a fable a frail slender thing rhymeywinged with a sting in its tail but by addings and alterings not previously planneddigressions chancehatched like birds eggs in the sandand dawdlings to suit every whimsys demand always freeing the bird which i held in my hand for the two perched perhaps out of reach in the treeit grew by degrees to the size which you see i was like the old woman that carried the calf and my neighbors like hers no doubt wonder and laugh and when my strained arms with their grown burthen full i call it my fable they call it a bull  having scrawled at full gallop as far as that goes in a style that is neither good verse nor bad prose and being a person whom nobody knows some people will say i am rather more free with my readers than it is becoming to be that i seem to expect them to wait on my leisure in following wherever i wander at pleasure that in short i take more than a young authors lawful ease and laugh in a queer way so like mephistopheles that the public will doubt as they grope through my rhythm if in truth i am making fun at them or with them  so the excellent public is hereby assured that the sale of my book is already secured for there is not a poet throughout the whole land but will purchase a copy or two out of hand in the fond expectation of being amused in it by seeing his betters cutup and abused in it now i find by a pretty exact calculation there are something like ten thousand bards in the nation of that special variety whom the review and magazine critics call lofty and true and about thirty thousand this tribe is increasing of the kinds who are termed full of promise and pleasing the public will see by a glance at this schedule that they cannot expect me to be oversedulous about courting them since it seems i have got enough fuel made sure of for boiling my pot  as for such of our poets as find not their names mentioned once in my pages with praises or blames let them send in their cards without further delay to my friend g p putnam esquire in broadway where a list will be kept with the strictest regard to the day and the hour of receiving the card then taking them up as i chance to have time that is if their names can be twisted in rhyme i will honestly give each his proper position at the rate of one author to each new edition thus a premium is offered sufficiently high as the magazines say when they tell their best lie to induce bards to club their resources and buy the balance of every edition until they have all of them fairly been run through the mill  one word to such readers judicious and wise as read books with something behind the mere eyes of whom in the country perhaps there are two including myself gentle reader and you all the characters sketched in this slight jeu desprit though it may be they seem here and there rather free and drawn from a mephistophelian standpoint are meant to be faithful and that is the grand point and none but an owl would feel sore at a rub from a jester who tells you without any subterfuge that he sits in diogenes tub                   a preliminary note to the second                           edition   though it well may be reckoned of all composition the species at once most delightful and healthy is a thing which an author unless he be wealthy and willing to pay for that kind of delight is not in all instances called on to write though there are it is said who their spirits to cheer slip in a new titlepage three times a year and in this way snuff up an imaginary savor of that sweetest of dishes the popular favormuch as if a starved painter should fall to and treat the ugolino inside to a picture of meat  you remember if not pray turn over and look that in writing the preface which ushered my book i treated you excellent public not merely with a cool disregard but downright cavalierly now i would not take back the least thing i then said though i thereby could butter both sides of my bread for i never could see that an author owed aught to the people he solaced diverted or taught and as for mere fame i have long ago learned that the persons by whom it is finally earned are those with whom your verdict weighed not a pin unsustained by the higher court sitting within  but i wander from what i intended to saythat you have namely shown such a liberal way of thinking and so much æsthetic perception of anonymous worth in the handsome reception you gave to my book spite of some private piques having bought the first thousand in barely two weeks that i think past a doubt if you measured the phiz of yours most devotedly wonderful quiz you would find that its vertical section was shorter by an inch and two tenths or twixt that and a quarter  you have watched a child playingin those wondrous years when belief is not bound to the eyes and the ears and the vision divine is so clear and unmarred that each baker of pies in the dirt is a bard give a knife and a shingle he fits out a fleet and on that little mud puddle over the street his invention in purest good faith will make sail round the globe with a puff of his breath for a gale will visit in barely ten minutes all climes and find northwestern passages hundreds of

aladdins lamp out of a stone and for hours they enjoy each his own supernatural powers this is all very pretty and pleasant but then suppose our two urchins have grown into men and both have turned authorsone says to his brother lets play were the american somethings or other only let them be big enough no matter what come you shall be goethe or pope which you choose ill be coleridge and both shall write mutual reviews so they both as mere strangers before many days send each other a cord of anonymous bays each in piling his epithets smiles in his sleeve to see what his friend can be made to believe each in reading the others unbiased review thinksheres pretty high praise but no more than is true well we laugh at them both and yet make no great fuss when the same farce is acted to benefit us even i who if asked scarce a month since what fudge meant should have answered the dear publics critical judgment begin to think sharpwitted horace spoke sooth when he said that the public sometimes hit the truth  in reading these lines you perhaps have a vision of a person in pretty good health and condition and yet since i put forth my primary edition i have been crushed scorched

banquet as that was quite out of the question  in the edition now issued no pains are neglected and my verses as orators say stand corrected yet some blunders remain of the publics own make which i wish to correct for my personal sake for instance a character drawn in pure fun and condensing the traits of a dozen in one has been as i hear by some persons applied to a good friend of mine whom to stab in the side as we walked along chatting and joking together would not be my way i can hardly tell whether a question will ever arise in which he and i should by any strange fortune agree but meanwhile my esteem for him grows as i know him and though not the best judge upon earth of a poem he knows what it is he is saying and why and is honest and fearless two good points which i have not found so rife i can easily smother my love for them whether on my side or tother  for my other anonymi you may be sure that i know what is meant by a caricature and what by a portrait there are those who think it is capital fun to be spattering their ink on quiet unquarrelsome folk but the minute the game changes sides and the others begin it they see something savage and horrible in it as for me i respect neither women nor men for their gender nor own any sex in a pen i choose just to hint to some causeless unfriends that as far as i know there are always two ends and one of them heaviest too

twas a step into which he had driven her   he somehow or other had never forgiven her   her memory he nursed as a kind of a tonic   something bitter to chew when hed play the byronic   and i cant count the obstinate nymphs that he brought over   by a strange kind of smile he put on when he thought of her   my case is like didos he sometimes remarkd   when i last saw my love she was fairly

still grieves   to see those loved graces all taking their leaves   those charms beyond speech so enchanting but now   as they left me forever each making its bough   if her tongue had a tang

never will cry till shes out of the wood   what wouldnt i give if i never had known of her   twere a kind of relief had i something to groan over   if i had but some letters of hers now to toss over   i might turn for the nonce a byronic philosopher   and bewitch all the flats by bemoaning the loss of her   one needs something tangible though to begin on   a loom as it were for the fancy to spin on   what boots all your grist it can never be ground   till a breeze makes the arms of the windmill go round   or if tis a watermill alter the metaphor   and say it wont stir save the wheel be well wet afore   or lug in some stuff about water so dreamily   it is not a metaphor though tis a simile   a lily perhaps would set my mill agoing   for just at this season i think they are blowing   here somebody fetch one not very far hence   theyre in bloom by the score tis but climbing a fence   theres a poet hard by who does nothing but fill his   whole garden from one end to tother with lilies   a very good plan were it not for satiety   one longs for a weed here and there for variety   though a weed is no more than a flower in disguise   which is seen through at once if love give a man eyes      now there happened to be among phœbuss followers   a gentleman one of the omnivorous swallowers   who bolt every book that comes out of the press   without the least question of larger or less   whose stomachs are strong at the expense of their head   for reading new books is like eating new bread   one can bear it at first but by gradual steps he   is brought to deaths door of a mental dyspepsy   on a previous stage of existence our hero   had ridden outside with the glass below zero   he had been tis a fact you may safely rely on   of a very old stock a most eminent scion   a stock all fresh quacks their fierce boluses ply on   who stretch the new boots earths unwilling to try on   whom humbugs of all shapes and sorts keep their eye on   whose hairs in the mortar of every new zion   who when whistles are dear go directly and buy one   who think slavery a crime that we must not say fie on   who hunt if they eer hunt at all with the lion   though they hunt lions also whenever they spy one   who contrive to make every good fortune a wry one   and at last choose the hard bed of honor to die on   whose pedigree traced to earths earliest years   is longer than anything else but their ears   in short he was sent into life with the wrong key   he unlocked the door and stept forth a poor donkey   though kicked and abused by his bipedal betters   yet he filled no mean place in the kingdom of letters   far happier than many a literary hack   he bore only papermill rags on his back   for it makes a vast difference which side the mill   one expends on the paper his labor and skill   so when his soul waited a new transmigration   and destiny balanced twixt this and that station   not having much time to expend upon bothers   remembering hed had some connection with authors   and considering his four legs had grown paralytic   she set him on two and he came forth a critic      through his babyhood no kind of pleasure he took   in any amusement but tearing a book   for him there was no intermediate stage   from babyhood up to straightlaced middle age   there were years when he didnt wear coattails behind   but a boy he could never be rightly defined   like the irish good folk though in length scarce a span   from the womb he came gravely a little old man   while other boys trousers demanded the toil   of the motherly fingers on all kinds of soil   red yellow brown black clayey gravelly loamy   he sat in the corner and read viri romæ   he never was known to unbend or to revel once   in base marbles hockey or kick up the devil once   he was just one of those who excite the benevolence   of your old prigs who sound the souls depths with a ledger   and are on the lookout for some young men to edger        cate as they call it who wont be too costly   and wholl afterward take to the ministry mostly   who always wear spectacles always look bilious   always keep on good terms with each materfamilias   throughout the whole parish and manage to rear   ten boys like themselves on four hundred a year   who fulfilling in turn the same fearful conditions   either preach through their noses or go upon missions      in this way our hero got safely to college   where he bolted alike both his commons and knowledge   a readingmachine always wound up and going   he mastered whatever was not worth the knowing   appeared in a gown and a vest of black satin   to spout such a gothic oration in latin   that tully could never have made out a word in it   though himself was the model the author preferred in it   and grasping the parchment which gave him in fee   all the mystic andsoforths contained in a b   he was launched life is always compared to a sea   with just enough learning and skill for the using it   to prove hed a brain by forever confusing it   so worthy saint benedict piously burning   with the holiest zeal against secular learning   nesciensque scienter as writers express it   indoctusque sapienter â româ recessit     twould be endless to tell you the things that he knew   all separate facts undeniably true   but with him or each other theyd nothing to do   no power of combining arranging discerning   digested the masses he learned into learning   there was one thing in life he had practical knowledge for   and this you will think he need scarce go to college for   not a deed would he do nor a word would he utter   till hed weighed its relations to plain bread and butter   when he left alma mater he practised his wits   in compiling the journals historical bits   of shops broken open men falling in fits   great fortunes in england bequeathed to poor printers   and cold spells the coldest for many past winters   then rising by industry knack and address   got notices up for an unbiassed press   with a mind so wellpoised it seemed equally made for   applause or abuse just which chanced to be paid for   from this point his progress was rapid and sure   to the post of a regular heavy reviewer      and here i must say he wrote excellent articles   on the hebraic points or the force of greek particles   they filled up the space nothing else was prepared for   and nobody read that which nobody cared for   if any old book reached a fiftieth edition   he could fill forty pages with safe erudition   he could gauge the old books by the old set of rules   and his very old nothings pleased very old fools   but give him a new book fresh out of the heart   and you put him at sea without compass or chart   his blunders aspired to the rank of an art   for his lore was engraft something foreign that grew in him   exhausting the sap of the native and true in him   so that when a man came with a soul that was new in him   carving new forms of truth out of natures old granite   new and old at their birth like le verriers planet   which to get a true judgment themselves must create   in the soul of their critic the measure and weight   being rather themselves a fresh standard of grace   to compute their own judge and assign him his place   our reviewer would crawl all about it and round it   and reporting each circumstance just as he found it   without the least malicehis record would be   profoundly æsthetic as that of a flea   which supping on wordsworth should print for our sakes   recollections of nights with the bard of the lakes   or borne by an arab guide ventured to render a   general view of the ruins of denderah      as i said he was never precisely unkind   the defect in his brain was just absence of mind   if he boasted twas simply that he was selfmade   a position which i for one never gainsaid   my respect for my maker supposing a skill   in his works which our hero would answer but ill   and i trust that the mould which he used may be cracked or he   made bold by success may enlarge his phylactery   and set up a kind of a manmanufactory   an event which i shudder to think about seeing   that man is a moral accountable being      he meant well enough but was still in the way   as a dunce always is let him be where he may   indeed they appear to come into existence   to impede other folks with their awkward assistance   if you set up a dunce on the very north pole   all alone with himself i believe on my soul   hed manage to get betwixt somebodys shins   and pitch him down bodily all in his sins   to the grave polar bears sitting round on the ice   all shortening their grace to be in for a slice   or if he found nobody else there to pother   why one of his legs would just trip up the other   for theres nothing we read of in tortures inventions   like a wellmeaning dunce with the best of intentions      a terrible fellow to meet in society   not the toast that he buttered was ever so dry at tea   there hed sit at the table and stir in his sugar   crouching close for a spring all the while like a cougar   be sure of your facts of your measures and weights   of your timehes as fond as an arab of dates   youll be telling perhaps in your comical way   of something youve seen in the course of the day   and just as youre tapering out the conclusion   you venture an illfated classic allusion   the girls have all got their laughs ready when whack   the cougar comes down on your thunderstruck back   you had left out a commayour greeks put in joint   and pointed at cost of your storys whole point   in the course of the evening you venture on certain   soft speeches to anne in the shade of the curtain   you tell her your heart can be likened to one flower   and that oh most charming of women s the sunflower   which turnshere a clear nasal voice to your terror   from outside the curtain says thats all an error   as for him hesno matter he never grew tender   sitting after a ball with his feet on the fender   shaping somebodys sweet features out of cigar smoke   though hed willingly grant you that such doings are smoke   all women he damns with mutabile semper   and if ever he felt something like loves distemper   twas towards a young lady who spoke ancient mexican   and assisted her father in making a lexicon   though i recollect hearing him get quite ferocious   about mary clausum the mistress of grotius   or something of that sortbut no more to bore ye   with characterpainting ill turn to my story      now apollo who finds it convenient sometimes   to get his court clear of the makers of rhymes   the genus i think it is called irritabile   every one of whom thinks himself treated most shabbily   and nurses awhat is itimmedicabile   which keeps him at boilingpoint hot for a quarrel   as bitter as wormwood and sourer than sorrel   if any poor devil but look at a laurel   apollo i say being sick of their rioting   though he sometimes acknowledged their verse had a quieting   effect after dinner and seemed to suggest a   retreat to the shrine of a tranquil siesta   kept our hero at hand who by means of a bray   which he gave to the life drove the rabble away   and if that wouldnt do he was sure to succeed   if he took his review out and offered to read   or failing in plans of this milder description   he would ask for their aid to get up a subscription   considering that authorship wasnt a rich craft   to print the american drama of witchcraft   stay ill read you a scenebut he hardly began   ere apollo shrieked help and the authors all ran   and once when these purgatives acted with less spirit   and the desperate case asked a remedy desperate   he drew from his pocket a foolscap epistle   as calmly as if twere a ninebarrelled pistol   and threatened them all with the judgment to come   of a wandering stars first impressions of rome   stop stop with their hands oer their ears screamed the muses   he may go off and murder himself if he chooses   twas a means selfdefence only sanctioned his trying   tis mere massacre now that the enemys flying   if hes forced to t again and we happen to be there   give us each a large handkerchief soaked in strong   ether      i call this a fable for critics you think its   more like a display of my rhythmical trinkets   my plot like an icicle s slender and slippery   every moment more slender and likely to slip awry   and the reader unwilling in loco desipere   is free to jump over as much of my frippery   as he fancies and if hes a provident skipper he   may have an odyssean sway of the gales   and get safe into port ere his patience all fails   moreover although tis a slender return   for your toil and expense yet my paper will burn   and if you have manfully struggled thus far with me   you may een twist me up and just light your cigar with me   if too angry for that you can tear me in pieces   and my membra disjecta consign to the breezes   a fate like great ratzaus whom one of those bores   who beflead with bad verses poor louis quatorze   describes the first verse somehow ends with victoire   as dispersant partout et ses membres et sa gloire   or if i were overdesirous of earning   a repute among noodles for classical learning   i could pick you a score of allusions i wis   as new as the jests of didaskalos tis   better still i could make out a good solid list   from recondite authors who do not exist   but that would be naughty at least i could twist   something out of absyrtus or turn your inquiries   after miltons prose metaphor drawn from osiris   but as cicero says he wont say this or that   a fetch i must say most transparent and flat   after saying whateer he could possibly think of   i simply will state that i pause on the brink of   a mire ankledeep of deliberate confusion   made up of old jumbles of classic allusion   so when you were thinking yourselves to be pitied   just conceive how much harder your teeth youd have gritted   an t were not for the dulness ive kindly omitted      id apologize here for my many digressions   were it not that im certain to trip into fresh ones   tis so hard to escape if you get in their mesh once   just reflect if you please how tis said by horatius   that mæonides nods now and then and my gracious   it certainly does look a little bit ominous   when he gets under way with ton dapameibomenos   here a something occurs which ill just clap a rhyme to   and say it myself ere a zoilus have time to   any author a nap like van winkles may take   if he only contrive to keep readers awake   but hell very soon find himself laid on the shelf   if they fall a nodding when he nods himself      once for all to return and to stay will i nill i   when phœbus expressed his desire for a lily   our hero whose homœopathic sagacity   with an ocean of zeal mixed his drop of capacity   set off for the garden as fast as the wind   or to take a comparison more to my mind   as a sound politician leaves conscience behind   and leaped the low fence as a party hack jumps   oer his principles when something else turns up trumps      he was gone a long time and apollo meanwhile   went over some sonnets of his with a file   for of all compositions he thought that the sonnet   best repaid all the toil you expended upon it   it should reach with one impulse the end of its course   and for one final blow collect all of its force   not a verse should be salient but each one should tend   with a wavelike upgathering to burst at the end   so condensing the strength here there smoothing a wry kink   he was killing the time when up walked mr    at a few steps behind him a small man in glasses   went dodging about muttering murderers asses   from out of his pocket a paper hed take   with the proud look of martyrdom tied to its stake   and reading a squib at himself hed say here i see   gainst american letters a bloody conspiracy   they are all by my personal enemies written   i must post an anonymous letter to britain   and show that this gall is the merest suggestion   of spite at my zeal on the copyright question   for on this side the water tis prudent to pull   oer the eyes of the public their national wool   by accusing of slavish respect to john bull   all american authors who have more or less   of that antiamerican humbugsuccess   while in private were always embracing the knees   of some twopenny editor over the seas   and licking his critical shoes for you know tis   the whole aim of our lives to get one english notice   my american puffs i would willingly burn all   theyre all from one source monthly weekly diurnal   to get but a kick from a transmarine journal      so culling the gibes of each critical scorner   as if they were plums and himself were jack horner   he came cautiously on peeping round every corner   and into each hole where a weasel might pass in   expecting the knife of some critic assassin   who stabs to the heart with a caricature   not so bad as those daubs of the sun to be sure   yet done with a daggerotype whose vile portraits   disperse all ones good and condense all ones poor traits      apollo looked up hearing footsteps approaching   and slipped out of sight the new rhymes he was broaching   good day mr  im happy to meet   with a scholar so ripe and a critic so neat   who through grubstreet the soul of a gentleman carries   what news from that suburb of london and paris   which latterly makes such shrill claims to monopolize   the credit of being the new worlds metropolis      why nothing of consequence save this attack   on my friend there behind by some pitiful hack   who thinks every national author a poor one   that isnt a copy of something thats foreign   and assaults the american dick                                    nay tis clear   that your damon theres fond of a flea in his ear   and if no one else furnished them gratis on tick   he would buy some himself just to hear the old click   why i honestly think if some fool in japan   should turn up his nose at the poems on man   your friend there by some inward instinct would know it   would get it translated reprinted and show it   as a man might take off a high stock to exhibit   the autograph round his own neck of the gibbet   nor would let it rest so but fire column after column   signed cato or brutus or something as solemn   by way of displaying his critical crosses   and tweaking that poor transatlantic proboscis   his broadsides resulting and this theres no doubt of   in successively sinking the craft theyre fired out of   now nobody knows when an author is hit   if he dont have a public hysterical fit   let him only keep close in his snug garrets dim ether   and nobody d think of his criticsor him either   if an author have any least fibre of worth in him   abuse would but tickle the organ of mirth in him   all the critics on earth cannot crush with their ban   one word thats in tune with the nature of man      well perhaps so meanwhile i have brought you a book   into which if youll just have the goodness to look   you may feel so delighted when you have got through it   as to think it not unworth your while to review it   and i think i can promise your thoughts if you do   a place in the next democratic review      the most thankless of gods you must surely have thought me   for this is the fortyfourth copy youve brought me   i have given them away or at least i have tried   but ive fortytwo left standing all side by side   the man who accepted that one copy died   from one end of a shelf to the other they reach   with the authors respects neatly written in each   the publisher sure will proclaim a te deum   when he hears of that order the british museum   has sent for one set of what books were first printed   in america little or bigfor tis hinted   that this is the first truly tangible hope he   has ever had raised for the sale of a copy   ive thought very often t would be a good thing   in all public collections of books if a wing   were set off by itself like the seas from the dry lands   marked literature suited to desolate islands   and filled with such books as could never be read   save by readers of proofs forced to do it for bread   such books as ones wrecked on in small countrytaverns   such as hermits might mortify over in caverns   such as satan if printing had then been invented   as the climax of woe would to job have presented   such as crusoe might dip in although there are few so   outrageously cornered by fate as poor crusoe   and since the philanthropists just now are banging   and gibbeting all whore in favor of hanging   though cheever has proved that the bible and altar   were let down from heaven at the end of a halter   and that vital religion would dull and grow callous   unrefreshed now and then with a sniff of the gallows   and folks are beginning to think it looks odd   to choke a poor scamp for the glory of god   and that he who esteems the virginia reel   a bait to draw saints from their spiritual weal   and regards the quadrille as a far greater knavery   than crushing his african children with slavery   since all who take part in a waltz or cotillion   are mounted for hell on the devils own pillion   who as every true orthodox christian well knows   approaches the heart through the door of the toes   that he i was saying whose judgments are stored   for such as take steps in despite of his word   should look with delight on the agonized prancing   of a wretch who has not the least ground for his dancing   while the state standing by sings a verse from the psalter   about offering to god on his favorite halter   and when the legs droop from their twitching divergence   sells the clothes to a jew and the corpse to the surgeons      now instead of all this i think i can direct you all   to a criminal code both humane and effectual   i propose to shut up every doer of wrong   with these desperate books for such term short or long   as by statute in such cases made and provided   shall be by your wise legislators decided   thuslet murderers be shut to grow wiser and cooler   at hard labor for life on the works of miss    petty thieves kept from flagranter crimes by their fears   shall peruse yankee doodle a blank term of years   that american punch like the english no doubt   just the sugar and lemons and spirit left out      but stay here comes tityrus griswold and leads on   the flocks whom he first plucks alive and then feeds on   a loudcackling swarm in whose feathers warmdrest   he goes for as perfect aswan as the rest      there comes emerson first whose rich words every one   are like gold nails in temples to hang trophies on   whose prose is grand verse while his verse the lord knows   is some of it pr no tis not even prose   im speaking of metres some poems have welled   from those rare depths of soul that have neer been excelled   they re not epics but that doesnt matter a pin   in creating the only hard thing s to begin   a grassblades no easier to make than an oak   if youve once found the way youve achieved the grand stroke   in the worst of his poems are mines of rich matter   but thrown in a heap with a crash and a clatter   now it is not one thing nor another alone   makes a poem but rather the general tone   the something pervading uniting the whole   the before unconceived unconceivable soul   so that just in removing this trifle or that you   take away as it were a chief limb of the statue   roots wood bark and leaves singly perfect may be   but clapt hodgepodge together they dont make a tree      but to come back to emerson whom by the way   i believe we left waitinghis is we may say   a greek head on right yankee shoulders whose range   has olympus for one pole for tother the exchange   he seems to my thinking although im afraid   the comparison must long ere this have been made   a plotinusmontaigne where the egyptians gold mist   and the gascons shrewd wit cheekbyjowl coexist   all admire and yet scarcely six converts hes got   to i dont nor they either exactly know what   for though he builds glorious temples tis odd   he leaves never a doorway to get in a god   tis refreshing to oldfashioned people like me   to meet such a primitive pagan as he   in whose mind all creation is duly respected   as parts of himselfjust a little projected   and whos willing to worship the stars and the sun   a convert tonothing but emerson   so perfect a balance there is in his head   that he talks of things sometimes as if they were dead   life nature love god and affairs of that sort   he looks at as merely ideas in short   as if they were fossils stuck round in a cabinet   of such vast extent that our earths a mere dab in it   composed just as he is inclined to conjecture her   namely one part pure earth ninetynine parts pure lecturer   you are filled with delight at his clear demonstration   each figure word gesture just fits the occasion   with the quiet precision of science hell sort em   but you cant help suspecting the whole a post mortem      there are persons moleblind to the souls make and style   who insist on a likeness twixt him and carlyle   to compare him with plato would be vastly fairer   carlyles the more burly but e is the rarer   he sees fewer objects but clearlier truelier   if cs as original es more peculiar   that hes more of a man you might say of the one   of the other hes more of an emerson   cs the titan as shaggy of mind as of limb   e the cleareyed olympian rapid and slim   the ones twothirds norseman the other half greek   where the ones most abounding the others to seek   cs generals require to be seen in the mass   es specialties gain if enlarged by the glass   c gives nature and god his own fits of the blues   and rims commonsense things with mystical hues   e sits in a mystery calm and intense   and looks coolly around him with sharp common sense   c shows you how everyday matters unite   with the dim transdiurnal recesses of night   while e in a plain preternatural way   makes mysteries matters of mere every day   c draws all his characters quite à la fuseli   he dont sketch their bundles of muscles and thews illy   but he paints with a brush so untamed and profuse   they seem nothing but bundles of muscles and thews   e is rather like flaxman lines strait and severe   and a colorless outline but full round and clear   to the men he thinks worthy he frankly accords   the design of a white marble statue in words   c labors to get at the centre and then   take a reckoning from there of his actions and men   e calmly assumes the said centre as granted   and given himself has whatever is wanted      he has imitators in scores who omit   no part of the man but his wisdom and wit   who go carefully oer the skyblue of his brain   and when he has skimmed it once skim it again   if at all they resemble him you may be sure it is   because their shoals mirror his mists and obscurities   as a mudpuddle seems deep as heaven for a minute   while a cloud that floats oer is reflected within it      there comes  for instance to see him s rare sport   tread in emersons tracks with legs painfully short   how he jumps how he strains and gets red in the face   to keep step with the mystagogues natural pace   he follows as close as a stick to a rocket   his fingers exploring the prophets each pocket   fie for shame brother bard with good fruit of your own   cant you let neighbor emersons orchards alone   besides tis no use youll not find een a core    has picked up all the windfalls before   they might strip every tree and e never would catch em   his hesperides have no rude dragon to watch em   when they send him a dishfull and ask him to try em   he never suspects how the sly rogues came by em   he wonders why tis there are none such his trees on   and thinks em the best he has tasted this season      yonder calm as a cloud alcott stalks in a dream   and fancies himself in thy groves academe   with the parthenon nigh and the olivetrees oer him   and never a fact to perplex him or bore him   with a snug room at platos when night comes to walk to   and people from morning till midnight to talk to   and from midnight till morning nor snore in their listening   so he muses his face with the joy of it glistening   for his highest conceit of a happiest state is   where theyd live upon acorns and hear him talk gratis   and indeed i believe no man ever talked better   each sentence hangs perfectly poised to a letter   he seems piling words but theres royal dust hid   in the heart of each skypiercing pyramid   while he talks he is great but goes out like a taper   if you shut him up closely with pen ink and paper   yet his fingers itch for em from morning till night   and he thinks he does wrong if he dont always write   in this as in all things a lamb among men   he goes to sure death when he goes to his pen      close behind him is brownson his mouth very full   with attempting to gulp a gregorian bull   who contrives spite of that to pour out as he goes   a stream of transparent and forcible prose   he shifts quite about then proceeds to expound   that tis merely the earth not himself that turns round   and wishes it clearly impressed on your mind   that the weathercock rules and not follows the wind   proving first then as deftly confuting each side   with no doctrine pleased thats not somewhere denied   he lays the denier away on the shelf   and thendown beside him lies gravely himself   hes the salt river boatman who always stands willing   to convey friend or foe without charging a shilling   and so fond of the trip that when leisures to spare   hell row himself up if he cant get a fare   the worst of it is that his logics so strong   that of two sides he commonly chooses the wrong   if there is only one why hell split it in two   and first pummel this half then that black and blue   that white s white needs no proof but it takes a deep fellow   to prove it jetblack and that jetblack is yellow   he offers the true faith to drink in a sieve   when it reaches your lips theres naught left to believe   but a few silly syllo i mean gisms that squat em   like tadpoles oerjoyed with the mud at the bottom      there is willis so natty and jaunty and gay   who says his best things in so foppish a way   with conceits and pet phrases so thickly oerlaying em   that one hardly knows whether to thank him for saying em   overornament ruins both poem and prose   just conceive of a muse with a ring in her nose   his prose had a natural grace of its own   and enough of it too if hed let it alone   but he twitches and jerks so one fairly gets tired   and is forced to forgive where he might have admired   yet whenever it slips away free and unlaced   it runs like a stream with a musical waste   and gurgles along with the liquidest sweep   tis not deep as a river but whod have it deep   in a country where scarcely a village is found   that has not its author sublime and profound   for some one to be slightly shoal is a duty   and williss shallowness makes half his beauty   his prose winds along with a blithe gurgling error   and reflects all of heaven it can see in its mirror   tis a narrowish strip but it is not an artifice   tis the true outofdoors with its genuine hearty phiz   it is nature herself and theres something in that   since most brains reflect but the crown of a hat   no volume i know to read under a tree   more truly delicious than his a l abri   with the shadows of leaves flowing over your book   like rippleshades netting the bed of a brook   with june coming softly your shoulder to look over   breezes waiting to turn every leaf of your book over   and nature to criticise still as you read   the page that bears that is a rare one indeed      hes so innate a cockney that had he been born   where plain bareskin s the only fulldress that is worn   hed have given his own such an air that youd say   t had been made by a tailor to lounge in broadway   his natures a glass of champagne with the foam on t   as tender as fletcher as witty as beaumont   so his best

their belief a believing in nothing at all   or something of that sort i know they all went   for a general union of total dissent   he went a step farther without cough or hem   he frankly avowed he believed not in them   and before he could be jumbled up or prevented   from their orthodox kind of dissent he dissented   there was heresy here you perceive for the right   of privately judging means

christians they bore   with sincerest conviction their chairs to the shore   they brandished their worn theological birches   bade natural progress keep out of the churches   and expected the lines they had drawn to prevail   with the fastrising tide to keep out of their pale   they had formerly dammed the pontifical see   and the same thing they thought would do nicely for p   but he turned up his nose at their murmuring and shamming   and cared shall i say not a d for their damming   so they first read him out of their church and next minute   turned round and declared he had never been in it   but the ban was too small or the man was too big   for he recks not their bells books and candles a fig   he dont look like a man who would stay treated shabbily   sophroniscus sons head oer the features of rabelais   he bangs and bethwacks themtheir backs he salutes   with the whole tree of knowledge torn up by the roots   his sermons with satire are plenteously verjuiced   and he talks in

discourse theyll be bibled or koraned   for hes seized the idea by his martyrdom fired   that all men not orthodox may be inspired   yet tho wisdom profane with his creed he may weave in   he makes it quite clear what he doesnt believe in   while some who decry him think all kingdom come   is a sort of a kind of a species of hum   of which as it were so to speak not a crumb   would be left if we didnt keep carefully mum   and to make a clean breast that tis perfectly plain   that all kinds of wisdom are somewhat profane   now ps creed than this may be lighter or darker   but in one thing tis clear he has faith namelyparker   and this is what makes him the crowddrawing preacher   theres a background of god to each hardworking feature   every word that he speaks has been fierily furnaced   in the blast of a life that has struggled in earnest   there he stands looking more like a ploughman than priest   if not dreadfully awkward not graceful at least   his gestures all downright and same if you will   as of brownfisted hobnail in hoeing a drill   but his periods fall on you stroke after stroke   like the blows of a lumberer felling an oak   you forget the man wholly youre thankful to meet   with a preacher who smacks of the field and the street   and to hear youre not overparticular whence   almost taylors profusion quite latimers sense      there is bryant as quiet as cool and as dignified   as a smooth silent iceberg that never is ignified   save when by reflection tis kindled o nights   with a semblance of flame by the chill northern lights   he may rank griswold says so first bard of your nation   theres no doubt that he stands in supreme iceolation   your topmost parnassus he may set his heel on   but no warm applauses come peal following peal on   hes too smooth and too polished to hang any zeal on   unqualified merits ill grant if you choose he has em   but he lacks the one merit of kindling enthusiasm   if he stir you at all it is just on my soul   like being stirred up with the very north pole      he is very nice reading in summer but inter   nos we dont want extra freezing in winter   take him up in the depth of july my advice is   when you feel an egyptian devotion to ices   but deduct all you can theres enough thats right good in him   he has a true soul for field river and wood in him   and his heart in the midst of brick walls or whereer it is   glows softens and thrills with the tenderest charities   to you mortals that delve in this traderidden planet   no to old berkshires hills with their limestone and granite   if youre one who in loco add foco here desipis   you will get of his outermost heart as i guess a piece   but youd get deeper down if you came as a precipice   and would break the last seal of its inwardest fountain   if you only could palm yourself off for a mountain   mr quivis or somebody quite as discerning   some scholar whos hourly expecting his learning   calls b the american wordsworth but wordsworth   is worth near as much as your whole tuneful herds worth   no dont be absurd hes an excellent bryant   but my friends youll endanger the life of your client   by attempting to stretch him up into a giant   if you choose to compare him i think there are two per   sons fit for a parallelthomson and cowperc   i dont mean exactlytheres something of each   theres ts love of nature cs penchant to preach   just mix up their minds so that cs spice of craziness   shall balance and neutralize ts turn for laziness   and it gives you a brain cool quite frictionless quiet   whose internal police nips the buds of all riot   a brain like a permanent straitjacket put on   the heart which strives vainly to burst off a button   a brain which without being slow or mechanic   does more than a larger less drilled more volcanic   hes a cowper condensed with no craziness bitten   and the advantage that wordsworth before him has written    footnote c      to demonstrate quickly and easily how per      versely absurd tis to sound this name cowper      as people in general call him named super      i just add that he rhymes it himself with horsetrooper       but my dear little bardlings dont prick up your ears   nor suppose i would rank you and bryant as peers   if i call him an iceberg i dont mean to say   there is nothing in that which is grand in its way   he is almost the one of your poets that knows   how much grace strength and dignity lie in repose   if he sometimes fall short he is too wise to mar   his thoughts modest fulness by going too far   twould be well if your authors should all make a trial   of what virtue there is in severe selfdenial   and measure their writings by hesiods staff   which teaches that all have less value than half      there is whittier whose swelling and vehement heart   strains the straitbreasted drab of the quaker apart   and reveals the live man still supreme and erect   underneath the bemummying wrappers of sect   there was neer a man born who had more of the swing   of the true lyric bard and all that kind of thing   and his failures arise though perhaps he dont know it   from the very same cause that has made him a poet   a fervor of mind which knows no separation   twixt simple excitement and pure inspiration   as my pythoness erst sometimes erred from not knowing   if twere i or mere wind through her tripod was blowing   let his mind once get head in its favorite direction   and the torrent of verse bursts the dams of reflection   while borne with the rush of the metre along   the poet may chance to go right or go wrong   content with the whirl and delirium of song   then his grammars not always correct nor his rhymes   and hes prone to repeat his own lyrics sometimes   not his best though for those are struck off at whiteheats   when the heart in his breast like a triphammer beats   and can neer be repeated again any more   than they could have been carefully plotted before   like old whatshisname there at the battle of hastings   who however gave more than mere rhythmical bastings   our quaker leads off metaphorical fights   for reform and whatever they call human rights   both singing and striking in front of the war   and hitting his foes with the mallet of thor   anne haec one exclaims on beholding his knocks   vestis filii tui o leatherclad fox   can that be thy son in the battles mid din   preaching brotherly love and then driving it in   to the brain of the tough old goliah of sin   with the smoothest of pebbles from castalys spring   impressed on his hard moral sense with a sling      all honor and praise to the righthearted bard   who was true to the voice when such service was hard   who himself was so free he dared sing for the slave   when to look but a protest in silence was brave   all honor and praise to the women and men   who spoke out for the dumb and the downtrodden then   i need not to name them already for each   i see history preparing the statue and niche   they were harsh but shall you be so shocked at hard words   who have beaten your pruninghooks up into swords   whose rewards and hurrahs men are surer to gain   by the reaping of men and of women than grain   why should you stand aghast at their fierce wordy war if   you scalp one another for bank or for tariff   your calling them cutthroats and knaves all day long   dont prove that the use of hard language is wrong   while the worlds heart beats quicker to think of such men   as signed tyrannys doom with a bloody steelpen   while on fourthofjulys beardless orators fright one   with hints at harmodius and aristogeiton   you need not look shy at your sisters and brothers   who stab with sharp words for the freedom of others   no a wreath twine a wreath for the loyal and true   who for the sake of the many dared stand with the few   not of bloodspattered laurel for enemies braved   but of broad peaceful oakleaves for citizens saved      here comes dana abstractedly loitering along   involved in a paulopostfuture of song   wholl be going to write whatll never be written   till the muse ere he thinks of it gives him the mitten   who is so well aware of how things should be done   that his own works displease him before theyre begun   who so well all that makes up good poetry knows   that the best of his poems is written in prose   all saddled and bridled stood pegasus waiting   he was booted and spurred but he loitered debating   in a very grave question his soul was immersed   which foot in the stirrup he ought to put first   and while this point and that he judicially dwelt on   he somehow or other had written paul felton   whose beauties or faults whichsoever you see there   youll allow only genius could hit upon either   that he once was the idle man none will deplore   but i fear he will never be anything more   the ocean of song heaves and glitters before him   the depth and the vastness and longing sweep oer him   he knows every breaker and shoal on the chart   he has the coast pilot and so on by heart   yet he spends his whole life like the man in the fable   in learning to swim on his librarytable      there swaggers john neal who has wasted in maine   the sinews and chords of his pugilist brain   who might have been poet but that in its stead he   preferred to believe that he was so already   too hasty to wait till arts ripe fruit should drop   he must pelt down an unripe and colicky crop   who took to the law and had this sterling plea for it   it required him to quarrel and paid him a fee for it   a man whos made less than he might have because   he always has thought himself more than he was   who with very good natural gifts as a bard   broke the strings of his lyre out by striking too hard   and cracked half the notes of a truly fine voice   because song drew less instant attention than noise   ah men do not know how much strength is in poise   that he goes the farthest who goes far enough   and that all beyond that is just bother and stuff   no vain man matures he makes too much new wood   his blooms are too thick for the fruit to be good   tis the modest man ripens tis he that achieves   just whats needed of sunshine and shade he receives   grapes to mellow require the cool dark of their leaves   neal wants balance he throws his mind always too far   whisking out flocks of comets but never a star   he has so much muscle and loves so to show it   that he strips himself naked to prove hes a poet   and to show he could leap arts wide ditch if he tried   jumps clean oer it and into the hedge tother side   he has strength but theres nothing about him in keeping   one gets surelier onward by walking than leaping   he has used his own sinews himself to distress   and had done vastly more had he done vastly less   in letters too soon is as bad as too late   could he only have waited he might have been great   but he plumped into helicon up to the waist   and muddied the stream ere he took his first taste      there is hawthorne with genius so shrinking and rare   that you hardly at first see the strength that is there   a frame so robust with a nature so sweet   so earnest so graceful so solid so fleet   is worth a descent from olympus to meet   tis as if a rough oak that for ages had stood   with his gnarled bony branches like ribs of the wood   should bloom after cycles of struggle and scathe   with a single anemone trembly and rathe   his strength is so tender his wildness so meek   that a suitable parallel sets one to seek   hes a john bunyan fouqué a puritan tieck   when nature was shaping him clay was not granted   for making so fullsized a man as she wanted   so to fill out her model a little she spared   from some finergrained stuff for a woman prepared   and she could not have hit a more excellent plan   for making him fully and perfectly man   the success of her scheme gave her so much delight   that she tried it again shortly after in dwight   only while she was kneading and shaping the clay   she sang to her work in her sweet childish way   and found when shed put the last touch to his soul   that the music had somehow got mixed with the whole      heres cooper whos written six volumes to show   hes as good as a lord well lets grant that hes so   if a person prefer that description of praise   why a coronets certainly cheaper than bays   but he need take no pains to convince us hes not   as his enemies say the american scott   choose any twelve men and let c read aloud   that one of his novels of which hes most proud   and id lay any bet that without ever quitting   their box theyd be all to a man for acquitting   he has drawn you one character though that is new   one wildflower hes plucked that is wet with the dew   of this fresh western world and the thing not to mince   he has done naught but copy it ill ever since   his indians with proper respect be it said   are just natty bumpo daubed over with red   and his very long toms are the same useful nat   rigged up in duck pants and a souwester hat   though once in a coffin a good chance was found   to have slipt the old fellow away underground   all his other menfigures are clothes upon sticks   the dernière chemise of a man in a fix   as a captain besieged when his garrisons small   sets up caps upon poles to be seen oer the wall   and the women he draws from one model dont vary   all sappy as maples and flat as a prairie   when a characters wanted he goes to the task   as a cooper would do in composing a cask   he picks out the staves of their qualities heedful   just hoops them together as tight as is needful   and if the best fortune should crown the attempt he   has made at the most something wooden and empty      dont suppose i would underrate coopers abilities   if i thought youd do that i should feel very ill at ease   the men who have given to one character life   and objective existence are not very rife   you may number them all both prosewriters and singers   without overrunning the bounds of your fingers   and natty wont go to oblivion quicker   than adams the parson or primrose the vicar      there is one thing in cooper i like too and that is   that on manners he lectures his countrymen gratis   not precisely so either because for a rarity   he is paid for his tickets in unpopularity   now he may overcharge his american pictures   but youll grant theres a good deal of truth in his strictures   and i honor the man who is willing to sink   half his present repute for the freedom to think   and when he has thought be his cause strong or weak   will risk t other half for the freedom to speak   caring naught for what vengeance the mob has in store   let that mob be the upper ten thousand or lower      there are truths you americans need to be told   and it neverll refute them to swagger and scold   john bull looking oer the atlantic in choler   at your aptness for trade says you worship the dollar   but to scorn such idollartrys what very few do   and john goes to that church as often as you do   no matter what john says dont try to outcrow him   tis enough to go quietly on and outgrow him   like most fathers bull hates to see number one   displacing himself in the mind of his son   and detests the same faults in himself hed neglected   when he sees them again in his childs glass reflected   to love one another youre too like by half   if he is a bull you re a pretty stout calf   and tear your own pasture for naught but to show   what a nice pair of horns youre beginning to grow      there are one or two things i should just like to hint   for you dont often get the truth told you in print   the most of you this is what strikes all beholders   have a mental and physical stoop in the shoulders   though you ought to be free as the winds and the waves   youve the gait and the manners of runaway slaves   tho you brag of your new world you dont half believe in it   and as much of the old as is possible weave in it   your goddess of freedom a tight buxom girl   with lips like a cherry and teeth like a pearl   with eyes bold as herès and hair floating free   and full of the sun as the spray of the sea   who can sing at a husking or romp at a shearing   who can trip through the forests alone without fearing   who can drive home the cows with a song through the grass   keeps glancing aside into europes cracked glass   hides her red hands in gloves pinches up her lithe waist   and makes herself wretched with transmarine taste   she loses her fresh country charm when she takes   any mirror except her own rivers and lakes      you steal englishmens books and think englishmens thought   with their salt on her tail your wild eagle is caught   your literature suits its each whisper and motion   to what will be thought of it over the ocean   the cast clothes of europe your statesmanship tries   and mumbles again the old blarneys and lies   forget europe wholly your veins throb with blood   to which the dull current in hers is but mud   let her sneer let her say your experiment fails   in her voice theres a tremble een now while she rails   and your shore will soon be in the nature of things   covered thick with gilt driftwood of runaway kings   where alone as it were in a longfellows waif   her fugitive pieces will find themselves safe   o my friends thank your god if you have one that he   twixt the old world and you set the gulf of a sea   be strongbacked brownhanded upright as your pines   by the scale of a hemisphere shape your designs   be true to yourselves and this new nineteenth age   as a statue by powers or a picture by page   plough sail forge build carve paint all things make new   to your own newworld instincts contrive to be true   keep your ears open wide to the futures first call   be whatever you will but yourselves first of all   stand fronting the dawn on toils heavenscaling peaks   and become my new race of more practical greeks   hem your likeness at present i shudder to tell ot   is that you have your slaves and the greek had his helot      here a gentleman present who had in his attic   more pepper than brains shriekedthe mans a fanatic   im a capital tailor with warm tar and feathers   and will make him a suit thatll serve in all weathers   but well argue the point first im willing to reasont   palaver before condemnations but decent   so through my humble person humanity begs   of the friends of true freedom a loan of bad eggs   but apollo let one such a look of his show forth   as when ἤϊε νύκτι ἐοικώς and so forth   and the gentleman somehow slunk out of the way   but as he was going gained courage to say   at slavery in the abstract my whole soul rebels   i am as strongly opposed tot as any one else   ay no doubt but whenever ive happened to meet   with a wrong or a crime it is always concrete   answered phœbus severely then turning to us   the mistake of such fellows as just made the fuss   is only in taking a great busy nation   for a part of their pitiful cottonplantation   but there comes miranda zeus where shall i flee to   she has such a penchant for bothering me too   she always keeps asking if i dont observe a   particular likeness twixt her and minerva   she tells me my efforts in verse are quite clever   shes been travelling now and will be worse than ever   one would think though a sharpsighted noter shed be   of all thats worth mentioning over the sea   for a woman must surely see well if she try   the whole of whose beings a capital i   she will take an old notion and make it her own   by saying it oer in her sibylline tone   or persuade you tis something tremendously deep   by repeating it so as to put you to sleep   and she well may defy any mortal to see through it   when once she has mixed up her infinite me through it   there is one thing she owns in her own single right   it is native and genuinenamely her spite   though when acting as censor she privately blows   a censer of vanity neath her own nose      here miranda came up and said phœbus you know   that the infinite soul has its infinite woe   as i ought to know having lived cheek by jowl   since the day i was born with the infinite soul   i myself introduced i myself i alone   to my lands better life authors solely my own   who the sad heart of earth on their shoulders have taken   whose works sound a depth by lifes quiet unshaken   such as shakspeare for instance the bible and bacon   not to mention my own works times nadir is fleet   and as for myself im quite out of conceit      quite out of conceit im enchanted to hear it   cried apollo aside whod have thought she was near it   to be sure one is apt to exhaust those commodities   he uses too fast yet in this case as odd it is   as if neptune should say to his turbots and whitings   im as much out of salt as mirandas own writings   which as she in her own happy manner has said   sound a depth for tis one of the functions of lead   she often has asked me if i could not find   a place somewhere near me that suited her mind   i know but a single one vacant which she   with her rare talent that way would fit to a t   and it would not imply any pause or cessation   in the work she esteems her peculiar vocation   she may enter on duty today if she chooses   and remain tiringwoman for life to the muses      miranda meanwhile has succeeded in driving   up into a corner in spite of their striving   a small flock of terrified victims and there   with an iturnthecrankoftheuniverse air   and a tone which at least to my fancy appears   not so much to be entering as boxing your ears   is unfolding a tale of herself i surmise   for tis dotted as thick as a peacocks with is   apropos of miranda ill rest on my oars   and drift through a trifling digression on bores   for though not wearing earrings in more majorum   our ears are kept bored just as if we still wore em   there was one feudal custom worth keeping at least   roasted bores made a part of each wellordered feast   and of all quiet pleasures the very ne plus   was in hunting wild bores as the tame ones hunt us   archæologians i know who have personal fears   of this wise application of hounds and of spears   have tried to make out with a zeal more than wonted   twas a kind of wild swine that our ancestors hunted   but ill never believe that the age which has strewn   europe oer with cathedrals and otherwise shown   that it knew what was what could by chance not have known   spending too its chief time with its buff on no doubt   which beast twould improve the world most to thin out   i divide bores myself in the manner of rifles   into two great divisions regardless of trifles   theres your smoothbore and screwbore who do not much vary   in the weight of cold lead they respectively carry   the smoothbore is one in whose essence the mind   not a corner nor cranny to cling by can find   you feel as in nightmares sometimes when you slip   down a steep slated roof where theres nothing to grip   you slide and you slide the blank horror increases   you had rather by far be at once smashed to pieces   you fancy a whirlpool below white and frothing   and finally drop off and light uponnothing   the screwbore has twists in him faint predilections   for going just wrong in the tritest directions   when hes wrong he is flat when hes right he cant show it   hell tell you what snooks said about the new poetd   or how fogrum was outraged by tennysons princess   he has spent all his spare time and intellect since his   birth in perusing on each art and science   just the books in which no one puts any reliance   and though nemo were told horis omnibus sapit   the rule will not fit him however you shape it   for he has a perennial foison of sappiness   he has just enough force to spoil half your days happiness   and to make him a sort of mosquito to be with   but just not enough to dispute or agree with    footnote d      if you call snooks an owl he will show by his looks      that hes morally certain youre jealous of snooks      these sketches i made not to be too explicit   from two honest fellows who made me a visit   and broke like the tale of the bear and the fiddle   my reflections on halleck short off by the middle   i shall not now go into the subject more deeply   for i notice that some of my readers look sleeply   i will barely remark that mongst civilized nations   theres none that displays more exemplary patience   under all sorts of boring at all sorts of hours   from all sorts of desperate persons than ours   not to speak of our papers our state legislatures   and other such trials for sensitive natures   just look for a moment at congressappalled   my fancy shrinks back from the phantom it called   why theres scarcely a member unworthy to frown   neath what fourier nicknames the boreal crown   only think what that infinite borepowr could do   if applied with a utilitarian view   suppose for example we shipped it with care   to saharas great desert and let it bore there   if they held one short session and did nothing else   theyd fill the whole waste with artesian wells   but tis time now with pen phonographic to follow   through some more of his sketches our laughing apollo      there comes harry franco and as he draws near   you find thats a smile which you took for a sneer   one half of him contradicts tother his wont   is to say very sharp things and do very blunt   his manners as hard as his feelings are tender   and a sortie hell make when he means to surrender   hes in joke half the time when he seems to be sternest   when he seems to be joking be sure hes in earnest   he has common sense in a way thats uncommon   hates humbug and cant loves his friends like a woman   builds his dislikes of cards and his friendships of oak   loves a prejudice better than aught but a joke   is half upright quaker half downright comeouter   loves freedom too well to go stark mad about her   quite artless himself is a lover of art   shuts you out of his secrets and into his heart   and though not a poet yet all must admire   in his letters of pinto his skill on the liar      there comes poe with his raven like barnaby rudge   threefifths of him genius and twofifths sheer fudge   who talks like a book of iambs and pentameters   in a way to make people of commonsense damn metres   who has written some things quite the best of their kind   but the heart somehow seems all squeezed out by the mind   whobut heyday whats this messieurs mathews and poe   you mustnt fling mudballs at longfellow so   does it make a man worse that his characters such   as to make his friends love him as you think too much   why there is not a bard at this moment alive   more willing than he that his fellows should thrive   while you are abusing him thus even now   he would help either one of you out of a slough   you may say that hes smooth and all that till youre hoarse   but remember that elegance also is force   after polishing granite as much as you will   the heart keeps its tough old persistency still   deduct all you can that still keeps you at bay   why hell live till men weary of collins and gray   im not overfond of greek metres in english   to me rhymes a gain so it be not too jinglish   and your modern hexameter verses are no more   like greek ones than sleek mr pope is like homer   as the roar of the sea to the coo of a pigeon is   so compared to your moderns sounds old melesigenes   i may be too partial the reason perhaps otis   that ive heard the old blind man recite his own rhapsodies   and my ear with that music impregnate may be   like the poor exiled shell with the soul of the sea   or as one cant bear strauss when his nature is cloven   to its deeps within deeps by the stroke of beethoven   but set that aside and tis truth that i speak   had theocritus written in english not greek   i believe that his exquisite sense would scarce change a line   in that rare tender virginlike pastoral evangeline   thats not ancient nor modern its place is apart   where time has no sway in the realm of pure art   tis a shrine of retreat from earths hubbub and strife   as quiet and chaste as the authors own life      there comes philothea her face all aglow   she has just been dividing some poor creatures woe   and cant tell which pleases her most to relieve   his want or his story to hear and believe   no doubt against many deep griefs she prevails   for her ear is the refuge of destitute tales   she knows well that silence is sorrows best food   and that talking draws off from the heart its black blood   so shell listen with patience and let you unfold   your bundle of rags as twere pure cloth of gold   which indeed it all turns to as soon as shes touched it   and to borrow a phrase from the nursery muched it   she has such a musical taste she will go   any distance to hear one who draws a long bow   she will swallow a wonder by mere might and main   and thinks it geometrys fault if shes fain   to consider things flat inasmuch as theyre plain   facts with her are accomplished as frenchmen would say   they will prove all she wishes them toeither way   and as fact lies on this side or that we must try   if were seeking the truth to find where it dont lie   i was telling her once of a marvellous aloe   that for thousands of years had looked spindling and sallow   and though nursed by the fruitfullest powers of mud   had never vouchsafed een so much as a bud   till its owner remarked as a sailor you know   often will in a calm that it never would blow   for he wished to exhibit the plant and designed   that its blowing should help him in raising the wind   at last it was told him that if he should water   its roots with the blood of his unmarried daughter   who was born as her mother a calvinist said   with a baxters effectual caul on her head   it would blow as the obstinate breeze did when by a   like decree of her father died iphigenia   at first he declared he himself would be blowed   ere his conscience with such a foul crime he would load   but the thought coming oft grew less dark than before   and he mused as each creditor knocked at his door   if this were but done they would dun me no more   i told philothea his struggles and doubts   and how he considered the ins and the outs   of the visions he had and the dreadful dyspepsy   how he went to the seer that lives at pokeepsie   how the seer advised him to sleep on it first   and to read his big volume in case of the worst   and further advised he should pay him five dollars   for writing dum dum on his wristbands and collars   three years and ten days these dark words he had studied   when the daughter was missed and the aloe had budded   i told how he watched it grow large and more large   and wondered how much for the show he should charge   she had listened with utter indifference to this till   i told how it bloomed and discharging its pistil   with an aim the eumenides dictated shot   the botanical filicide dead on the spot   it had blown but he reaped not his horrible gains   for it blew with such force as to blow out his brains   and the crime was blown also because on the wad   which was paper was writ visitation of god   as well as a thrilling account of the deed   which the coroner kindly allowed me to read      well my friend took this story up just to be sure   as one might a poor foundling thats laid at ones door   she combed it and washed it and clothed it and fed it   and as if t were her own child most tenderly bred it   laid the scene of the legend i mean far away a   mong the green vales underneath himalaya   and by artistlike touches laid on here and there   made the whole thing so touching i frankly declare   i have read it all thrice and perhaps i am weak   but i found every time there were tears on my cheek      the pole

something they call illustrations to wit   like those with which chapman obscured holy write   which are said to illustrate because as i view it   like lucus a non they precisely dont do it   let a man who can write what himself understands   keep clear if he can of designing mens hands   who bury the sense if theres any worth having   and then very honestly call it engraving   but to quit badinage which there isnt much wit in   hallecks better i doubt not than all he has written   in his verse a clear glimpse you will frequently find   if not of a great of a fortunate mind   which contrives to be true to its natural loves   in a world of backoffices ledgers and stoves   when his heart breaks away from the brokers and banks   and kneels in its own private shrine to give thanks   theres a genial manliness in him that earns   our sincerest respect read for instance his burns   and we cant but regret seek excuse where we may   that so much of a man has been peddled away

 each charging the others with envies and jealousies   by the way tis a fact that displays what profusions   of all kinds of greatness bless free institutions   that while the old world has produced barely eight   of such poets as all men agree to call great   and of other great characters hardly a score   one might safely say less than that rather than more   with you every year a whole crop is

offers an excellent text   ill give em some brief hints on criticism next   so musing a moment he turned to the crowd   and clearing his voice spoke as follows aloud      my friends in the happier days of the muse   we were luckily free from such things as reviews   then naught came between with its fog to make clearer   the heart of the poet to that of his hearer   then the poet brought heaven to the people and they   felt that they too were poets in hearing his lay   then the poet was prophet the past in his soul   precreated the future both parts of one whole   then for him there was nothing too great or too small   for one natural deity sanctified all   then the bard owned no clipper and meter of moods   save the spirit of silence that hovers and broods   oer the seas and the mountains the rivers and woods   he asked not earths verdict forgetting the clods   his soul soared and sang to an audience of gods   twas for them that he measured the thought and the line   and shaped for their vision the perfect design   with as glorious a foresight a balance as true   as swung out the worlds in the infinite blue   then a glory and greatness invested mans heart   the universal which now stands estranged and apart   in the free individual moulded was art   then the forms of the artist seemed thrilled with desire   for something as yet unattained fuller higher   as once with her lips lifted hands and eyes listening   and her whole upward soul in her countenance glistening   eurydice stoodlike a beacon unfired   which once touchd with flame will leap heavnward inspired   and waited with answering kindle to mark   the first gleam of orpheus that pained the red dark   then painting song sculpture did more than relieve   the need that men feel to create and believe   and as in all beauty who listens with love   hears these words oft repeatedbeyond and above   so these seemed to be but the visible sign   of the grasp of the soul after things more divine   they were ladders the artist erected to climb   oer the narrow horizon of space and of time   and we see there the footsteps by which men had gained   to the one rapturous glimpse of the neverattained   as shepherds could erst sometimes trace in the sod   the last spurning print of a skycleaving god      but now on the poets disprivacied moods   with do this and do that the pert critic intrudes   while he thinks hes been barely fulfilling his duty   to interpret twixt men and their own sense of beauty   and has striven while others sought honor or pelf   to make his kind happy as he was himself   he finds hes been guilty of horrid offences   in all kinds of moods numbers genders and tenses   hes been ob and subjective what kettle calls pot   precisely at all events what he ought not   you have done this says one judge done that says another   you should have done this grumbles one that says t other   never mind what he touches one shrieks out taboo   and while he is wondering what he shall do   since each suggests opposite topics for song   they all shout together youre right and youre wrong      nature fits all her children with something to do   he who would write and cant write can surely review   can set up a small booth as critic and sell us his   petty conceit and his pettier jealousies   thus a lawyers apprentice just out of his teens   will do for the jeffrey of six magazines   having read johnsons lives of the poets half through   theres nothing on earth hes not competent to   he reviews with as much nonchalance as he whistles   he goes through a book and just picks out the thistles   it matters not whether he blame or commend   if hes bad as a foe hes far worse as a friend   let an author but write whats above his poor scope   and hell go to work gravely and twist up a rope   and inviting the world to see punishment done   hang himself up to bleach in the wind and the sun   tis delightful to see when a man comes along   who has anything in him peculiar and strong   every cockboat that swims clear its fierce pop gundeck at him   and make as he passes its ludicrous peck at him    here miranda came up and began as to that   apollo at once seized his gloves cane and hat   and seeing the place getting rapidly cleared   i too snatched my notes and forthwith disappeared                               the biglow papers                        notices of an independent press   i have observed reader bene or malevolent as it may happen that it is customary to append to the second editions of books and to the second works of authors short sentences commendatory of the first under the title of notices of the press these i have been given to understand are procurable at certain established rates payment being made either in money or advertising patronage by the publisher or by an adequate outlay of servility on the part of the author considering these things with myself and also that such notices are neither intended nor generally believed to convey any real opinions being a purely ceremonial accompaniment of literature and resembling certificates to the virtues of various morbiferal panaceas i conceived that it would be not only more economical to prepare a sufficient number of such myself but also more immediately subservient to the end in view to prefix them to this our primary edition rather than await the contingency of a second when they would seem to be of small utility to delay attaching the bobs until the second attempt at flying the kite would indicate but a slender experience in that useful art neither has it escaped my notice nor failed to afford me matter of reflection that when a circus or a caravan is about to visit jaalam the initial step is to send forward large and highly ornamented bills of performance to be hung in the barroom and the postoffice these having been sufficiently gazed at and beginning to lose their attractiveness except for the flies and truly the boys also in whom i find it impossible to repress even during schoolhours certain oral and telegraphic communications concerning the expected show upon some fine morning the band enters in a gaylypainted wagon or triumphal chariot and with noisy advertisement by means of brass wood and sheepskin makes the circuit of our startled villagestreets then as the exciting sounds draw nearer and nearer do i desiderate those eyes of aristarchus whose looks were as a breeching to a boy then do i perceive with vain regret of wasted opportunities the advantage of a pancratic or pantechnic education since he is most reverenced by my little subjects who can throw the cleanest summerset or walk most securely upon the revolving cask the story of the pied piper becomes for the first time credible to me albeit confirmed by the hameliners dating their legal instruments from the period of his exit as i behold how those strains without pretence of magical potency bewitch the pupillary legs nor leave to the pedagogic an entire selfcontrol for these reasons lest my kingly prerogative should suffer diminution i prorogue my restless commons whom i also follow into the street chiefly lest some mischief may chance befall them after the manner of such a band i send forward the following notices of domestic manufacture to make brazen proclamation not unconscious of the advantage which will accrue if our little craft cymbula sutilis shall seem to leave port with a clipping breeze and to carry in nautical phrase a bone in her mouth nevertheless i have chosen as being more equitable to prepare some also sufficiently objurgatory that readers of every taste may find a dish to their palate i have modelled them upon actually existing specimens preserved in my own cabinet of natural curiosities one in particular i had copied with tolerable exactness from a notice of one of my own discourses which from its superior tone and appearance of vast experience i concluded to have been written by a man at least three hundred years of age though i recollected no existing instance of such antediluvian longevity nevertheless i afterwards discovered the author to be a young gentleman preparing for the ministry under the direction of one of my brethren in a neighboring town and whom i had once instinctively corrected in a latin quantity but this i have been forced to omit from its too great lengthh w                   from the universal littery universe  full of passages which rivet the attention of the reader under a rustic garb sentiments are conveyed which should be committed to the memory and engraven on the heart of every moral and social being we consider this a unique performance we hope to see it soon introduced into our common schools mr wilbur has performed his duties as editor with excellent taste and judgment this is a vein which we hope to see successfully prosecuted we hail the appearance of this work as a long stride toward the formation of a purely aboriginal indigenous native and american literature we rejoice to meet with an author national enough to break away from the slavish deference too common among us to english grammar and orthography where all is so good we are at a loss how to make extracts on the whole we may call it a volume which no library pretending to entire completeness should fail to place upon its shelves              from the higginbottomopolis snappingturtle  a collection of the merest balderdash and doggerel that it was ever our bad fortune to lay eyes on the author is a vulgar buffoon and the editor a talkative tedious old fool we use strong language but should any of our readers peruse the book from which calamity heaven preserve them they will find reasons for it thick as the leaves of vallumbrozer or to use a still more expressive comparison as the combined heads of author and editor the work is wretchedly got up we should like to know how much british gold was pocketed by this libeller of our country and her purest patriots                     from the oldfogrumville mentor  we have not had time to do more than glance through this handsomely printed volume but the name of its respectable editor the rev mr wilbur of jaalam will afford a sufficient guaranty for the worth of its contents the paper is white the type clear and the volume of a convenient and attractive size in reading this elegantly executed work it has seemed to us that a passage or two might have been retrenched with advantage and that the general style of diction was susceptible of a higher polish on the whole we may safely leave the ungrateful task of criticism to the reader we will barely suggest that in volumes intended as this is for the illustration of a provincial dialect and turns of expression a dash of humor or satire might be thrown in with advantage the work is admirably got up this work will form an appropriate ornament to the centretable it is beautifully printed on paper of an excellent quality                         from the dekay bulwark  we should be wanting in our duty as the conductor of that tremendous engine a public press as an american and as a man did we allow such an opportunity as is presented to us by the biglow papers to pass by without entering our earnest protest against such attempts now alas too common at demoralizing the public sentiment under a wretched mask of stupid drollery slavery war the social glass and in short all the valuable and timehonored institutions justly dear to our common humanity and especially to republicans are made the butt of coarse and senseless ribaldry by this lowminded scribbler it is time that the respectable and religious portion of our community should be aroused to the alarming inroads of foreign jacobinism sansculottism and infidelity it is a fearful proof of the widespread nature of this contagion that these secret stabs at religion and virtue are given from under the cloak credite posteri of a clergyman it is a mournful spectacle indeed to the patriot and christian to see liberality and new ideas falsely so calledthey are as old as eden invading the sacred precincts of the pulpit on the whole we consider this volume as one of the first shocking results which we predicted would spring out of the late french revolution             from the bungtown copper and comprehensive tocsin                    a tryweakly family journal  altogether an admirable work full of humor boisterous but delicateof wit withering and scorching yet combined with a pathos cool as morning dewof satire ponderous as the mace of richard yet keen as the scymitar of saladin a work full of mountainmirth mischievous as puck and lightsome as ariel we know not whether to admire most the genial fresh and discursive concinnity of the author or his playful fancy weird imagination and compass of style at once both objective and subjective we might indulge in some criticisms but were the author other than he is he would be a different being as it is he has a wonderful pose which flits from flower to flower and bears the reader irresistibly along on its eagle pinions like ganymede to the highest heaven of invention we love a book so purely objective many of his pictures of natural scenery have an extraordinary subjective clearness and fidelity in fine we consider this as one of the most extraordinary volumes of this or any age we know of no english author who could have written it it is a work to which the proud genius of our country standing with one foot on the aroostook and the other on the rio grande and holding up the starspangled banner amid the wreck of matter and the crush of worlds may point with bewildering scorn of the punier efforts of enslaved europe we hope soon to encounter our author among those higher walks of literature in which he is evidently capable of achieving enduring fame already we should be inclined to assign him a high position in the bright galaxy of our american bards              from the saltriver pilot and flag of freedom  a volume in bad grammar and worse taste while the pieces here collected were confined to their appropriate sphere in the corners of obscure newspapers we considered them wholly beneath contempt but as the author has chosen to come forward in this public manner he must expect the lash he so richly merits contemptible slanders vilest billingsgate has

to our readers by his sprightly letters from abroad which have graced our columns called at our office yesterday we learn from him that having enjoyed the distinguished privilege while in germany of an introduction to the celebrated von humbug he took the opportunity to present that eminent man with a copy of the biglow papers the next morning he received the following note which he has kindly furnished us for publication we prefer to print it verbatim knowing that our readers will readily forgive the few errors into which the illustrious writer has fallen through ignorance of our language

have escaped the attentive eye that i have on the titlepage omitted those honorary appendages to the editorial name which not only add greatly to the value of every book but whet and exacerbate the appetite of the reader for not only does he surmise that an honorary membership of literary and scientific societies implies a certain amount of necessary distinction on the part of the recipient of such decorations but he is willing to trust himself more entirely to an author who writes under the fearful responsibility of involving the reputation of such bodies as the s archœl dahom or the acad lit et scient kamtschat i cannot but think that the early editions of shakspeare and milton would have met with more rapid and general acceptance but for the barrenness of their respective titlepages and i believe that even now a publisher of the works of either of those justly distinguished men would find his account in procuring their admission to the membership of learned bodies on the continenta proceeding no whit more incongruous than the reversal of the judgment against socrates when he was already more than twenty centuries beyond the reach of antidotes and when his memory had acquired a deserved respectability i conceive that it was a feeling of the importance of this precaution which induced mr locke to style himself gent on the titlepage of his essay as who should say to his readers that they could receive his metaphysics on the honor of a gentleman  nevertheless finding that without descending to a smaller size of type than would have been compatible with the dignity of the several societies to be named i could not compress my intended list within the limits of a single page and thinking moreover that the act would carry with it an air of decorous modesty i have chosen to take the reader aside as it were into my private closet and there not only exhibit to him the diplomas which i already possess but also to furnish him with a prophetic vision of those which i may without undue presumption hope for as not beyond the reach of human ambition and attainment and i am the rather induced to this from the fact that my name has been unaccountably dropped from the last triennial catalogue of our beloved alma mater whether this is to be attributed to the difficulty of latinizing any of those honorary adjuncts with a complete list of which i took care to furnish the proper persons nearly a year beforehand or whether it had its origin in any more culpable motives i forbear to consider in this place the matter being in course of painful investigation but however this may be i felt the omission the more keenly as i had in expectation of the new catalogue enriched the library of the jaalam athenæum with the old one then in my possession by which means it has come about that my children will be deprived of a neverwearying winter evenings amusement in looking out the name of their parent in that distinguished roll those harmless innocents had at least committed nobut i forbear having intrusted my reflections and animadversions on this painful topic to the safekeeping of my private diary intended for posthumous publication i state this fact here in order that certain nameless individuals who are perhaps overmuch congratulating themselves on my silence may know that a rod is in pickle which the vigorous hand of a justly incensed posterity will apply to their memories  the careful reader will note that in the list which i have prepared i have included the names of several cisatlantic societies to which a place is not commonly assigned in processions of this nature i have ventured to do this not only to encourage native ambition and genius but also because i have never been able to perceive in what way distance unless we suppose them at the end of a lever could increase the weight of learned bodies as far as i have been able to extend my researches among such stuffed specimens as occasionally reach america i have discovered no generic difference between the antipodal fogrum japonicum and the f americanum sufficiently common in our own immediate neighborhood yet with a becoming deference to the popular belief that distinctions of this sort are enhanced in value by every additional mile they travel i have intermixed the names of some tolerably distant literary and other associations with the rest  i add here also an advertisement which that it may be the more readily understood by those persons especially interested therein i have written in that curtailed and otherwise maltreated canine latin to the

introduction   when more than three years ago my talented young parishioner mr biglow came to me and submitted to my animadversions the first of his poems which he intended to commit to the more hazardous trial of a city newspaper it never so much as entered my imagination to conceive that his productions would ever be gathered into a fair volume and ushered into the august presence of the reading public by myself so little are we shortsighted mortals able to predict the event i confess that there is to me a quite new satisfaction in being associated though only as sleeping partner in a book which can stand by itself in an independent unity on the shelves of libraries for there is always this drawback from the pleasure of printing a sermon that whereas the queasy stomach of this generation will not bear a discourse long enough to make a separate volume those religious and godlyminded children those samuels if i may call them so of the brain must at first lie buried in an undistinguished heap and then get such resurrection as is vouchsafed to them mummywrapt with a score of others in a cheap binding with no other mark of distinction than the word miscellaneous printed upon the back far be it from me to claim any credit for the quite unexpected popularity which i am pleased to find these bucolic strains have attained unto if i know myself i am measurably free from the itch of vanity yet i may be allowed to say that i was not backward to recognize in them a certain wild puckery acidulous sometimes even verging toward that point which in our rustic phrase is termed shuteye flavor not wholly unpleasing nor unwholesome to palates cloyed with the sugariness of tamed and cultivated fruit it may be also that some touches of my own here and there may have led to their wider acceptance albeit solely from my larger experience of literature and authorshipj    footnote j the reader curious in such matters may refer      if he can find them to a sermon preached on the      anniversary of the dark day an artillery election      sermon a discourse on the late eclipse dorcas a      funeral sermon on the death of madam submit tidd relict of      the late experience tidd esq c c  i was at first inclined to discourage mr biglows attempts as knowing that the desire to poetize is one of the diseases naturally incident to adolescence which if the fitting remedies be not at once and with a bold hand applied may become chronic and render one who might else have become in due time an ornament of the social circle a painful object even to nearest friends and relatives but thinking on a further experience that there was a germ of promise in him which required only culture and the pulling up of weeds from around it i thought it best to set before him the acknowledged examples of english composition in verse and leave the rest to natural emulation with this view i accordingly lent him some volumes of pope and goldsmith to the assiduous study of which he promised to devote his evenings not long afterward he brought me some verses written upon that model a specimen of which i subjoin having changed some phrases of less elegancy and a few rhymes objectionable to the cultivated ear the poem consisted of childish reminiscences and the sketches which follow will not seem destitute of truth to those whose fortunate education began in a country village and first let us hang up his charcoal portrait of the schooldame    propt on the marsh a dwelling now i see   the humble schoolhouse of my a b c   where welldrilled urchins each behind

pipkins her pierian store   she mid the volleyed learning firm and calm   patted the furloughed ferule on her palm   and to our wonder could divine at once   who flashed the pan and who was downright dunce    there young devotion learned to climb with ease   the gnarly limbs of scripture familytrees   and he was most commended and admired   who soonest to the topmost twig perspired   each name was called as many various ways   as pleased the readers ear on different days   so that the weather or the ferules stings   colds in the head or fifty other things   transformed the helpless hebrew

the points pleased her the same   if any tyro found a name too tough   and looked at her pride furnished skill enough   she nerved her larynx for the desperate thing   and cleared the fivebarred syllables at a spring    ah dear old times there once it was my hap   perched on a stool to wear the longeared cap   from books degraded there i sat at ease   a drone the envy of compulsory bees   rewards of merit too full many a time   each with its woodcut and its moral rhyme   and pierced halfdollars hung on ribbons gay   about my neckto be restored next day   i carried home rewards as shining then   as those which deck the lifelong pains of men   more solid than the redemanded praise   with which the world beribbons later days    ah dear old times how brightly ye return   how

decorous curve to every rank adapt   how did it graduate with a courtly ease   the whole long scale of social differences   yet so gave each his measure running oer   none thought his own was less his

absence to our love   let the thick dogsears in my primer prove  i add only one further extract which will possess a melancholy interest to all such as have endeavored to glean the materials of revolutionary history from the lips of aged persons who took a part in the actual making of it and finding the manufacture profitable continued the supply in an adequate proportion to the demand    old joe is gone who saw hot percy goad   his slow artillery up the concord road   a tale which grew in wonder year by year   as every time he told it joe drew near   to the main fight till faded and grown gray   the original scene to bolder tints gave way   then joe had heard the foes scared doublequick   beat on stove drum with one uncaptured stick   and ere death came the lengthening tale to lop   himself had fired and seen a redcoat drop   had joe lived long enough that scrambling fight   had squared more nearly with his sense of right   and vanquished percy to complete the tale   had hammered stone for life in concord jail  i do not know that the foregoing extracts ought not to be called my own rather than mr biglows as indeed he maintained stoutly that my file had left nothing of his in them i should not perhaps have felt entitled to take so great liberties with them had i not more than suspected an hereditary vein of poetry in myself a very near ancestor having written a latin poem in the harvard gratulatio on the accession of george the third suffice it to say that whether not satisfied with such limited approbation as i could conscientiously bestow or from a sense of natural inaptitude certain it is that my young friend could never be induced to any further essays in this kind he affirmed that it was to him like writing in a foreign tonguethat mr popes versification was like the regular ticking of one of willards clocks in which one could fancy after long listening a certain kind of rhythm or tune but which yet was only a povertystricken tick tick after alland that he had never seen a sweetwater on a trellis growing so fairly or in forms so pleasing to his eye as a foxgrape over a scruboak in a swamp he added i know not what to the effect that the sweetwater would only be the more disfigured by having its leaves starched and ironed out and that pegsus so he called him hardly looked right with his mane and tail in curlpapers these and other such opinions i did not long strive to eradicate attributing them rather to a defective education and senses untuned by too long familiarity with purely natural objects than to a perverted moral sense i was the more inclined to this leniency since sufficient evidence was not to seek that his verses wanting as they certainly were in classic polish and point had somehow taken hold of the public ear in a surprising manner so only setting him right as to the quantity of the proper name pegasus i left him to follow the bent of his natural genius  yet could i not surrender him wholly to the tutelage of the pagan which literally interpreted signifies village muse without yet a further effort for his conversion and to this end i resolved that whatever of poetic fire yet burned in myself aided by the assiduous bellows of correct models should be put in requisition accordingly when my ingenious young parishioner brought to my study a copy of verses which he had written touching the acquisition of territory resulting from the mexican war and the folly of leaving the question of slavery or freedom to the adjudication of chance i did myself indite a short fable or apologue after the manner of gay and prior to the end that he might see how easily even such subjects as he treated of were capable of a more refined style and more elegant expression mr biglows production was as follows

form following and i print it here i sincerely trust out of no vainglory but solely with the hope of doing good            leaving the matter open                a tale          by homer wilbur am     two brothers once an illmatched pair   together dwelt no matter where   to whom an uncle sam or some one   had left a house and farm in common   the two in principles and habits   were different as rats from rabbits   stout farmer north with frugal care   laid up provision for his heir   not scorning with hard sunbrowned hands   to scrape acquaintance with his lands   whatever thing he had to do   he did and made it pay him too   he sold his waste stone by the pound   his drains made waterwheels spin round   his ice in summertime he sold   his wood brought profit when twas cold   he dug and delved from morn till night   strove to make profit square with right   lived on his means cut no great dash   and paid his debts in honest cash    on tother hand his brother south   lived very much from hand to mouth   played gentleman nursed dainty hands   borrowed norths money on his lands   and culled his morals and his graces   from cockpits barrooms fights and races   his sole work in the farming line   was keeping droves of longlegged swine   which brought great bothers and expenses   to north in looking after fences   and when they happened to break through   cost him both time and temper too   for south insisted it was plain   he ought to drive them home again   and north consented to the work   because he loved to buy cheap pork    meanwhile souths swine increasing fast   his farm became too small at last   so having thought the matter over   and feeling bound to live in clover   and never pay the clovers worth   he said one day to brother north    our families are both increasing   and though we labor without ceasing   our produce soon will be too scant   to keep our children out of want   they who wish fortune to be lasting   must be both prudent and forecasting   we soon shall need more land a lot   i know that cheaply can be bot   you lend the cash ill buy the acres   and well be equally partakers    poor north whose anglosaxon blood   gave him a hankering after mud   wavered a moment then consented   and when the cash was paid repented   to make the new land worth a pin   thought he it must be all fenced in   for if souths swine once get the run ont   no kind of farming can be done ont   if that dont suit the other side   tis best we instantly divide    but somehow south could neer incline   this way or that to run the line   and always found some new pretence   gainst setting the division fence   at last he said                       for peaces sake   liberal concessions i will make   though i believe upon my soul   ive a just title to the whole   ill make an offer which i call   genrouswell have no fence at all   then both of us wheneer we choose   can take what part we want to use   if you should chance to need it first   pick you the best ill take the worst    agreed cried north thought he this fall   with wheat and rye ill sow it all   in that way i shall get the start   and south may whistle for his part   so thought so done the field was sown   and winter having come and gone   sly north walked blithely forth to spy   the progress of his wheat and rye   heavens what a sight his brothers swine   had asked themselves all out to dine   such grunting munching rooting shoving   the soil seemed all alive and moving   as for his grain such work theyd made ont   he couldnt spy a single blade ont    off in a rage he rushed to south   my wheat and ryegrief choked his mouth   pray dont mind me said south but plant   all of the new land that you want   yes but your hogs cried north                                      the grain   wont hurt them answered south again   but they destroy my grain                                 no doubt   tis fortunate youve found it out   misfortunes teach and only they   you must not sow it in their way   nay you says north must keep them out   did i create them with a snout   asked south demurely as agreed   the land is open to your seed   and would you fain prevent my pigs   from running there their harmless rigs   god knows i view this compromise   with not the most approving eyes   i gave up my unquestioned rights   for sake of quiet days and nights   i offered then you know tis true   to cut the piece of land in two   then cut it now growls north                                     abate   your heat says south tis now too late   i offered you the rocky corner   but you of your own good the scorner   refused to take it i am sorry   no doubt you might have found a quarry   perhaps a goldmine for aught i know   containing heaps of native rhino   you cant expect me to resign   my right               but where quoth north are mine   your rights says tother well thats funny   i bought the land                          i paid the money   that answered south is from the point   the ownership youll grant is joint   im sure my only hope and trust is   not law so much as abstract justice   though you remember twas agreed   that so and soconsult the deed   objections now are out of date   they might have answered once but fate   quashes them at the point weve got to   obsta principiis thats my motto   so saying south began to whistle   and looked as obstinate as gristle   while north went homeward each brown paw   clenched like a knot of natural law   and all the while in either ear   heard something clicking wondrous clear  to turn now to other matters there are two things upon which it would seem fitting to dilate somewhat more largely in this placethe yankee character and the yankee dialect and first of the yankee character which has wanted neither open maligners nor even more dangerous enemies in the persons of those unskilful painters who have given to it that hardness angularity and want of proper perspective which in truth belonged not to their subject but to their own niggard and unskilful pencil  new england was not so much the colony of a mother country as a hagar driven forth into the wilderness the little selfexiled band which came hither in 1620 came not to seek gold but to found a democracy they came that they might have the privilege to work and pray to sit upon hard benches and listen to painful preachers as long as they would yea even unto thirtyseventhly if the spirit so willed it and surely if the greek might boast his thermopylæ where three hundred men fell in resisting the persian we may well be proud of our plymouth rock where a handful of men women and children not merely faced but vanquished winter famine the wilderness and the yet more invincible storge that drew them back to the green island far away these found no lotus growing upon the surly shore the taste of which could make them forget their little native ithaca nor were they so wanting to themselves in faith as to burn their ship but could see the fair west wind belly the homeward sail and then turn unrepining to grapple with the terrible unknown  as want was the prime foe these hardy exodists had to fortress themselves against so it is little wonder if that traditional feud is long in wearing out of the stock the wounds of the old warfare were long ahealing and an east wind of hard times puts a new ache in every one of them thrift was the first lesson in their hornbook pointed out letter after letter by the lean finger of the hard schoolmaster necessity neither were those plump rosygilled englishmen that came hither but a hardfaced atrabilious earnesteyed race stiff from long wrestling with the lord in prayer and who had taught satan to dread the new puritan hug add two hundred years influence of soil climate and exposure with its necessary result of idiosyncrasies and we have the present yankee full of expedients halfmaster of all trades inventive in all but the beautiful full of shifts not yet capable of comfort armed at all points against the old enemy hunger longanimous good at patching not so careful for what is best as for what will do with a clasp to his purse and a button to his pocket not skilled to build against time as in old countries but against sorepressing need accustomed to move the world with no ποῦ στῶ but his own two feet and no lever but his own long forecast a strange hybrid indeed did circumstance beget here in the new world upon the old puritan stock and the earth never before saw such mysticpracticalism such niggardgeniality such calculatingfanaticism such castironenthusiasm such sourfacedhumor such closefistedgenerosity this new græculus esuriens will make a living out of anything he will invent new trades as well as tools his brain is his capital and he will get education at all risks put him on juan fernandez and he would make a spellingbook first and a saltpan afterward in cœlum jusseris ibitor the other way eitherit is all one so anything is to be got by it yet after all thin speculative jonathan is more like the englishman of two centuries ago than john bull himself is he has lost somewhat in solidity has become fluent and adaptable but more of the original groundwork of character remains he feels more at home with fulke greville herbert of cherbury quarles george herbert and browne than with his modern english cousins he is nearer than john by at least a hundred years to naseby marston moor worcester and the time when if ever there were true englishmen john bull has suffered the idea of the invisible to be very much fattened out of him jonathan is conscious still that he lives in the world of the unseen as well as of the seen to move john you must make your fulcrum of solid beef and pudding an abstract idea will do for jonathan                      to the indulgent reader       my friend the reverend mr wilbur having been seized with      a dangerous fit of illness before this introduction had      passed through the press and being incapacitated for all      literary exertion sent to me his notes memoranda c and      requested me to fashion them into some shape more fitting      for the general eye this owing to the fragmentary and      disjointed state of his manuscripts i have felt wholly      unable to do yet being unwilling that the reader should be      deprived of such parts of his lucubrations as seemed more      finished and not well discerning how to segregate these      from the rest i have concluded to send them all to the      press precisely as they are                                    columbus nye                       pastor of a church in bungtown corner  it remains to speak of the yankee dialect and first it may be premised in a general way that any one much read in the writings of the early colonists need not be told that the far greater share of the words and phrases now esteemed peculiar to new england and local there were brought from the mother country a person familiar with the dialect of certain portions of massachusetts will not fail to recognize in ordinary discourse many words now noted in english vocabularies as archaic the greater part of which were in common use about the time of the king james translation of the bible shakspeare stands less in need of a glossary to most new englanders than to many a native of the old country the peculiarities of our speech however are rapidly wearing out as there is no country where reading is so universal and newspapers are so multitudinous so no phrase remains long local but is transplanted in the mailbags to every remotest corner of the land consequently our dialect approaches nearer to uniformity than that of any other nation  the english have complained of us for coining new words many of those so stigmatized were old ones by them forgotten and all make now an unquestioned part of the currency wherever english is spoken undoubtedly we have a right to make new words as they are needed by the fresh aspects under which life presents itself here in the new world and indeed wherever a language is alive it grows it might be questioned whether we could not establish a stronger title to the ownership of the english tongue than the motherislanders themselves here past all question is to be its great home and centre and not only is it already spoken here by greater numbers but with a higher popular average of correctness than in britain the great writers of it too we might claim as ours were ownership to be settled by the number of readers and lovers  as regards the provincialisms to be met with in this volume i may say that the reader will not find one which is not as i believe either native or imported with the early settlers nor one which i have not with my own ears heard in familiar use in the metrical portion of the book i have endeavored to adapt the spelling as nearly as possible to the ordinary mode of pronunciation let the reader who deems me overparticular remember this caution of martial     quem recitas meus est o fidentine libellus     sed male cum recitas incipit esse tuus  a few further explanatory remarks will not be impertinent  i shall barely lay down a few general rules for the readers guidance  1 the genuine yankee never gives the rough sound to the r when he can help it and often displays considerable ingenuity in avoiding it even before a vowel  2 he seldom sounds the final g a piece of selfdenial if we consider his partiality for nasals the same of the final d as han and stan for hand and stand  3 the h in such words as while when where he omits altogether  4 in regard to a he shows some inconsistency sometimes giving a close and obscure sound as hev for have hendy for handy ez for as thet for that and again giving it the broad sound it has in father as hânsome for handsome  5 to the sound ou he prefixes an e hard to exemplify otherwise than orally  the following passage in shakspeare he would recite thus    neow is the winta uv eour

might be gratified with a sight of the editorial effigies and here a choice between two was offeredthe one a profile entirely black cut by doyle the other a portrait painted by a native artist of much promise the first of these seemed wanting in expression and in the second a slight obliquity of the visual organs has been heightened perhaps from an overdesire of force on the part of the artist into too close an approach to actual strabismus this slight divergence in my optical apparatus from the ordinary modelhowever i may have been taught to regard it in the light of a mercy rather than a cross since it enabled me to give as much of directness and personal application to my discourses as met the wants of my congregation without risk of offending any by being supposed to have him or her in my eye as the saying isseemed yet to mrs wilbur a sufficient objection to the engraving of the aforesaid painting we read of many who either absolutely refused to allow the copying of their features as especially did plotinus and agesilaus among the ancients not to mention the more modern instances of scioppius palæottus pinellus velserus gataker and others or were indifferent thereto as cromwell                                 β yet was cæsar desirous of concealing his baldness per contra my lord protectors carefulness in the matter of his wart might be cited men generally more desirous of being improved in their portraits than characters shall probably find very unflattered likenesses of ourselves in recording angels gallery                                 γ whether any of our national peculiarities may be traced to our use of stoves as a certain closeness of the lips in pronunciation and a smothered smoulderingness of disposition seldom roused to open flame an unrestrained intercourse with fire probably conducive to generosity and hospitality of soul ancient mexicans used stoves as the friar augustin ruiz reports hakluyt iii 468but the popish priests not always reliable authority  today picked my isabella grapes crop injured by attacks of rosebug in the spring whether noah was justifiable in preserving this class of insects                                 δ concerning mr biglows pedigree tolerably certain that there was never a poet among his ancestors an ordination hymn attributed to a maternal uncle but perhaps a sort of production not demanding the creative faculty  his grandfather a painter of the grandiose or michael angelo school seldom painted objects smaller than houses or barns and these with uncommon expression                                 ε of the wilburs no complete pedigree the crest said to be a wild boar whence perhaps the name a connection with the earls of wilbraham quasi wild boar ham might be made out this suggestion worth

early for only three years after namely 1714 we have evidence that he married winifred daughter of lieutenant tipping  he seems to have been a man of substance for we find him in 1696 conveying one undivided eightieth part of a saltmeadow in yabbok and he commanded a sloop in 1702  those who doubt the importance of genealogical studies fuste potius quam argumento erudiendi  i trace him as far as 1723 and there lose him in that year he was chosen selectman  no gravestone perhaps overthrown when new hearsehouse was built 1802  he was probably the son of john who came from bilham comit salop

esteemed the      firstborn of adam to be the most worthy not only because      of that privilege of primogeniture but inasmuch as he was      able to overcome and slay his younger brother that was a      wise saying of the famous marquis pescara to the papal      legate that it was impossible for men to serve mars and      christ at the same time yet in time past the profession of      arms was judged to be κατ᾽ ἐξοχήν that of a gentleman nor      does this opinion want for strenuous upholders even in our      day must we suppose then that the profession of      christianity was only intended for losels or at best to      afford an opening for plebeian ambition or shall we hold      with that nicely metaphysical pomeranian captain vratz who      was count königsmarks chief instrument in the murder of mr      thynne that the scheme of salvation has been arranged with      an especial eye to the necessities of the upper classes and      that god would consider a gentleman and deal with him      suitably to the condition and profession he had placed him      in it may be said of us all exemplo plus quam ratione      vivimush w                                     no ii                                 a letter  from mr hosea biglow to the hon j t buckingham editor of the boston courier covering a letter from mr b sawin private in the massachusetts regiment        this letter of mr sawins was not originally written in      verse mr biglow thinking it peculiarly susceptible of      metrical adornment translated it so to speak into his own      vernacular tongue this is not the time to consider the      question whether rhyme be a mode of expression natural to      the human race if leisure from other and more important      avocations be granted i will handle the matter more at      large in an appendix to the present volume in this place i      will barely remark that i have sometimes noticed in the      unlanguaged prattlings of infants a fondness for      alliteration assonance and even rhyme in which natural      predisposition we may trace the three degrees through which      our anglosaxon verse rose to its culmination in the poetry      of pope i would not be understood as questioning in these      remarks that pious theory which supposes that children if      left entirely to themselves would naturally discourse in      hebrew for this the authority of one experiment is claimed      and i could with sir thomas browne desire its      establishment inasmuch as the acquirement of that sacred      tongue would thereby be facilitated i am aware that      herodotus states the conclusion of psammeticus to have been      in favor of a dialect of the phrygian but beside the      chance that a trial of this importance would hardly be      blessed to a pagan monarch whose only motive was curiosity      we have on the hebrew side the comparatively recent      investigation of james the fourth of scotland i will add to      this prefatory remark that mr sawin though a native of      jaalam has never been a stated attendant on the religious      exercises of my congregation i consider my humble efforts      prospered in that not one of my sheep hath ever indued the      wolfs clothing of war save for the comparatively innocent      diversion of a militia training not that my flock are      backward to undergo the hardships of defensive warfare      they serve cheerfully in the great army which fights even      unto death pro aris et focis accoutred with the spade      the axe the plane the sledge the spellingbook and other      such effectual weapons against want and ignorance and      unthrift i have taught them under god to esteem our human      institutions as but tents of a night to be stricken      whenever truth

when hath satan      been to seek for attorneys who have maintained that our      late inroad upon mexico was undertaken not so much for the      avenging of any national quarrel as for the spreading of      free institutions and of protestantism capita vix duabus      anticyris medenda verily i admire that no pious sergeant      among these new crusaders beheld martin luther riding at the      front of the host upon a tamed pontifical bull as in that      former invasion of mexico the zealous gomara spawn though      he were of the scarlet woman was favored with a vision of      st james of compostella skewering the infidels upon his      apostolical lance we read also that richard of the lion      heart having gone to palestine on a similar errand of      mercy was divinely encouraged to cut the throats of such      paynims as refused to swallow the bread of life doubtless      that they might be thereafter incapacitated for swallowing      the filthy gobbets of mahound by angels of heaven who      cried to the king and his knightsseigneurs tuez tuez      providentially using the french tongue as being the only      one understood by their auditors this would argue for the      pantoglottism of these celestial intelligences while on      the other hand the devil teste cotton mather is      unversed in certain of the indian dialects yet must he be a      semeiologist the most expert making himself intelligible to      every people and kindred by signs no other discourse      indeed being needful than such as the mackerelfisher      holds with his finned quarry who if other bait be wanting      can by a bare bit of white rag at the end of a string      captivate those foolish fishes such piscatorial oratory is      satan cunning in before one he trails a hat and feather or      a bare feather without a hat before another a presidential      chair or a tidewaiters stool or a pulpit in the city no      matter what to us dangling there over our heads they seem      junkets dropped out of the seventh heaven sops dipped in      nectar but once in our mouths they are all one bits of      fuzzy cotton       this however by the way it is time now revocare gradum      while so many miracles of this sort vouched by      eyewitnesses have encouraged the arms of papists not to      speak of echetlæus at marathon and those dioscuri whom we      must conclude imps of the pit who sundry times captained      the pagan roman soldiery it is strange that our first      american crusade was not in some such wise also signalized      yet it is said that the lord hath manifestly prospered our      armies this opens the question whether when our hands are      strengthened to make great slaughter of our enemies it be      absolutely and demonstratively certain that this might is      added to us from above or whether some potentate from an      opposite quarter may not have a finger in it as there are      few pies into which his meddling digits are not thrust      would the sanctifier and setterapart of the seventh day      have assisted in a victory gained on the sabbath as was one      in the late war or has that day become less an object of      his especial care since the year 1697 when so manifest a      providence occurred to mr william trowbridge in answer to      whose prayers when he and all on shipboard with him were      starving a dolphin was sent daily which was enough to      serve em only on saturdays they still catched a couple      and on the lords days they could catch none at all      haply they might have been permitted by way of      mortification to take some few sculpins those banes of the      saltwater angler which unseemly fish would moreover      have conveyed to them a symbolical reproof for their breach      of the day being known in the rude dialect of our mariners      as cape cod clergymen       it has been a refreshment to many nice consciences to know      that our chief magistrate would not regard with eyes of      approval the by many esteemed sinful pastime of dancing      and i own myself to be so far of that mind that i could not      but set my face against this mexican polka though danced to      the presidential piping with a gubernatorial second if ever      the country should be seized with another such mania de      propagandâ fide i think it would be wise to fill our      bombshells with alternate copies of the cambridge platform      and the thirtynine articles which would produce a mixture      of the highest explosive power and to wrap every one of our      cannonballs in a leaf of the new testament the reading of      which is denied to those who sit in the darkness of popery      those iron evangelists would thus be able to disseminate      vital religion and gospel truth in quarters inaccessible to      the ordinary missionary i have seen lads unimpregnate with      the more sublimated punctiliousness of walton secure      pickerel taking their unwary siesta beneath the lilypads      too nigh the surface with a gun and small shot why not      then since gunpowder was unknown in the time of the      apostles not to enter here upon the question whether it      were discovered before that period by the chinese suit our      metaphor to the age in which we live and say shooters as      well as fishers of men       i do much fear that we shall be seized now and then with a      protestant fervor as long as we have neighbor naboths whose      wallowings in papistical mire excite our horror in exact      proportion to the size and desirableness of their vineyards      yet i rejoice that some earnest protestants have been made      by this wari mean those who protested against it fewer      they were than i could wish for one might imagine america      to have been colonized by a tribe of those nondescript      african animals the ayeayes so difficult a word is no to      us all there is some malformation or defect of the vocal      organs which either prevents our uttering it at all or      gives it so thick a pronunciation as to be unintelligible a      mouth filled with the national pudding or watering in      expectation thereof is wholly incompetent to this      refractory monosyllable an abject and herpetic public      opinion is the pope the antichrist for us to protest      against e corde cordium and

it is of      this that we must all be puppets this thumps the      pulpitcushion this guides the editors pen this wags the      senators tongue this decides what scriptures are      canonical and shuffles christ away into the apocrypha      according to that sentence fathered upon solon Οὕτω δημόσιον      κακὸν ἔρχεται οἴκαδ ἑκάστῳ this unclean spirit is      skilful to assume various shapes i have known it to      enter my own study and nudge my elbow of a saturday      under the semblance of a wealthy member of my      congregation it were a great blessing if every      particular of what in the sum we call popular sentiment      could carry about the name of its manufacturer stamped      legibly upon it i gave a stab under the fifth rib to      that pestilent fallacyour country right

thinks        a few remarks on the following verses will not be out of      place the satire in them was not meant to have any      personal but only a general application of the gentleman      upon whose letter they were intended as a commentary mr      biglow had never heard till he saw the letter itself the      position of the satirist is oftentimes one which he would      not have chosen had the election been left to himself in      attacking bad principles he is obliged to select some      individual who has made himself their exponent and in whom      they are impersonate to the end that what he says may not      through ambiguity be dissipated tenues in auras for what      says seneca longum iter per præcepta breve et efficace      per exempla a bad principle is comparatively harmless      while it continues to be an abstraction nor can the general      mind comprehend it fully till it is printed in that large      type which all men can read at sight namely the life and      character the sayings and doings of particular persons it      is one of the cunningest fetches of satan that he never      exposes himself directly to our arrows but still dodging      behind this neighbor or that acquaintance compels us to      wound him through them if at all he holds our affections      as hostages the while he patches up a truce with our      conscience       meanwhile let us not forget that the aim of the true      satirist is not to be severe upon persons but only upon      falsehood and as truth and falsehood start from the same      point and sometimes even go along together for a little      way his business is to follow the path of the latter after      it diverges and to show her floundering in the bog at the      end of it truth is quite beyond the reach of satire there      is so brave a simplicity in her that she can no more be      made ridiculous than an oak or a pine the danger of the      satirist is that continual use may deaden his sensibility      to the force of language he becomes more and more liable to      strike harder than he knows or intends he may be careful to      put on his boxinggloves and yet forget that the older      they grow the more plainly may the knuckles inside be felt      moreover in the heat of contest the eye is insensibly      drawn to the crown of victory whose tawdry tinsel glitters      through that dust of the ring which obscures truths wreath      of simple leaves i have sometimes thought that my young      friend mr biglow needed a monitory hand laid on his      armaliquid sufflaminandus erat i have never thought it      good husbandry to water the tender plants of reform with      aqua fortis yet where so much is to do in the beds he      were a sorry gardener who should wage a whole days war with      an iron scuffle on those ill weeds that make the      gardenwalks of life unsightly when a sprinkle of attic      salt will wither them up est ars etiam maledicendi says      scaliger and truly it is a hard thing to say where the      graceful gentleness of the lamb merges in downright      sheepishness we may conclude with worthy and wise dr      fuller that one may be a lamb in private wrongs but in      hearing general affronts to goodness they are asses which      are not lionsh w    guvener b is a sensible man     he stays to his home an looks arter his folks   he draws

he      sez the worldll go right ef he hollers out gee       the attentive reader will doubtless have perceived in the      foregoing poem an allusion to that pernicious      sentimentour country right or wrong it is an abuse of      language to call a certain portion of land much more      certain personages elevated for the time being to high      station our country i would not sever nor loosen a single      one of those ties by which we are united to the spot of our      birth nor minish by a tittle the respect due to the      magistrate i love our own bay state too well to do the one      and as for the other i have myself for nigh forty years      exercised however unworthily the function of justice of      the peace having been called thereto by the unsolicited      kindness of that most excellent man and upright patriot      caleb strong patriæ fumus igne alieno luculentior is best      qualified with thisubi libertas ibi patria we are      inhabitants of two worlds and owe a double but not a      divided allegiance in virtue of our clay this little ball      of earth exacts a certain loyalty of us while in our      capacity as spirits we are admitted citizens of an      invisible and holier fatherland there is a patriotism of      the soul whose claim absolves us from our other and terrene      fealty our true country is that ideal realm which we      represent to ourselves under the names of religion duty      and the like our terrestrial organizations are but faroff      approaches to so fair a model and all they are verily      traitors who resist not any attempt to divert them from this      their original intendment when therefore one would have      us to fling up our caps and shout with the multitudeour      country however bounded he demands of us that we      sacrifice the larger to the less the higher to the lower      and that we yield to the imaginary claims of a few acres of      soil our duty and privilege as liegemen of truth our true      country is bounded on the north and the south on the east      and the west by justice and when she oversteps that      invisible boundaryline by so much as a hairsbreadth she      ceases to be our mother and chooses rather to be looked      upon quasi noverca that is a hard choice when our      earthly love of country calls upon us to tread one path and      our duty points us to another we must make as noble and      becoming an election as did penelope between icarius and      ulysses veiling our faces we must take silently the hand      of duty to follow her       shortly after the publication of the foregoing poem there      appeared some comments upon it in one of the public prints      which seemed to call for animadversion i accordingly      addressed to mr buckingham of the boston courier the      following letter                                       jaalam november 4 1847      to the editor of the courier       respected sircalling at the postoffice this morning      our worthy and efficient postmaster offered for my perusal a      paragraph in the boston morning post of the 3d instant      wherein certain effusions of the pastoral muse are      attributed to the pen of mr james russell lowell for aught      i know or can affirm to the contrary this mr lowell may be      a very deserving person and a youth of parts though i have      seen verses of his which i could never rightly understand      and if he be such he i am certain as well as i would be      free from any proclivity to appropriate to himself whatever      of credit or discredit may honestly belong to another i      am confident that in penning these few lines i am only      forestalling a disclaimer from that young gentleman whose      silence hitherto when rumor pointed to himward has excited      in my bosom mingled emotions of sorrow and surprise well      may my young parishioner mr biglow exclaim with the poet                        sic vos non vobis c       though in saying this i would not convey the impression      that he is a proficient in the latin tonguethe tongue i      might add of a horace and a tully       mr b does not employ his pen i can safely say for any      lucre of worldly gain or to be exalted by the carnal      plaudits of men digito monstrari c he does not wait      upon providence for mercies and in his heart mean merces      but i should esteem myself as verily deficient in my duty      who am his friend and in some unworthy sort his spiritual      fidus achates c if i did not step forward to claim      for him whatever measure of applause might be assigned to      him by the judicious       if this were a fitting occasion i might venture here a      brief dissertation touching the manner and kind of my young      friends poetry but i dubitate whether this abstruser sort      of speculation though enlivened by some apposite instances      from aristophanes would sufficiently interest your oppidan      readers as regards their satirical tone and their      plainness of speech i will only say that in my pastoral      experience i have found that the archenemy loves nothing      better than to be treated as a religious moral and      intellectual being and that there is no apage sathanas      so potent as ridicule but it is a kind of weapon that must      have a button of goodnature on the point of it       the productions of mr b have been stigmatized in some      quarters as unpatriotic but i can vouch that he loves his      native soil with that hearty though discriminating      attachment which springs from an intimate social intercourse      of many years standing in the ploughing season no one has      a deeper share in the wellbeing of the country than he if      dean swift were right in saying that he who makes two blades      of grass grow where one grew before confers a greater      benefit on the state than he who taketh a city mr b might      exhibit a fairer claim to the presidency than general scott      himself i think that some of those disinterested lovers of      the hardhanded democracy whose fingers have never touched      anything rougher than the dollars of our common country      would hesitate to compare palms with him it would do your      heart good respected sir to see that young man mow he      cuts a cleaner and wider swarth than any in this town       but it is time for me to be at my post it is very clear      that my young friends shot has struck the lintel for the      post is shaken amos ix 1 the editor of that paper is a      strenuous advocate of the mexican war and a colonel as i      am given to understand i presume that being necessarily      absent in mexico he has left his journal in some less      judicious hands at any rate the post has been too swift on      this occasion it could hardly have cited a more      incontrovertible line from any poem than that which it has      selected for animadversion namely            we kind o thought christ went agin war an pillage       if the post maintains the converse of this proposition it      can hardly be considered as a safe guidepost for the moral      and religious portions of its party however many other      excellent qualities of a post it may be blessed with there      is a sign in london on which is paintedthe green man      it would do very well as a portrait of any individual who      would support so unscriptural a thesis as regards the      language of the line in question i am bold to say that he      who readeth the hearts of men will not account any dialect      unseemly which conveys a sound and pious sentiment i could      wish that such sentiments were more common however      uncouthly expressed saint ambrose affirms that veritas a      quocunque why not then quomodocunque dicatur a      spiritu sancto est digest also this of baxterthe      plainest words are the most profitable oratory in the      weightiest matters       when the paragraph in question was shown to mr biglow the      only part of it which seemed to give him any dissatisfaction      was that which classed him with the whig party he says      that if resolutions are a nourishing kind of diet that      party must be in a very hearty and flourishing condition      for that they have quietly eaten more good ones of their own      baking than he could have conceived to be possible without      repletion he has been for some years past i regret to say      an ardent opponent of those sound doctrines of protective      policy which form so prominent a portion of the creed of      that party i confess that in some discussions which i      have had with him on this point in my study he has      displayed a vein of obstinacy which i had not hitherto      detected in his composition he is also horresco      referens infected in no small measure with the peculiar      notions of a print called the liberator whose heresies i      take every proper opportunity of combating and of which i      thank god i have never read a single line       i did not see mr bs verses until they appeared in print      and there is certainly one thing in them which i consider      highly improper i allude to the personal references to      myself by name to confer notoriety on an humble individual      who is laboring quietly in his vocation and who keeps his      cloth as free as he can from the dust of the political arena      though væ mihi si non evangelizavero is no doubt an      indecorum the sentiments which he attributes to me i will      not deny to be mine they were embodied though in a      different form in a discourse preached upon the last day of      public fasting and were acceptable to my entire people of      whatever political views except the postmaster who      dissented ex officio i observe that you sometimes devote      a portion of your paper to a religious summary i should be      well pleased to furnish a copy of my discourse for insertion      in this department of your instructive journal by omitting      the advertisements it might easily be got within the limits      of a single number and i venture to insure you the sale of      some scores of copies in this town i will cheerfully render      myself responsible for ten it might possibly be      advantageous to issue it as an extra but perhaps you will      not esteem it an object and i will not press it my offer      does not spring from any weak desire of seeing my name in      print for i can enjoy this satisfaction at any time by      turning to the triennial catalogue of the university where      it also possesses that added emphasis of italics with which      those of my calling are distinguished       i would simply add that i continue to fit ingenuous youth      for college and that i have two spacious and airy sleeping      apartments at this moment unoccupied ingenuas didicisse      c terms which vary according to the circumstances of the      parents may be known on application to me by letter post      paid in all cases the lad will be expected to fetch his own      towels this rule mrs w desires me to add has no      exceptions              respectfully your obedient servant                                           homer wilbur am       ps perhaps the last paragraph may look like an attempt to      obtain the insertion of my circular gratuitously if it      should appear to you in that light i desire that you would      erase it or charge for it at the usual rates and deduct      the amount from the proceeds in your hands from the sale of      my discourse when it shall be printed my circular is much      longer and more explicit and will be forwarded without      charge to any who may desire it it has been very neatly      executed on a letter sheet by a very deserving printer who      attends upon my ministry and is a creditable specimen of      the typographic art i have one hung over my mantelpiece in      a neat frame where it makes a beautiful and appropriate      ornament and balances the profile of mrs w cut with her      toes by the young lady born without arms        h w       i have in the foregoing letter mentioned general scott in      connection with the presidency because i have been given to      understand that he has blown to pieces and otherwise caused      to be destroyed more mexicans than any other commander his      claim would therefore be deservedly considered the      strongest until accurate returns of the mexicans killed      wounded and maimed be obtained it will be difficult to      settle these nice points of precedence should it prove that      any other officer has been more meritorious and destructive      than general s and has thereby rendered himself more      worthy of the confidence and support of the conservative      portion of our community i shall cheerfully insert his      name instead of that of general s in a future edition it      may be thought likewise that general s has invalidated      his claims by too much attention to the decencies of      apparel and the habits belonging to a gentleman these      abstruser points of statesmanship are beyond my scope i      wonder not that successful military achievement should      attract the admiration of the multitude rather do i rejoice      with wonder to behold how rapidly this sentiment is losing      its hold upon the popular mind it is related of thomas      warton the second of that honored name who held the office      of poetry professor at oxford that when one wished to find      him being absconded as was his wont in some obscure      alehouse he was counselled to traverse the city with a drum      and fife the sound of which inspiring music would be sure      to draw the doctor from his retirement into the street we      are all more or less bitten with this martial insanity      nescio quâ dulcedine  cunctos ducit i confess to some      infection of that itch myself when i see a      brigadiergeneral maintaining his insecure elevation in the      saddle under the severe fire of the trainingfield and when      i remember that some military enthusiasts through haste      inexperience or an overdesire to lend reality to those      fictitious combats will sometimes discharge their ramrods      i cannot but admire while i deplore the mistaken devotion      of those heroic officers semel insanivimus omnes i was      myself during the late war with great britain chaplain of      a regiment which was fortunately never called to active      military duty i mention this circumstance with regret      rather than pride had i been summoned to actual warfare i      trust that i might have been strengthened to bear myself      after the manner of that reverend father in our new england      israel dr benjamin colman who as we are told in turells      life of him when the vessel in which he had taken passage      for england was attacked by a french privateer fought like      a philosopher and a christian and prayed all the while      he charged and fired as this note is already long i shall      not here enter upon a discussion of the question whether      christians may lawfully be soldiers i think it sufficiently      evident that during the first two centuries of the      christian era at least two professions were esteemed      incompatible consult jortin on this headh w                                     no iv  remarks of increase d ophace esquire at an extrumpery caucus in state street reported by mr h biglow        the ingenious reader will at once understand that no such      speech as the following was ever totidem verbis      pronounced but there are simpler and less guarded wits for      the satisfying of which such an explanation may be needful      for there are certain invisible lines which as truth      successively overpasses she becomes untruth to one and      another of us as a large river flowing from one kingdom      into another sometimes takes a new name albeit the waters      undergo no change how small soever there is moreover a      truth of fiction more veracious than the truth of fact as      that of the poet which represents to us things and events      as they ought to be rather than servilely copies them as      they are imperfectly imaged in the crooked and smoky glass      of our mundane affairs it is this which makes the speech of      antonius though originally spoken in no wider a forum than      the brain of shakspeare more historically valuable than      that other which appian has reported by as much as the      understanding of the englishman was more comprehensive than      that of the alexandrian mr biglow in the present      instance has only made use of a license assumed by all the      historians of antiquity who put into the mouths of various      characters such words as seem to them most fitting to the      occasion and to the speaker if it be objected that no such      oration could ever have been delivered i answer that there      are few assemblages for speechmaking which do not better      deserve the title of parliamentum indoctorum than did the      sixth parliament of henry the fourth and that men still      continue to have as much faith in the oracle of fools as      ever pantagruel had howell in his letters recounts a      merry tale of a certain ambassador of queen elizabeth who      having written two letters one to her majesty and the other      to his wife directed them at crosspurposes so that the      queen was beducked and bedeared and requested to send a      change of hose and the wife was beprincessed and otherwise      unwontedly besuperlatived till the one feared for the wits      of her ambassador and the other for those of her husband      in like manner it may be presumed that our speaker has      misdirected some of his thoughts and given to the whole      theatre what he would have wished to confide only to a      select auditory at the back of the curtain for it is seldom      that we can get any frank utterance from men who address      for the most part a buncombe either in this world or the      next as for their audiences it may be truly said of our      people that they enjoy one political institution in common      with the ancient athenians i mean a certain profitless kind      of ostracism wherewith nevertheless they seem hitherto      well enough content for in presidential elections and      other affairs of the sort whereas i observe that the      oysters fall to the lot of comparatively few the shells      such as the privileges of voting as they are told to do by      the ostrivori aforesaid and of huzzaing at public      meetings are very liberally distributed among the people      as being their prescriptive and quite sufficient portion       the occasion of the speech is supposed to be mr palfreys      refusal to vote for the

a squintin to foorier   ill be thet is i mean ill be blest   ef i hark to a word frum so noted a pest   i shant talk with him my religions too fervent   good mornin my friends im your most humble servant       into the question whether the ability to express ourselves      in articulate language has been productive of more good or      evil i shall not here enter at large the two faculties of      speech and of speechmaking are wholly diverse in their      natures by the first we make ourselves intelligible by the      last unintelligible to our fellows it has not seldom      occurred to me noting how in our national legislature every      thing runs to talk as lettuces if the season or the soil      be unpropitious shoot up lankly to seed instead of forming      handsome heads that babel was the first congress the      earliest mill erected for the manufacture of gabble in      these days what with town meetings school committees      boards lumber of one kind and another congresses      parliaments diets indian councils palavers and the like      there is scarce a village which has not its factories of      this description driven by milkand water power i cannot      conceive the confusion of tongues to have been the curse of      babel since i esteem my ignorance of other languages as a      kind of martellotower in which i am safe from the furious      bombardments of foreign garrulity for this reason i have      ever preferred the study of the dead languages those      primitive formations being ararats upon whose silent peaks i      sit secure and watch this new deluge without fear though it      rain figures simulacra semblances of speech forty days      and nights together as it not uncommonly happens thus is      my coat as it were without buttons by which any but a      vernacular wild bore can seize me is it not possible that      the shakers may intend to convey a quiet reproof and hint      in fastening their outer garments with hooks and eyes       this reflection concerning babel which i find in no      commentary was first thrown upon my mind when an excellent      deacon of my congregation being infected with the second      advent delusion assured me that he had received a first      instalment of the gift of tongues as a small earnest of      larger possessions in the like kind to follow for of a      truth i could not reconcile it with my ideas of the divine      justice and mercy that the single wall which protected      people of other languages from the incursions of this      otherwise wellmeaning propagandist should be broken down       in reading congressional debates i have fancied that      after the subsidence of those painful buzzings in the brain      which result from such exercises i detected a slender      residuum of valuable information i made the discovery that      nothing takes longer in the saying than any thing else      for as ex nihilo nihil fit so from one polypus nothing      any number of similar ones may be produced i would      recommend to the attention of vivâ voce debaters and      controversialists the admirable example of the monk copres      who in the fourth century stood for half an hour in the      midst of a great fire and thereby silenced a manichæan      antagonist who had less of the salamander in him as for      those who quarrel in print i have no concern with them      here since the eyelids are a divinelygranted shield      against all such moreover i have observed in many modern      books that the printed portion is becoming gradually      smaller and the number of blank or flyleaves as they are      called greater should this fortunate tendency of      literature continue books will grow more valuable from year      to year and the whole serbonian bog yield to the advances      of firm arable land       the sagacious lacedæmonians hearing that tesephone had      bragged that he could talk all day long on any given      subject made no more ado but forthwith banished him      whereby they supplied him a topic and at the same time took      care that his experiment upon it should be tried out of      earshot       i have wondered in the representatives chamber of our own      commonwealth to mark how little impression seemed to be      produced by that emblematic fish suspended over the heads of      the members our wiser ancestors no doubt hung it there as      being the animal which the pythagoreans reverenced for its      silence and which certainly in that particular does not so      well merit the epithet coldblooded by which naturalists      distinguish it as certain bipeds afflicted with      ditchwater on the brain who take occasion to tap      themselves in fanueil halls meetinghouses and other      places of public resorth w                                     no v                        the debate in the sennit                          sot to a nusry rhyme        the incident which gave rise to the debate satirized in the      following verses was the unsuccessful attempt of drayton and      sayres to give freedom to seventy men and women      fellowbeings and fellowchristians had tripoli instead of      washington been the scene of this undertaking the unhappy      leaders in it would have been as secure of the theoretic as      they now are of the practical part of martyrdom i question      whether the dey of tripoli is blessed with a district      attorney so benighted as ours at the seat of government      very fitly is he named key who would allow himself to be      made the instrument of locking the door of hope against      sufferers in such a cause not all the waters of the ocean      can cleanse the vile smutch of the jailers fingers from off      that little key ahenea clavis a brazen key indeed       mr calhoun who is made the chief speaker in this      burlesque seems to think that the light of the nineteenth      century is to be put out as soon as he tinkles his little      cowbell curfew whenever slavery is touched he sets up his      scarecrow of dissolving the union this may do for the      north but i should conjecture that something more than a      pumpkinlantern is required to scare manifest and      irretrievable destiny out of her path mr calhoun cannot      let go the apronstring of the past the past is a good      nurse but we must be weaned from her sooner or later even      though like plotinus we should run home from school to ask      the breast after we are tolerably wellgrown youths it      will not do for us to hide our faces in her lap whenever      the strange future holds out her arms and asks us to come to      her       but we are all alike we have all heard it said often      enough that little boys must not play with fire and yet      if the matches be taken away from us and put out of reach      upon the shelf we must needs get into our little corner      and scowl and stamp and threaten the dire revenge of going      to bed without our supper the world shall stop till we get      our dangerous plaything again dame earth meanwhile who      has more than enough household matters to mind goes      bustling hither and thither as a hiss or a sputter tells her      that this or that kettle of hers is boiling over and before      bedtime we are glad to eat our porridge cold and gulp down      our dignity along with it       mr calhoun has somehow acquired the name of a great      statesman and if it be great statesmanship to put lance in      rest and run a tilt at the spirit of the age with the      certainty of being next moment hurled neck and heels into      the dust amid universal laughter he deserves the title he      is the sir kay of our modern chivalry he should remember      the old scandinavian mythus thor was the strongest of gods      but he could not wrestle with time nor so much as lift up a      fold of the great snake which knit the universe together      and when he smote the earth though with his terrible      mallet it was but as if a leaf had fallen yet all the      while it seemed to thor that he had only been wrestling with      an old woman striving to lift a cat and striking a stupid      giant on the head       and in old times doubtless the giants were stupid and      there was no better sport for the sir launcelots and sir      gawains than to go about cutting off their great blundering      heads with enchanted swords but things have wonderfully      changed it is the giants nowadays that have the science      and the intelligence while the chivalrous don quixotes of      conservatism still cumber themselves with the clumsy armor      of a bygone age on whirls the restless globe through      unsounded time with its cities and its silences its births      and funerals half light half shade but never wholly dark      and sure to swing round into the happy morning at last with      an involuntary smile one sees mr calhoun letting slip his      packthread cable with a crooked pin at the end of it to      anchor south carolina upon the bank and shoal of the      pasth w                             to mr buckenam

of our patriarchal brethren of the south yet it is      clear that their possessions have legs and an unaccountable      propensity for using them in a northerly direction i marvel      that the grand jury of washington did not find a true bill      against the north star for aiding and abetting drayton and      sayres it would have been quite of a piece with the      intelligence displayed by the south on other questions      connected with slavery i think that no ship of state was      ever freighted with a more veritable jonah than this same      domestic institution of ours mephistopheles himself could      not feign so bitterly so satirically sad a sight as this of      three millions of human beings crushed beyond help or hope      by this one mighty argumentour fathers knew no better      nevertheless it is the unavoidable destiny of jonahs to be      cast overboard sooner or later or shall we try the      experiment of hiding our jonah in a safe place that none      may lay hands on him to make jetsam of him let us then      with equal forethought and wisdom lash ourselves to the      anchor and await in pious confidence the certain result      perhaps our suspicious passenger is no jonah after all      being black for it is well known that a superintending      providence made a kind of sandwich of ham and his      descendants to be devoured by the caucasian race       in gods name let all who hear nearer and nearer the      hungry moan of the storm and the growl of the breakers      speak out but alas we have no right to interfere if a      man pluck an apple of mine he shall be in danger of the      justice but if he steal my brother i must be silent who      says this our constitution consecrated by the callous      consuetude of sixty years and grasped

   quid sum miser tunc dicturus             quem patronum rogaturus       there is a point where toleration sinks into sheer baseness      and poltroonery the toleration of the worst leads us to      look on what is barely better as good enough and to worship      what is only moderately good woe to that man or that      nation to whom mediocrity has become an ideal       has our experiment of

the invention      of printing indeed the position which he holds is that      which the clergyman should hold even now but the clergyman      chooses to walk off to the extreme edge of the world and to      throw such seed as he has clear over into that darkness      which he calls the next life as if next did not mean      nearest and as if any life were nearer than that      immediately present one which boils and eddies all around      him at the caucus the ratification meeting and the polls      who taught him to exhort men to prepare for eternity as for      some future era of which the present forms no integral part      the furrow which time is even now turning runs through the      everlasting and in that must he plant or nowhere yet he      would fain believe and teach that we are going to have      more of eternity than we have now this going of his is      like that of the auctioneer on which gone follows before      we have made up our minds to bidin which manner not      three months back i lost an excellent copy of chappelow on      job so it has come to pass that the preacher instead of      being a living force has faded into an emblematic figure at      christenings weddings and funerals or if he exercise any      other function it is as keeper and feeder of certain      theologic dogmas which when occasion offers he unkennels      with a staboy to bark and bite as tis their nature to      whence that reproach of odium theologicum has arisen       meanwhile see what a pulpit the editor mounts daily      sometimes with a congregation of fifty thousand within reach      of his voice and never so much as a nodder even among      them and from what a bible can he choose his texta bible      which needs no translation and which no priestcraft can      shut and clasp from the laitythe open volume of the      world upon which with a pen of sunshine or destroying      fire the inspired present is even now writing the annals of      god methinks the editor who should understand his calling      and be equal thereto would truly deserve that title of      ποιμὴν λαῶν which homer bestows upon princes he would be      the moses of our nineteenth century and whereas the old      sinai silent now is but a common mountain stared at by the      elegant tourist and crawled over by the hammering geologist      he must find his tables of the new law here among factories      and cities in this wilderness of sin numbers xxxiii 12      called progress of civilization and be the captain of our      exodus into the canaan of a truer social order       nevertheless our editor will not come so far within even      the shadow of sinai as mahomet did but chooses rather to      construe moses by joe smith he takes up the crook not that      the sheep may be fed but that he may never want a warm      woollen suit and a joint of mutton            immemor o fidei pecorumque oblite tuorum       for which reason i would derive the name editor not so      much from edo to publish as from edo to eat that      being the peculiar profession to which he esteems himself      called he blows up the flames of political discord for no      other occasion than that he may thereby handily boil his own      pot i believe there are two thousand of these muttonloving      shepherds in the united states and of these how many have      even

eyes to see it rightly is the      newspaper to me for example sitting on the critical front      bench of the pit in my study here in jaalam the advent of      my weekly journal is as that of a strolling theatre or      rather of a puppetshow on whose stage narrow as it is      the tragedy comedy and farce of life are played in little      behold the whole huge earth sent to me hebdomadally in a      brownpaper wrapper       hither to my obscure corner by wind or steam on      horseback or dromedaryback in the pouch of the indian      runner or clicking over the magnetic wires troop all the      famous performers from the four quarters of the globe      looked at from a point of criticism tiny puppets they seem      all as the editor sets up his booth upon my desk and      officiates as showman now i can truly see how little and      transitory is life the earth appears almost as a drop of      vinegar on which the solar microscope of the imagination      must be brought to bear in order to make out anything      distinctly that animalcule there in the peajacket is      louis philippe just landed on the coast of england that      other in the gray surtout and cocked hat is napoleon      bonaparte smith assuring france that she need apprehend no      interference from him in the present alarming juncture at      that spot where you seem to see a speck of something in      motion is an immense massmeeting look sharper and you      will see a mite brandishing his mandibles in an excited      manner that is the great mr soandso defining his position      amid tumultuous and irrepressible cheers that infinitesimal      creature upon whom some score of others as minute as he      are gazing in openmouthed admiration is a famous      philosopher expounding to a select audience their capacity      for the infinite that scarce discernible pufflet of smoke      and dust is a revolution that speck there is a reformer      just arranging the lever with which he is to move the world      and lo there creeps forward the shadow of a skeleton that      blows one breath between its grinning teeth and all our      distinguished actors are whisked off the slippery stage into      the dark beyond       yes the little showbox has its solemner suggestions now      and then we catch a glimpse of a grim old man who lays down      a scythe and hourglass in the corner while he shifts the      scenes there too in the dim background a weird shape is      ever delving sometimes he leans upon his mattock and      gazes as a coach whirls by bearing the newly married on      their wedding jaunt or glances carelessly at a babe brought      home from christening suddenly for the scene grows larger      and larger as we look a bony hand snatches back a performer      in the midst of his part and him whom yesterday two      infinites past and future would not suffice a handful of      dust is enough to cover and silence forever nay we see the      same fleshless fingers opening to clutch the showman      himself and guess not without a shudder that they are      lying in wait for spectator also       think of it for three dollars a year i buy a seasonticket      to this great globe theatre for which god would write the      dramas only that we like farces spectacles and the      tragedies of apollyon better whose sceneshifter is time      and whose curtain is rung down by death       such thoughts will occur to me sometimes as i am tearing      off the wrapper of my newspaper then suddenly that      otherwise too often vacant sheet becomes invested for me      with a strange kind of awe look deaths and marriages      notices of inventions discoveries and books lists of      promotions of killed wounded and missing news of fires      accidents of sudden wealth and as sudden povertyi hold      in my hand the ends of myriad invisible electric conductors      along which tremble the joys sorrows wrongs triumphs      hopes and despairs of as many men and women everywhere so      that upon that mood of mind which seems to isolate me from      mankind as a spectator of their puppetpranks another      supervenes in which i feel that i too unknown and unheard      of am yet of some import to my fellows for through my      newspaper here do not families take pains to send me an      entire stranger news of a death among them are not here      two who would have me know of their marriage and strangest      of all is not this singular person anxious to have me      informed that he has received a fresh supply of dimitry      bruisgins but to none of us does the president continue      miraculous even if for a moment discerned as such we      glance carelessly at the sunrise and get used to orion and      the pleiades the wonder wears off and tomorrow this      sheet in which a vision was let down to me from heaven      shall be the wrappage to a bar of soap or the platter for a      beggars broken victualsh w

editor of the national antislavery standard        curiosity may be said to be the quality which preeminently      distinguishes and segregates man from the lower animals as      we trace the scale of animated nature downward we find this      faculty as it may truly be called of the mind diminished      in the savage and quite extinct in the brute the first      object which civilized man proposes to himself i take to be      the finding out whatsoever he can concerning his neighbors      nihil humanum a me alienum puto i am curious about even      john smith the desire next in strength to this an opposite      pole indeed of the same magnet is that of communicating      the unintelligence we have carefully picked up       men in general may be divided into the inquisitive and the      communicative to the first class belong peeping toms      eavesdroppers navelcontemplating brahmins      metaphysicians travellers empedocleses spies the various      societies for promoting rhinothism columbuses yankees      discoverers and men of science who present themselves to      the mind as so many marks of interrogation wandering up and      down the world or sitting in studies and laboratories the      second class i should again subdivide into four in the      first subdivision i would rank those who have an itch to      tell us about themselvesas keepers of diaries      insignificant persons generally montaignes horace      walpoles autobiographers poets the second includes those      who are anxious to impart information concerning other      peopleas historians barbers and such to the third      belong those who labor to give us intelligence about nothing      at allas novelists political orators the large majority      of authors preachers lecturers and the like in the      fourth come those who are communicative from motives of      public benevolenceas finders of maresnests and bringers      of ill news each of us twolegged fowls without feathers      embraces all these subdivisions in himself to a greater or      less degree for none of us so much as lays an egg or      incubates a chalk one but straightway the whole barnyard      shall know it by our cackle or our cluck omnibus hoc      vitium est there are different grades in all these      classes one will turn his telescope toward a backyard      another toward uranus one will tell you that he dined with      smith another that he supped with plato in one particular      all men may be considered as belonging to the first grand      division inasmuch as they all seem equally desirous of      discovering the mote in their neighbors eye       to one or another of these species every human being may      safely be referred i think it beyond a peradventure that      jonah prosecuted some inquiries into the digestive apparatus      of whales and that noah sealed up a letter in an empty      bottle that news in regard to him might not be wanting in      case of the worst they had else been super or subter human      i conceive also that as there are certain persons who      continually peep and pry at the keyhole of that mysterious      door through which sooner or later we all make our exits      so there are doubtless ghosts fidgetting and fretting on the      other side of it because they have no means of conveying      back to this world the scraps of news they have picked up in      that for there is an answer ready somewhere to every      question the great law of give and take runs through all      nature and if we see a hook we may be sure that an eye is      waiting for it i read in every face i meet a standing      advertisement of information wanted in regard to a b or      that the friends of c d can hear something to his      disadvantage by application to such a one       it was to gratify the two great passions of asking and      answering that epistolary correspondence was first invented      letters for by this usurped title epistles are now commonly      known are of several kinds first there are those which      are not letters at allas letterspatent letters      dismissory letters enclosing bills letters of      administration plinys letters letters of diplomacy of      cato of mentor of lords lyttleton chesterfield and      orrery of jacob behmen seneca whom st jerome includes in      his list of sacred writers letters from abroad from sons      in college to their fathers letters of marque and letters      generally which are in nowise letters of mark second are      real letters such as those of gray cowper walpole howel      lamb d y the first letters from children printed in      staggering capitals letters from new york letters of      credit and others interesting for the sake of the writer      or the thing written i have read also letters from europe      by a gentleman named pinto containing some curious gossip      and which i hope to see collected for the benefit of the      curious there are besides letters addressed to      posterityas epitaphs for example written for their own      monuments by monarchs whereby we have lately become      possessed of the names of several great conquerors and kings      of kings hitherto unheard of and still unpronounceable but      valuable to the student of the entirely dark ages the      letter which st peter sent to king pepin in the year of      grace 755 that of the virgin to the magistrates of messina      that of st gregory thaumaturgus to the dl and that of      this lastmentioned active policemagistrate to a nun of      girgenti i would place in a class by themselves as also      the letters of candidates concerning which i shall dilate      more fully in a note at the end of the following poem at      present sat

safely enough be called a republic of letters      epistolary composition becomes then an epidemic which      seizes one candidate after another not seldom cutting short      the thread of political life it has come to such a pass      that a party dreads less the attacks of its opponents than a      letter from its candidate litera scripta manet and it      will go hard if something bad can not be made of it general      harrison it is well understood was surrounded during his      candidacy with the cordon sanitaire of a vigilance      committee no prisoner in spielberg was ever more cautiously      deprived of writing materials the soot was scraped      carefully from the chimneyplaces outposts of expert      rifleshooters rendered it sure death for any goose who      came clad in feathers to approach within a certain limited      distance of north bend and all domestic fowls about the      premises were reduced to the condition of platos original      man by these precautions the general was saved parva      componere magnis i remember that when partyspirit once      ran high among my people upon occasion of the choice of a      new deacon i having my preferences yet not caring too      openly to express them made use of an innocent fraud to      bring about that result which i deemed most desirable my      stratagem was no other than the throwing a copy of the      complete letterwriter in the way of the candidate whom i      wished to defeat he caught the infection and addressed a      short note to his constituents in which the opposite party      detected so many and so grave improprieties he had      modelled it upon the letter of a young lady accepting a      proposal of marriage that he not only lost his election      but falling under a suspicion of sabellianism and i know      not what the widow endive assured me that he was a      paralipomenon to her certain knowledge was forced to      leave the town thus it is that the letter killeth       the object which candidates propose to themselves in writing      is to convey no meaning at all and here is a quite      unsuspected pitfall into which they successively plunge      headlong for it is precisely in such cryptographies that      mankind are prone to seek for and find a wonderful amount      and variety of significance omne ignotum pro mirifico      how do we admire at the antique world striving to crack      those oracular nuts from delphi hammon and elsewhere in      only one of which can i so much as surmise that any kernel      had ever lodged that namely wherein apollo confessed that      he was mortal one didymus is moreover related to have      written six thousand books on the single subject of grammar      a topic rendered only more tenebrific by the labors of his      successors and which seems still to possess an attraction      for authors in proportion as they can make nothing of it a      singular loadstone for theologians also is the beast in      the apocalypse whereof in the course of my studies i have      noted two hundred and three several interpretations each      lethiferal to all the rest non nostrum est tantas      componere lites yet i have myself ventured upon a two      hundred and fourth which i embodied in a discourse preached      on occasion of the demise of the late usurper napoleon      bonaparte and which quieted in a large measure the minds      of my people it is true that my views on this important      point were ardently controverted by mr shearjashub holden      the then preceptor of our academy and in other particulars      a very deserving and sensible young man though possessing a      somewhat limited knowledge of the greek tongue but his      heresy struck down no deep root and he having been lately      removed by the hand of providence i had the satisfaction of      reaffirming my cherished sentiments in a sermon preached      upon the lords day immediately succeeding his funeral this      might seem like taking an unfair advantage did i not add      that he had made provision in his last will being celibate      for the publication of a posthumous tractate in support of      his own dangerous opinions       i know of nothing in our modern times which approaches so      nearly to the ancient oracle as the letter of a presidential      candidate now among the greeks the eating of beans was      strictly forbidden to all such as had it in mind to consult      those expert amphibologists and this same prohibition on      the part of pythagoras to his disciples is understood to      imply an abstinence from politics beans having been used as      ballots that other explication quod videlicet sensus eo      cibo obtundi existimaret though supported pugnis et      calcibus by many of the learned and not wanting the      countenance of cicero is confuted by the larger experience      of new england on the whole i think it safer to apply here      the rule of interpretation which now generally obtains in      regard to antique cosmogonies myths fables proverbial      expressions and knotty points generally which is to find      a commonsense meaning and then select whatever can be      imagined the most opposite thereto in this way we arrive at      the conclusion that the greeks objected to the questioning      of candidates and very properly if as i conceive the      chief point be not to discover what a person in that      position is or what he will do but whether he can be      elected vos exemplaria græca nocturna versate manu      versate diurna       but since an imitation of the greeks in this particular      the asking of questions being one chief privilege of      freemen is hardly to be hoped for and our candidates will      answer whether they are questioned or not i would      recommend that these anteelectionary dialogues should be      carried on by symbols as were the diplomatic      correspondences of the scythians and macrobii or confined      to the language of signs like the famous interview of      panurge and goatsnose a candidate might then convey a      suitable reply to all committees of inquiry by closing one      eye or by presenting them with a phial of egyptian darkness      to be speculated upon by their respective constituencies      these answers would be susceptible of whatever retrospective      construction the exigencies of the political campaign might      seem to demand and the candidate could take his position on      either side of the fence with entire consistency or if      letters must be written profitable use might be made of the      dighton rock hieroglyphic or the cuneiform script every      fresh decipherer of which is enabled to educe a different      meaning whereby a sculptured stone or two supplies us and      will probably continue to supply posterity with a very vast      and various body of authentic history for even the briefest      epistle in the ordinary chirography is dangerous there is      scarce any style so compressed that superfluous words may      not be detected in it a severe critic might curtail that      famous brevity of cæsars by two thirds drawing his pen      through the supererogatory veni and vidi perhaps after      all the surest footing of hope is to be found in the      rapidly increasing tendency to demand less and less of      qualification in candidates already have statesmanship      experience and the possession nay the profession even      of principles been rejected as superfluous and may not the      patriot reasonably hope that the ability to write will      follow at present there may be death in pothooks as well      as pots the loop of a letter may suffice

tribulation quid non mortalia      pectora cogis auri sacra fames the speculation has      sometimes crossed my mind in that dreary interval of      drought which intervenes between quarterly stipendiary      showers that providence by the creation of a moneytree      might have simplified wonderfully the sometimes perplexing      problem of human life we read of breadtrees the butter

quite tasteless and      innutritious of trees bearing men we are not without      examples as those in the park of louis the eleventh of      france who has forgotten moreover that olivetree      growing in the athenians backgarden with its strange      uxorious crop for the general propagation of which as of a      new and precious variety the philosopher diogenes hitherto      uninterested in arboriculture was so zealous in the      sylva of our own southern states the females of my family      have called my attention to the chinatree not to multiply      examples i will barely add to my list the birchtree in      the smaller branches of which has been implanted so      miraculous a virtue for communicating the latin and greek      languages and which may well therefore be classed among      the trees producing necessaries of lifevenerabile donum      fatalis virgæ that moneytrees existed in the golden age      there want not prevalent reasons for our believing for does      not the old proverb when it asserts that money does not      grow on every bush imply a fortiori that there were      certain bushes which did produce it again there is another      ancient saw to the effect that money is the root of all      evil from which two adages it may be safe to infer that the      aforesaid species of tree first degenerated into a shrub      then absconded underground and finally in our iron age      vanished altogether in favorable exposures it may be      conjectured that a specimen or two survived to a great age      as in the garden of the hesperides and indeed what else      could that tree in the sixth Æneid have been with a branch      whereof the trojan hero procured admission to a territory      for the entering of which money is a surer passport than to      a certain other more profitable too foreign kingdom      whether these speculations of mine have any force in them      or whether they will not rather by most readers be deemed      impertinent to the matter in hand is a question which i      leave to the determination of an indulgent posterity that      there were in more primitive and happier times shops where      money was soldand that too on credit and at a      bargaini take to be matter of demonstration for what but      a dealer in this article was that Æolus who supplied ulysses      with motive power for his fleet in bags what that ericus      king of sweden who is said to have kept the winds in his      cap what in more recent times those lapland nornas who      traded in favorable breezes all which will appear the more      clearly when we consider that even to this day raising      the wind is proverbial for raising money and that brokers      and banks were invented by the venetians at a later period       and now for the improvement of this digression i find a      parallel to mr sawins fortune in an adventure of my own      for shortly after i had first broached to myself the      beforestated naturalhistorical and archæological theories      as i was passing hæc negotia penitus mecum revolvens      through one of the obscure suburbs of our new england      metropolis my eye was attracted by these words upon a      signboardcheap cashstore here was at once the      confirmation of my speculations and the substance of my      hopes here lingered the fragment of a happier past or      stretched out the first tremulous organic filament of a more      fortunate future thus glowed the distant mexico to the eyes      of sawin as he looked through the dirty pane of the

halfbelieving glance expended in various      useful directions the funds to be obtained by pledging the      manuscript of a proposed volume of discourses already did a      clock ornament the tower of the jaalam meetinghouse a gift      appropriately but modestly commemorated in the parish and      town records both for now many years kept by myself      already had my son seneca completed his course at the      university whether for the moment we may not be      considered as actually lording it over those baratarias with      the viceroyalty of which hope invests us and whether we are      ever so warmly housed as in our spanish castles would      afford matter of argument enough that i found that      signboard to be no other than a bait to the trap of a      decayed grocer nevertheless i bought a pound of dates      getting short weight by reason of immense flights of harpy      flies who pursued and lighted upon their prey even in the      very scales which purchase i made not only with an eye to      the little ones at home but also as a figurative reproof of      that too frequent habit of my mind which forgetting the      due order of chronology will often persuade me that the      happy sceptre of saturn is stretched over this      astræaforsaken nineteenth century       having glanced at the ledger of glory under the title      sawin b let us extend our investigations and discover      if that instructive volume does not contain some charges      more personally interesting to ourselves i think we should      be more economical of our resources did we thoroughly      appreciate the fact that whenever brother jonathan seems      to be thrusting his hand into his own pocket he is in      fact picking ours i confess that the late muck which the      country has been running has materially changed my views as      to the best method of raising revenue if by means of      direct taxation the bills for every extraordinary outlay      were brought under our immediate eye so that like thrifty      housekeepers we could see where and how fast the money was      going we should be less likely to commit extravagances at      present these things are managed in such a huggermugger      way that we know not what we pay for the poor man is      charged as much as the rich and while we are saving and      scrimping at the spigot the government is drawing off at      the bung if we could know that a part of the money we      expend for tea and coffee goes to buy powder and balls and      that it is mexican blood which makes the clothes on our      backs more costly it would set some of us athinking during      the present fall i have often pictured to myself a      government official entering my study and handing me the

about      obtaining money under the false pretence of being glory for      me i have an imagination which plays me uncomfortable      tricks it happens to me sometimes to see a slaughterer on      his way home from his days work and forthwith my      imagination puts a cockedhat upon his head and epaulettes      upon his shoulders and sets him up as a candidate for the      presidency so also on a recent public occasion as the      place assigned to the reverend clergy is just behind that      of officers of the army and navy in processions it was my      fortune to be seated at the

   no ix                    a third letter from b sawin esq        upon the following letter slender comment will be needful      in what river selemnus has mr sawin bathed that he has      become so swiftly oblivious of his former loves from an      ardent and as befits a soldier confident wooer of that coy      bride the popular favor we see him subside of a sudden      into the i trust not jilted cincinnatus returning to his      plough with a goodlysized branch of willow in his hand      figuratively returning however to a figurative plough and      from no profound affection for that honored implement of      husbandry for which indeed mr sawin never displayed any      decided predilection but in order to be gracefully      summoned therefrom to more congenial labors it would seem      that the character of the ancient dictator had become part      of the recognized stock of our modern political comedy      though as our term of office extends to a quadrennial      length the parallel is not so minutely exact as could be      desired it is sufficiently so however for purposes of      scenic representation an humble cottage if built of logs      the better forms the arcadian background of the stage this      rustic paradise is labelled ashland jaalam north bend      marshfield kinderhook or bâton rouge as occasion demands      before the door stands a something

by      appropriate groups of happy laborers or from it the      successful one is torn with difficulty sustained alone by a      noble sense of public duty only i have observed that if      the scene be laid at bâton rouge or ashland the laborers      are kept carefully in the background and are heard to shout      from behind the scenes in a singular tone resembling      ululation and accompanied by a sound not unlike vigorous      clapping this however may be artistically in keeping with      the habits of the rustic population of those localities the      precise connection between agricultural pursuits and      statesmanship i have not been able after diligent inquiry      to discover but that my investigations may not be barren      of all fruit i will mention one curious statistical fact      which i consider thoroughly established namely that no      real farmer ever attains practically beyond a seat in      general court however theoretically qualified for more      exalted station       it is probable that some other prospect has been opened to      mr sawin and that he has not made this great sacrifice      without some definite understanding in regard to a seat in      the cabinet or a foreign mission it may be supposed that we      of jaalam were not untouched by a feeling of villatic pride      in beholding our townsman occupying so large a space in the      public eye and to me deeply revolving the qualifications      necessary to a candidate in these frugal times those of mr      s seemed peculiarly adapted to a successful campaign the      loss of a leg an arm an eye and four fingers reduced him      so nearly to the condition of a vox et præterea nihil      that i could think of nothing but the loss of his head by      which his chance

i trust      with some mutual satisfaction i say patient for i love      not that kind which skims dippingly over the surface of the      page as swallows over a pool before rain by such no pearls      shall be gathered but if no pearls there be as indeed      the world is not without example of books wherefrom the      longestwinded diver shall bring up no more than his proper      handful of mud yet let us hope that an oyster or two may      reward adequate perseverance if neither pearls nor oysters      yet is patience itself a gem worth diving deeply for       it may seem to some that too much space has been usurped by      my own private lucubrations and some may be fain to bring      against me that old jest of him who preached all his hearers      out of the meetinghouse save only the sexton who remaining      for yet a little space from a sense of official duty at      last gave out also and presenting the keys humbly      requested our preacher to lock the doors when he should      have wholly relieved himself of his testimony i confess to      a satisfaction in the self act of preaching nor do i esteem      a discourse to be wholly thrown away even upon a sleeping or      unintelligent auditory i cannot easily believe that the      gospel of saint john which jacques cartier ordered to be      read in the latin tongue to the canadian savages upon his      first meeting with them fell altogether upon stony ground      for the earnestness of the preacher is a sermon appreciable      by dullest intellects and most alien ears in this wise did      episcopius convert many to his opinions who yet understood      not the language in which he discoursed the chief thing is      that the messenger believe that he has an authentic message      to deliver for counterfeit messengers that mode of      treatment which father john de plano carpini relates to have      prevailed among the tartars would seem effectual and      perhaps deserved enough for my own part i may lay claim      to so much of the spirit of martyrdom as would have led me      to go into banishment with those clergymen whom alphonso the      sixth of portugal drave out of his kingdom for refusing to      shorten their public eloquence it is possible that having      been invited into my brother biglows desk i may have been      too little scrupulous in using it for the venting of my own      peculiar doctrines to a congregation drawn together in the      expectation and with the desire of hearing him       i am not wholly unconscious of a peculiarity of mental      organization which impels me like the railroadengine with      its train of cars to run backward for a short distance in      order to obtain a fairer start i may compare myself to one      fishing from the rocks when the sea runs high who      misinterpreting the suction of the undertow for the biting      of some larger fish jerks suddenly and finds that he has      caught bottom hauling in upon the end of his line a trail      of various algæ among which nevertheless the naturalist      may haply find something to repay the disappointment of the      angler yet have i conscientiously endeavored to adapt      myself to the impatient temper of the age daily      degenerating more and more from the high standard of our      pristine new england to the catalogue of lost arts i would      mournfully add also that of listening to twohour sermons      surely we have been abridged into a race of pigmies for      truly in those of the old discourses yet subsisting to us      in print the endless spinal column of divisions and      subdivisions can be likened to nothing so exactly as to the      vertebræ of the saurians whence the theorist may conjecture      a race of anakim proportionate to the withstanding of these      other monsters i say anakim rather than nephelim because      there seem reasons for supposing that the race of those      whose heads though no giants are constantly enveloped in      clouds which that name imports will never become extinct      the attempt to vanquish the innumerable heads of one of      those aforementioned discourses may supply us with a      plausible interpretation of the second labor of hercules      and his successful experiment with fire affords us a useful      precedent       but while i lament the degeneracy of the age in this regard      i cannot refuse to succumb to its influence looking out      through my studywindow i see mr biglow at a distance busy      in gathering his baldwins of which to judge by the number      of barrels lying about under the trees his crop is more      abundant than my ownby which sight i am admonished to      turn to those orchards of the mind wherein my labors may be

his house and his wife            moved into it     my worthy friend a gordon knott     from business snug withdrawn   was much contented with a lot   that would contain a tudor cot   twixt twelve feet square of gardenplot     and twelve feet more of lawn    he had laid business on the shelf     to give his taste expansion   and since no man retired with pelf     the building mania can shun   knott being middleaged himself   resolved to build unhappy elf     a mediæval mansion    he called an architect in counsel    i want said he ayou know what     you are a builder i am knott     a thing complete from chimneypot   down to the very grounsel     heres a halfacre of good land     just have it nicely mapped and planned   and make your workmen drive on     meadow there is and upland too     and i should like a waterview   d you think you could contrive one     perhaps the pump and trough would do     if painted a judicious blue     the woodland ive attended to     he meant three pines stuck up askew   two dead ones and a live one     a pocketfull of rocks t would take   to build a house of freestone     but then it is not hard to make   what nowadays is the stone     the cunning painter in a trice     your houses outside petrifies     and people think it very gneiss   without inquiring deeper     my money never shall be thrown     away on such a deal of stone   when stone of deal is cheaper    and so the greenest of antiques     was reared for knott to dwell in   the architect worked hard for weeks   in venting all his private peaks   upon the roof whose crop of leaks     had satisfied fluellen   whatever any body had   out of the common good or bad     knott had it all worked well in   a donjonkeep where clothes might dry   a porters lodge that was a sty   a campanile slim and high     too small to hang a bell in   all up and down and here and there   with lordknowswhats of round and square   stuck on at random every where   it was a house to make one stare     all corners and all gables   like dogs let loose upon a bear   ten emulous styles staboyed with care   the whole among them seemed to tear   and all the oddities to spare     were set upon the stables    knott was delighted with a pile     approved by fashions leaders   only he made the builder smile   by asking every little while   why that was called the twodoor style     which certainly had three doors   yet better for this luckless man   if he had put a downright ban     upon the thing in limine   for though to quit affairs his plan   ere many days poor knott began   perforce accepting draughts that ran     all waysexcept up chimney   the house though painted stone to mock   with nice white lines round every block     some trepidation stood in   when tempests with petrific shock   so to speak made it really rock     though not a whit less wooden   and painted stone howeer well done   will not take in the prodigal sun   whose beams are never quite at one     with our terrestrial lumber   so the wood shrank around the knots   and gaped in disconcerting spots   and there were lots of dots and rots     and crannies without number   wherethrough as you may well presume   the wind like water through a flume     came rushing in ecstatic   leaving in all three floors no room     that was not a rheumatic   and what with points and squares and rounds     grown shaky on their poises   the house at night was full of pounds   thumps bumps creaks scratchings rapstillzounds   cried knott this goes beyond all bounds   i do not deal in tongues and sounds   nor have i let my house and grounds     to a family of noyeses    but though knotts house was full of airs     he had but onea daughter   and as he owned much stocks and shares   many who wished to render theirs   such vain unsatisfying cares   and needed wives to sew their tears     in matrimony sought her   they vowed her gold they wanted not     their faith would never falter   they longed to tie this single knott     in the hymenæal halter   so daily at the door they rang     cards for the belle delivering   or in the choir at her they sang   achieving such a rapturous twang     as set her nerves ashivering    now knott had quite made up his mind     that colonel jones should have her   no beauty he but oft we find   sweet kernels neath a roughish rind   so hoped his jennyd be resigned     and make no more palaver   glanced at the fact that love was blind   that girls were ratherish inclined     to pet their little crosses   then nosologically defined   the rate at which the system pined   in those unfortunates who dined   upon that metaphoric kind     of dishtheir own proboscis    but she with many tears and moans     besought him not to mock her   said twas too much for flesh and bones   to marry mortgages and loans   that fathers hearts were stocks and stones   and that shed go when mrs jones     to davy joness locker   then gave her head a little toss   that said as plain as ever was   if men are always at a loss     mere womankind to bridle   to try the thing on woman cross     were fifty times as idle   for she a strict resolve had made     and registered in private   that either she would die a maid   or else be mrs doctor slade     if woman could contrive it   and though the weddingday was set     jenny was more so rather   declaring in a pretty pet   that howsoeer they spread their net   she would outjennyral them yet     the colonel and her father    just at this time the publics eyes     were keenly on the watch a stir   beginning slowly to arise   about those questions and replies   those raps that unwrapped mysteries     so rapidly at rochester   and knott already nervous grown   by lying much awake alone   and listening sometimes to a moan     and sometimes to a clatter   wheneer the wind at night would rouse   the gingerbreadwork on his house   or when some hastytempered mouse   behind the plastering made a towse     about a family matter   began to wonder if his wife   a paralytic half her life     which made it more surprising   might not to rule him from her urn   have taken a peripatetic turn     for want of exorcising    this thought once nestled in his head   ere long contagious grew and spread   infecting all his mind with dread   until at last he lay in bed   and heard his wife with wellknown tread   entering the kitchen through the shed     or wast his fancy mocking   opening the pantry cutting bread   and then shed been some ten years dead     closets and drawers unlocking   or in his room his breath grew thick   he heard the longfamiliar click   of slender needles flying quick     as if she knit a stocking   for whomhe prayed that years might flit     with pains rheumatic shooting   before those ghostly things she knit   upon his unfleshed sole might fit   he did not fancy it a bit     to stand upon that footing   at other times his frightened hairs     above the bedclothes trusting   he heard her full of household cares   no dream entrapped in suppers snares   the foal of horrible nightmares   but broad awake as he declares   go bustling up and down the stairs   or setting back last evenings chairs     or with the poker thrusting   the rakedup seacoals hardened crust   andwhat impossible it must   he knew she had returned to dust   and yet could scarce his senses trust   hearing her as she poked and fussed     about the parlor dusting    night after night he strove to sleep     and take his ease in spite of it   but still his flesh would chill and creep   and though two nightlamps he might keep     he could not so make light of it   at last quite desperate he goes   and tells his neighbors all his woes     which did but their amount enhance   they made such mockery of his fears   that soon his days were of all jeers     his nights of the rueful countenance   i thought most folks one neighbor said   gave up the ghost when they were dead   another gravely shook his head     adding from all we hear its   quite plain poor knott is going mad   for how can he at once be sad     and think hes full of spirits   a third declared he knew a knife     would cut this knott much quicker   the surest way to end all strife   and lay the spirit of a wife     is just to take and lick her   a temperance man caught up the word   ah yes he groaned ive always heard     our poor friend somewhat slanted   towrd taking liquor overmuch   i fear these spirits may be dutch   a sort of gins or something such     with which his house is haunted   i see the thing as clear as light   if knott would give up getting tight     naught farther would be wanted   so all his neighbors stood aloof   and that the spirits neath his roof   were not entirely up to proof     unanimously granted    knott knew that cocks and sprites were foes   and so bought up heaven only knows   how many though he wanted crows   to give ghosts caws as i suppose     to think that day was breaking   moreover what he called his park   he turned into a kind of ark   for dogs because a little bark   is a good tonic in the dark     if one is given to waking   but things went on from bad to worse   his curs were nothing but a curse     and what was still more shocking   foul ghosts of living fowl made scoff   and would not think of going off     in spite of all his cocking    shanghais buckscounties dominiques   malays that didnt lay for weeks     polanders bantams dorkings   waiving the cost no trifling ill   since each brought in his little bill   by day or night were never still   but every thought of rest would kill     with cacklings and with quorkings   henry the eighth of wives got free     by a way he had of axing   but poor knotts tudor henery   was not so fortunate and he     still found his trouble waxing   as for the dogs the rows they made   and how they howled snarled barked and bayed     beyond all human knowledge is   all night as wide awake as gnats   the terriers rumpused after rats   or just for practice taught their brats   to worry castoff shoes and hats   the bulldogs settled private spats   all chased imaginary cats   or raved behind the fences slats   at real ones or from their mats   with friends miles off held pleasant chats   or like some folks in white cravats   contemptuous of sharps and flats     sat up and sang dogsologies   meanwhile the cats set up a squall   and safe upon the gardenwall     all night kept catawalling   as if the feline race were all   in one wild cataleptic sprawl     into loves tortures falling                    part ii    showing what is meant by a flow of spirits    at first the ghosts were somewhat shy   coming when none but knott was nigh   and people said twas all their eye   or rather his a flam the sly     digestions machination   some recommended a wet sheet   some a nice broth of pounded peat   some a cold flatiron to the feet   some a decoction of lambsbleat   some a southwesterly grain of wheat   meat was by some pronounced unmeet   others thought fish most indiscreet   and that twas worse than all to eat   of vegetables sour or sweet   except perhaps the skin of beat     in such a concatenation   one quack his button gently plucks   and murmurs biliary ducks     says knott i never ate one   but all though brimming full of wrath   homœo allo hydropath   concurred in thisthat t others path     to deaths door was the straight one   still spite of medical advice   the ghosts came thicker and a spice     of mischief grew apparent   nor did they only come at night   but seemed to fancy broad daylight   till knott in horror and affright     his unoffending hair rent   wheneer with handkerchief on lap   he made his elbowchair a trap   to catch an afterdinner nap   the spirits always on the tap   would make a sudden rap rap rap   the halfspun cord of sleep to snap   and what is life without its nap   but threadbareness and mere mishap   as t were with a percussion cap     the troubles climax capping   it seemed a party dried and grim   of mummies had come to visit him   each getting off from every limb     its multitudinous wrapping   scratchings sometimes the walls ran round   the merest pennyweights of sound   sometimes twas only by the pound     they carried on their dealing   a thumping neath the parlor floor   thumpbumpthumpbumping oer and oer   as if the vegetables in store   quiet and orderly before     were all together pealing   you would have thought the thing was done   by the spirit of some son of a gun     and that a fortytwo pounder   or that the ghost which made such sounds   could be none other than john pounds     of ragged schools the founder    through three gradations of affright   the awful noises reached their height     at first they knocked nocturnally   then for some reason changing quite   as mourners after six months flight   turn suddenly from dark to light     began to knock diurnally   and last combining all their stocks   scotland was neer so full of knox   into one chaos father of nox   nocte pluitthey showered knocks     and knocked knocked knocked eternally   ever upon the go like

creatures of sadducistic race   with grovelling intellects and base   they could not find the slightest trace     to indicate deception   indeed it is declared by some   that spirits of this sort are

and catch thee by the beard thy nails id trim     and make thee work as was advised by him                         xxvi     work am i not at work from morn till night   sounding the deeps of oracles umbilical     which for mans guidance never come to light   with all their various aptitudes until i call    and i do i not twirl from left to right   for conscience sake is that no work thou silly gull     he had thee in his eye twas gabriel     sent to reward my faith i know him well                        xxvii     twas vishnu thou vile whirligig and so   the good old quarrel was begun anew     one would have sworn the sky was black as sloe   had but the other darned to call it blue     nor were the followers who fed them slow   to treat each other with their curses too     each hating tother moves it tears or laughter     because he thought him sure of hell hereafter                        xxviii      at last some genius built a bridge of boats   over the stream and ahmeds zealots filed     across upon a mission to cut throats   and spread religion pure and undefiled     they sowed the propagandists wildest oats   cutting off all down to the smallest child     and came back giving thanks for such fat mercies     to find their harvest gone past prayers or curses                         xxix      all gone except their saints religious hops   which he kept up with more than common flourish     but these however satisfying crops   for the inner man were not enough to nourish     the body politic which quickly drops   reserve in such sad juncture and turns currish     so

saintship grated     ran slow creaked stopped and wishing him in tophet     they gathered strength enough to stone the prophet                         xxxi      some stronger ones contrived by eating leather   their weaker friends and one thing or another     the winter months of scarcity to weather   among these was the late saints younger brother     who in the spring collecting them together   persuaded them that ahmeds holy pother     had wrought in their behalf and that the place     of saint should be continued to his race                        xxxii      accordingly twas settled on the spot   that allah favored that peculiar breed     beside as all were satisfied twould not   be quite respectable to have the need     of public spiritual food forgot   and so the tribe with proper
