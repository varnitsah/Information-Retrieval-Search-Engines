species were preparing to reprint it for me there are books as there are horses which a judicious owner on fair survey of them might prefer to adjust by at once shooting through the head but in the case of books owing to the pirate species that is not possible remains therefore that at least dirty paper and errors of the press be guarded against that a poor book which has still to walk this world do walk in clean linen so to speak and pass its few and evil days with no blotches but its own adhering to it  there have been various new lives of schiller since this one first saw the light—great changes in our notions informations in our relations to the life of schiller and to other things connected therewith during that long time into which i could not in the least enter on the present occasion such errors one or two as lay corrigible on the surface i have pointed out by here and there a note as i read but of errors that lay deeper there could no charge be taken to break the surface to tearup the old substance and model it anew was a task that lay far from me—that would have been frightful to me what was written remains written and the reader by way of constant commentary when needed has to say to himself it was written twenty years ago for newer instruction on schillers biography he can consult the schillers leben of madame von wolzogen which goethe once called a schiller redivivus the briefwechsel zwischen schiller und goethe—or as a summary of the whole and the readiest inlet to the general subject for an english reader sir edward bulwers sketch of schillers life a vigorous and lively piece of writing prefixed to his translations from schiller  the present little book is very imperfect—but it pretends also to be very harmless it can innocently instruct those who are more ignorant than itself to which ingenuous class according to their wants and tastes let it with all good wishes and hopes to meet afterwards in fruitfuler provinces be heartily

      17591784   among the writers of the concluding part of the last century there is none more deserving of our notice than friedrich schiller distinguished alike for the splendour of his intellectual faculties and the elevation of his tastes and feelings he has left behind him in his works a noble emblem of these great qualities and the reputation which he thus enjoys and has merited excites our attention the more on considering the circumstances under which it was acquired schiller had peculiar difficulties to strive with and his success has likewise been peculiar much of his life was deformed by inquietude and disease and it terminated at middle age he composed in a language then scarcely settled into form or admitted to a rank among the cultivated languages of europe yet his writings are remarkable for their extent and variety as well as their intrinsic excellence and his own countrymen are not his only or perhaps his principal admirers it is difficult to collect or interpret the general voice but the world no less than germany seems already to have dignified him with the reputation of a classic to have enrolled him among that select number whose works belong not wholly to any age or nation but who having instructed their own contemporaries are claimed as instructors by the great family of mankind and set apart for many centuries from the common oblivion which soon overtakes the mass of authors as it does the mass of other men  such has been the high destiny of schiller his history and character deserve our study for more than one reason a natural and harmless feeling attracts us towards such a subject we are anxious to know how so great a man passed through the world how he lived and moved and had his being and the question if properly investigated might yield advantage as well as pleasure it would be interesting to discover by what gifts and what employment of them he reached the eminence on which we now see him to follow the steps of his intellectual and moral culture to gather from his life and works some picture of himself it is worth inquiring whether he who could represent noble actions so well did himself act nobly how those powers of intellect which in philosophy and art achieved so much applied themselves to the everyday emergencies of life how the generous ardour which delights us in his poetry displayed itself in the common intercourse between man and man it would at once instruct and gratify us if we could understand him thoroughly could transport ourselves into his circumstances outward and inward could see as he saw and feel as he felt  but if the various utility of such a task is palpable enough its difficulties are not less so we should not lightly think of comprehending the very simplest character in all its bearings and it might argue vanity to boast of even a common acquaintance with one like schillers such men as he are misunderstood by their daily companions much more by the distant observer who gleans his information from scanty records and casual notices of characteristic events which biographers are often too indolent or injudicious to collect and which the peaceful life of a man of letters usually supplies in little abundance the published details of schillers history are meagre and insufficient and his writings like those of every author can afford but a dim and dubious copy of his mind nor is it easy to decipher even this with moderate accuracy the haze of a foreign language of foreign manners and modes of thinking strange to us confuses and obscures the sight often magnifying what is trivial softening what is rude and sometimes hiding or distorting what is beautiful to take the dimensions of schillers mind were a hard enterprise in any case harder still with these impediments  accordingly we do not in this place pretend to attempt it we have no finished portrait of his character to offer no formal estimate of his works it will be enough for us if in glancing over his life we can satisfy a simple curiosity about the fortunes and chief peculiarities of a man connected with us by a bond so kindly as that of the teacher to the taught the giver to the receiver of mental delight if in wandering through his intellectual creation we can enjoy once more the magnificent and fragrant beauty of that fairy land and express our feelings where we do not aim at judging and deciding   johann christoph friedrich schiller was a native of marbach a small town of würtemberg situated on the banks of the neckar he was born on the 10th of november 1759—a few months later than our own robert burns schillers early culture was favoured by the dispositions but obstructed by the outward circumstances of his parents though removed above the pressure of poverty their station was dependent and fluctuating it involved a frequent change of place and plan johann caspar schiller the father had been a surgeon in the bavarian army he served in the netherlands during the succession war after his return home to würtemberg he laid aside the medical profession having obtained a commission of ensign and adjutant under his native prince this post he held successively in two regiments he had changed into the second and was absent on active duty when friedrich was born the peace of paris put an end to his military employment but caspar had shown himself an intelligent unassuming and useful man and the duke of würtemberg was willing to retain him in his service the layingout of various nurseries and plantations in the pleasuregrounds of ludwigsburg and solitude was intrusted to the retired soldier now advanced to the rank of captain he removed from one establishment to another from time to time and continued in the dukes pay till death in his latter years he resided chiefly at ludwigsburg  this mode of life was not the most propitious for educating such a boy as friedrich but the native worth of his parents did more than compensate for the disadvantages of their worldly condition and their limited acquirements in knowledge the benevolence the modest and prudent integrity the true devoutness of these good people shone forth at an after period expanded and beautified in the character of their son his heart was nourished by a constant exposure to such influences and thus the better part of his education prospered well the mother was a woman of many household virtues to a warm affection for her children and husband she joined a degree of taste and intelligence which is of much rarer occurrence she is said to have been a lover of poetry in particular an admiring reader of utz and gellert writers whom it is creditable for one in her situation to have relished1 her kindness and tenderness of heart peculiarly endeared her to friedrich her husband appears to have been a person of great probity and meekness of temper sincerely desirous to approve himself a useful member of society and to do his duty conscientiously to all men the seeds of many valuable qualities had been sown in him by nature and though his early life had been unfavourable for their cultivation he at a late period laboured not without success to remedy this disadvantage such branches of science and philosophy as lay within his reach he studied with diligence whenever his professional employments left him leisure on a subject connected with the latter he became an author2 but what chiefly distinguished him was the practice of a sincere piety which seems to have diffused itself over all his feelings and given to his clear and honest character that calm elevation which in such a case is its natural result as his religion mingled itself with every motive and action of his life the wish which in all his wanderings lay nearest his heart the wish for the education of his son was likely to be deeply tinctured with it there is yet preserved in his handwriting a prayer composed in advanced age wherein he mentions how at the childs birth he had entreated the great father of all to supply in strength of spirit what must needs be wanting in outward instruction the grayhaired man who had lived to see the maturity of his boy could now express his solemn thankfulness that god had heard the prayer of a mortal      footnote 1 she was of humble descent and little education     the daughter of a baker in kodweis      footnote 2 his book is entitled die baumzucht im grossen     the cultivation of trees on the grand scale it came to a     second edition in 1806  friedrich followed the movements of his parents for some time and had to gather the elements of learning from various masters perhaps it was in part owing to this circumstance that his progress though respectable or more was so little commensurate with what he afterwards became or with the capacities of which even his earliest years gave symptoms thoughtless and gay as a boy is wont to be he would now and then dissipate his time in childish sports forgetful that the stolen charms of ball and leapfrog must be dearly bought by reproaches but occasionally he was overtaken with feelings of deeper import and used to express the agitations of his little mind in words and actions which were first rightly interpreted when they were called to mind long afterwards his schoolfellows can now recollect that even his freaks had sometimes a poetic character that a certain earnestness of temper a frank integrity an appetite for things grand or moving was discernible across all the caprices of his boyhood once it is said during a tremendous thunderstorm his father missed him in the young group within doors none of the sisters could tell what was become of fritz and the old man grew at length so anxious that he was forced to go out in quest of him fritz was scarcely past the age of infancy and knew not the dangers of a scene so awful his father found him at last in a solitary place of the neighbourhood perched on the branch of a tree gazing at the tempestuous face of the sky and watching the flashes as in succession they spread their lurid gleam over it to the reprimands of his parent the whimpering truant pleaded in extenuation that the lightning was very beautiful and that he wished to see where it was coming from—such anecdotes we have long known are in themselves of small value the present one has the additional defect of being somewhat dubious in respect of authenticity we have ventured to give it as it came to us notwithstanding the picture of the boy schiller contemplating the thunder is not without a certain interest for such as know the man  schillers first teacher was moser pastor and schoolmaster in the village of lorch where the parents resided from the sixth to the ninth year of their son this person deserves mention for the influence he exerted on the early history of his pupil he seems to have given his name to the priest moser in the robbers his spiritual calling and the conversation of his son himself afterwards a preacher are supposed to have suggested to schiller the idea of consecrating himself to the clerical profession this idea which laid hold of and cherished some predominant though vague propensities of the boys disposition suited well with the religious sentiments of his parents and was soon formed into a settled purpose in the public school at ludwigsburg whither the family had now removed his studies were regulated with this view and he underwent in four successive years the annual examination before the stuttgard commission to which young men destined for the church are subjected in that country schillers temper was naturally devout with a delicacy of feeling which tended towards bashfulness and timidity there was mingled in him a fervid impetuosity which was ever struggling through its concealment and indicating that he felt deeply and strongly as well as delicately such a turn of mind easily took the form of religion prescribed to it by early example and early affections as well as nature schiller looked forward to the sacred profession with alacrity it was the serious daydream of all his boyhood and much of his youth as yet however the project hovered before him at a great distance and the path to its fulfilment offered him but little entertainment his studies did not seize his attention firmly he followed them from a sense of duty not of pleasure virgil and horace he learned to construe accurately but is said to have taken no deep interest in their poetry the tenderness and meek beauty of the first the humour and sagacity and capricious pathos of the last the matchless elegance of both would of course escape his inexperienced perception while the matter of their writings must have appeared frigid and shallow to a mind so susceptible he loved rather to meditate on the splendour of the ludwigsburg theatre which had inflamed his imagination when he first saw it in his ninth year and given shape and materials to many of his subsequent reveries3 under these circumstances his progress with all his natural ability could not be very striking the teachers did not fail now and then to visit him with their severities yet still there was a negligent success in his attempts which joined to his honest and vivid temper made men augur well of him the stuttgard examinators have marked him in their records with the customary formula of approval or at worst of toleration they usually designate him as a boy of good hope puer bonæ spei      footnote 3 the first display of his poetic gifts occurred     also in his ninth year but took its rise in a much humbler     and less common source than the inspiration of the stage his     biographers have recorded this small event with a     conscientious accuracy second only to that of boswell and     hawkins in regard to the lichfield duck the little tale     says one of them is worth relating the rather that after     an interval of more than twenty years schiller himself on     meeting with his early comrade the late dr elwert of     kantstadt for the first time since their boyhood reminded     him of the adventure recounting the circumstances with great     minuteness and glee it is as follows once in 1768 elwert     and he had to repeat their catechism together on a certain     day publicly in the church their teacher an     illconditioned narrowminded pietist had previously     threatened them with a thorough flogging if they missed even     a single word to make the matter worse this very teacher     chanced to be the person whose turn it was to catechise on     the appointed day both the boys began their answers with     dismayed hearts and faltering tongues yet they succeeded in     accomplishing the task and were in consequence rewarded by     the mollified pedagogue with two kreutzers apiece four     kreutzers of ready cash was a sum of no common magnitude how     it should be disposed of formed a serious question for the     parties interested schiller moved that they should go to     harteneck a hamlet in the neighbourhood and have a dish of     curdsandcream his partner assented but alas in harteneck     no particle of curds or cream was to be had schiller then     made offer for a quartercake of cheese but for this four     entire kreutzers were demanded leaving nothing whatever in     reserve for bread twice baffled the little gastronomes     unsatisfied in stomach wandered on to neckarweihingen     where at length though not till after much inquiry they     did obtain a comfortable mess of curdsandcream served up     in a gay platter and silver spoons to eat it with for all     this moreover they were charged but three kreutzers so     that there was still one left to provide them with a bunch of     st john grapes exhilarated by such liberal cheer schiller     rose into a glow of inspiration having left the village he     mounted with his comrade to the adjacent height which     overlooks both harteneck and neckarweihingen and there in a     truly poetic effusion he pronounced his malediction on the     creamless region bestowing with the same solemnity his     blessing on the one which had afforded him that savoury     refreshment friedrich von schillers leben heidelberg     1817 p 11  this good hope was not however destined to be realised in the way they expected accidents occurred which changed the direction of schillers exertions and threatened for a time to prevent the success of them altogether the duke of würtemberg had lately founded a free seminary for certain branches of professional education it was first set up at solitude one of his country residences and had now been transferred to stuttgard where under an improved form and with the name of karlsschule we believe it still exists the duke proposed to give the sons of his military officers a preferable claim to the benefits of this institution and having formed a good opinion both of schiller and his father he invited the former to profit by this opportunity the offer occasioned great embarrassment the young man and his parents were alike determined in favour of the church a project with which this new one was inconsistent their embarrassment was but increased when the duke on learning the nature of their scruples desired them to think well before they decided it was out of fear and with reluctance that his proposal was accepted schiller enrolled himself in 1773 and turned with a heavy heart from freedom and cherished hopes to greek and seclusion and law  his anticipations proved to be but too just the six years which he spent in this establishment were the most harassing and comfortless of his life the stuttgard system of education seems to have been formed on the principle not of cherishing and correcting nature but of rooting it out and supplying its place with something better the process of teaching and living was conducted with the stiff formality of military drilling every thing went on by statute and ordinance there was no scope for the exercise of freewill no allowance for the varieties of original structure a scholar might possess what instincts or capacities he pleased the regulations of the school took no account of this he must fit himself into the common mould which like the old giants bed stood there appointed by superior authority to be filled alike by the great and the little the same strict and narrow course of reading and composition was marked out for each beforehand and it was by stealth if he read or wrote any thing beside their domestic economy was regulated in the same spirit as their preceptorial it consisted of the same sedulous exclusion of all that could border on pleasure or give any exercise to choice the pupils were kept apart from the conversation or sight of any person but their teachers none ever got beyond the precincts of despotism to snatch even a fearful joy their very amusements proceeded by the word of command  how grievous all this must have been it is easy to conceive to schiller it was more grievous than to any other of an ardent and impetuous yet delicate nature whilst his discontentment devoured him internally he was too modest and timid to give it the relief of utterance by deeds or words locked up within himself he suffered deeply but without complaining some of his letters written during this period have been preserved they exhibit the ineffectual struggles of a fervid and busy mind veiling its many chagrins under a certain dreary patience which only shows them more painfully he pored over his lexicons and grammars and insipid tasks with an artificial composure but his spirit pined within him like a captives when he looked forth into the cheerful world or recollected the affection of parents the hopes and frolicsome enjoyments of past years the misery he endured in this severe and lonely mode of existence strengthened or produced in him a habit of constraint and shyness which clung to his character through life  the study of law for which he had never felt any predilection naturally grew in his mind to be the representative of all these evils and his distaste for it went on increasing on this point he made no secret of his feelings one of the exercises yearly prescribed to every scholar was a written delineation of his own character according to his own views of it to be delivered publicly at an appointed time schiller on the first of these exhibitions ventured to state his persuasion that he was not made to be a jurist but called rather by his inclinations and faculties to the clerical profession this statement of course produced no effect he was forced to continue the accustomed course and his dislike for law kept fast approaching to absolute disgust in 1775 he was fortunate enough to get it relinquished though at the expense of adopting another employment for which in different circumstances he would hardly have declared himself the study of medicine for which a new institution was about this time added to the stuttgard school had no attractions for schiller he accepted it only as a galling servitude in exchange for one more galling his mind was bent on higher objects and he still felt all his present vexations aggravated by the thought that his fairest expectations from the future had been sacrificed to worldly convenience and the humblest necessities of life  meanwhile the youth was waxing into manhood and the fetters of discipline lay heavier on him as his powers grew stronger and his eyes became open to the stirring and variegated interests of the world now unfolding itself to him under new and more glowing colours as yet he contemplated the scene only from afar and it seemed but the more gorgeous on that account he longed to mingle in its busy current and delighted to view the image of its movements in his favourite poets and historians plutarch and shakspeare4 the writings of klopstock lessing garve herder gerstenberg goethe and a multitude of others which marked the dawning literature of germany he had studied with a secret avidity they gave him vague ideas of men and life or awakened in him splendid visions of literary glory klopstocks messias combined with his own religious tendencies had early turned him to sacred poetry before the end of his fourteenth year he had finished what he called an epic poem entitled moses the extraordinary popularity of gerstenbergs ugolino and goethes götz von berlichingen next directed his attention to the drama and as admiration in a mind like his full of blind activity and nameless aspirings naturally issues in imitation he plunged with equal ardour into this new subject and produced his first tragedy cosmo von medicis some fragments of which he retained and inserted in his robbers a mass of minor performances preserved among his papers or published in the magazines of the time serve sufficiently to show that his mind had already dimly discovered its destination and was striving with a restless vehemence to reach it in spite of every obstacle      footnote 4 the feeling produced in him by shakspeare he     described long afterwards it throws light on the general     state of his temper and tastes when i first at a very     early age he says became acquainted with this poet i     felt indignant at his coldness his hardness of heart which     permitted him in the most melting pathos to utter jests—to     mar by the introduction of a fool the soulsearching scenes     of hamlet lear and other pieces which now kept him     still where my sensibilities hastened forward now drove him     carelessly onward where i would so gladly have lingered       he was the object of my reverence and zealous study for years     before i could love himself i was not yet capable of     comprehending nature at firsthand i had but learned to     admire her image reflected in the understanding and put in     order by rules werke bd viii 2 p 77  such obstacles were in his case neither few nor small schiller felt the mortifying truth that to arrive at the ideal world he must first gain a footing in the real that he might entertain high thoughts and longings might reverence the beauties of nature and grandeur of mind but was born to toil for his daily bread poetry he loved with the passionateness of a first affection but he could not live by it he honoured it too highly to wish to live by it his prudence told him that he must yield to stern necessity must forsake the balmy climate of pindus for the greenland of a barren and dreary science of terms and he did not hesitate to obey his professional studies were followed with a rigid though reluctant fidelity it was only in leisure gained by superior diligence that he could yield himself to more favourite pursuits genius was to serve as the ornament of his inferior qualities not as an excuse for the want of them  but if when such sacrifices were required it was painful to comply with the dictates of his own reason it was still more so to endure the harsh and superfluous restrictions of his teachers he felt it hard enough to be driven from the enchantments of poetry by the dull realities of duty but it was intolerable and degrading to be hemmedin still farther by the caprices of severe and formal pedagogues schiller brooded gloomily over the constraints and hardships of his situation many plans he formed for deliverance sometimes he would escape in secret to catch a glimpse of the free and busy world to him forbidden sometimes he laid schemes for utterly abandoning a place which he abhorred and trusting to fortune for the rest often the sight of his classbooks and schoolapparatus became irksome beyond endurance he would feign sickness that he might be left in his own chamber to write poetry and pursue his darling studies without hindrance such artifices did not long avail him the masters noticed the regularity of his sickness and sent him tasks to be done while it lasted even schillers patience could not brook this his natural timidity gave place to indignation he threw the paper of exercises at the feet of the messenger and said sternly that here he would choose his own studies  under such corroding and continual vexations an ordinary spirit would have sunk at length would have gradually given up its loftier aspirations and sought refuge in vicious indulgence or at best have sullenly harnessed itself into the yoke and plodded through existence weary discontented and broken ever casting back a hankering look upon the dreams of youth and ever without power to realise them but schiller was no ordinary character and did not act like one beneath a cold and simple exterior dignified with no artificial attractions and marred in its native amiableness by the incessant obstruction the isolation and painful destitutions under which he lived there was concealed a burning energy of soul which no obstruction could extinguish the hard circumstances of his fortune had prevented the natural development of his mind his faculties had been cramped and misdirected but they had gathered strength by opposition and the habit of selfdependence which it encouraged his thoughts unguided by a teacher had sounded into the depths of his own nature and the mysteries of his own fate his feelings and passions unshared by any other heart had been driven back upon his own where like the volcanic fire that smoulders and fuses in secret they accumulated till their force grew irresistible  hitherto schiller had passed for an unprofitable a discontented and a disobedient boy but the time was now come when the gyves of schooldiscipline could no longer cripple and distort the giant might of his nature he stood forth as a man and wrenched asunder his fetters with a force that was felt at the extremities of europe the publication of the robbers forms an era not only in schillers history but in the literature of the world and there seems no doubt that but for so mean a cause as the perverted discipline of the stuttgard school we had never seen this tragedy schiller commenced it in his nineteenth year and the circumstances under which it was composed are to be traced in all its parts it is the production of a strong untutored spirit consumed by an activity for which there is no outlet indignant at the barriers which restrain it and grappling darkly with the phantoms to which its own energy thus painfully imprisoned gives being a rude simplicity combined with a gloomy and overpowering force are its chief characteristics they remind us of the defective cultivation as well as of the fervid and harassed feelings of its author above all the latter quality is visible the tragic interest of the robbers is deep throughout so deep that frequently it borders upon horror a grim inexpiable fate is made the ruling principle it envelops and overshadows the whole and under its louring influence the fiercest efforts of human will appear but like flashes that illuminate the wild scene with a brief and terrible splendour and are lost forever in the darkness the unsearchable abysses of mans destiny are laid open before us black and profound and appalling as they seem to the young mind when it first attempts to explore them the obstacles that thwart our faculties and wishes the deceitfulness of hope the nothingness of existence are sketched in the sable colours so natural to the enthusiast when he first ventures upon life and compares the world that is without him to the anticipations that were within  karl von moor is a character such as young poets always delight to contemplate or delineate to schiller the analogy of their situations must have peculiarly recommended him moor is animated into action by feelings similar to those under which his author was then suffering and longing to act gifted with every noble quality of manhood in overflowing abundance moors first expectations of life and of the part he was to play in it had been glorious as a poets dream but the minor dexterities of management were not among his endowments in his eagerness to reach the goal he had forgotten that the course is a labyrinthic maze beset with difficulties of which some may be surmounted some can only be evaded many can be neither hurried on by the headlong impetuosity of his temper he entangles himself in these perplexities and thinks to penetrate them not by skill and patience but by open force he is baffled deceived and still more deeply involved but injury and disappointment exasperate rather than instruct him he had expected heroes and he finds mean men friends and he finds smiling traitors to tempt him aside to profit by his aberrations and lead him onward to destruction he had dreamed of magnanimity and every generous principle he finds that prudence is the only virtue sure of its reward too fiery by nature the intensity of his sufferings has now maddened him still farther he is himself incapable of calm reflection and there is no counsellor at hand to assist him none whose sympathy might assuage his miseries whose wisdom might teach him to remedy or to endure them he is stung by fury into action and his activity is at once blind and tremendous since the world is not the abode of unmixed integrity he looks upon it as a den of thieves since its institutions may obstruct the advancement of worth and screen delinquency from punishment he regards the social union as a pestilent nuisance the mischiefs of which it is fitting that he in his degree should do his best to repair by means however violent revenge is the mainspring of his conduct but he ennobles it in his own eyes by giving it the colour of a disinterested concern for the maintenance of justice—the abasement of vice from its high places and the exaltation of suffering virtue single against the universe to appeal to the primary law of the stronger to grasp the scales of providence in a mortals hand is frantic and wicked but moor has a force of soul which makes it likewise awful the interest lies in the conflict of this gigantic soul against the fearful odds which at length overwhelm it and hurry it down to the darkest depths of ruin  the original conception of such a work as this betrays the inexperience no less than the vigour of youth its execution gives a similar testimony the characters of the piece though traced in glowing colours are outlines more than pictures the few features we discover in them are drawn with elaborate minuteness but the rest are wanting every thing indicates the condition of a keen and powerful intellect which had studied men in books only had by selfexamination and the perusal of history detected and strongly seized some of the leading peculiarities of human nature but was yet ignorant of all the minute and more complex principles which regulate mens conduct in actual life and which only a knowledge of living men can unfold if the hero of the play forms something like an exception to this remark he is the sole exception and for reasons alluded to above his character resembles the authors own even with karl the success is incomplete with the other personages it is far more so franz von moor the villain of the piece is an amplified copy of iago and richard but the copy is distorted as well as amplified there is no air of reality in franz he is a villain of theory who studies to accomplish his object by the most diabolical expedients and soothes his conscience by arguing with the priest in favour of atheism and materialism not the genuine villain of shakspeare and nature who employs his reasoning powers in creating new schemes and devising new means and conquers remorse by avoiding it—by fixing his hopes and fears on the more pressing emergencies of worldly business so reflective a miscreant as franz could not exist his calculations would lead him to honesty if merely because it was the best policy  amelia the only female in the piece is a beautiful creation but as imaginary as her persecutor franz still and exalted in her warm enthusiasm devoted in her love to moor she moves before us as the inhabitant of a higher and simpler world than ours he sails on troubled seas she exclaims with a confusion of metaphors which it is easy to pardon he sails on troubled seas amelias love sails with him he wanders in pathless deserts amelias love makes the burning sand grow green beneath him and the stunted shrubs to blossom the south scorches his bare head his feet are pinched by the northern snow stormy hail beats round his temples—amelias love rocks him to sleep in the storm seas and hills and horizons are between us but souls escape from their clay prisons and meet in the paradise of love she is a fair vision the beau idéal of a poets first mistress but has few mortal lineaments  similar defects are visible in almost all the other characters moor the father is a weak and fond old man who could have arrived at gray hairs in such a state of ignorance nowhere but in a work of fiction the inferior banditti are painted with greater vigour yet still in rugged and illshapen forms their individuality is kept up by an extravagant exaggeration of their several peculiarities schiller himself pronounced a severe but not unfounded censure when he said of this work in a maturer age that his chief fault was in presuming to delineate men two years before he had met one  his skill in the art of composition surpassed his knowledge of the world but that too was far from perfection schillers style in the robbers is partly of a kind with the incidents and feelings which it represents strong and astonishing and sometimes wildly grand but likewise inartificial coarse and grotesque his sentences in their rude emphasis come down like the club of hercules the stroke is often of a crushing force but its sweep is irregular and awkward when moor is involved in the deepest intricacies of the old question necessity and free will and has convinced himself that he is but an engine in the hands of some dark and irresistible power he cries out why has my perillus made of me a brazen bull to roast men in my glowing belly the stagedirection says shaken with horror no wonder that he shook  schiller has admitted these faults and explained their origin in strong and sincere language in a passage of which we have already quoted the conclusion a singular miscalculation of nature he says had combined my poetical tendencies with the place of my birth any disposition to poetry did violence to the laws of the institution where i was educated and contradicted the plan of its founder for eight years my enthusiasm struggled with military discipline but the passion for poetry is vehement and fiery as a first love what discipline was meant to extinguish it blew into a flame to escape from arrangements that tortured me my heart sought refuge in the world of ideas when as yet i was unacquainted with the world of realities from which iron bars excluded me i was unacquainted with men for the four hundred that lived with me were but repetitions of the same creature true casts of one single mould and of that very mould which plastic nature solemnly disclaimed    thus circumstanced a stranger to human characters and human fortunes to hit the medium line between angels and devils was an enterprise in which i necessarily failed in attempting it my pencil necessarily brought out a monster for which by good fortune the world had no original and which i would not wish to be immortal except to perpetuate an example of the offspring which genius in its unnatural union with thraldom may give to the world i allude to the robbers5      footnote 5 deutsches museum v jahr 1784 cited by     doering  yet with all these excrescences and defects the unbounded popularity of the robbers is not difficult to account for to every reader the excitement of emotion must be a chief consideration to the mass of readers it is the sole one and the grand secret of moving others is that the poet be himself moved we have seen how well schillers temper and circumstances qualified him to fulfil this condition treatment not of his choosing had raised his own mind into something like a pythian frenzy and his genius untrained as it was sufficed to communicate abundance of the feeling to others perhaps more than abundance to judge from our individual impression the perusal of the robbers produces an effect powerful even to pain we are absolutely wounded by the catastrophe our minds are darkened and distressed as if we had witnessed the execution of a criminal it is in vain that we rebel against the inconsistencies and crudities of the work its faults are redeemed by the living energy that pervades it we may exclaim against the blind madness of the hero but there is a towering grandeur about him a whirlwind force of passion and of will which catches our hearts and puts the scruples of criticism to silence the most delirious of enterprises is that of moor but the vastness of his mind renders even that interesting we see him leagued with desperadoes directing their savage strength to actions more and more audacious he is in arms against the conventions of men and the everlasting laws of fate yet we follow him with anxiety through the forests and desert places where he wanders encompassed with peril inspired with lofty daring and torn by unceasing remorse and we wait with awe for the doom which he has merited and cannot avoid nor amid all his frightful aberrations do we ever cease to love him he is an archangel though in ruins and the strong agony with which he feels the present the certainty of that stern future which awaits him which his own eye never loses sight of makes us lenient to his crimes when he pours forth his wild recollections or still wilder forebodings there is a terrible vehemence in his expressions which overpowers us in spite both of his and their extravagance the scene on the hills beside the danube where he looks at the setting sun and thinks of old hopes and times when he could not sleep if his evening prayer had been forgotten is one with all its improprieties that ever clings to the memory see he passionately continues all things are gone forth to bask in the peaceful beam of the spring why must i alone inhale the torments of hell out of the joys of heaven that all should be so happy all so married together by the spirit of peace the whole world one family its father above that father not mine i alone the castaway i alone struck out from the company of the just not for me the sweet name of child never for me the languishing look of one whom i love never never the embracing of a bosom friend encircled with murderers serpents hissing around me riveted to vice with iron bonds leaning on the bending reed of vice over the gulf of perdition amid the flowers of the glad world a howling abaddon oh that i might return into my mothers womb—that i might be born a beggar i would never more—o heaven that i could be as one of these daylabourers oh i would toil till the blood ran down from my temples to buy myself the pleasure of one noontide sleep the blessing of a single tear there was a time too when i could weep—o ye days of peace thou castle of my father ye green lovely valleys—o all ye elysian scenes of my childhood will ye never come again never with your balmy sighing cool my burning bosom mourn with me nature they will never come again never cool my burning bosom with their balmy sighing they are gone gone and may not return  no less strange is the soliloquy where moor with the instrument of selfdestruction in his hands the dread key that is to shut behind him the prison of life and to unbolt before him the dwelling of eternal night—meditates on the gloomy enigmas of his future destiny soliloquies on this subject are numerous—from the time of hamlet of cato and downwards perhaps the worst of them has more ingenuity perhaps the best of them has less awfulness than the present st dominick himself might shudder at such a question with such an answer as this what if thou shouldst send me companionless to some burnt and blasted circle of the universe which thou hast banished from thy sight where the lone darkness and the motionless desert were my prospects—forever i would people the silent wilderness with my fantasies i should have eternity for leisure to examine the perplexed image of the universal woe  strength wild impassioned strength is the distinguishing quality of moor all his history shows it and his death is of a piece with the fierce splendour of his life having finished the bloody work of crime and magnanimity and horror he thinks that for himself suicide would be too easy an exit he has noticed a poor man toiling by the wayside for eleven children a great reward has been promised for the head of the robber the gold will nourish that poor drudge and his boys and moor goes forth to give it them we part with him in pity and sorrow looking less at his misdeeds than at their frightful expiation  the subordinate personages though diminished in extent and varied in their forms are of a similar quality with the hero a strange mixture of extravagance and true energy in perusing the work which represents their characters and fates we are alternately shocked and inspired there is a perpetual conflict between our understanding and our feelings yet the latter on the whole come off victorious the robbers is a tragedy that will long find readers to astonish and with all its faults to move it stands in our imagination like some ancient rugged pile of a barbarous age irregular fantastic useless but grand in its height and massiveness and black frowning strength it will long remain a singular monument of the early genius and early fortune of its author  the publication of such a work as this naturally produced an extraordinary feeling in the literary world translations of the robbers soon appeared in almost all the languages of europe and were read in all of them with a deep interest compounded of admiration and aversion according to the relative proportions of sensibility and judgment in the various minds which contemplated the subject in germany the enthusiasm which the robbers excited was extreme the young author had burst upon the world like a meteor and surprise for a time suspended the power of cool and rational criticism in the ferment produced by the universal discussion of this single topic the poet was magnified above his natural dimensions great as they were and though the general sentence was loudly in his favour yet he found detractors as well as praisers and both equally beyond the limits of moderation  one charge brought against him must have damped the joy of literary glory and stung schillers pure and virtuous mind more deeply than any other he was accused of having injured the cause of morality by his work of having set up to the impetuous and fiery temperament of youth a model of imitation which the young were too likely to pursue with eagerness and which could only lead them from the safe and beaten tracks of duty into error and destruction it has even been stated and often been repeated since that a practical exemplification of this doctrine occurred about this time in germany a young nobleman it was said of the fairest gifts and prospects had cast away all these advantages betaken himself to the forests and copying moor had begun a course of active operations—which also copying moor but less willingly he had ended by a shameful death  it can now be hardly necessary to contradict these theories or to show that none but a candidate for bedlam as well as tyburn could be seduced from the substantial comforts of existence to seek destruction and disgrace for the sake of such imaginary grandeur the german nobleman of the fairest gifts and prospects turns out on investigation to have been a german blackguard whom debauchery and riotous extravagance had reduced to want who took to the highway when he could take to nothing else—not allured by an ebullient enthusiasm or any heroical and misdirected appetite for sublime actions but driven by the more palpable stimulus of importunate duns an empty purse and five craving senses perhaps in his later days this philosopher may have referred to schillers tragedy as the source from which he drew his theory of life but if so we believe he was mistaken for characters like him the great attraction was the charms of revelry and the great restraint the gallows—before the period of karl von moor just as they have been since and will be to the end of time among motives like these the influence of even the most malignant book could scarcely be discernible and would be little detrimental if it were  nothing at any rate could be farther from schillers intention than such a consummation in his preface he speaks of the moral effects of the robbers in terms which do honour to his heart while they show the inexperience of his head ridicule he signifies has long been tried against the wickedness of the times whole cargoes of hellebore have been expended—in vain and now he thinks recourse must be had to more pungent medicines we may smile at the simplicity of this idea and safely conclude that like other specifics the present one would fail to produce a perceptible effect but schillers vindication rests on higher grounds than these his work has on the whole furnished nourishment to the more exalted powers of our nature the sentiments and images which he has shaped and uttered tend in spite of their alloy to elevate the soul to a nobler pitch and this is a sufficient defence as to the danger of misapplying the inspiration he communicates of forgetting the dictates of prudence in our zeal for the dictates of poetry we have no great cause to fear it hitherto at least there has always been enough of dull reality on every side of us to abate such fervours in good time and bring us back to the most sober level of prose if not to sink us below it we should thank the poet who performs such a service and forbear to inquire too rigidly whether there is any moral in his piece or not the writer of a work which interests and excites the spiritual feelings of men has as little need to justify himself by showing how it exemplifies some wise saw or modern instance as the doer of a generous action has to demonstrate its merit by deducing it from the system of shaftesbury or smith or paley or whichever happens to be the favourite system for the age and place the instructiveness of the one and the virtue of the other exist independently of all systems or saws and in spite of all   but the tragedy of the robbers produced some inconveniences of a kind much more sensible than these its theoretical mischiefs we have called it the signal of schillers deliverance from school tyranny and military constraint but its operation in this respect was not immediate at first it seemed to involve him more deeply and dangerously than before he had finished the original sketch of it in 1778 but for fear of offence he kept it secret till his medical studies were completed6 these in the mean time he had pursued with sufficient assiduity to merit the usual honours7 in 1780 he had in consequence obtained the post of surgeon to the regiment augé in the würtemberg army this advancement enabled him to complete his project to print the robbers at his own expense not being able to find any bookseller that would undertake it the nature of the work and the universal interest it awakened drew attention to the private circumstances of the author whom the robbers as well as other pieces of his writing that had found their way into the periodical publications of the time sufficiently showed to be no common man many grave persons were offended at the vehement sentiments expressed in the robbers and the unquestioned ability with which these extravagances were expressed but made the matter worse to schillers superiors above all such things were inconceivable he might perhaps be a very great genius but was certainly a dangerous servant for his highness the grand duke of würtemberg officious people mingled themselves in the affair nay the graziers of the alps were brought to bear upon it the grisons magistrates it appeared had seen the book and were mortally huffed at being there spoken of according to a swabian adage as common highwaymen8 they complained in the hamburg correspondent and a sort of jackal at ludwigsburg one walter whose name deserves to be thus kept in mind volunteered to plead their cause before the grand duke      footnote 6 on this subject doering gives an anecdote which     may perhaps be worth translating one of schillers teachers     surprised him on one occasion reciting a scene from the     robbers before some of his intimate companions at the     words which franz von moor addresses to moser ha what     thou knowest none greater think again death heaven     eternity damnation hovers in the sound of thy voice not     one greater—the door opened and the master saw schiller     stamping in desperation up and down the room for shame     said he for shame to get into such a passion and curse     so the other scholars tittered covertly at the worthy     inspector and schiller called after him with a bitter smile     a noodle ein confiscirter kerl      footnote 7 his latin essay on the philosophy of     physiology was written in 1778 and never printed his     concluding thesis was published according to custom the     subject is arduous enough the connection between the animal     and spiritual nature of man—which dr cabanis has since     treated in so offensive a fashion schillers tract we have     never seen doering says it was long out of print till     nasse reproduced it in his medical journal leipzig 1820     he is silent respecting its merits      footnote 8 the obnoxious passage has been carefully     expunged from subsequent editions it was in the third scene     of the second act spiegelberg discoursing with razmann     observes an honest man you may form of windlestraws but     to make a rascal you must have grist besides there is a

forth on this occasion for     the honour of the grisons to deny this weighty charge and     denounce the crime of making it was not dogberry or verges     but one of the noble family of salis  informed of all these circumstances the grand duke expressed his disapprobation of schillers poetical labours in the most unequivocal terms schiller was at length summoned to appear before him and it then turned out that his highness was not only dissatisfied with the moral or political errors of the work but scandalised moreover at its want of literary merit in this latter respect he was kind enough to proffer his own services but schiller seems to have received the proposal with no sufficient gratitude and the interview passed without advantage to either party it terminated in the dukes commanding schiller to abide by medical subjects or at least to beware of writing any more poetry without submitting it to his inspection  we need not comment on this portion of the grand dukes history his treatment of schiller has already been sufficiently avenged by the great body of mankind his name will be recollected chiefly if at all for the sake of the unfriended youth whom he now schooled so sharply and afterwards afflicted so cruelly it will be recollected also with the angry triumph which we feel against a shallow and despotic noble of convention who strains himself to oppress one of natures nobility submitted by blind chance to his dominion and—finds that he cannot all this is far more than the prince of würtemberg deserves of limited faculties and educated in the french principles of taste then common to persons of his rank in germany he had perused the robbers with unfeigned disgust he could see in the author only a misguided enthusiast with talents barely enough to make him dangerous and though he never fully or formally retracted this injustice he did not follow it up when schiller became known to the world at large the duke ceased to persecute him the father he still kept in his service and nowise molested  in the mean time however various mortifications awaited schiller it was in vain that he discharged the humble duties of his station with the most strict fidelity and even it is said with superior skill he was a suspected person and his most innocent actions were misconstrued his slightest faults were visited with the full measure of official severity his busy imagination aggravated the evil he had seen poor schubart9 wearing out his tedious eight years of durance in the fortress of asperg because he had been a rock of offence to the powers that were the fate of this unfortunate author appeared to schiller a type of his own his free spirit shrank at the prospect of wasting its strength in strife against the pitiful constraints the minute and endless persecutions of men who knew him not yet had his fortune in their hands the idea of dungeons and jailors haunted and tortured his mind and the means of escaping them the renunciation of poetry the source of all his joy if likewise of many woes the radiant guidingstar of his turbid and obscure existence seemed a sentence of death to all that was dignified and delightful and worth retaining in his character totally ignorant of what is called the world conscious too of the might that slumbered in his soul and proud of it as kings are of their sceptres impetuous when roused and spurning unjust restraint yet wavering and timid from the delicacy of his nature and still more restricted in the freedom of his movements by the circumstances of his father whose all depended on the pleasure of the court schiller felt himself embarrassed and agitated and tormented in no common degree urged this way and that by the most powerful and conflicting impulses driven to despair by the paltry shackles that chained him yet forbidden by the most sacred considerations to break them he knew not on what he should resolve he reckoned himself the most unfortunate of men      footnote 9 see appendix i no 1  time at length gave him the solution circumstances occurred which forced him to decide the popularity of the robbers had brought him into correspondence with several friends of literature who wished to patronise the author or engage him in new undertakings among this number was the freiherr von dalberg superintendent of the theatre at mannheim under whose encouragement and countenance schiller remodelled the robbers altered it in some parts and had it brought upon the stage in 1781 the correspondence with dalberg began in literary discussions but gradually elevated itself into the expression of more interesting sentiments dalberg loved and sympathised with the generous enthusiast involved in troubles and perplexities which his inexperience was so little adequate to thread he gave him advice and assistance and schiller repaid this favour with the gratitude due to his kind his first and then almost his only benefactor his letters to this gentleman have been preserved and lately published they exhibit a lively picture of schillers painful situation at stuttgard and of his unskilful as well as eager anxiety to be delivered from it10 his darling project was that dalberg should bring him to mannheim as theatrical poet by permission of the duke at one time he even thought of turning player      footnote 10 see appendix i no 2  neither of these projects could take immediate effect and schillers embarrassments became more pressing than ever with the natural feeling of a young author he had ventured to go in secret and witness the first representation of his tragedy at mannheim his incognito did not conceal him he was put under arrest during a week for this offence and as the punishment did not deter him from again transgressing in a similar manner he learned that it was in contemplation to try more rigorous measures with him dark hints were given to him of some exemplary as well as imminent severity and dalbergs aid the sole hope of averting it by quiet means was distant and dubious schiller saw himself reduced to extremities beleaguered with present distresses and the most horrible forebodings on every side roused to the highest pitch of indignation yet forced to keep silence and wear the face of patience he could endure this maddening constraint no longer he resolved to be free at whatever risk to abandon advantages which he could not buy at such a price to quit his stepdame home and go forth though friendless and alone to seek his fortune in the great market of life some foreign duke or prince was arriving at stuttgard and all the people were in movement occupied with seeing the spectacle of his entrance schiller seized this opportunity of retiring from the city careless whither he went so he got beyond the reach of turnkeys and grand dukes and commanding officers it was in the month of october 1782  this last step forms the catastrophe of the publication of the robbers it completed the deliverance of schiller from the grating thraldom under which his youth had been passed and decided his destiny for life schiller was in his twentythird year when he left stuttgard he says he went empty away—empty in purse and hope the future was indeed sufficiently dark before him without patrons connexions or country he had ventured forth to the warfare on his own charges without means experience or settled purpose it was greatly to be feared that the fight would go against him yet his situation though gloomy enough was not entirely without its brighter side he was now a free man free however poor and his strong soul quickened as its fetters dropped off and gloried within him in the dim anticipation of great and farextending enterprises if cast too rudely among the hardships and bitter disquietudes of the world his past nursing had not been delicate he was already taught to look upon privation and discomfort as his daily companions if he knew not how to bend his course among the perplexed vicissitudes of society there was a force within him which would triumph over many difficulties and a light from heaven was about his path which if it failed to conduct him to wealth and preferment would keep him far from baseness and degrading vices literature and every great and noble thing which the right pursuit of it implies he loved with all his heart and all his soul to this inspiring object he was henceforth exclusively devoted advancing towards this and possessed of common necessaries on the humblest scale there was little else to tempt him his life might be unhappy but would hardly be disgraceful  schiller gradually felt all this and gathered comfort while better days began to dawn upon him fearful of trusting himself so near stuttgard as at mannheim he had passed into franconia and was living painfully at oggersheim under the name of schmidt but dalberg who knew all his distresses supplied him with money for immediate wants and a generous lady made him the offer of a home madam von wolzogen lived on her estate of bauerbach in the neighbourhood of meinungen she knew schiller from his works and his intimacy with her sons who had been his fellowstudents at stuttgard she invited him to her house and there treated him with an affection which helped him to forget the past and look cheerfully forward to the future  under this hospitable roof schiller had leisure to examine calmly the perplexed and dubious aspect of his affairs happily his character belonged not to the whining or sentimental sort he was not of those in whom the pressure of misfortune produces nothing but unprofitable pain who spend in cherishing and investigating and deploring their miseries the time which should be spent in providing a relief for them with him strong feeling was constantly a call to vigorous action he possessed in a high degree the faculty of conquering his afflictions by directing his thoughts not to maxims for enduring them or modes of expressing them with interest but to plans for getting rid of them and to this disposition or habit—too rare among men of genius men of a much higher class than mere sentimentalists but whose sensibility is out of proportion with their inventiveness or activity—we are to attribute no small influence in the fortunate conduct of his subsequent life with such a turn of mind schiller now that he was at length master of his own movements could not long be at a loss for plans or tasks once settled at bauerbach he immediately resumed his poetical employments and forgot in the regions of fancy the vague uncertainties of his real condition or saw prospects of amending it in a life of literature by many safe and sagacious persons the prudence of his late proceedings might be more than questioned it was natural for many to forbode that one who left the port so rashly and sailed with such precipitation was likely to make shipwreck ere the voyage had extended far but the lapse of a few months put a stop to such predictions a year had not passed since his departure when schiller sent forth his verschwörung des fiesco and kabale und liebe tragedies which testified that dangerous and arduous as the life he had selected might be he possessed resources more than adequate to its emergencies fiesco he had commenced during the period of his arrest at stuttgard it was published with the other play in 1783 and soon after brought upon the mannheim theatre with universal approbation  it was now about three years since the composition of the robbers had been finished five since the first sketch of it had been formed with what zeal and success schiller had in that interval pursued the work of his mental culture these two dramas are a striking proof the first ardour of youth is still to be discerned in them but it is now chastened by the dictates of a maturer reason and made to animate the products of a much happier and more skilful invention schillers ideas of art had expanded and grown clearer his knowledge of life had enlarged he exhibits more acquaintance with the fundamental principles of human nature as well as with the circumstances under which it usually displays itself and far higher and juster views of the manner in which its manifestations should be represented  in the conspiracy of fiesco we have to admire not only the energetic animation which the author has infused into all his characters but the distinctness with which he has discriminated without aggravating them and the vividness with which he has contrived to depict the scene where they act and move the political and personal relations of the genoese nobility the luxurious splendour the intrigues the feuds and jarring interests which occupy them are made visible before us we understand and may appreciate the complexities of the conspiracy we mingle as among realities in the pompous and imposing movements which lead to the catastrophe the catastrophe itself is displayed with peculiar effect the midnight silence of the sleeping city interrupted only by the distant sounds of watchmen by the low hoarse murmur of the sea or the stealthy footsteps and disguised voice of fiesco is conveyed to our imagination by some brief but graphic touches we seem to stand in the solitude and deep stillness of genoa awaiting the signal which is to burst so fearfully upon its slumber at length the gun is fired and the wild uproar which ensues is no less strikingly exhibited the deeds and sounds of violence astonishment and terror the volleying cannon the heavy toll of the alarmbells the acclamation of assembled thousands the voice of genoa speaking with fiesco—all is made present to us with a force and clearness which of itself were enough to show no ordinary power of close and comprehensive conception no ordinary skill in arranging and expressing its results  but it is not this felicitous delineation of circumstances and visible scenes that constitutes our principal enjoyment the faculty of penetrating through obscurity and confusion to seize the characteristic features of an object abstract or material of producing a lively description in the latter case an accurate and keen scrutiny in the former is the essential property of intellect and occupies in its best form a high rank in the scale of mental gifts but the creative faculty of the poet and especially of the dramatic poet is something superadded to this it is far rarer and occupies a rank far higher in this particular fiesco without approaching the limits of perfection yet stands in an elevated range of excellence the characters on the whole are imagined and portrayed with great impressiveness and vigour traces of old faults are indeed still to be discovered there still seems a want of pliancy about the genius of the author a stiffness and heaviness in his motions his sublimity is not to be questioned but it does not always disdain the aid of rude contrasts and mere theatrical effect he paints in colours deep and glowing but without sufficient skill to blend them delicately he amplifies nature more than purifies it he omits but does not well conceal the omission fiesco has not the complete charm of a true though embellished resemblance to reality its attraction rather lies in a kind of colossal magnitude which requires it if seen to advantage to be viewed from a distance yet the prevailing qualities of the piece do more than make us pardon such defects if the dramatic imitation is not always entirely successful it is never very distant from success and a constant flow of powerful thought and sentiment counteracts or prevents us from noticing the failure we find evidence of great philosophic penetration great resources of invention directed by a skilful study of history and men and everywhere a bold grandeur of feeling and imagery gives life to what study has combined the chief incidents have a dazzling magnificence the chief characters an aspect of majesty and force which corresponds to it fervour of heart capaciousness of intellect and imagination present themselves on all sides the general effect is powerful and exalting  fiesco himself is a personage at once probable and tragically interesting the luxurious dissipation in which he veils his daring projects softens the rudeness of that strength which it half conceals his immeasurable pride expands itself not only into a disdain of subjection but also into the most lofty acts of magnanimity his blind confidence in fortune seems almost warranted by the resources which he finds in his own fearlessness and imperturbable presence of mind his ambition participates in the nobleness of his other qualities he is less anxious that his rivals should yield to him in power than in generosity and greatness of character attributes of which power is with him but the symbol and the fit employment ambition in fiesco is indeed the common wish of every mind to diffuse its individual influence to see its own activity reflected back from the united minds of millions but it is the common wish acting on no common man he does not long to rule that he may sway other wills as it were by the physical exertion of his own he would lead us captive by the superior grandeur of his qualities once fairly manifested and he aims at dominion chiefly as it will enable him to manifest these it is not the arena that he values but what lies in that arena the sovereignty is enviable not for its adventitious splendour not because it is the object of coarse and universal wonder but as it offers in the collected force of a nation something which the loftiest mortal may find scope for all his powers in guiding spread out the thunder fiesco exclaims into its single tones and it becomes a lullaby for children pour it forth together in one quick peal and the royal sound shall move the heavens his affections are not less vehement than his other passions his heart can be melted into powerlessness and tenderness by the mild persuasions of his leonora the idea of exalting this amiable being mingles largely with the other motives to his enterprise he is in fact a great and might have been a virtuous man and though in the pursuit of grandeur he swerves from absolute rectitude we still respect his splendid qualities and admit the force of the allurements which have led him astray it is but faintly that we condemn his sentiments when after a night spent in struggles between a rigid and a more accommodating patriotism he looks out of his chamber as the sun is rising in its calm beauty and gilding the waves and mountains and all the innumerable palaces and domes and spires of genoa and exclaims with rapture this majestic city—mine to flame over it like the kingly day to brood over it with a monarchs power all these sleepless longings all these never satiated wishes to be drowned in that unfathomable ocean we admire fiesco we disapprove of him and sympathise with him he is crushed in the ponderous machinery which himself put in motion and thought to control we lament his fate but confess that it was not undeserved he is a fit offering of individual freewill to the force of social conventions  fiesco is not the only striking character in the play which bears his name the narrow fanatical republican virtue of verrina the mild and venerable wisdom of the old doria the unbridled profligacy of his nephew even the cold contented irreclaimable perversity of the cutthroat moor all dwell in our recollections but what next to fiesco chiefly attracts us is the character of leonora his wife leonora is of kindred to amelia in the robbers but involved in more complicated relations and brought nearer to the actual condition of humanity she is such a heroine as schiller most delights to draw meek and retiring by the softness of her nature yet glowing with an ethereal ardour for all that is illustrious and lovely she clings about her husband as if her being were one with his she dreams of remote and peaceful scenes where fiesco should be all to her she all to fiesco her idea of love is that her name should lie in secret behind every one of his thoughts should speak to him from every object of nature that for him this bright majestic universe itself were but as the shining jewel on which her image only hers stood engraved her character seems a reflection of fiescos but refined from his grosser strength and transfigured into a celestial form of purity and tenderness and touching grace jealousy cannot move her into anger she languishes in concealed sorrow when she thinks herself forgotten it is affection alone that can rouse her into passion but under the influence of this she forgets all weakness and fear she cannot stay in her palace on the night when fiescos destiny is deciding she rushes forth as if inspired to share in her husbands dangers and sublime deeds and perishes at last in the tumult  the death of leonora so brought about and at such a time is reckoned among the blemishes of the work that of fiesco in which schiller has ventured to depart from history is to be more favourably judged of fiesco is not here accidentally drowned but plunged into the waves by the indignant verrina who forgets or stifles the feelings of friendship in his rage at political apostasy the nature of the drama we are justly told will not suffer the operation of chance or of an immediate providence higher spirits can discern the minute fibres of an event stretching through the whole expanse of the system of the world and hanging it may be on the remotest limits of the future and the past where man discerns nothing save the action itself hovering unconnected in space but the artist has to paint for the short view of man whom he wishes to instruct not for the piercing eye of superior powers from whom he learns   in the composition of fiesco schiller derived the main part of his original materials from history he could increase the effect by gorgeous representations and ideas preëxisting in the mind of his reader enormity of incident and strangeness of situation lent him a similar assistance in the robbers kabale und liebe is destitute of these advantages it is a tragedy of domestic life its means of interesting are comprised within itself and rest on very simple feelings dignified by no very singular action the name courtintriguing and love correctly designates its nature it aims at exhibiting the conflict the victorious conflict of political manœuvering of cold worldly wisdom with the pure impassioned movements of the young heart as yet unsullied by the tarnish of everyday life inexperienced in its calculations sick of its empty formalities and indignantly determined to castoff the mean restrictions it imposes which bind so firmly by their number though singly so contemptible the idea is far from original this is a conflict which most men have figured to themselves which many men of ardent mind are in some degree constantly waging to make it in this simple form the subject of a drama seems to be a thought of schillers own but the praise though not the merit of his undertaking considerable rather as performed than projected has been lessened by a multitude of worthless or noxious imitations the same primary conception has been tortured into a thousand shapes and tricked out with a thousand tawdry devices and meretricious ornaments by the kotzebues and other intellectual jacobins whose productions have brought what we falsely call the german theatre into such deserved contempt in england some portion of the gall due only to these inflated flimsy and fantastic persons appears to have acted on certain critics in estimating this play of schillers august wilhelm schlegel speaks slightingly of the work he says it will hardly move us by its tone of overstrained sensibility but may well afflict us by the painful impressions which it leaves our own experience has been different from that of schlegel in the characters of louisa and ferdinand walter we discovered little overstraining their sensibility we did not reckon very criminal seeing it united with a clearness of judgment chastened by a purity of heart and controlled by a force of virtuous resolution in full proportion with itself we rather admired the genius of the poet which could elevate a poor musicmasters daughter to the dignity of a heroine could represent without wounding our sense of propriety the affection of two noble beings created for each other by nature and divided by rank we sympathised in their sentiments enough to feel a proper interest in their fate and see in them what the author meant we should see two pure and lofty minds involved in the meshes of vulgar cunning and borne to destruction by the excess of their own good qualities and the crimes of others  ferdinand is a nobleman but not convinced that his patent of nobility is more ancient or of more authority than the primeval scheme of the universe he speaks and acts like a young man entertaining such persuasions disposed to yield everything to reason and true honour but scarcely anything to mere use and wont his passion for louisa is the sign and the nourishment rather than the cause of such a temper he loves her without limit as the only creature he has ever met with of a like mind with himself and this feeling exalts into inspiration what was already the dictate of his nature we accompany him on his straight and plain path we rejoice to see him fling aside with a strong arm the artifices and allurements with which a worthless father and more worthless associates assail him at first in vain there is something attractive in the spectacle of native integrity fearless though inexperienced at war with selfishness and craft something mournful because the victory will seldom go as we would have it  louisa is a meet partner for the generous ferdinand the poet has done justice to her character she is timid and humble a feeling and richly gifted soul is hid in her by the unkindness of her earthly lot she is without counsellors except the innate holiness of her heart and the dictates of her keen though untutored understanding yet when the hour of trial comes she can obey the commands of both and draw from herself a genuine nobleness of conduct which secondhand prudence and wealth and titles would but render less touching her filial affection her angelic attachment to her lover her sublime and artless piety are beautifully contrasted with the bleakness of her external circumstances she appears before us like the one rose of the wilderness left on its stalk and we grieve to see it crushed and trodden down so rudely  the innocence the enthusiasm the exalted life and stern fate of louisa and ferdinand give a powerful charm to this tragedy it is everywhere interspersed with pieces of fine eloquence and scenes which move us by their dignity or pathos we recollect few passages of a more overpowering nature than the conclusion where ferdinand beguiled by the most diabolical machinations to disbelieve the virtue of his mistress puts himself and her to death by poison there is a gloomy and solemn might in his despair though overwhelmed he seems invincible his enemies have blinded and imprisoned him in their deceptions but only that like samson he may overturn his prisonhouse and bury himself and all that have wronged him in its ruins  the other characters of the play though in general properly sustained are not sufficiently remarkable to claim much of our attention wurm the chief counsellor and agent of the unprincipled calculating father is wicked enough but there is no great singularity in his wickedness he is little more than the dry cool and now somewhat vulgar miscreant the villanous attorney of modern novels kalb also is but a worthless subject and what is worse but indifferently handled he is meant for the featherbrained thing of tags and laces which frequently inhabits courts but he wants the grace and agility proper to the species he is less a fool than a blockhead less perverted than totally inane schillers strength lay not in comedy but in something far higher the great merit of the present work consists in the characters of the hero and heroine and in this respect it ranks at the very head of its class as a tragedy of common life we know of few rivals to it certainly of no superior   the production of three such pieces as the robbers fiesco and kabale und liebe already announced to the world that another great and original mind had appeared from whose maturity when such was the promise of its youth the highest expectations might be formed these three plays stand related to each other in regard to their nature and form as well as date they exhibit the progressive state of schillers education show us the fiery enthusiasm of youth exasperated into wildness astonishing in its movements rather than sublime and the same enthusiasm gradually yielding to the sway of reason gradually using itself to the constraints prescribed by sound judgment and more extensive knowledge of the three the robbers is doubtless the most singular and likely perhaps to be the most widely popular but the latter two are of more real worth in the eye of taste and will better bear a careful and rigorous study  with the appearance of fiesco and its companion the first period of schillers literary history may conclude the stormy confusions of his youth were now subsiding after all his aberrations repulses and perplexed wanderings he was at length about to reach his true destination and times of more serenity began to open for him two such tragedies as he had lately offered to the world made it easier for his friend dalberg to second his pretensions schiller was at last gratified by the fulfilment of his favourite scheme in september 1783 he went to mannheim as poet to the theatre a post of respectability and reasonable profit to the duties of which he forthwith addressed himself with all his heart he was not long afterwards elected a member of the german society established for literary objects in mannheim and he valued the honour not only as a testimony of respect from a highly estimable quarter but also as a means of uniting him more closely with men of kindred pursuits and tempers and what was more than all of quieting forever his apprehensions from the government at stuttgard since his arrival at mannheim one or two suspicious incidents had again alarmed him on this head but being now acknowledged as a subject of the elector palatine naturalised by law in his new country he had nothing more to fear from the duke of würtemberg  satisfied with his moderate income safe free and surrounded by friends that loved and honoured him schiller now looked confidently forward to what all his efforts had been a search and hitherto a fruitless search for an undisturbed life of intellectual labour what effect this happy aspect of his circumstances must have produced upon him may be easily conjectured through many years he had been inured to agitation and distress now peace and liberty and hope sweet in themselves were sweeter for their novelty for the first time in his life he saw himself allowed to obey without reluctance the ruling bias of his nature for the first time inclination and duty went hand in hand his activity awoke with renovated force in this favourable scene longthwarted halfforgotten projects again kindled into brightness as the possibility of their accomplishment became apparent schiller glowed with a generous pride when he felt his faculties at his own disposal and thought of the use he meant to make of them all my connexions he said are now dissolved the public is now all to me my study my sovereign my confidant to the public alone i henceforth belong before this and no other tribunal will i place myself this alone do i reverence and fear something majestic hovers before me as i determine now to wear no other fetters but the sentence of the world to appeal to no other throne but the soul of man  these expressions are extracted from the preface to his thalia a periodical work which he undertook in 1784 devoted to subjects connected with poetry and chiefly with the drama in such sentiments we leave him commencing the arduous and perilous but also glorious and sublime duties of a life consecrated to the discovery of truth and the creation of intellectual beauty he was now exclusively what is called a man of letters for the rest of his days                                    part ii     from schillers settlement at mannheim to his settlement at jena                              17831790                                  part second                               17831790   if to know wisdom were to practise it if fame brought true dignity and peace of mind or happiness consisted in nourishing the intellect with its appropriate food and surrounding the imagination with ideal beauty a literary life would be the most enviable which the lot of this world affords but the truth is far otherwise the man of letters has no immutable allconquering volition more than other men to understand and to perform are two very different things with him as with every one his fame rarely exerts a favourable influence on his dignity of character and never on his peace of mind its glitter is external for the eyes of others within it is but the aliment of unrest the oil cast upon the evergnawing fire of ambition quickening into fresh vehemence the blaze which it stills for a moment moreover this man of letters is not wholly made of spirit but of clay and spirit mixed his thinking faculties may be nobly trained and exercised but he must have affections as well as thoughts to make him happy and food and raiment must be given him or he dies far from being the most enviable his way of life is perhaps among the many modes by which an ardent mind endeavours to express its activity the most thickly beset with suffering and degradation look at the biography of authors except the newgate calendar it is the most sickening chapter in the history of man the calamities of these people are a fertile topic and too often their faults and vices have kept pace with their calamities nor is it difficult to see how this has happened talent of any sort is generally accompanied with a peculiar fineness of sensibility of genius this is the most essential constituent and life in any shape has sorrows enough for hearts so formed the employments of literature sharpen this natural tendency the vexations that accompany them frequently exasperate it into morbid soreness the cares and toils of literature are the business of life its delights are too ethereal and too transient to furnish that perennial flow of satisfaction coarse but plenteous and substantial of which happiness in this world of ours is made the most finished efforts of the mind give it little pleasure frequently they give it pain for mens aims are ever far beyond their strength and the outward recompense of these undertakings the distinction they confer is of still smaller value the desire for it is insatiable even when successful and when baffled it issues in jealousy and envy and every pitiful and painful feeling so keen a temperament with so little to restrain or satisfy so much to distress or tempt it produces contradictions which few are adequate to reconcile hence the unhappiness of literary men hence their faults and follies  thus literature is apt to form a dangerous and discontenting occupation even for the amateur but for him whose rank and worldly comforts depend on it who does not live to write but writes to live its difficulties and perils are fearfully increased few spectacles are more afflicting than that of such a man so gifted and so fated so jostled and tossed to and fro in the rude bustle of life the buffetings of which he is so little fitted to endure cherishing it may be the loftiest thoughts and clogged with the meanest wants of pure and holy purposes yet ever driven from the straight path by the pressure of necessity or the impulse of passion thirsting for glory and frequently in want of daily bread hovering between the empyrean of his fancy and the squalid desert of reality cramped and foiled in his most strenuous exertions dissatisfied with his best performances disgusted with his fortune this man of letters too often spends his weary days in conflicts with obscure misery harassed chagrined debased or maddened the victim at once of tragedy and farce the last forlorn outpost in the war of mind against matter many are the noble souls that have perished bitterly with their tasks unfinished under these corroding woes some in utter famine like otway some in dark insanity like cowper and collins some like chatterton have sought out a more stern quietus and turning their indignant steps away from a world which refused them welcome have taken refuge in that strong fortress where poverty and cold neglect and the thousand natural shocks which flesh is heir to could not reach them any more  yet among these men are to be found the brightest specimens and the chief benefactors of mankind it is they that keep awake the finer parts of our souls that give us better aims than power or pleasure and withstand the total sovereignty of mammon in this earth they are the vanguard in the march of mind the intellectual backwoodsmen reclaiming from the idle wilderness new territories for the thought and the activity of their happier brethren pity that from all their conquests so rich in benefit to others themselves should reap so little but it is vain to murmur they are volunteers in this cause they weighed the charms of it against the perils and they must abide the results of their decision as all must the hardships of the course they follow are formidable but not all inevitable and to such as pursue it rightly it is not without its great rewards if an authors life is more agitated and more painful than that of others it may also be made more spiritstirring and exalted fortune may render him unhappy it is only himself that can make him despicable the history of genius has in fact its bright side as well as its dark and if it is distressing to survey the misery and what is worse the debasement of so many gifted men it is doubly cheering on the other hand to reflect on the few who amid the temptations and sorrows to which life in all its provinces and most in theirs is liable have travelled through it in calm and virtuous majesty and are now hallowed in our memories not less for their conduct than their writings such men are the flower of this lower world to such alone can the epithet of great be applied with its true emphasis there is a congruity in their proceedings which one loves to contemplate he who would write heroic poems should make his whole life a heroic poem  so thought our milton and what was more difficult he acted so to milton the moral king of authors a heroic multitude out of many ages and countries might be joined a cloud of witnesses that encompass the true literary man throughout his pilgrimage inspiring him to lofty emulation cheering his solitary thoughts with hope teaching him to struggle to endure to conquer difficulties or in failure and heavy sufferings to                            arm th obdured breast     with stubborn patience as with triple steel  to this august series in his own degree the name of schiller may be added  schiller lived in more peaceful times than milton his history is less distinguished by obstacles surmounted or sacrifices made to principle yet he had his share of trials to encounter and the admirers of his writings need not feel ashamed of the way in which he bore it one virtue the parent of many others and the most essential of any in his circumstances he possessed in a supreme degree he was devoted with entire and unchanging ardour to the cause he had embarked in the extent of his natural endowments might have served with a less eager character as an excuse for long periods of indolence broken only by fits of casual exertion with him it was but a new incitement to improve and develop them the ideal man that lay within him the image of himself as he should be was formed upon a strict and curious standard and to reach this constantly approached and constantly receding emblem of perfection was the unwearied effort of his life this crowning principle of conduct never ceasing to inspire his energetic mind introduced a consistency into his actions a firm coherence into his character which the changeful condition of his history rendered of peculiar importance his resources his place of residence his associates his worldly prospects might vary as they pleased this purpose did not vary it was ever present with him to nerve every better faculty of his head and heart to invest the chequered vicissitudes of his fortune with a dignity derived from himself the zeal of his nature overcame the temptations to that loitering and indecision that fluctuation between sloth and consuming toil that infirmity of resolution with all its tormenting and enfeebling consequences to which a literary man working as he does at a solitary task uncalled for by any pressing tangible demand and to be recompensed by distant and dubious advantage is especially exposed unity of aim aided by ordinary vigour of character will generally insure perseverance a quality not ranked among the cardinal virtues but as essential as any of them to the proper conduct of life ninetenths of the miseries and vices of mankind proceed from idleness with men of quick minds to whom it is especially pernicious this habit is commonly the fruit of many disappointments and schemes oft baffled and men fail in their schemes not so much from the want of strength as from the illdirection of it the weakest living creature by concentrating his powers on a single object can accomplish something the strongest by dispersing his over many may fail to accomplish anything the drop by continual falling bores its passage through the hardest rock the hasty torrent rushes over it with hideous uproar and leaves no trace behind few men have applied more steadfastly to the business of their life or been more resolutely diligent than schiller  the profession of theatrical poet was in his present circumstances particularly favourable to the maintenance of this wholesome state of mind in the fulfilment of its duties while he gratified his own dearest predilections he was likewise warmly seconded by the prevailing taste of the public the interest excited by the stage and the importance attached to everything connected with it are greater in germany than in any other part of europe not excepting france or even paris nor as in paris is the stage in german towns considered merely as a mental recreation an elegant and pleasant mode of filling up the vacancy of tedious evenings in germany it has the advantage of being comparatively new and its exhibitions are directed to a class of minds attuned to a far higher pitch of feeling the germans are accused of a proneness to amplify and systematise to admire with excess and to find in whatever calls forth their applause an epitome of a thousand excellencies which no one else can discover in it their discussions on the theatre do certainly give colour to this charge nothing at least to an english reader can appear more disproportionate than the influence they impute to the stage and the quantity of anxious investigation they devote to its concerns  with us the question about the moral tendency of theatrical amusements is now very generally consigned to the meditation of debating clubs and speculative societies of young men under age with our neighbours it is a weighty subject of inquiry for minds of almost the highest order with us the stage is considered as a harmless pastime wholesome because it occupies the man by occupying his mental not his sensual faculties one of the many departments of fictitious representation perhaps the most exciting but also the most transitory sometimes hurtful generally beneficial just as the rest are entitled to no peculiar regard and far inferior in its effect to many others which have no special apparatus for their application the germans on the contrary talk of it as of some new organ for refining the hearts and minds of men a sort of lay pulpit the worthy ally of the sacred one and perhaps even better fitted to exalt some of our nobler feelings because its objects are much more varied and because it speaks to us through many avenues addressing the eye by its pomp and decorations the ear by its harmonies and the heart and imagination by its poetical embellishments and heroic acts and sentiments influences still more mysterious are hinted at if not directly announced an idea seems to lurk obscurely at the bottom of certain of their abstruse and elaborate speculations as if the stage were destined to replace some of those sublime illusions which the progress of reason is fast driving from the earth as if its pageantry and allegories and figurative shadowingforth of things might supply mens nature with much of that quickening nourishment which we once derived from the superstitions and mythologies of darker ages viewing the matter in this light they proceed in the management of it with all due earnestness hence their minute and painful investigations of the origin of dramatic emotion of its various kinds and degrees their subdivisions of romantic and heroic and romanticoheroic and the other endless jargon that encumbers their critical writings the zeal of the people corresponds with that of their instructors the want of more important public interests naturally contributes still farther to the prominence of this the discussion of which is not forbidden or sure to be without effect literature attracts nearly all the powerful thought that circulates in germany and the theatre is the great nucleus of german literature  it was to be expected that schiller would participate in a feeling so universal and so accordant with his own wishes and prospects the theatre of mannheim was at that period one of the best in germany he felt proud of the share which he had in conducting it and exerted himself with his usual alacrity in promoting its various objects connected with the duties of his office was the more personal duty of improving his own faculties and extending his knowledge of the art which he had engaged to cultivate he read much and studied more the perusal of corneille racine voltaire and the other french classics could not be without advantage to one whose exuberance of power and defect of taste were the only faults he had ever been reproached with and the sounder ideas thus acquired he was constantly busy in exemplifying by attempts of his own his projected translations from shakspeare and the french were postponed for the present indeed except in the instance of macbeth they were never finished his conradin von schwaben and a second part of the robbers were likewise abandoned but a number of minor undertakings sufficiently evinced his diligence and don carlos which he had now seriously commenced was occupying all his poetical faculties  another matter he had much at heart was the setting forth of a periodical work devoted to the concerns of the stage in this enterprise schiller had expected the patronage and coöperation of the german society of which he was a member it did not strike him that any other motive than a genuine love of art and zeal for its advancement could have induced men to join such a body but the zeal of the german society was more according to knowledge than that of their new associate they listened with approving ear to his vivid representations and widespreading projects but declined taking any part in the execution of them dalberg alone seemed willing to support him mortified but not disheartened by their coldness schiller reckoned up his means of succeeding without them the plan of his work was contracted within narrower limits he determined to commence it on his own resources after much delay the first number of the rheinische thalia enriched by three acts of don carlos appeared in 1785 it was continued with one short interruption till 1794 the main purpose of the work being the furtherance of dramatic art and the extension and improvement of the public taste for such entertainments its chief contents are easy to be guessed at theatrical criticisms essays on the nature of the stage its history in various countries its moral and intellectual effects and the best methods of producing them a part of the publication was open to poetry and miscellaneous discussion  meditating so many subjects so assiduously schiller knew not what it was to be unemployed yet the task of composing dramatic varieties of training players and deliberating in the theatrical senate or even of expressing philosophically his opinions on these points could not wholly occupy such a mind as his there were times when notwithstanding his own prior habits and all the vaunting of dramaturgists he felt that their scenic glories were but an empty show a lying refuge where there was no abiding rest for the soul his eager spirit turned away from their paltry world of pasteboard to dwell among the deep and serious interests of the living world of men the thalia besides its dramatic speculations and performances contains several of his poems which indicate that his attention though officially directed elsewhither was alive to all the common concerns of humanity that he looked on life not more as a writer than as a man the laura whom he celebrates was not a vision of the mind but a living fair one whom he saw daily and loved in the secrecy of his heart his gruppe aus dem tartarus group from tartarus his kindesmörderinn infanticide are products of a mind brooding over dark and mysterious things while improving in the art of poetry in the capability of uttering his thoughts in the form best adapted to express them he was likewise improving in the more valuable art of thought itself and applying it not only to the business of the imagination but also to those profound and solemn inquiries which every reasonable mortal is called to engage with  in particular the philosophische briefe written about this period exhibits schiller in a new and to us more interesting point of view julius and raphael are the emblems of his own fears and his own hopes their philosophic letters unfold to us many a gloomy conflict that had passed in the secret chambers of their authors soul sceptical doubts on the most important of all subjects were natural to such an understanding as schillers but his heart was not of a temper to rest satisfied with doubts or to draw a sorry compensation for them from the pride of superior acuteness or the vulgar pleasure of producing an effect on others by assailing their dearest and holiest persuasions with him the question about the essence of our being was not a subject for shallow speculation charitably named scientific still less for vain jangling and polemical victories it was a fearful mystery which it concerned all the deepest sympathies and most sublime anticipations of his mind to have explained it is no idle curiosity but the shuddering voice of nature that asks if our happiness depend on the harmonious play of the sensorium if our conviction may waver with the beating of the pulse what schillers ultimate opinions on these points were we are nowhere specially informed that his heart was orthodox that the whole universe was for him a temple in which he offered up the continual sacrifice of devout adoration his works and life bear noble testimony yet here and there his fairest visions seem as if suddenly sicklied over with a pale cast of doubt a withering shadow seems to flit across his soul and chill it in his loftiest moods the dark condition of the man who longs to believe and longs in vain he can represent with a verisimilitude and touching beauty which shows it to have been familiar to himself apart from their ingenuity there is a certain severe pathos in some of these passages which affects us with a peculiar emotion the hero of another work is made to express himself in these terms  what went before and what will follow me i regard as two black impenetrable curtains which hang down at the two extremities of human life and which no living man has yet drawn aside many hundreds of generations have already stood before them with their torches guessing anxiously what lies behind on the curtain of futurity many see their own shadows the forms of their passions enlarged and put in motion they shrink in terror at this image of themselves poets philosophers and founders of states have painted this curtain with their dreams more smiling or more dark as the sky above them was cheerful or gloomy and their pictures deceive the eye when viewed from a distance many jugglers too make profit of this our universal curiosity by their strange mummeries they have set the outstretched fancy in amazement a deep silence reigns behind this curtain no one once within it will answer those he has left without all you can hear is a hollow echo of your question as if you shouted into a chasm to the other side of this curtain we are all bound men grasp hold of it as they pass trembling uncertain who may stand within it to receive them quid sit id quod tantum morituri vident some unbelieving people there have been who have asserted that this curtain did but make a mockery of men and that nothing could be seen because nothing was behind it but to convince these people the rest have seized them and hastily pushed them in11      footnote 11 der geisterseher schillers werke b iv p     350  the philosophic letters paint the struggles of an ardent enthusiastic inquisitive spirit to deliver itself from the harassing uncertainties to penetrate the dread obscurity which overhangs the lot of man the first faint scruples of the doubter are settled by the maxim believe nothing but thy own reason there is nothing holier than truth but reason employed in such an inquiry can do but half the work she is like the conjuror that has pronounced the spell of invocation but has forgot the counterword spectres and shadowy forms come crowding at his summons in endless multitudes they press and hover round his magic circle and the terrorstruck blackartist cannot lay them julius finds that on rejecting the primary dictates of feeling the system of dogmatical belief he is driven to the system of materialism recoiling in horror from this dead and cheerless creed he toils and wanders in the labyrinths of pantheism seeking comfort and rest but finding none till baffled and tired and sick at heart he seems inclined as far as we can judge to renounce the dreary problem altogether to shut the eyes of his too keen understanding and take refuge under the shade of revelation the anxieties and errors of julius are described in glowing terms his intellectual subtleties are mingled with the eloquence of intense feeling the answers of his friend are in a similar style intended not more to convince than to persuade the whole work is full of passion as well as acuteness the impress of a philosophic and poetic mind striving with all its vast energies to make its poetry and its philosophy agree considered as exhibiting the state of schillers thoughts at this period it possesses a peculiar interest in other respects there is little in it to allure us it is short and incomplete there is little originality in the opinions it expresses and none in the form of its composition as an argument on either side it is too rhetorical to be of much weight it abandons the inquiry when its difficulties and its value are becoming greatest and breaks off abruptly without arriving at any conclusion schiller has surveyed the dark serbonian bog of infidelity but he has made no causeway through it the philosophic letters are a fragment  amid employments so varied with health and freedom from the coarser hardships of life schillers feelings might be earnest but could scarcely be unhappy his mild and amiable manners united to such goodness of heart and such height of accomplishment endeared him to all classes of society in mannheim dalberg was still his warm friend schwann and laura he conversed with daily his genius was fast enlarging its empire and fast acquiring more complete command of it he was loved and admired rich in the enjoyment of present activity and fame and richer in the hope of what was coming yet in proportion as his faculties and his prospects expanded he began to view his actual situation with less and less contentment for a season after his arrival it was natural that mannheim should appear to him as land does to the shipwrecked mariner full of gladness and beauty merely because it is land it was equally natural that after a time this sentiment should abate and pass away that his place of refuge should appear but as other places only with its difficulties and discomforts aggravated by their nearness his revenue was inconsiderable here and dependent upon accidents for its continuance a share in directing the concerns of a provincial theatre a task not without its irritations was little adequate to satisfy the wishes of a mind like his schiller longed for a wider sphere of action the world was all before him he lamented that he should still be lingering on the mere outskirts of its business that he should waste so much time and effort in contending with the irascible vanity of players or watching the ebbs and flows of public taste in resisting small grievances and realising a small result he determined upon leaving mannheim if destitute of other holds his prudence might still have taught him to smother this unrest the neverfailing inmate of every human breast and patiently continue where he was but various resources remained to him and various hopes invited him from other quarters the produce of his works or even the exercise of his profession would insure him a competence anywhere the former had already gained him distinction and goodwill in every part of germany the first number of his thalia had arrived at the court of hessendarmstadt while the duke of sachsenweimar happened to be there the perusal of the first acts of don carlos had introduced the author to that enlightened prince who expressed his satisfaction and respect by transmitting him the title of counsellor a less splendid but not less truthful or pleasing testimonial had lately reached him from leipzig  some days ago he writes i met with a very flattering and agreeable surprise there came to me out of leipzig from unknown hands four parcels and as many letters written with the highest enthusiasm towards me and overflowing with poetical devotion they were accompanied by four miniature portraits two of which are of very beautiful young ladies and by a pocketbook sewed in the finest taste such a present from people who can have no interest in it but to let me know that they wish me well and thank me for some cheerful hours i prize extremely the loudest applause of the world could scarcely have flattered me so agreeably  perhaps this incident trifling as it was might not be without effect in deciding the choice of his future residence leipzig had the more substantial charm of being a centre of activity and commerce of all sorts that of literature not excepted and it contained some more effectual friends of schiller than these his unseen admirers he resolved on going thither his wishes and intentions are minutely detailed to huber his chief intimate at leipzig in a letter written shortly before his removal we translate it for the hints it gives us of schillers tastes and habits at that period of his history  this then is probably the last letter i shall write to you from mannheim the time from the fifteenth of march has hung upon my hands like a trial for life and thank heaven i am now ten whole days nearer you and now my good friend as you have already consented to take my entire confidence upon your shoulders allow me the pleasure of leading you into the interior of my domestic wishes  in my new establishment at leipzig i purpose to avoid one error which has plagued me a great deal here in mannheim it is this no longer to conduct my own housekeeping and also no longer to live alone the former is not by any means a business i excel in it costs me less to execute a whole conspiracy in five acts than to settle my domestic arrangements for a week and poetry you yourself know is but a dangerous assistant in calculations of economy my mind is drawn different ways i fall headlong out of my ideal world if a holed stocking remind me of the real world  as to the other point i require for my private happiness to have a true warm friend that would be ever at my hand like my better angel to whom i could communicate my nascent ideas in the very act of conceiving them not needing to transmit them as at present by letters or long visits nay when this friend of mine lives beyond the four corners of my house the trifling circumstance that in order to reach him i must cross the street dress myself and so forth will of itself destroy the enjoyment of the moment and the train of my thoughts is torn in pieces before i see him  observe you my good fellow these are petty matters but petty matters often bear the weightiest result in the management of life i know myself better than perhaps a thousand mothers sons know themselves i understand how much and frequently how little i require to be completely happy the question therefore is can i get this wish of my heart fulfilled in leipzig  if it were possible that i could make a lodgment with you all my cares on that head would be removed i am no bad neighbour as perhaps you imagine i have pliancy enough to suit myself to another and here and there withal a certain knack as yorick says at helping to make him merrier and better failing this if you could find me any person that would undertake my small economy everything would still be well  i want nothing but a bedroom which might also be my working room and another chamber for receiving visits the housegear necessary for me are a good chest of drawers a desk a bed and sofa a table and a few chairs with these conveniences my accommodation were sufficiently provided for  i cannot live on the groundfloor nor close by the ridgetile also my windows positively must not look into the churchyard i love men and therefore like their bustle if i cannot so arrange it that we meaning the quintuple alliance12 shall mess together i would engage at the table dhôte of the inn for i had rather fast than eat without company large or else particularly good      footnote 12 who the other three were is nowhere     particularly mentioned  i write all this to you my dearest friend to forewarn you of my silly tastes and at all events that i may put it in your power to take some preparatory steps in one place or another for my settlement my demands are in truth confoundedly naïve but your goodness has spoiled me  the first part of the thalia must already be in your possession the doom of carlos will ere now be pronounced yet i will take it from you orally had we five not been acquainted who knows but we might have become so on occasion of this very carlos  schiller went accordingly to leipzig though whether huber received him or he found his humble necessaries elsewhere we have not learned he arrived in the end of march 1785 after eighteen months residence at mannheim the reception he met with his amusements occupations and prospects are described in a letter to the kammerrath schwann a bookseller at mannheim alluded to above except dalberg schwann had been his earliest friend he was now endeared to him by subsequent familiarity not of letters and writing but of daily intercourse and what was more than all by the circumstance that laura was his daughter the letter it will be seen was written with a weightier object than the pleasure of describing leipzig it is dated 24th april 1785  you have an indubitable right to be angry at my long silence yet i know your goodness too well to be in doubt that you will pardon me  when a man unskilled as i am in the busy world visits leipzig for the first time during the fair it is if not excusable at least intelligible that among the multitude of strange things running through his head he should for a few days lose recollection of himself such my dearest friend has till today been nearly my case and even now i have to steal from many avocations the pleasing moments which in idea i mean to spend with you at mannheim  our journey hither of which herr götz will give you a circumstantial description was the most dismal you can well imagine bog snow and rain were the three wicked foes that by turns assailed us and though we used an additional pair of horses all the way from vach yet our travelling which should have ended on friday was spunout till sunday it is universally maintained that the fair has visibly suffered by the shocking state of the roads at all events even in my eyes the crowd of sellers and buyers is far beneath the description i used to get of it in the empire  in the very first week of my residence here i made innumerable new acquaintances among whom weisse oeser hiller zollikofer professor huber jünger the famous actor reinike a few merchants families of the place and some berlin people are the most interesting during fairtime as you know well a person cannot get the full enjoyment of any one our attention to the individual is dissipated in the noisy multitude  my most pleasant recreation hitherto has been to visit richters coffeehouse where i constantly find half the world of leipzig assembled and extend my acquaintance with foreigners and natives  from various quarters i have had some alluring invitations to berlin and dresden which it will be difficult for me to withstand it is quite a peculiar case my friend to have a literary name the few men of worth and consideration who offer you their intimacy on that score and whose regard is really worth coveting are too disagreeably counterweighed by the baleful swarm of creatures who keep humming round you like so many fleshflies gape at you as if you were a monster and condescend moreover on the strength of one or two blotted sheets to present themselves as colleagues many people cannot understand how a man that wrote the robbers should look like another son of adam closecut hair at the very least and postillions boots and a hunters whip were expected  many families are in the habit here of spending the summer in some of the adjacent villages and so enjoying the pleasures of the country i mean to pass a few months in gohlis which lies only a quarter of a league from leipzig with a very pleasant walk leading to it through the rosenthal here i purpose being very diligent working at carlos and the thalia that so which perhaps will please you more than anything i may gradually and silently return to my medical profession i long impatiently for that epoch of my life when my prospects may be settled and determined when i may follow my darling pursuits merely for my own pleasure at one time i studied medicine con amore could i not do it now with still greater keenness  this my best friend might of itself convince you of the truth and firmness of my purpose but what should offer you the most complete security on that point what must banish all your doubts about my steadfastness i have yet kept secret now or never i must speak it out distance alone gives me courage to express the wish of my heart frequently enough when i used to have the happiness of being near you has this confession hovered on my tongue but my confidence always forsook me when i tried to utter it my best friend your goodness your affection your generosity of heart have encouraged me in a hope which i can justify by nothing but the friendship and respect you have always shown me my free unconstrained access to your house afforded me the opportunity of intimate acquaintance with your amiable daughter and the frank kind treatment with which both you and she honoured me tempted my heart to entertain the bold wish of becoming your son my prospects have hitherto been dim and vague they now begin to alter in my favour i will strive with more continuous vigour when the goal is clear do you decide whether i can reach it when the dearest wish of my heart supports my zeal  yet two short years and my whole fortune will be determined i feel how much i ask how boldly and with how little right i ask it a year is past since this thought took possession of my soul but my esteem for you and your excellent daughter was too high to allow room for a wish which at that time i could found on no solid basis i made it a duty with myself to visit your house less frequently and to dissipate such feelings by absence but this poor artifice did not avail me  the duke of weimar was the first person to whom i disclosed myself his anticipating goodness and the declaration that he took an interest in my happiness induced me to confess that this happiness depended on a union with your noble daughter and he expressed his satisfaction at my choice i have reason to hope that he will do more should it come to the point of completing my happiness by this union  i shall add nothing farther i know well that hundreds of others might afford your daughter a more splendid fate than i at this moment can promise her but that any other heart can be more worthy of her i venture to deny your decision which i look for with impatience and fearful expectation will determine whether i may venture to write in person to your daughter fare you well forever loved by—your—  friedrich schiller   concerning this proposal we have no farther information to communicate except that the parties did not marry and did not cease being friends that schiller obtained the permission he concludes with requesting appears from other sources three years afterwards in writing to the same person he alludes emphatically to his eldest daughter and what is more ominous apologises for his silence to her schillers situation at this period was such as to preclude the idea of present marriage perhaps in the prospect of it laura and he commenced corresponding and before the wishedfor change of fortune had arrived both of them attracted to other objects had lost one another in the vortex of life and ceased to regard their finding one another as desirable  schillers medical project like many which he formed never came to any issue in moments of anxiety amid the fluctuations of his lot the thought of this profession floated through his mind as of a distant stronghold to which in time of need he might retire but literature was too intimately interwoven with his dispositions and his habits to be seriously interfered with it was only at brief intervals that the pleasure of pursuing it exclusively seemed overbalanced by its inconveniences he needed a more certain income than poetry could yield him but he wished to derive it from some pursuit less alien to his darling study medicine he never practised after leaving stuttgard  in the mean time whatever he might afterwards resolve on he determined to complete his carlos the half of which composed a considerable time before had lately been running the gauntlet of criticism in the thalia13 with this for his chief occupation gohlis or leipzig for his residence and a circle of chosen friends for his entertainment schillers days went happily along his lied an die freude song to joy one of his most spirited and beautiful lyrical productions was composed here it bespeaks a mind impetuous even in its gladness and overflowing with warm and earnest emotions      footnote 13 wielands rather harsh and not too judicious     sentence on it may be seen at large in grubers wieland     geschildert b ii s 571  but the love of change is grounded on the difference between anticipation and reality and dwells with man till the age when habit becomes stronger than desire or anticipation ceases to be hope schiller did not find that his establishment at leipzig though pleasant while it lasted would realise his ulterior views he yielded to some of his alluring invitations and went to dresden in the end of summer dresden contained many persons who admired him more who admired his fame and a few who loved himself among the latter the appellationsrath körner deserves especial mention14 schiller found a true friend in körner and made his house a home he parted his time between dresden and löschwitz near it where that gentleman resided it was here that don carlos the printing of which was meanwhile proceeding at leipzig received its completion and last corrections15 it was published in 1786      footnote 14 the wellwritten life prefixed to the     stuttgard and tübingen edition of schillers works is by     this körner the theodor körner whose lyre and sword     became afterwards famous was his son      footnote 15 in vol x of the vienna edition of schiller     are some ludicrous verses almost his sole attempt in the way     of drollery bearing a title equivalent to this to the     right honourable the board of washers the most humble     memorial of a downcast tragic poet at löschwitz of which     doering gives the following account the first part of don     carlos being already printed by göschen in leipzig the     poet pressed for the remainder felt himself obliged to stay     behind from an excursion which the körner family were making     in a fine autumn day unluckily the lady of the house     thinking schiller was to go along with them had locked all     her cupboards and the cellar schiller found himself without     meat or drink or even wood for fuel still farther     exasperated by the dabbling of some washermaids beneath his     window he produced these lines the poem is of the kind     which cannot be translated the first three stanzas are as     follows      die wäsche klatscht vor meiner thür         es plarrt die küchenzofe     und mich mich fuhrt das flügelthier         zu könig philips hofe      ich eile durch die gallerie         mit schnellem schritt belausche     dort die prinzessin eboli         im süssen liebesrausche      schon ruft das schöne weib triumph         schon hör ich—tod und hölle     was hör ich—einen nassen strumpf         geworfen in die welle  the story of don carlos seems peculiarly adapted for dramatists the spectacle of a royal youth condemned to death by his father of which happily our european annals furnish but another example is among the most tragical that can be figured the character of that youth the intermixture of bigotry and jealousy and love with the other strong passions which brought on his fate afford a combination of circumstances affecting in themselves and well calculated for the basis of deeply interesting fiction accordingly they have not been neglected carlos has often been the theme of poets particularly since the time when his history recorded by the abbé st réal was exposed in more brilliant colours to the inspection of every writer and almost of every reader  the abbé st réal was a dexterous artist in that halfillicit species of composition the historic novel in the course of his operations he lighted on these incidents and by fillingup according to his fancy what historians had only sketched to him by amplifying beautifying suppressing and arranging he worked the whole into a striking little narrative distinguished by all the symmetry the sparkling graces the vigorous description and keen thought which characterise his other writings this french sallust as his countrymen have named him has been of use to many dramatists his conjuraison contre venise furnished otway with the outline of his best tragedy epicaris has more than once appeared upon the stage and don carlos has been dramatised in almost all the languages of europe besides otways carlos so famous at its first appearance many tragedies on this subject have been written most of them are gathered to their final rest some are fast going thither two bid fair to last for ages schiller and alfieri have both drawn their plot from st réal the former has expanded and added the latter has compressed and abbreviated  schillers carlos is the first of his plays that bears the stamp of anything like full maturity the opportunities he had enjoyed for extending his knowledge of men and things the sedulous practice of the art of composition the study of purer models had not been without their full effect increase of years had done something for him diligence had done much more the ebullience of youth is now chastened into the steadfast energy of manhood the wild enthusiast that spurned at the errors of the world has now become the enlightened moralist that laments their necessity or endeavours to find out their remedy a corresponding alteration is visible in the external form of the work in its plot and diction the plot is contrived with great ingenuity embodying the result of much study both dramatic and historical the language is blank verse not prose as in the former works it is more careful and regular less ambitious in its object but more certain of attaining it schillers mind had now reached its full stature he felt and thought more justly he could better express what he felt and thought  the merit we noticed in fiesco the fidelity with which the scene of action is brought before us is observable to a still greater degree in don carlos the spanish court in the end of the sixteenth century its rigid cold formalities its cruel bigoted but proudspirited grandees its inquisitors and priests and philip its head the epitome at once of its good and its bad qualities in all his complex interests are exhibited with wonderful distinctness and address nor is it at the surface or the outward movements alone that we look we are taught the mechanism of their characters as well as shown it in action the stonyhearted despot himself must have been an object of peculiar study to the author narrow in his understanding dead in his affections from his birth the lord of europe philip has existed all his days above men not among them locked up within himself a stranger to every generous and kindly emotion his gloomy spirit has had no employment but to strengthen or increase its own elevation no pleasure but to gratify its own selfwill superstition harmonising with these native tendencies has added to their force but scarcely to their hatefulness it lends them a sort of sacredness in his own eyes and even a sort of horrid dignity in ours philip is not without a certain greatness the greatness of unlimited external power and of a will relentless in its dictates guided by principles false but consistent and unalterable the scene of his existence is haggard stern and desolate but it is all his own and he seems fitted for it we hate him and fear him but the poet has taken care to secure him from contempt  the contrast both of his fathers fortune and character are those of carlos few situations of a more affecting kind can be imagined than the situation of this young generous and illfated prince from boyhood his heart had been bent on mighty things he had looked upon the royal grandeur that awaited his maturer years only as the means of realising those projects for the good of men which his beneficent soul was ever busied with his fathers dispositions and the temper of the court which admitted no development of such ideas had given the charm of concealment to his feelings his life had been in prospect and we are the more attached to him that deserving to be glorious and happy he had but expected to be either bright days however seemed approaching shut out from the communion of the albas and domingos among whom he lived a stranger the communion of another and far dearer object was to be granted him elizabeths love seemed to make him independent even of the future which it painted with still richer hues but in a moment she is taken from him by the most terrible of all visitations his bride becomes his mother and the stroke that deprives him of her while it ruins him forever is more deadly because it cannot be complained of without sacrilege and cannot be altered by the power of fate itself carlos as the poet represents him calls forth our tenderest sympathies his soul seems once to have been rich and glorious like the garden of eden but the desertwind has passed over it and smitten it with perpetual blight despair has overshadowed all the fair visions of his youth or if he hopes it is but the gleam of delirium which something sterner than even duty extinguishes in the cold darkness of death his energy survives but to vent itself in wild gusts of reckless passion or aimless indignation there is a touching poignancy in his expression of the bitter melancholy that oppresses him in the fixedness of misery with which he looks upon the faded dreams of former years or the fierce ebullitions and dreary pauses of resolution which now prompts him to retrieve what he has lost now withers into powerlessness as nature and reason tell him that it cannot must not be retrieved  elizabeth no less moving and attractive is also depicted with masterly skill if she returns the passion of her amiable and once betrothed lover we but guess at the fact for so horrible a thought has never once been whispered to her own gentle and spotless mind yet her heart bleeds for carlos and we see that did not the most sacred feelings of humanity forbid her there is no sacrifice she would not make to restore his peace of mind by her soothing influence she strives to calm the agony of his spirit by her mild winning eloquence she would persuade him that for don carlos other objects must remain when his hopes of personal felicity have been cut off she would change his love for her into love for the millions of human beings whose destiny depends on his a meek vestal yet with the prudence of a queen and the courage of a matron with every graceful and generous quality of womanhood harmoniously blended in her nature she lives in a scene that is foreign to her the happiness she should have had is beside her the misery she must endure is around her yet she utters no regret gives way to no complaint but seeks to draw from duty itself a compensation for the cureless evil which duty has inflicted many tragic queens are more imposing and majestic than this elizabeth of schiller but there is none who rules over us with a sway so soft and feminine none whom we feel so much disposed to love as well as reverence  the virtues of elizabeth are heightened by comparison with the principles and actions of her attendant the princess eboli the character of eboli is full of pomp and profession magnanimity and devotedness are on her tongue some shadow of them even floats in her imagination but they are not rooted in her heart pride selfishness unlawful passion are the only inmates there her lofty boastings of generosity are soon forgotten when the success of her attachment to carlos becomes hopeless the fervour of a selfish love once extinguished in her bosom she regards the object of it with none but vulgar feelings virtue no longer according with interest she ceases to be virtuous from a rejected mistress the transition to a jealous spy is with her natural and easy yet we do not hate the princess there is a seductive warmth and grace about her character which makes us lament her vices rather than condemn them the poet has drawn her at once false and fair  in delineating eboli and philip schiller seems as if struggling against the current of his nature our feelings towards them are hardly so severe as he intended their words and deeds at least those of the latter are wicked and repulsive enough but we still have a kind of latent persuasion that they meant better than they spoke or acted with the marquis of posa he had a more genial task this posa we can easily perceive is the representative of schiller himself the ardent love of men which forms his ruling passion was likewise the constant feeling of his author the glowing eloquence with which he advocates the cause of truth and justice and humanity was such as schiller too would have employed in similar circumstances in some respects posa is the chief character of the piece there is a preëminent magnificence in his object and in the faculties and feelings with which he follows it of a splendid intellect and a daring devoted heart his powers are all combined upon a single purpose even his friendship for carlos grounded on the likeness of their minds and faithful as it is yet seems to merge in this paramount emotion zeal for the universal interests of man aiming with all his force of thought and action to advance the happiness and best rights of his fellowcreatures pursuing this noble aim with the skill and dignity which it deserves his mind is at once unwearied earnest and serene he is another carlos but somewhat older more experienced and never crossed in hopeless love there is a calm strength in posa which no accident of fortune can shake whether cheering the forlorn carlos into new activity whether lifting up his voice in the ear of tyrants and inquisitors or taking leave of life amid his vast unexecuted schemes there is the same sedate magnanimity the same fearless composure when the fatal bullet strikes him he dies with the concerns of others not his own upon his lips he is a reformer the perfection of reformers not a revolutionist but a prudent though determined improver his enthusiasm does not burst forth in violence but in manly and enlightened energy his eloquence is not more moving to the heart than his lofty philosophy is convincing to the head there is a majestic vastness of thought in his precepts which recommends them to the mind independently of the beauty of their dress few passages of poetry are more spiritstirring than his last message to carlos through the queen the certainty of death seems to surround his spirit with a kind of martyr glory he is kindled into transport and speaks with a commanding power the pathetic wisdom of the line tell him that when he is a man he must reverence the dreams of his youth has often been admired that scene has many such  the interview with philip is not less excellent there is something so striking in the idea of confronting the cold solitary tyrant with the only man in all his states that does not need him of raising the voice of true manhood for once within the gloomy chambers of thraldom and priestcraft that we can forgive the stretch of poetic license by which it is effected philip and posa are antipodes in all respects philip thinks his new instructor is a protestant a charge which posa rebuts with calm dignity his object not being separation and contention but union and peaceful gradual improvement posa seems to understand the character of philip better not attempting to awaken in his sterile heart any feeling for real glory or the interests of his fellowmen he attacks his selfishness and pride represents to him the intrinsic meanness and misery of a throne however decked with adventitious pomp if built on servitude and isolated from the sympathies and interests of others  we translate the entire scene though not by any means the best it is among the fittest for extraction of any in the piece posa has been sent for by the king and is waiting in a chamber of the palace to know what is required of him the king enters unperceived by posa whose attention is directed to a picture on the wall   act iii scene x  the king and marquis de posa  the latter on noticing the king advances towards him and kneels then rises and waits without any symptom of embarrassment  king looks at him with surprise       we have met before then  mar

my service no remonstrance i will have it so        had the character of posa been drawn ten years later it would have been imputed as all things are to the french revolution and schiller himself perhaps might have been called a jacobin happily as matters stand there is room for no such imputation it is pleasing to behold in posa the deliberate expression of a great and good mans sentiments on these everagitated subjects a noble monument embodying the liberal ideas of his age in a form beautified by his own genius and lasting as its other products16      footnote 16 jean paul nevertheless not without some show     of reason has compared this posa to the tower of a     lighthouse high farshining—empty note of 1845  connected with the superior excellence of posa critics have remarked a dramatic error which the author himself was the first to acknowledge and account for the magnitude of posa throws carlos into the shade the hero of the first three acts is no longer the hero of the other two the cause of this we are informed was that schiller kept the work too long upon his own hands  in composing the piece he observes many interruptions occurred so that a considerable time elapsed between beginning and concluding it and in the mean while much within myself had changed the various alterations which during this period my way of thinking and feeling underwent naturally told upon the work i was engaged with what parts of it had at first attracted me began to produce this effect in a weaker degree and in the end scarcely at all new ideas springing up in the interim displaced the former ones carlos himself had lost my favour perhaps for no other reason than because i had become his senior and from the opposite cause posa had occupied his place thus i commenced the fourth and fifth acts with quite an altered heart but the first three were already in the hands of the public the plan of the whole could not now be reformed nothing therefore remained but to suppress the piece entirely or to fit the second half to the first the best way i could  the imperfection alluded to is one of which the general reader will make no great account the second half is fitted to the first with address enough for his purposes intent not upon applying the dramatic gauge but on being moved and exalted we may peruse the tragedy without noticing that any such defect exists in it the pity and love we are first taught to feel for carlos abide with us to the last and though posa rises in importance as the piece proceeds our admiration of his transcendent virtues does not obstruct the gentler feelings with which we look upon the fate of his friend a certain confusion and crowding together of events about the end of the play is the only fault in its plan that strikes us with any force even this is scarcely prominent enough to be offensive  an intrinsic and weightier defect is the want of ease and lightness in the general composition of the piece a defect which all its other excellencies will not prevent us from observing there is action enough in the plot energy enough in the dialogue and abundance of individual beauties in both but there is throughout a certain air of stiffness and effort which abstracts from the theatrical illusion the language in general impressive and magnificent is now and then inflated into bombast the characters do not as it were verify their human nature by those thousand little touches and nameless turns which distinguish the genius essentially dramatic from the genius merely poetical the proteus of the stage from the philosophic observer and trained imitator of life we have not those careless felicities those varyings from high to low that air of living freedom which shakspeare has accustomed us like spoiled children to look for in every perfect work of this species schiller is too elevated too regular and sustained in his elevation to be altogether natural  yet with all this carlos is a noble tragedy there is a stately massiveness about the structure of it the incidents are grand and affecting the characters powerful vividly conceived and impressively if not completely delineated of wit and its kindred graces schiller has but a slender share nor among great poets is he much distinguished for depth or fineness of pathos but what gives him a place of his own and the loftiest of its kind is the vastness and intense vigour of his mind the splendour of his thoughts and imagery and the bold vehemence of his passion for the true and the sublime under all their various forms he does not thrill but he exalts us his genius is impetuous exuberant majestic and a heavenly fire gleams through all his creations he transports us into a holier and higher world than our own everything around us breathes of force and solemn beauty the looks of his heroes may be more staid than those of men the movements of their minds may be slower and more calculated but we yield to the potency of their endowments and the loveliness of the scene which they animate the enchantments of the poet are strong enough to silence our scepticism we forbear to inquire whether it is true or false  the celebrity of alfieri generally invites the reader of don carlos to compare it with filippo both writers treat the same subject both borrow their materials from the same source the nouvelle historique of st réal but it is impossible that two powerful minds could have handled one given idea in more diverse manners their excellencies are in fact so opposite that they scarcely come in competition alfieris play is short and the characters are few he describes no scene his personages are not the king of spain and his courtiers but merely men their place of action is not the escurial or madrid but a vacant objectless platform anywhere in space in all this schiller has a manifest advantage he paints manners and opinions he sets before us a striking pageant which interests us of itself and gives a new interest to whatever is combined with it the principles of the antique or perhaps rather of the french drama upon which alfieri worked permitted no such delineation in the style there is the same diversity a severe simplicity uniformly marks alfieris style in his whole tragedy there is not a single figure a hard emphatic brevity is all that distinguishes his language from that of prose schiller we have seen abounds with noble metaphors and all the warm exciting eloquence of poetry it is only in expressing the character of philip that alfieri has a clear superiority without the aid of superstition which his rival especially in the catastrophe employs to such advantage alfieri has exhibited in his filippo a picture of unequalled power obscurity is justly said to be essential to terror and sublimity and schiller has enfeebled the effect of his tyrant by letting us behold the most secret recesses of his spirit we understand him better but we fear him less alfieri does not show us the internal combination of filippo it is from its workings alone that we judge of his nature mystery and the shadow of horrid cruelty brood over his filippo it is only a transient word or act that gives us here and there a glimpse of his fierce implacable tremendous soul a short and dubious glimmer that reveals to us the abysses of his being dark lurid and terrific as the throat of the infernal pool alfieris filippo is perhaps the most wicked man that human imagination has conceived  alfieri and schiller were again unconscious competitors in the history of mary stuart but the works before us give a truer specimen of their comparative merits schiller seems to have the greater genius alfieri the more commanding character alfieris greatness rests on the stern concentration of fiery passion under the dominion of an adamantine will this was his own make of mind and he represents it with strokes in themselves devoid of charm but in their union terrible as a prophetic scroll schillers moral force is commensurate with his intellectual gifts and nothing more the mind of the one is like the ocean beautiful in its strength smiling in the radiance of summer and washing luxuriant and romantic shores that of the other is like some black unfathomable lake placed far amid the melancholy mountains bleak solitary desolate but girdled with grim skypiercing cliffs overshadowed with storms and illuminated only by the red glare of the lightning schiller is magnificent in his expansion alfieri is overpowering in his condensed energy the first inspires us with greater admiration the last with greater awe   this tragedy of carlos was received with immediate and universal approbation in the closet and on the stage it excited the warmest applauses equally among the learned and unlearned schillers expectations had not been so high he knew both the excellencies and the faults of his work but he had not anticipated that the former would be recognised so instantaneously the pleasure of this new celebrity came upon him therefore heightened by surprise had dramatic eminence been his sole object he might now have slackened his exertions the public had already ranked him as the first of their writers in that favourite department but this limited ambition was not his moving principle nor was his mind of that sort for which rest is provided in this world the primary disposition of his nature urged him to perpetual toil the great aim of his life the unfolding of his mental powers was one of those which admit but a relative not an absolute progress new ideas of perfection arise as the former have been reached the student is always attaining never has attained  schillers worldly circumstances too were of a kind well calculated to prevent excess of quietism he was still drifting at large on the tide of life he was crowned with laurels but without a home his heart warm and affectionate fitted to enjoy the domestic blessings which it longed for was allowed to form no permanent attachment he felt that he was unconnected solitary in the world cut off from the exercise of his kindlier sympathies or if tasting such pleasures it was snatching them rather than partaking of them calmly the vulgar desire of wealth and station never entered his mind for an instant but as years were added to his age the delights of peace and continuous comfort were fast becoming more acceptable than any other and he looked with anxiety to have a restingplace amid his wanderings to be a man among his fellowmen  for all these wishes schiller saw that the only chance of fulfilment depended on unwearied perseverance in his literary occupations yet though his activity was unabated and the calls on it were increasing rather than diminished its direction was gradually changing the drama had long been stationary and of late been falling in his estimation the difficulties of the art as he viewed it at present had been overcome and new conquests invited him in other quarters the latter part of carlos he had written as a task rather than a pleasure he contemplated no farther undertaking connected with the stage for a time indeed he seems to have wavered among a multiplicity of enterprises now solicited to this and now to that without being able to fix decidedly on any the restless ardour of his mind is evinced by the number and variety of his attempts its fluctuation by the circumstance that all of them are either short in extent or left in the state of fragments of the former kind are his lyrical productions many of which were composed about this period during intervals from more serious labours the character of these performances is such as his former writings gave us reason to expect with a deep insight into life and a keen and comprehensive sympathy with its sorrows and enjoyments there is combined that impetuosity of feeling that pomp of thought and imagery which belong peculiarly to schiller if he had now left the drama it was clear that his mind was still overflowing with the elements of poetry dwelling among the grandest conceptions and the boldest or finest emotions thinking intensely and profoundly but decorating its thoughts with those graces which other faculties than the understanding are required to afford them with these smaller pieces schiller occupied himself at intervals of leisure throughout the remainder of his life some of them are to be classed among the most finished efforts of his genius the walk the song of the bell contain exquisite delineations of the fortunes and history of man his ritter toggenburg his cranes of ibycus his hero and leander are among the most poetical and moving ballads to be found in any language  of these poems the most noted written about this time the freethinking of passion freigeisterei der leidenschaft is said to have originated in a real attachment the lady whom some biographers of schiller introduce to us by the mysterious designation of the fräulein a    one of the first beauties in dresden seems to have made a deep impression on the heart of the poet they tell us that she sat for the picture of the princess eboli in his don carlos that he paid his court to her with the most impassioned fervour and the extreme of generosity they add one or two anecdotes of dubious authenticity which as they illustrate nothing but show us only that love could make schiller crazy as it is said to make all gods and men we shall use the freedom to omit  this enchanting and not inexorable spinster perhaps displaced the mannheim laura from her throne but the gallant assiduities which she required or allowed seem not to have abated the zeal of her admirer in his more profitable undertakings her reign we suppose was brief and without abiding influence schiller never wrote or thought with greater diligence than while at dresden partially occupied with conducting his thalia or with those more slight poetical performances his mind was hovering among a multitude of weightier plans and seizing with avidity any hint that might assist in directing its attempts to this state of feeling we are probably indebted for the geisterseher a novel naturalised in our circulating libraries by the title of the ghostseer two volumes of which were published about this time the king of quacks the renowned cagliostro was now playing his dextrous game at paris harrowingup the souls of the curious and gullible of all ranks in that capital by various thaumaturgic feats raising the dead from their graves and what was more to the purpose raising himself from the station of a poor sicilian lacquey to that of a sumptuous and extravagant count the noise of his exploits appears to have given rise to this work of schillers it is an attempt to exemplify the process of hoodwinking an acute but too sensitive man of working on the latent germ of superstition which exists beneath his outward scepticism harassing his mind by the terrors of magic—the magic of chemistry and natural philosophy and natural cunning till racked by doubts and agonising fears and plunging from one depth of dark uncertainty into another he is driven at length to still his scruples in the bosom of the infallible church the incidents are contrived with considerable address displaying a familiar acquaintance not only with several branches of science but also with some curious forms of life and human nature one or two characters are forcibly drawn particularly that of the amiable but feeble count the victim of the operation the strange foreigner with the visage of stone who conducts the business of mystification strikes us also though we see but little of him the work contains some vivid description some passages of deep tragical effect it has a vein of keen observation in general a certain rugged power which might excite regret that it was never finished but schiller found that his views had been mistaken it was thought that he meant only to electrify his readers by an accumulation of surprising horrors in a novel of the mrs radcliffe fashion he felt in consequence discouraged to proceed and finally abandoned it  schiller was in fact growing tired of fictitious writing imagination was with him a strong not an exclusive perhaps not even a predominating faculty in the sublimest flights of his genius intellect is a quality as conspicuous as any other we are frequently not more delighted with the grandeur of the drapery in which he clothes his thoughts than with the grandeur of the thoughts themselves to a mind so restless the cultivation of all its powers was a peremptory want in one so earnest the love of truth was sure to be among its strongest passions even while revelling with unworn ardour in the dreamy scenes of the imagination he had often cast a longing look and sometimes made a hurried inroad into the calmer provinces of reason but the first effervescence of youth was past and now more than ever the love of contemplating or painting things as they should be began to yield to the love of knowing things as they are the tendency of his mind was gradually changing he was about to enter on a new field of enterprise where new triumphs awaited him  for a time he had hesitated what to choose at length he began to think of history as a leading object of pursuit this promised him peculiar advantages it was new to him and fitted to employ some of his most valuable gifts it was grounded on reality for which as we have said his taste was now becoming stronger its mighty revolutions and events and the commanding characters that figure in it would likewise present him with things great and moving for which his taste had always been strong as recording the past transactions and indicating the prospects of nations it could not fail to be delightful to one for whom not only human nature was a matter of most fascinating speculation but who looked on all mankind with the sentiments of a brother feeling truly what he often said that he had no dearer wish than to see every living mortal happy and contented with his lot to all these advantages another of a humbler sort was added but which the nature of his situation forbade him to lose sight of the study of history while it afforded him a subject of continuous and regular exertion would also afford him what was even more essential the necessary competence of income for which he felt reluctant any longer to depend on the resources of poetry but which the produce of his pen was now the only means he had of realising  for these reasons he decided on commencing the business of historian the composition of don carlos had already led him to investigate the state of spain under philip ii and being little satisfied with watsons clear but shallow work on that reign he had turned to the original sources of information the writings of grotius strada de thou and many others investigating these with his usual fidelity and eagerness the revolt of the netherlands had by degrees become familiar to his thoughts distinct in many parts where it was previously obscure and attractive as it naturally must be to a temper such as his he now determined that his first historical performance should be a narrative of that event he resolved to explore the minutest circumstance of its rise and progress to arrange the materials he might collect in a more philosophical order to interweave with them the general opinions he had formed or was forming on many points of polity and national or individual character and if possible to animate the whole with that warm sympathy which in a lover of freedom this most glorious of her triumphs naturally called forth  in the fillingup of such an outline there was scope enough for diligence but it was not in schillers nature to content himself with ordinary efforts no sooner did a project take hold of his mind than rallying round it all his accomplishments and capabilities he stretched it out into something so magnificent and comprehensive that little less than a lifetime would have been sufficient to effect it this history of the revolt of the netherlands which formed his chief study he looked upon but as one branch of the great subject he was yet destined to engage with history at large in all its bearings was now his final aim and his mind was continually occupied with plans for acquiring improving and diffusing the knowledge of it  of these plans many never reached a describable shape very few reached even partial execution one of the latter sort was an intended history of the most remarkable conspiracies and revolutions in the middle and later ages a first volume of the work was published in 1787 schillers part in it was trifling scarcely more than that of a translator and editor st réals conspiracy of bedmar against venice here furnished with an extended introduction is the best piece in the book indeed st réal seems first to have set him on this task the abbé had already signified his predilection for plots and revolutions and given a fine sample of his powers in treating such matters what schiller did was to expand this idea and communicate a systematic form to it his work might have been curious and valuable had it been completed but the pressure of other engagements the necessity of limiting his views to the netherlands prevented this for the present it was afterwards forgotten and never carried farther   such were schillers occupations while at dresden their extent and variety are proof enough that idleness was not among his vices it was in truth the opposite extreme in which he erred he wrote and thought with an impetuosity beyond what nature always could endure his intolerance of interruptions first put him on the plan of studying by night an alluring but pernicious practice which began at dresden and was never afterwards forsaken his recreations breathed a similar spirit he loved to be much alone and strongly moved the banks of the elbe were the favourite resort of his mornings here wandering in solitude amid groves and lawns and green and beautiful places he abandoned his mind to delicious musings watched the fitful current of his thoughts as they came sweeping through his soul in their vague fantastic gorgeous forms pleased himself with the transient images of memory and hope or meditated on the cares and studies which had lately been employing and were again soon to employ him at times he might be seen floating on the river in a gondola feasting himself with the loveliness of earth and sky he delighted most to be there when tempests were abroad his unquiet spirit found a solace in the expression of his own unrest on the face of nature danger lent a charm to his situation he felt in harmony with the scene when the rack was sweeping stormfully across the heavens and the forests were sounding in the breeze and the river was rolling its chafed waters into wild eddying heaps  yet before the darkness summoned him exclusively to his tasks schiller commonly devoted a portion of his day to the pleasures of society could he have found enjoyment in the flatteries of admiring hospitality his present fame would have procured them for him in abundance but these things were not to schillers taste his opinion of the fleshflies of leipzig we have already seen he retained the same sentiments throughout all his life the idea of being what we call a lion is offensive enough to any man of not more than common vanity or less than common understanding it was doubly offensive to him his pride and his modesty alike forbade it the delicacy of his nature aggravated into shyness by his education and his habits rendered situations of display more than usually painful to him the digito prætereuntium was a sort of celebration he was far from coveting in the circles of fashion he appeared unwillingly and seldom to advantage their glitter and parade were foreign to his disposition their strict ceremonial cramped the play of his mind hemmed in as by invisible fences among the intricate barriers of etiquette so feeble so inviolable he felt constrained and helpless alternately chagrined and indignant it was the giant among pigmies gulliver in lilliput tied down by a thousand packthreads but there were more congenial minds with whom he could associate more familiar scenes in which he found the pleasures he was seeking here schiller was himself frank unembarrassed pliant to the humour of the hour his conversation was delightful abounding at once in rare and simple charms besides the intellectual riches which it carried with it there was that flow of kindliness and unaffected good humour which can render dulness itself agreeable schiller had many friends in dresden who loved him as a man while they admired him as a writer their intercourse was of the kind he liked sober as well as free and mirthful it was the careless calm honest effusion of his feelings that he wanted not the noisy tumults and coarse delirium of dissipation for this under any of its forms he at no time showed the smallest relish  a visit to weimar had long been one of schillers projects he now first accomplished it in 1787 saxony had been for ages the attica of germany and weimar had of late become its athens in this literary city schiller found what he expected sympathy and brotherhood with men of kindred minds to goethe he was not introduced17 but herder and wieland received him with a cordial welcome with the latter he soon formed a most friendly intimacy wieland the nestor of german letters was grown gray in the service schiller reverenced him as a father and he was treated by him as a son we shall have bright hours he said wieland is still young when he loves wieland had long edited the deutsche mercur in consequence of their connexion schiller now took part in contributing to that work some of his smaller poems one or two fragments of the history of the netherlands and the letters on don carlos first appeared here his own thalia still continued to come out at leipzig with these for his incidental employments with the belgian revolt for his chief study and the best society in germany for his leisure schiller felt no wish to leave weimar the place and what it held contented him so much that he thought of selecting it for his permanent abode you know the men he writes of whom germany is proud a herder a wieland with their brethren and one wall now encloses me and them what excellencies are in weimar in this city at least in this territory i mean to settle for life and at length once more to get a country      footnote 17 doering says goethe was at this time absent     in italy an error as will by and by appear  so occupied and so intentioned he continued to reside at weimar some months after his arrival he received an invitation from his early patroness and kind protectress madam von wolzogen to come and visit her at bauerbach schiller went accordingly to this his ancient city of refuge he again found all the warm hospitality which he had of old experienced when its character could less be mistaken but his excursion thither produced more lasting effects than this at rudolstadt where he stayed for a time on occasion of this journey he met with a new friend it was here that he first saw the fräulein lengefeld a lady whose attractions made him loth to leave rudolstadt and eager to return  next year he did return he lived from may till november there or in the neighbourhood he was busy as usual and he visited the lengefeld family almost every day schillers views on marriage his longing for a civic and domestic existence we already know to be united with a person he had said that shares our sorrows and our joys that responds to our feelings that moulds herself so pliantly so closely to our humours reposing on her calm and warm affection to relax our spirit from a thousand distractions a thousand wild wishes and tumultuous passions to dream away all the bitterness of fortune in the bosom of domestic enjoyment this the true delight of life some years had elapsed since he expressed these sentiments which time had confirmed not weakened the presence of the fräulein lengefeld awoke them into fresh activity he loved this lady the return of love with which she honoured him diffused a sunshine over all his troubled world and if the wish of being hers excited more impatient thoughts about the settlement of his condition it also gave him fresh strength to attain it he was full of occupation while in rudolstadt ardent serious but not unhappy his literary projects were proceeding as before and besides the enjoyment of virtuous love he had that of intercourse with many worthy and some kindred minds  among these the chief in all respects was goethe it was during his present visit that schiller first met with this illustrious person concerning whom both by reading and report his expectations had been raised so high no two men both of exalted genius could be possessed of more different sorts of excellence than the two that were now brought together in a large company of their mutual friends the english reader may form some approximate conception of the contrast by figuring an interview between shakspeare and milton how gifted how diverse in their gifts the mind of the one plays calmly in its capricious and inimitable graces over all the provinces of human interest the other concentrates powers as vast but far less various on a few subjects the one is catholic the other is sectarian the first is endowed with an allcomprehending spirit skilled as if by personal experience in all the modes of human passion and opinion therefore tolerant of all peaceful collected fighting for no class of men or principles rather looking on the world and the various battles waging in it with the quiet eye of one already reconciled to the futility of their issues but pouring over all the forms of manycoloured life the light of a deep and subtle intellect and the decorations of an overflowing fancy and allowing men and things of every shape and hue to have their own free scope in his conception as they have it in the world where providence has placed them the other is earnest devoted struggling with a thousand mighty projects of improvement feeling more intensely as he feels more narrowly rejecting vehemently choosing vehemently at war with the one half of things in love with the other half hence dissatisfied impetuous without internal rest and scarcely conceiving the possibility of such a state apart from the difference of their opinions and mental culture shakspeare and milton seem to have stood in some such relation as this to each other in regard to the primary structure of their minds so likewise in many points was it with goethe and schiller the external circumstances of the two were moreover such as to augment their several peculiarities goethe was in his thirtyninth year and had long since found his proper rank and settlement in life schiller was ten years younger and still without a fixed destiny on both of which accounts his fundamental scheme of thought the principles by which he judged and acted and maintained his individuality although they might be settled were less likely to be sobered and matured in these circumstances we can hardly wonder that on schillers part the first impression was not very pleasant goethe sat talking of italy and art and travelling and a thousand other subjects with that flow of brilliant and deep sense sarcastic humour knowledge fancy and good nature which is said to render him the best talker now alive18 schiller looked at him in quite a different mood he felt his natural constraint increased under the influence of a man so opposite in character so potent in resources so singular and so expert in using them a man whom he could not agree with and knew not how to contradict soon after their interview he thus writes  on the whole this personal meeting has not at all diminished the idea great as it was which i had previously formed of goethe but i doubt whether we shall ever come into any close communication with each other much that still interests me has already had its epoch with him his whole nature is from its very origin otherwise constructed than mine his world is not my world our modes of conceiving things appear to be essentially different from such a combination no secure substantial intimacy can result time will try      footnote 18 1825  the aid of time was not in fact unnecessary on the part of goethe there existed prepossessions no less hostile and derived from sources older and deeper than the present transitory meeting to the discontents of which they probably contributed he himself has lately stated them with his accustomed frankness and good humour in a paper part of which some readers may peruse with an interest more than merely biographical  on my return from italy he says where i had been endeavouring to train myself to greater purity and precision in all departments of art not heeding what meanwhile was going on in germany i found here some older and some more recent works of poetry enjoying high esteem and wide circulation while unhappily their character to me was utterly offensive i shall only mention heinses ardinghello and schillers robbers the first i hated for its having undertaken to exhibit sensuality and mystical abstruseness ennobled and supported by creative art the last because in it the very paradoxes moral and dramatic from which i was struggling to get liberated had been laid hold of by a powerful though an immature genius and poured in a boundless rushing flood over all our country  neither of these gifted individuals did i blame for what he had performed or purposed it is the nature and the privilege of every mortal to attempt working in his own peculiar way he attempts it first without culture scarcely with the consciousness of what he is about and continues it with consciousness increasing as his culture increases whereby it happens that so many exquisite and so many paltry things are to be found circulating in the world and one perplexity is seen to rise from the ashes of another  but the rumour which these strange productions had excited over germany the approbation paid to them by every class of persons from the wild student to the polished courtlady frightened me for i now thought all my labour was to prove in vain the objects and the way of handling them to which i had been exercising all my powers appeared as if defaced and set aside and what grieved me still more was that all the friends connected with me heinrich meyer and moritz as well as their fellowartists tischbein and bury seemed in danger of the like contagion i was much hurt had it been possible i would have abandoned the study of creative art and the practice of poetry altogether for where was the prospect of surpassing those performances of genial worth and wild form in the qualities which recommended them conceive my situation it had been my object and my task to cherish and impart the purest exhibitions of poetic art and here was i hemmed in between ardinghello and franz von moor  it happened also about this time that moritz returned from italy and stayed with me awhile during which he violently confirmed himself and me in these persuasions i avoided schiller who was now at weimar in my neighbourhood the appearance of don carlos was not calculated to approximate us the attempts of our common friends i resisted and thus we still continued to go on our way apart  by degrees however both parties found that they had been mistaken the course of accidents brought many things to light which had been hidden the true character of each became unfolded more and more completely to the other and the cold measured tribute of respect was on both sides animated and exalted by feelings of kindness and ultimately of affection ere long schiller had by gratifying proofs discovered that this goethe was a very worthy man and goethe in his love of genius and zeal for the interests of literature was performing for schiller the essential duties of a friend even while his personal repugnance continued unabated  a strict similarity of characters is not necessary or perhaps very favourable to friendship to render it complete each party must no doubt be competent to understand the other both must be possessed of dispositions kindred in their great lineaments but the pleasure of comparing our ideas and emotions is heightened when there is likeness in unlikeness the same sentiments different opinions rousseau conceives to be the best material of friendship reciprocity of kind words and actions is more effectual than all luther loved melancthon johnson was not more the friend of edmund burke than of poor old dr levitt goethe and schiller met again as they ultimately came to live together and to see each other oftener they liked each other better they became associates friends and the harmony of their intercourse strengthened by many subsequent communities of object was never interrupted till death put an end to it goethe in his time has done many glorious things but few on which he should look back with greater pleasure than his treatment of schiller literary friendships are said to be precarious and of rare occurrence the rivalry of interest disturbs their continuance a rivalry greater where the subject of competition is one so vague impalpable and fluctuating as the favour of the public where the feeling to be gratified is one so nearly allied to vanity the most irritable arid and selfish feeling of the human heart had goethes prime motive been the love of fame he must have viewed with repugnance not the misdirection but the talents of the rising genius advancing with such rapid strides to dispute with him the palm of intellectual primacy nay as the million thought already in possession of it and if a sense of his own dignity had withheld him from offering obstructions or uttering any whisper of discontent there is none but a truly patrician spirit that would cordially have offered aid to being secretly hostile and openly indifferent the next resource was to enact the patron to solace vanity by helping the rival whom he could not hinder and who could do without his help goethe adopted neither of these plans it reflects much credit on him that he acted as he did eager to forward schillers views by exerting all the influence within his power he succeeded in effecting this and what was still more difficult in suffering the character of benefactor to merge in that of equal they became not friends only but fellowlabourers a connection productive of important consequences in the history of both particularly of the younger and more undirected of the two   meanwhile the history of the revolt of the united netherlands was in part before the world the first volume came out in 1788 schillers former writings had given proofs of powers so great and various such an extent of general intellectual strength and so deep an acquaintance both practical and scientific with the art of composition that in a subject like history no ordinary work was to be looked for from his hands with diligence in accumulating materials and patient care in elaborating them he could scarcely fail to attain distinguished excellence the present volume was well calculated to fulfil such expectations the revolt of the netherlands possesses all the common requisites of a good history and many which are in some degree peculiar to itself the information it conveys is minute and copious we have all the circumstances of the case remote and near set distinctly before us yet such is the skill of the arrangement these are at once briefly and impressively presented the work is not stretched out into a continuous narrative but gathered up into masses which are successively exhibited to view the minor facts being grouped around some leading one to which as to the central object our attention is chiefly directed this method of combining the details of events of proceeding as it were per saltum from eminence to eminence and thence surveying the surrounding scene is undoubtedly the most philosophical of any but few men are equal to the task of effecting it rightly it must be executed by a mind able to look on all its facts at once to disentangle their perplexities referring each to its proper head and to choose often with extreme address the station from which the reader is to view them without this or with this inadequately done a work on such a plan would be intolerable schiller has accomplished it in great perfection the whole scene of affairs was evidently clear before his own eye and he did not want expertness to discriminate and seize its distinctive features the bond of cause and consequence he never loses sight of and over each successive portion of his narrative he pours that flood of intellectual and imaginative brilliancy which all his prior writings had displayed his reflections expressed or implied are the fruit of strong comprehensive penetrating thought his descriptions are vivid his characters are studied with a keen sagacity and set before us in their most striking points of view those of egmont and orange occur to every reader as a rare union of perspicacity and eloquence the work has a look of order of beauty joined to calm reposing force had it been completed it might have ranked as the very best of schillers prose compositions but no second volume ever came to light and the first concludes at the entrance of alba into brussels two fragments alone the siege of antwerp and the passage of albas army both living pictures show us still farther what he might have done had he proceeded the surpassing and often highlypicturesque movements of this war the devotedness of the dutch their heroic achievement of liberty were not destined to be painted by the glowing pen of schiller whose heart and mind were alike so qualified to do them justice19      footnote 19 if we mistake not madame de staël in her     révolution française had this performance of schillers in     her eye her work is constructed on a similar though a rather     looser plan of arrangement the execution of it bears the     same relation to that of schiller it is less irregular more     ambitious in its rhetoric inferior in precision though     often not in force of thought and imagery  the accession of reputation which this work procured its author was not the only or the principal advantage he derived from it eichhorn professor of history was at this time about to leave the university of jena goethe had already introduced his new acquaintance schiller to the special notice of amelia the accomplished regent of sachsenweimar he now joined with voigt the head chaplain of the court in soliciting the vacant chair for him seconded by the general voice and the persuasion of the princess herself he succeeded schiller was appointed professor at jena he went thither in 1789   with schillers removal to jena begins a new epoch in his public and private life his connexion with goethe here first ripened into friendship and became secured and cemented by frequency of intercourse20 jena is but a few miles distant from weimar and the two friends both settled in public offices belonging to the same government had daily opportunities of interchanging visits schillers wanderings were now concluded with a heart tired of so fluctuating an existence but not despoiled of its capacity for relishing a calmer one with a mind experienced by much and varied intercourse with men full of knowledge and of plans to turn it to account he could now repose himself in the haven of domestic comforts and look forward to days of more unbroken exertion and more wholesome and permanent enjoyment than hitherto had fallen to his lot in the february following his settlement at jena he obtained the hand of fräulein lengefeld a happiness with the prospect of which he had long associated all the pleasures which he hoped for from the future a few months after this event he thus expresses himself in writing to a friend  life is quite a different thing by the side of a beloved wife than so forsaken and alone even in summer beautiful nature i now for the first time fully enjoy it live in it the world again clothes itself around me in poetic forms old feelings are again awakening in my breast what a life i am leading here i look with a glad mind around me my heart finds a perennial contentment without it my spirit so fine so refreshing a nourishment my existence is settled in harmonious composure not strained and impassioned but peaceful and clear i look to my future destiny with a cheerful heart now when standing at the wishedfor goal i wonder with myself how it all has happened so far beyond my expectations fate has conquered the difficulties for me it has i may say forced me to the mark from the future i expect everything a few years and i shall live in the full enjoyment of my spirit nay i think my very youth will be renewed an inward poetic life will give it me again      footnote 20 the obstacles to their union have already been     described in the words of goethe the steps by which these     were surmounted are described by him in the same paper with     equal minuteness and effect it is interesting but cannot be     inserted here see appendix i no 3  to what extent these smiling hopes were realised will be seen in the next and concluding part of this biography                                    part iii                 from his settlement at jena to his death                               17901805                                   part third                               17901805   the duties of his new office naturally called upon schiller to devote himself with double zeal to history a subject which from choice he had already entered on with so much eagerness in the study of it we have seen above how his strongest faculties and tastes were exercised and gratified and new opportunities were now combined with new motives for persisting in his efforts concerning the plan or the success of his academical prelections we have scarcely any notice in his class it is said he used most frequently to speak extempore and his delivery was not distinguished by fluency or grace a circumstance to be imputed to the agitation of a public appearance for as woltmann assures us the beauty the elegance ease and true instructiveness with which he could continuously express himself in private were acknowledged and admired by all his friends his matter we suppose would make amends for these deficiencies of manner to judge from his introductory lecture preserved in his works with the title what is universal history and with what views should it be studied there perhaps has never been in europe another course of history sketched out on principles so magnificent and philosophical21 but college exercises were far from being his ultimate object nor did he rest satisfied with mere visions of perfection the compass of the outline he had traced for a proper historian was scarcely greater than the assiduity with which he strove to fill it up his letters breathe a spirit not only of diligence but of ardour he seems intent with all his strength upon this fresh pursuit and delighted with the vast prospects of untouched and attractive speculation which were opening around him on every side he professed himself to be exceedingly contented with his business his ideas on the nature of it were acquiring both extension and distinctness and every moment of his leisure was employed in reducing them to practice he was now busied with the history of the thirtyyears war      footnote 21 the paper entitled hints on the origin of     human society as indicated in the mosaic records the     mission of moses the laws of solon and lycurgus are     pieces of the very highest order full of strength and     beauty delicious to the lovers of that plastic philosophy     which employs itself in giving form and life to the dry     bones of those antique events that lie before us so     inexplicable in the brief and enigmatic pages of their     chroniclers the glance over europe at the period of the     first crusade the times of the emperor frederick i the     troubles in france are also masterly sketches in a     simpler and more common style  this work which appeared in 1791 is considered by the german critics as his chief performance in this department of literature the revolt of the netherlands the only one which could have vied with it never was completed otherwise in our opinion it might have been superior either of the two would have sufficed to secure for schiller a distinguished rank among historians of the class denominated philosophical though even both together they afford but a feeble exemplification of the ideas which he entertained on the manner of composing history in his view the business of history is not merely to record but to interpret it involves not only a clear conception and a lively exposition of events and characters but a sound enlightened theory of individual and national morality a general philosophy of human life whereby to judge of them and measure their effects the historian now stands on higher ground takes in a wider range than those that went before him he can now survey vast tracts of human action and deduce its laws from an experience extending over many climes and ages with his ideas moreover his feelings ought to be enlarged he should regard the interests not of any sect or state but of mankind the progress not of any class of arts or opinions but of universal happiness and refinement his narrative in short should be moulded according to the science and impregnated with the liberal spirit of his time  voltaire is generally conceived to have invented and introduced a new method of composing history the chief historians that have followed him have been by way of eminence denominated philosophical this is hardly correct voltaire wrote history with greater talent but scarcely with a new species of talent he applied the ideas of the eighteenth century to the subject but in this there was nothing radically new in the hands of a thinking writer history has always been philosophy teaching by experience that is such philosophy as the age of the historian has afforded for a greek or roman it was natural to look upon events with an eye to their effect on his own city or country and to try them by a code of principles in which the prosperity or extension of this formed a leading object for a monkish chronicler it was natural to estimate the progress of affairs by the number of abbeys founded the virtue of men by the sumtotal of donations to the clergy and for a thinker of the present day it is equally natural to measure the occurrences of history by quite a different standard by their influence upon the general destiny of man their tendency to obstruct or to forward him in his advancement towards liberty knowledge true religion and dignity of mind each of these narrators simply measures by the scale which is considered for the time as expressing the great concerns and duties of humanity  schillers views on this matter were as might have been expected of the most enlarged kind it seems to me said he in one of his letters that in writing history for the moderns we should try to communicate to it such an interest as the history of the peloponnesian war had for the greeks now this is the problem to choose and arrange your materials so that to interest they shall not need the aid of decoration we moderns have a source of interest at our disposal which no greek or roman was acquainted with and which the patriotic interest does not nearly equal this last in general is chiefly of importance for unripe nations for the youth of the world but we may excite a very different sort of interest if we represent each remarkable occurrence that happened to men as of importance to man it is a poor and little aim to write for one nation a philosophic spirit cannot tolerate such limits cannot bound its views to a form of human nature so arbitrary fluctuating accidental the most powerful nation is but a fragment and thinking minds will not grow warm on its account except in so far as this nation or its fortunes have been influential on the progress of the species  that there is not some excess in this comprehensive cosmopolitan philosophy may perhaps be liable to question nature herself has wisely no doubt partitioned us into kindreds and nations and tongues it is among our instincts to grow warm in behalf of our country simply for its own sake and the business of reason seems to be to chasten and direct our instincts never to destroy them we require individuality in our attachments the sympathy which is expanded over all men will commonly be found so much attenuated by the process that it cannot be effective on any and as it is in nature so it is in art which ought to be the image of it universal philanthropy forms but a precarious and very powerless rule of conduct and the progress of the species will turn out equally unfitted for deeply exciting the imagination it is not with freedom that we can sympathise but with free men there ought indeed to be in history a spirit superior to petty distinctions and vulgar partialities our particular affections ought to be enlightened and purified but they should not be abandoned or such is the condition of humanity our feelings must evaporate and fade away in that extreme diffusion perhaps in a certain sense the surest mode of pleasing and instructing all nations is to write for one  this too schiller was aware of and had in part attended to besides the thirtyyears war is a subject in which nationality of feeling may be even wholly spared better than in almost any other it is not a german but a european subject it forms the concluding portion of the reformation and this is an event belonging not to any country in particular but to the human race yet if we mistake not this overtendency to generalisation both in thought and sentiment has rather hurt the present work the philosophy with which it is embued now and then grows vague from its abstractness ineffectual from its refinement the enthusiasm which pervades it elevated strong enlightened would have told better on our hearts had it been confined within a narrower space and directed to a more specific class of objects in his extreme attention to the philosophical aspects of the period schiller has neglected to take advantage of many interesting circumstances which it offered under other points of view the thirtyyears war abounds with what may be called picturesqueness in its events and still more in the condition of the people who carried it on hartes history of gustavus a wilderness which mere human patience seems unable to explore is yet enlivened here and there with a cheerful spot when he tells us of some scalade or camisado or speculates on troopers rendered bulletproof by artmagic his chaotic records have in fact afforded to our novelist the raw materials of dugald dalgetty a cavalier of the most singular equipment of character and manners which for many reasons merit study and description to much of this though as he afterwards proved it was well known to him schiller paid comparatively small attention his work has lost in liveliness by the omission more than it has gained in dignity or instructiveness  yet with all its imperfections this is no ordinary history the speculation it is true is not always of the kind we wish it excludes more moving or enlivening topics and sometimes savours of the inexperienced theorist who had passed his days remote from practical statesmen the subject has not sufficient unity in spite of every effort it breaks into fragments towards the conclusion but still there is an energy a vigorous beauty in the work which far more than redeems its failings great thoughts at every turn arrest our attention and make us pause to confirm or contradict them happy metaphors22 some vivid descriptions of events and men remind us of the author of fiesco and don carlos the characters of gustavus and wallenstein are finely developed in the course of the narrative tillys passage of the lech the battles of leipzig and lützen figure in our recollection as if our eyes had witnessed them the death of gustavus is described in terms which might draw iron tears from the eyes of veterans23 if schiller had inclined to dwell upon the mere visual or imaginative department of his subject no man could have painted it more graphically or better called forth our emotions sympathetic or romantic but this we have seen was not by any means his leading aim      footnote 22 yet we scarcely meet with one so happy as that     in the revolt of the netherlands where he finishes his     picture of the gloomy silence and dismay that reigned in     brussels on the first entrance of alba by this striking     simile now that the city had received the spanish general     within its walls it had the air as of a man that has drunk a     cup of poison and with shuddering expectation watches every     moment for its deadly agency      footnote 23 see appendix i no 4  on the whole the present work is still the best historical performance which germany can boast of müllers histories are distinguished by merits of another sort by condensing in a given space and frequently in lucid order a quantity of information copious and authentic beyond example but as intellectual productions they cannot rank with schillers woltmann of berlin has added to the thirtyyears war another work of equal size by way of continuation entitled history of the peace of munster with the first negotiations of which treaty the former concludes woltmann is a person of ability but we dare not say of him what wieland said of schiller that by his first historical attempt he has discovered a decided capability of rising to a level with hume robertson and gibbon he will rather rise to a level with belsham or smollett   this first complete specimen of schillers art in the historical department though but a small fraction of what he meant to do and could have done proved in fact to be the last he ever undertook at present very different cares awaited him in 1791 a fit of sickness overtook him he had to exchange the inspiring labours of literature for the disgusts and disquietudes of physical disease his disorder which had its seat in the chest was violent and threatening and though nature overcame it in the present instance the blessing of entire health never more returned to him the cause of this severe affliction seemed to be the unceasing toil and anxiety of mind in which his days had hitherto been passed his frame which though tall had never been robust was too weak for the vehement and sleepless soul that dwelt within it and the habit of nocturnal study had no doubt aggravated all the other mischiefs ever since his residence at dresden his constitution had been weakened but this rude shock at once shattered its remaining strength for a time the strictest precautions were required barely to preserve existence a total cessation from every intellectual effort was one of the most peremptory laws prescribed to him schillers habits and domestic circumstances equally rebelled against this measure with a beloved wife depending on him for support inaction itself could have procured him little rest his case seemed hard his prospects of innocent felicity had been too banefully obscured yet in this painful and difficult position he did not yield to despondency and at length assistance and partial deliverance reached him from a very unexpected quarter schiller had not long been sick when the hereditary prince now reigning duke of holsteinaugustenburg jointly with the count von schimmelmann conferred on him a pension of a thousand crowns for three years24 no stipulation was added but merely that he should be careful of his health and use every attention to recover this speedy and generous aid moreover was presented with a delicate politeness which as schiller said touched him more than even the gift itself we should remember this count and this duke they deserve some admiration and some envy      footnote 24 it was to denmark likewise that klopstock owed     the means of completing his messias  this disorder introduced a melancholy change into schillers circumstances he had now another enemy to strive with a secret and fearful impediment to vanquish in which much resolute effort must be sunk without producing any positive result pain is not entirely synonymous with evil but bodily pain seems less redeemed by good than almost any other kind of it from the loss of fortune of fame or even of friends philosophy pretends to draw a certain compensating benefit but in general the permanent loss of health will bid defiance to her alchymy it is a universal diminution the diminution equally of our resources and of our capacity to guide them a penalty unmitigated save by love of friends which then first becomes truly dear and precious to us or by comforts brought from beyond this earthly sphere from that serene fountain of peace and hope to which our weak philosophy cannot raise her wing for all men in itself disease is misery but chiefly for men of finer feelings and endowments to whom in return for such superiorities it seems to be sent most frequently and in its most distressing forms it is a cruel fate for the poet to have the sunny land of his imagination often the sole territory he is lord of disfigured and darkened by the shades of pain for one whose highest happiness is the exertion of his mental faculties to have them chained and paralysed in the imprisonment of a distempered frame with external activity with palpable pursuits above all with a suitable placidity of nature much even in certain states of sickness may be performed and enjoyed but for him whose heart is already overkeen whose world is of the mind ideal internal when the mildew of lingering disease has struck that world and begun to blacken and consume its beauty nothing seems to remain but despondency and bitterness and desolate sorrow felt and anticipated to the end  woe to him if his will likewise falter if his resolution fail and his spirit bend its neck to the yoke of this new enemy idleness and a disturbed imagination will gain the mastery of him and let loose their thousand fiends to harass him to torment him into madness alas the bondage of algiers is freedom compared with this of the sick man of genius whose heart has fainted and sunk beneath its load his clay dwelling is changed into a gloomy prison every nerve is become an avenue of disgust or anguish and the soul sits within in her melancholy loneliness a prey to the spectres of despair or stupefied with excess of suffering doomed as it were to a life in death to a consciousness of agonised existence without the consciousness of power which should accompany it happily death or entire fatuity at length puts an end to such scenes of ignoble misery which however ignoble as they are we ought to view with pity rather than contempt  such are frequently the fruits of protracted sickness in men otherwise of estimable qualities and gifts but whose sensibility exceeds their strength of mind in schiller its worst effects were resisted by the only availing antidote a strenuous determination to neglect them his spirit was too vigorous and ardent to yield even in this emergency he disdained to dwindle into a pining valetudinarian in the midst of his infirmities he persevered with unabated zeal in the great business of his life as he partially recovered he returned as strenuously as ever to his intellectual occupations and often in the glow of poetical conception he almost forgot his maladies by such resolute and manly conduct he disarmed sickness of its cruelest power to wound his frame might be in pain but his spirit retained its force unextinguished almost unimpeded he did not lose his relish for the beautiful the grand or the good in any of their shapes he loved his friends as formerly and wrote his finest and sublimest works when his health was gone perhaps no period of his life displayed more heroism than the present one  after this severe attack and the kind provision which he had received from denmark schiller seems to have relaxed his connexion with the university of jena the weightiest duties of his class appear to have been discharged by proxy and his historical studies to have been forsaken yet this was but a change not an abatement in the activity of his mind once partially free from pain all his former diligence awoke and being also free from the more pressing calls of duty and economy he was now allowed to turn his attention to objects which attracted it more among these one of the most alluring was the philosophy of kant  the transcendental system of the königsberg professor had for the last ten years been spreading over germany which it had now filled with the most violent contentions the powers and accomplishments of kant were universally acknowledged the high pretensions of his system pretensions it is true such as had been a thousand times put forth a thousand times found wanting still excited notice when so backed by ability and reputation the air of mysticism connected with these doctrines was attractive to the german mind with which the vague and the vast are always pleasing qualities the dreadful array of first principles the forest huge of terminology and definitions where the panting intellect of weaker men wanders as in pathless thickets and at length sinks powerless to the earth oppressed with fatigue and suffocated with scholastic miasma seemed sublime rather than appalling to the germans men who shrink not at toil and to whom a certain degree of darkness appears a native element essential for giving play to that deep meditative enthusiasm which forms so important a feature in their character kants philosophy accordingly found numerous disciples and possessed them with a zeal unexampled since the days of pythagoras this in fact resembled spiritual fanaticism rather than a calm ardour in the cause of science kants warmest admirers seemed to regard him more in the light of a prophet than of a mere earthly sage such admiration was of course opposed by corresponding censure the transcendental neophytes had to encounter sceptical gainsayers as determined as themselves of this latter class the most remarkable were herder and wieland herder then a clergyman of weimar seems never to have comprehended what he fought against so keenly he denounced and condemned the kantean metaphysics because he found them heterodox the young divines came back from the university of jena with their minds well nigh delirious full of strange doctrines which they explained to the examinators of the weimar consistorium in phrases that excited no idea in the heads of these reverend persons but much horror in their hearts25 hence reprimands and objurgations and excessive bitterness between the applicants for ordination and those appointed to confer it one young clergyman at weimar shot himself on this account heresy and jarring and unprofitable logic were universal hence herders vehement attacks on this pernicious quackery this delusive and destructive system of words26 wieland strove against it for another reason he had all his life been labouring to give currency among his countrymen to a species of diluted epicurism to erect a certain smooth and elegant and very slender scheme of taste and morals borrowed from our shaftesbury and the french all this feeble edifice the new doctrine was sweeping before it to utter ruin with the violence of a tornado it grieved wieland to see the work of half a century destroyed he fondly imagined that but for kants philosophy it might have been perennial with scepticism quickened into action by such motives herder and he went forth as brother champions against the transcendental metaphysics they were not long without a multitude of hot assailants the uproar produced among thinking men by the conflict has scarcely been equalled in germany since the days of luther fields were fought and victories lost and won nearly all the minds of the nation were in secret or openly arrayed on this side or on that goethe alone seemed altogether to retain his wonted composure he was clear for allowing the kantean scheme to have its day as all things have goethe has already lived to see the wisdom of this sentiment so characteristic of his genius and turn of thought      footnote 25 schelling has a book on the soul of the     world fichtes expression to his students tomorrow     gentlemen i shall create god is known to most readers      footnote 26 see herders leben by his widow that herder     was not usually troubled with any unphilosophical scepticism     or aversion to novelty may be inferred from his patronising     dr galls system of phrenology or skulldoctrine as they     call it in germany but gall had referred with acknowledgment     and admiration to the philosophie der geschichte der     menschheit here lay a difference  in these controversies soon pushed beyond the bounds of temperate or wholesome discussion schiller took no part but the noise they made afforded him a fresh inducement to investigate a set of doctrines so important in the general estimation a system which promised even with a very little plausibility to accomplish all that kant asserted his complete performance of to explain the difference between matter and spirit to unravel the perplexities of necessity and freewill to show us the true grounds of our belief in god and what hope nature gives us of the souls immortality and thus at length after a thousand failures to interpret the enigma of our being—hardly needed that additional inducement to make such a man as schiller grasp at it with eager curiosity his progress also was facilitated by his present circumstances jena had now become the chief wellspring of kantean doctrine a distinction or disgrace it has ever since continued to deserve reinhold one of kants ablest followers was at this time schillers fellowteacher and daily companion he did not fail to encourage and assist his friend in a path of study which as he believed conducted to such glorious results under this tuition schiller was not long in discovering that at least the new philosophy was more poetical than that of leibnitz and had a grander character persuasions which of course confirmed him in his resolution to examine it  how far schiller penetrated into the arcana of transcendentalism it is impossible for us to say the metaphysical and logical branches of it seem to have afforded him no solid satisfaction or taken no firm hold of his thoughts their influence is scarcely to be traced in any of his subsequent writings the only department to which he attached himself with his ordinary zeal was that which relates to the principles of the imitative arts with their moral influences and which in the kantean nomenclature has been designated by the term Æsthetics27 or the doctrine of sentiments and emotions on these subjects he had already amassed a multitude of thoughts to see which expressed by new symbols and arranged in systematic form and held together by some common theory would necessarily yield enjoyment to his intellect and inspire him with fresh alacrity in prosecuting such researches the new light which dawned or seemed to dawn upon him in the course of these investigations is reflected in various treatises evincing at least the honest diligence with which he studied and the fertility with which he could produce of these the largest and most elaborate are the essays on grace and dignity on naïve and sentimental poetry and the letters on the Æsthetic culture of man the other pieces are on tragic art on the pathetic on the cause of our delight in tragic objects on employing the low and common in art      footnote 27 from the verb αισθανομαι to     feel—the term is baumgartens prior to kant 1845  being cast in the mould of kantism or at least clothed in its garments these productions to readers unacquainted with that system are encumbered here and there with difficulties greater than belong intrinsically to the subject in perusing them the uninitiated student is mortified at seeing so much powerful thought distorted as he thinks into such fantastic forms the principles of reasoning on which they rest are apparently not those of common logic a dimness and doubt overhangs their conclusions scarcely anything is proved in a convincing manner but this is no strange quality in such writings to an exoteric reader the philosophy of kant almost always appears to invert the common maxim its end and aim seem not to be to make abstruse things simple but to make simple things abstruse often a proposition of inscrutable and dread aspect when resolutely grappled with and torn from its shady den and its bristling entrenchments of uncouth terminology and dragged forth into the open light of day to be seen by the natural eye and tried by merely human understanding proves to be a very harmless truth familiar to us from of old sometimes so familiar as to be a truism too frequently the anxious novice is reminded of dryden in the battle of the books there is a helmet of rusty iron dark grim gigantic and within it at the farthest corner is a head no bigger than a walnut these are the general errors of kantean criticism in the present works they are by no means of the worst or most pervading kind and there is a fundamental merit which does more than counterbalance them by the aid of study the doctrine set before us can in general at length be comprehended and schillers fine intellect recognisable even in its masquerade is ever and anon peering forth in its native form which all may understand which all must relish and presenting us with passages that show like bright verdant islands in the misty sea of metaphysics  we have been compelled to offer these remarks on kants philosophy but it is right to add that they are the result of only very limited acquaintance with the subject we cannot wish that any influence of ours should add a note however feeble to the loud and not at all melodious cry which has been raised against it in this country when a class of doctrines so involved in difficulties yet so sanctioned by illustrious names is set before us curiosity must have a theory respecting them and indolence and other humbler feelings are too ready to afford her one to call kants system a laborious dream and its adherents crazy mystics is a brief method brief but false the critic whose philosophy includes the craziness of men like these so easily and smoothly in its formulas should render thanks to heaven for having gifted him with science and acumen as few in any age or country have been gifted meaner men however ought to recollect that where we do not understand we should postpone deciding or at least keep our decision for our own exclusive benefit we of england may reject this kantean system perhaps with reason but it ought to be on other grounds than are yet before us philosophy is science and science as schiller has observed cannot always be explained in conversations by the parlour fire or in written treatises that resemble such the cui bono of these doctrines may not it is true be expressible by arithmetical computations the subject also is perplexed with obscurities and probably with manifold delusions and too often its interpreters with us have been like tenebrific stars that did ray out darkness on a matter itself sufficiently dark but what then is the jewel always to be found among the common dust of the highway and always to be estimated by its value in the common judgment it lies embosomed in the depths of the mine rocks must be rent before it can be reached skilful eyes and hands must separate it from the rubbish where it lies concealed and kingly purchasers alone can prize it and buy it this law of ostracism is as dangerous in science as it was of old in politics let us not forget that many things are true which cannot be demonstrated by the rules of wattss logic that many truths are valuable for which no price is given in paternoster row and no preferment offered at st stephens whoever reads these treatises of schiller with attention will perceive that they depend on principles of an immensely higher and more complex character than our essays on taste and our inquiries concerning the freedom of the will the laws of criticism which it is their purpose to establish are derived from the inmost nature of man the scheme of morality which they inculcate soars into a brighter region very far beyond the ken of our utilities and reflexsenses they do not teach us to judge of poetry and art as we judge of dinner merely by observing the impressions it produced in us and they do derive the duties and chief end of man from other grounds than the philosophy of profit and loss these letters on Æsthetic culture without the aid of anything which the most sceptical could designate as superstition trace out and attempt to sanction for us a system of morality in which the sublimest feelings of the stoic and the christian are represented but as stages in our progress to the pinnacle of true human grandeur and man isolated on this fragment of the universe encompassed with the boundless desolate unknown at war with fate without help or the hope of help is confidently called upon to rise into a calm cloudless height of internal activity and peace and be what he has fondly named himself the god of this lower world when such are the results who would not make an effort for the steps by which they are attained in schillers treatises it must be owned the reader after all exertions will be fortunate if he can find them yet a second perusal will satisfy him better than the first and among the shapeless immensities which fill the night of kantism and the meteoric coruscations which perplex him rather than enlighten he will fancy he descries some streaks of a serener radiance which he will pray devoutly that time may purify and ripen into perfect day the philosophy of kant is probably combined with errors to its very core but perhaps also this ponderous unmanageable dross may bear in it the everlasting gold of truth mighty spirits have already laboured in refining it is it wise in us to take up with the base pewter of utility and renounce such projects altogether we trust not28      footnote 28 are our hopes from mr coleridge always to be     fruitless sneers at the commonsense philosophy of the     scotch are of little use it is a poor philosophy perhaps     but not so poor as none at all which seems to be the state     of matters here at present  that schillers genius profited by this laborious and ardent study of Æsthetic metaphysics has frequently been doubted and sometimes denied that after such investigations the process of composition would become more difficult might be inferred from the nature of the case that also the principles of this critical theory were in part erroneous in still greater part too farfetched and finespun for application to the business of writing we may farther venture to assert but excellence not ease of composition is the thing to be desired and in a mind like schillers so full of energy of images and thoughts and creative power the more sedulous practice of selection was little likely to be detrimental and though considerable errors might mingle with the rules by which he judged himself the habit of judging carelessly or not at all is far worse than that of sometimes judging wrong besides once accustomed to attend strictly to the operations of his genius and rigorously to try its products such a man as schiller could not fail in time to discover what was false in the principles by which he tried them and consequently in the end to retain the benefits of this procedure without its evils there is doubtless a purism in taste a rigid fantastical demand of perfection a horror at approaching the limits of impropriety which obstructs the free impulse of the faculties and if excessive would altogether deaden them but the excess on the other side is much more frequent and for high endowments infinitely more pernicious after the strongest efforts there may be little realised without strong efforts there must be little that too much care does hurt in any of our tasks is a doctrine so flattering to indolence that we ought to receive it with extreme caution in works impressed with the stamp of true genius their quality not their extent is what we value a dull man may spend his lifetime writing little better so than writing much but a man of powerful mind is liable to no such danger of all our authors gray is perhaps the only one that from fastidiousness of taste has written less than he should have done there are thousands that have erred the other way what would a spanish reader give had lope de vega composed a hundred times as little and that little a hundred times as well  schillers own ideas on these points appear to be sufficiently sound they are sketched in the following extract of a letter interesting also as a record of his purposes and intellectual condition at this period  criticism must now make good to me the damage she herself has done and damaged me she most certainly has for the boldness the living glow which i felt before a rule was known to me have for several years been wanting i now see myself create and form i watch the play of inspiration and my fancy knowing she is not without witnesses of her movements no longer moves with equal freedom i hope however ultimately to advance so far that art shall become a second nature as polished manners are to wellbred men then imagination will regain her former freedom and submit to none but voluntary limitations  schillers subsequent writings are the best proof that in these expectations he had not miscalculated   the historical and critical studies in which he had been so extensively and seriously engaged could not remain without effect on schillers general intellectual character he had spent five active years in studies directed almost solely to the understanding or the faculties connected with it and such industry united to such ardour had produced an immense accession of ideas history had furnished him with pictures of manners and events of strange conjunctures and conditions of existence it had given him more minute and truer conceptions of human nature in its many forms new and more accurate opinions on the character and end of man the domain of his mind was both enlarged and enlightened a multitude of images and detached facts and perceptions had been laid up in his memory and his intellect was at once enriched by acquired thoughts and strengthened by increased exercise on a wider circle of knowledge  but to understand was not enough for schiller there were in him faculties which this could not employ and therefore could not satisfy the primary vocation of his nature was poetry the acquisitions of his other faculties served but as the materials for his poetic faculty to act upon and seemed imperfect till they had been sublimated into the pure and perfect forms of beauty which it is the business of this to elicit from them new thoughts gave birth to new feelings and both of these he was now called upon to body forth to represent by visible types to animate and adorn with the magic of creative genius the first youthful blaze of poetic ardour had long since passed away but this large increase of knowledge awakened it anew refined by years and experience into a steadier and clearer flame vague shadows of unaccomplished excellence gleams of ideal beauty were now hovering fitfully across his mind he longed to turn them into shape and give them a local habitation and a name criticism likewise had exalted his notions of art the modern writers on subjects of taste aristotle the ancient poets he had lately studied he had carefully endeavoured to extract the truth from each and to amalgamate their principles with his own in choosing he was now more difficult to satisfy minor poems had all along been partly occupying his attention but they yielded no space for the intensity of his impulses and the magnificent ideas that were rising in his fancy conscious of his strength he dreaded not engaging with the highest species of his art the perusal of the greek tragedians had given rise to some late translations29 the perusal of homer seems now to have suggested the idea of an epic poem the hero whom he first contemplated was gustavus adolphus he afterwards changed to frederick the great of prussia      footnote 29 these were a fine version of euripides     iphigenia in aulide and a few scenes of his phœnissæ  epic poems since the time of the epigoniad and leonidas and especially since that of some more recent attempts have with us become a mighty dull affair that schiller aimed at something infinitely higher than these faint and superannuated imitations far higher than even klopstock has attained will appear by the following extract from one of his letters  an epic poem in the eighteenth century should be quite a different thing from such a poem in the childhood of the world and it is that very circumstance which attracts me so much towards this project our manners the finest essence of our philosophies our politics economy arts in short of all we know and do would require to be introduced without constraint and interwoven in such a composition to live there in beautiful harmonious freedom as all the branches of greek culture live and are made visible in homers iliad nor am i disinclined to invent a species of machinery for this purpose being anxious to fulfil with hairsbreadth accuracy all the requisitions that are made of epic poets even on the side of form besides this machinery which in a subject so modern in an age so prosaic appears to present the greatest difficulty might exalt the interest in a high degree were it suitably adapted to this same modern spirit crowds of confused ideas on this matter are rolling to and fro within my head something distinct will come out of them at last  as for the sort of metre i would choose this i think you will hardly guess no other than ottave rime all the rest except iambic are become insufferable to me and how beautifully might the earnest and the lofty be made to play in these light fetters what attractions might the epic substance gain by the soft yielding form of this fine rhyme for the poem must not in name only but in very deed be capable of being sung as the iliad was sung by the peasants of greece as the stanzas of jerusalem delivered are still sung by the venetian gondoliers  the epoch of fredericks life that would fit me best i have considered also i should wish to select some unhappy situation it would allow me to unfold his mind far more poetically the chief action should if possible be very simple perplexed with no complicated circumstances that the whole might easily be comprehended at a glance though the episodes were never so numerous in this respect there is no better model than the iliad  schiller did not execute or even commence the project he has here so philosophically sketched the constraints of his present situation the greatness of the enterprise compared with the uncertainty of its success were sufficient to deter him besides he felt that after all his wide excursions the true home of his genius was the drama the department where its powers had first been tried and were now by habit or nature best qualified to act to the drama he accordingly returned the history of the thirtyyears war had once suggested the idea of gustavus adolphus as the hero of an epic poem the same work afforded him a subject for a tragedy he now decided on beginning wallenstein in this undertaking it was no easy task that he contemplated a common play did not now comprise his aim he required some magnificent and comprehensive object in which he could expend to advantage the new poetical and intellectual treasures which he had for years been amassing something that should at once exemplify his enlarged ideas of art and give room and shape to his fresh stores of knowledge and sentiment as he studied the history of wallenstein and viewed its capabilities on every side new ideas gathered round it the subject grew in magnitude and often changed in form his progress in actual composition was of course irregular and small yet the difficulties of the subject increasing with his own wider more ambitious conceptions did not abate his diligence wallenstein with many interruptions and many alterations sometimes stationary sometimes retrograde continued on the whole though slowly to advance  this was for several years his chosen occupation the task to which he consecrated his brightest hours and the finest part of his faculties for humbler employments demanding rather industry than inspiration there still remained abundant leisure of which it was inconsistent with his habits to waste a single hour his occasional labours accordingly were numerous varied and sometimes of considerable extent in the end of 1792 a new object seemed to call for his attention he once about this time seriously meditated mingling in politics the french revolution had from the first affected him with no ordinary hopes which however the course of events particularly the imprisonment of louis were now fast converting into fears for the illfated monarch and the cause of freedom which seemed threatened with disgrace in the treatment he was likely to receive schiller felt so deeply interested that he had determined in his case a determination not without its risks to address an appeal on these subjects to the french people and the world at large the voice of reason advocating liberty as well as order might still he conceived make a salutary impression in this period of terror and delusion the voice of a distinguished man would at first sound like the voice of the nation which he seemed to represent schiller was inquiring for a proper french translator and revolving in his mind the various arguments that might be used and the comparative propriety of using or forbearing to use them but the progress of things superseded the necessity of such deliberation in a few months louis perished on the scaffold the bourbon family were murdered or scattered over europe and the french government was changed into a frightful chaos amid the tumultuous and bloody horrors of which calm truth had no longer a chance to be heard schiller turned away from these repulsive and appalling scenes into other regions where his heart was more familiar and his powers more likely to produce effect the french revolution had distressed and shocked him but it did not lessen his attachment to liberty the name of which had been so desecrated in its wild convulsions perhaps in his subsequent writings we can trace a more respectful feeling towards old establishments more reverence for the majesty of custom and with an equal zeal a weaker faith in human perfectibility changes indeed which are the common fruit of years themselves in whatever age or climate of the world our experience may be gathered  among the number of fluctuating engagements one which for ten years had been constant with him was the editing of the thalia the principles and performances of that work he had long looked upon as insufficient in particular ever since his settlement at jena it had been among his favourite projects to exchange it for some other conducted on a more liberal scheme uniting more ability in its support and embracing a much wider compass of literary interests many of the most distinguished persons in germany had agreed to assist him in executing such a plan goethe himself a host undertook to go hand in hand with him the thalia was in consequence relinquished at the end of 1793 and the first number of the horen came out early in the following year this publication was enriched with many valuable pieces on points of philosophy and criticism some of schillers finest essays first appeared here even without the foreign aids which had been promised him it already bade fair to outdo as he had meant it should every previous work of that description  the musenalmanach of which he likewise undertook the superintendence did not aim so high like other works of the same title which are numerous in germany it was intended for preserving and annually delivering to the world a series of short poetical effusions or other fugitive compositions collected from various quarters and often having no connexion but their juxtaposition in this work as well as in the horen some of schillers finest smaller poems made their first appearance many of these pieces being written about this period especially the greater part of his ballads the idea of attempting which took its rise in a friendly rivalry with goethe but the most noted composition sent forth in the pages of the musenalmanach was the xenien30 a collection of epigrams which originated partly as it seems in the mean or irritating conduct of various contemporary authors in spite of the most flattering promises and of its own intrinsic character the horen at its first appearance instead of being hailed with welcome by the leading minds of the country for whom it was intended as a rallying point met in many quarters with no sentiment but coldness or hostility the controversies of the day had sown discord among literary men schiller and goethe associating together had provoked illwill from a host of persons who felt the justice of such mutual preference but liked not the inferences to be drawn from it and eyed this intellectual duumvirate however meek in the discharge of its functions and the wearing of its honours with jealousy and discontent      footnote 30 so called from ξενιον munus     hospitale a title borrowed from martial who has thus     designated a series of personal epigrams in his thirteenth     book  the cavilling of these people awkwardly contrasted with their personal absurdity and insipidity at length provoked the serious notice of the two illustrious associates the result was this german dunciad a production of which the plan was that it should comprise an immense multitude of detached couplets each conveying a complete thought within itself and furnished by one of the joint operators the subjects were of unlimited variety the most as schiller says were wild satire glancing at writers and writings intermixed with here and there a flash of poetical or philosophic thought it was at first intended to provide about a thousand of these pointed monodistichs unity in such a work appearing to consist in a certain boundlessness of size which should hide the heterogeneous nature of the individual parts the whole were then to be arranged and elaborated till they had acquired the proper degree of consistency and symmetry each sacrificing something of its own peculiar spirit to preserve the spirit of the rest this number never was completed and goethe being now busy with his wilhelm meister the project of completing it was at length renounced and the xenien were published as unconnected particles not pretending to constitute a whole enough appeared to create unbounded commotion among the parties implicated the xenien were exclaimed against abused and replied to on all hands but as they declared war not on persons but on actions not against gleim nicolai manso but against bad taste dulness and affectation nothing criminal could be sufficiently made out against them31 the musenalmanach where they appeared in 1797 continued to be published till the time of schillers leaving jena the horen ceased some months before      footnote 31 this is but a lame account of the farfamed     xenien and their results see more of the matter in franz     horns poesie und beredtsamkeit in carlyles     miscellanies i 67 c note of 1845  the coöperation of goethe which schiller had obtained so readily in these pursuits was of singular use to him in many others both possessing minds of the first order yet constructed and trained in the most opposite modes each had much that was valuable to learn of the other and suggest to him cultivating different kinds of excellence they could joyfully admit each others merit connected by mutual services and now by community of literary interests few unkindly feelings could have place between them for a man of high equalities it is rare to find a meet companion painful and injurious to want one solitude exasperates or deadens the heart perverts or enervates the faculties association with inferiors leads to dogmatism in thought and selfwill even in affections rousseau never should have lived in the val de montmorenci it had been good for warburton that hurd had not existed for johnson never to have known boswell or davies from such evils schiller and goethe were delivered their intimacy seems to have been equal frank and cordial from the contrasts and the endowments of their minds it must have had peculiar charms in his critical theories schiller had derived much profit from communicating with an intellect as excursive as his own but far cooler and more sceptical as he lopped off from his creed the excrescences of kantism goethe and he on comparing their ideas often found in them a striking similarity more striking and more gratifying when it was considered from what diverse premises these harmonious conclusions had been drawn on such subjects they often corresponded when absent and conversed when together they were in the habit of paying long visits to each others houses frequently they used to travel in company between jena and weimar at triesnitz a couple of english miles from jena goethe and he we are told might sometimes be observed sitting at table beneath the shade of a spreading tree talking and looking at the current of passengers—there are some who would have travelled fifty miles on foot to join the party  besides this intercourse with goethe he was happy in a kindly connexion with many other estimable men both in literary and in active life dalberg at a distance was to the last his friend and warmest admirer at jena he had schütz paul hufland reinhold wilhelm von humboldt also brother of the celebrated traveller had come thither about this time and was now among his closest associates at weimar excluding less important persons there were still herder and wieland to divide his attention with goethe and what to his affectionate heart must have been the most grateful circumstance of all his aged parents were yet living to participate in the splendid fortune of the son whom they had once lamented and despaired of but never ceased to love in 1793 he paid them a visit in swabia and passed nine cheerful months among the scenes dearest to his recollection enjoying the kindness of those unalterable friends whom nature had given him and the admiring deference of those by whom it was most delightful to be honoured—those who had known him in adverse and humbler circumstances whether they might have respected or contemned him by the grand duke his ancient censor and patron he was not interfered with that prince in answer to a previous application on the subject having indirectly engaged to take no notice of this journey the grand duke had already interfered too much with him and bitterly repented of his interference next year he died an event which schiller who had long forgotten past illtreatment did not learn without true sorrow and grateful recollections of bygone kindness the new sovereign anxious to repair the injustice of his predecessor almost instantly made offer of a vacant tübingen professorship to schiller a proposal flattering to the latter but which by the persuasion of the duke of weimar he respectfully declined  amid labours and amusements so multiplied amid such variety of intellectual exertion and of intercourse with men schiller it was clear had not suffered the encroachments of bodily disease to undermine the vigour of his mental or moral powers no period of his life displayed in stronger colours the lofty and determined zeal of his character he had already written much his fame stood upon a firm basis domestic wants no longer called upon him for incessant effort and his frame was pining under the slow canker of an incurable malady yet he never loitered never rested his fervid spirit which had vanquished opposition and oppression in his youth which had struggled against harassing uncertainties and passed unsullied through many temptations in his earlier manhood did not now yield to this last and most fatal enemy the present was the busiest most productive season of his literary life and with all its drawbacks it was probably the happiest violent attacks from his disorder were of rare occurrence and its constant influence the dark vapours with which it would have overshadowed the faculties of his head and heart were repelled by diligence and a courageous exertion of his will in other points he had little to complain of and much to rejoice in he was happy in his family the chosen scene of his sweetest most lasting satisfaction by the world he was honoured and admired his wants were provided for he had tasks which inspired and occupied him friends who loved him and whom he loved schiller had much to enjoy and most of it he owed to himself  in his mode of life at jena simplicity and uniformity were the most conspicuous qualities the single excess which he admitted being that of zeal in the pursuits of literature the sin which all his life had most easily beset him his health had suffered much and principally it was thought from the practice of composing by night yet the charms of this practice were still too great for his selfdenial and except in severe fits of sickness he could not discontinue it the highest proudest pleasure of his mind was that glow of intellectual production that fine frenzy which makes the poet while it lasts a new and nobler creature exalting him into brighter regions adorned by visions of magnificence and beauty and delighting all his faculties by the intense consciousness of their exerted power to enjoy this pleasure in perfection the solitary stillness of night diffusing its solemn influence over thought as well as earth and air had at length in schillers case grown indispensable for this purpose accordingly he was accustomed in the present as in former periods to invert the common order of things by day he read refreshed himself with the aspect of nature conversed or corresponded with his friends but he wrote and studied in the night and as his bodily feelings were too often those of languor and exhaustion he adopted in impatience of such mean impediments the pernicious expedient of stimulants which yield a momentary strength only to waste our remaining fund of it more speedily and surely  during summer his place of study was in a garden which at length he purchased in the suburbs of jena not far from the weselhöfts house where at that time was the office of the allgemeine litteraturzeitung reckoning from the marketplace of jena it lies on the southwest border of the town between the engelgatter and the neuthor in a hollow defile through which a part of the leutrabach flows round the city on the top of the acclivity from which there is a beautiful prospect into the valley of the saal and the fir mountains of the neighbouring forest schiller built himself a small house with a single chamber32 it was his favourite abode during hours of composition a great part of the works he then wrote were written here in winter he likewise dwelt apart from the noise of men in the griesbachs house on the outside of the citytrench    on sitting down to his desk at night he was wont to keep some strong coffee or winechocolate but more frequently a flask of old rhenish or champagne standing by him that he might from time to time repair the exhaustion of nature often the neighbours used to hear him earnestly declaiming in the silence of the night and whoever had an opportunity of watching him on such occasions a thing very easy to be done from the heights lying opposite his little gardenhouse on the other side of the dell might see him now speaking aloud and walking swiftly to and fro in his chamber then suddenly throwing himself down into his chair and writing and drinking the while sometimes more than once from the glass standing near him in winter he was to be found at his desk till four or even five oclock in the morning in summer till towards three he then went to bed from which he seldom rose till nine or ten33      footnote 32 the street leading from schillers     dwellinghouse to this was by some wags named the     xeniengasse a name not yet entirely disused      footnote 33 doering pp 118131  had prudence been the dominant quality in schillers character this practice would undoubtedly have been abandoned or rather never taken up it was an error so to waste his strength but one of those which increase rather than diminish our respect originating as it did in generous ardour for what was best and grandest they must be cold censurers that can condemn it harshly for ourselves we but lament and honour this excess of zeal its effects were mournful but its origin was noble who can picture schillers feelings in this solitude without participating in some faint reflection of their grandeur the toilworn but devoted soul alone under the silent starry canopy of night offering up the troubled moments of existence on the altar of eternity for here the splendour that gleamed across the spirit of a mortal transient as one of us was made to be perpetual these images and thoughts were to pass into other ages and distant lands to glow in human hearts when the heart that conceived them had long been mouldered into common dust to the lovers of genius this little gardenhouse might have been a place to visit as a chosen shrine nor will they learn without regret that the walls of it yielding to the hand of time have already crumbled into ruin and are now no longer to be traced the piece of ground that it stood on is itself hallowed with a glory that is bright pure and abiding but the literary pilgrim could not have surveyed without peculiar emotion the simple chamber in which schiller wrote the reich der schatten the spaziergang the ideal and the immortal scenes of wallenstein  the lastnamed work had cost him many an anxious given him many a pleasant hour for seven years it had continued in a state of irregular and oftsuspended progress sometimes lying endless and formless before him sometimes on the point of being given up altogether the multitude of ideas which he wished to incorporate in the structure of the piece retarded him and the difficulty of contenting his taste respecting the manner of effecting this retarded him still more in wallenstein he wished to embody the more enlarged notions which experience had given him of men especially which history had given him of generals and statesmen and while putting such characters in action to represent whatever was or could be made poetical in the stormy period of the thirtyyears war as he meditated on the subject it continued to expand in his fancy it assumed successively a thousand forms and after all due strictness of selection such was still the extent of materials remaining on his hands that he found it necessary to divide the play into three parts distinct in their arrangements but in truth forming a continuous drama of eleven acts in this shape it was sent forth to the world in 1799 a work of labour and persevering anxiety but of anxiety and labour as it then appeared which had not been bestowed in vain wallenstein is by far the best performance he had yet produced it merits a long chapter of criticism by itself and a few hurried pages are all that we can spend on it  as a porch to the great edifice stands part first entitled wallensteins camp a piece in one act it paints with much humour and graphical felicity the manners of that rude tumultuous host which wallenstein presided over and had made the engine of his ambitious schemes schillers early experience of a military life seems now to have stood him in good stead his soldiers are delineated with the distinctness of actual observation in rugged sharpness of feature they sometimes remind us of smolletts seamen here are all the wild lawless spirits of europe assembled within the circuit of a single trench violent tempestuous unstable is the life they lead ishmaelites their hands against every man and every mans hand against them the instruments of rapine tarnished with almost every vice and knowing scarcely any virtue but those of reckless bravery and uncalculating obedience to their leader their situation still presents some aspects which affect or amuse us and these the poet has seized with his accustomed skill much of the cruelty and repulsive harshness of these soldiers we are taught to forget in contemplating their forlorn houseless wanderings and the practical magnanimity with which even they contrive to wring from fortune a tolerable scantling of enjoyment their manner of existence wallenstein has at an after period of the action rather movingly expressed      our life was but a battle and a march      and like the winds blast neverresting homeless      we stormd across the warconvulsed earth  still farther to soften the asperities of the scene the dialogue is cast into a rude hudibrastic metre full of forced rhymes and strange doubleendings with a rhythm ever changing ever rough and lively which might almost be compared to the hard irregular fluctuating sound of the regimental drum in this ludicrous doggrel with phrases and figures of a correspondent cast homely ridiculous graphic these men of service paint their hopes and doings there are ranks and kinds among them representatives of all the constituent parts of the motley multitude which followed this prince of condottieri the solemn pedantry of the ancient wachtmeister is faithfully given no less so are the jocund ferocity and heedless daring of holkys jägers or the iron courage and stern campphilosophy of pappenheims cuirassiers of the jäger the sole principle is military obedience he does not reflect or calculate his business is to do whatever he is ordered and to enjoy whatever he can reach free wished i to live he says      free wished i to live and easy and gay      and see something new on each new day      in the joys of the moment lustily sharing      bout the past or the future not thinking or caring      to the kaiser therefore i sold my bacon      and by him good charge of the whole is taken      order me on mid the whistling fiery shot      over the rhinestream rapid and roaring wide      a third of the troop must go to pot—      without loss of time i mount and ride      but farther i beg very much do you see      that in all things else you would leave me free  the pappenheimer is an older man more sedate and more indomitable he has wandered over europe and gathered settled maxims of soldierly principle and soldierly privilege he is not without a rationale of life the various professions of men have passed in review before him but no coat that he has seen has pleased him like his own steel doublet cased in which it is his wish      looking down on the worlds poor restless scramble      careless through it astride of his nag to ramble  yet at times with this military stoicism there is blended a dash of homely pathos he admits      this sword of ours is no plough or spade      you cannot delve or reap with the iron blade      for us there falls no seed no cornfield grows      neither home nor kindred the soldier knows      wandering over the face of the earth      warming his hands at anothers hearth      from the pomp of towns he must onward roam      in the villagegreen with its cheerful game      in the mirth of the vintage or harvesthome      no part or lot can the soldier claim      tell me then in the place of goods or pelf      what has he unless to honour himself      leave not even this his own what wonder      the man should burn and kill and plunder  but the camp of wallenstein is fall of bustle as well as speculation there are gamblers peasants sutlers soldiers recruits capuchin friars moving to and fro in restless pursuit of their several purposes the sermon of the capuchin is an unparalleled composition34 a medley of texts puns nicknames and verbal logic conglutinated by a stupid judgment and a fiery catholic zeal it seems to be delivered with great unction and to find fit audience in the camp towards the conclusion they rush upon him and he narrowly escapes killing or ducking for having ventured to glance a censure at the general the soldiers themselves are jeering wrangling jostling discussing their wishes and expectations and at last they combine in a profound deliberation on the state of their affairs a vague exaggerated outline of the coming events and personages is imaged to us in their coarse conceptions we dimly discover the precarious position of wallenstein the plots which threaten him which he is meditating we trace the leading qualities of the principal officers and form a high estimate of the potent spirit which binds this fierce discordant mass together and seems to be the object of universal reverence where nothing else is revered      footnote 34 said to be by goethe the materials faithfully     extracted from a real sermon by the jesuit santa clara of     the period it refers to—there were various jesuits santa     clara of that period this is the german one abraham

resolving to revolt and octavio piccolomini in secret undermining his influence among the leaders and preparing for him that pit of ruin into which in the third part wallensteins death we see him sink with all his fortunes the military spirit which pervades the former piece is here well sustained the ruling motives of these captains and colonels are a little more refined or more disguised than those of the cuirassiers and jägers but they are the same in substance the love of present or future pleasure of action reputation money power selfishness but selfishness distinguished by a superficial external propriety and gilded over with the splendour of military honour of courage inflexible yet light cool and unassuming these are not imaginary heroes but genuine hired men of war we do not love them yet there is a pomp about their operations which agreeably fills up the scene this din of war this clash of tumultuous conflicting interests is felt as a suitable accompaniment to the affecting or commanding movements of the chief characters whom it envelops or obeys  of the individuals that figure in this world of war wallenstein himself the strong atlas which supports it all is by far the most imposing wallenstein is the model of a highsouled great accomplished man whose ruling passion is ambition he is daring to the utmost pitch of manhood he is enthusiastic and vehement but the fire of his soul burns hid beneath a deep stratum of prudence guiding itself by calculations which extend to the extreme limits of his most minute concerns this prudence sometimes almost bordering on irresolution forms the outward rind of his character and for a while is the only quality which we discover in it the immense influence which his genius appears to exert on every individual of his many followers prepares us to expect a great man and when wallenstein after long delay and much forewarning is in fine presented to us we at first experience something like a disappointment we find him indeed possessed of a staid grandeur yet involved in mystery wavering between two opinions and as it seems with all his wisdom blindly credulous in matters of the highest import it is only when events have forced decision on him that he rises in his native might that his giant spirit stands unfolded in its strength before us      night must it be ere friedlands star will beam  amid difficulties darkness and impending ruin at which the boldest of his followers grow pale he himself is calm and first in this awful crisis feels the serenity and conscious strength of his soul return wallenstein in fact though preeminent in power both external and internal of high intellect and commanding will skilled in war and statesmanship beyond the best in europe the idol of sixty thousand fearless hearts is not yet removed above our sympathy we are united with him by feelings which he reckons weak though they belong to the most generous parts of his nature his indecision partly takes its rise in the sensibilities of his heart as well as in the caution of his judgment his belief in astrology which gives force and confirmation to this tendency originates in some soft kindly emotions and adds a new interest to the spirit of the warrior it humbles him to whom the earth is subject before those mysterious powers which weigh the destinies of man in their balance in whose eyes the greatest and the least of mortals scarcely differ in littleness wallensteins confidence in the friendship of octavio his disinterested love for max piccolomini his paternal and brotherly kindness are feelings which cast an affecting lustre over the harsher more heroic qualities wherewith they are combined his treason to the emperor is a crime for which provoked and tempted as he was we do not greatly blame him it is forgotten in our admiration of his nobleness or recollected only as a venial trespass schiller has succeeded well with wallenstein where it was not easy to succeed the truth of history has been but little violated yet we are compelled to feel that wallenstein whose actions individually are trifling unsuccessful and unlawful is a strong sublime commanding character we look at him with interest our concern at his fate is tinged with a shade of kindly pity  in octavio piccolomini his warcompanion we can find less fault yet we take less pleasure octavios qualities are chiefly negative he rather walks by the letter of the moral law than by its spirit his conduct is externally correct but there is no touch of generosity within he is more of the courtier than of the soldier his weapon is intrigue not force believing firmly that whatever is is best he distrusts all new and extraordinary things he has no faith in human nature and seems to be virtuous himself more by calculation than by impulse we scarcely thank him for his loyalty serving his emperor he ruins and betrays his friend and besides though he does not own it personal ambition is among his leading motives he wishes to be general and prince and wallenstein is not only a traitor to his sovereign but a bar to this advancement it is true octavio does not personally tempt him towards his destruction but neither does he warn him from it and perhaps he knew that fresh temptation was superfluous wallenstein did not deserve such treatment from a man whom he had trusted as a brother even though such confidence was blind and guided by visions and starry omens octavio is a skilful prudent managing statesman of the kind praised loudly if not sincerely by their friends and detested deeply by their enemies his object may be lawful or even laudable but his ways are crooked we dislike him but the more that we know not positively how to blame him  octavio piccolomini and wallenstein are as it were the two opposing forces by which this whole universe of military politics is kept in motion the struggle of magnanimity and strength combined with treason against cunning and apparent virtue aided by law gives rise to a series of great actions which are here vividly presented to our view we mingle in the clashing interests of these men of war we see them at their gorgeous festivals and stormy consultations and participate in the hopes or fears that agitate them the subject had many capabilities and schiller has turned them all to profit our minds are kept alert by a constant succession of animating scenes of spectacle dialogue incident the plot thickens and darkens as we advance the interest deepens and deepens to the very end  but among the tumults of this busy multitude there are two forms of celestial beauty that solicit our attention and whose destiny involved with that of those around them gives it an importance in our eyes which it could not otherwise have had max piccolomini octavios son and thekla the daughter of wallenstein diffuse an ethereal radiance over all this tragedy they call forth the finest feelings of the heart where other feelings had already been aroused they superadd to the stirring pomp of scenes which had already kindled our imaginations the enthusiasm of bright unworn humanity the bloom of young desire the purple light of love the history of max and thekla is not a rare one in poetry but schiller has treated it with a skill which is extremely rare both of them are represented as combining every excellence their affection is instantaneous and unbounded yet the coolest most sceptical reader is forced to admire them and believe in them  of max we are taught from the first to form the highest expectations the common soldiers and their captains speak of him as of a perfect hero the cuirassiers had at pappenheims death on the field of lützen appointed him their colonel by unanimous election his appearance answers these ideas max is the very spirit of honour and integrity and young ardour personified though but passing into maturer age he has already seen and suffered much but the experience of the man has not yet deadened or dulled the enthusiasm of the boy he has lived since his very childhood constantly amid the clang of war and with few ideas but those of camps yet here by a native instinct his heart has attracted to it all that was noble and graceful in the trade of arms rejecting all that was repulsive or ferocious he loves wallenstein his patron his gallant and majestic leader he loves his present way of life because it is one of peril and excitement because he knows no other but chiefly because his young unsullied spirit can shed a resplendent beauty over even the wastest region in the destiny of man yet though a soldier and the bravest of soldiers he is not this alone he feels that there are fairer scenes in life which these scenes of havoc and distress but deform or destroy his first acquaintance with the princess thekla unveils to him another world which till then he had not dreamed of a land of peace and serene elysian felicity the charms of which he paints with simple and unrivalled eloquence max is not more daring than affectionate he is merciful and gentle though his training has been under tents modest and altogether unpretending though young and universally admired we conceive his aspect to be thoughtful but fervid dauntless but mild he is the very poetry of war the essence of a youthful hero we should have loved him anywhere but here amid barren scenes of strife and danger he is doubly dear to us  his first appearance wins our favour his eloquence in sentiment prepares us to expect no common magnanimity in action it is as follows octavio and questenberg are consulting on affairs of state max enters he is just returned from convoying the princess thekla and her mother the daughter and the wife of friedland to the camp at pilsen   act i scene iv  max piccolomini octavio piccolomini questenberg  max tis he himself my father welcome welcome  he embraces him on turning round he observes questenberg and draws coldly back  busied i

wrong sir minister to praise i wot you come not hither to blame and censure you are come let me be no exception  oct to max he comes from court where every one is not so well contented with the duke as here  max and what new fault have they to charge him with that he alone decides what he alone can understand well should it not be so it should and must this man was never made to ply and mould himself like wax to others it goes against his heart he cannot do it he has the spirit of a ruler and the station of a ruler well for us it is so few can rule themselves can use their wisdom wisely happy for the whole where there is one among them that can be a centre and a hold for many thousands that can plant himself like a firm column for the whole to lean on safely such a one is wallenstein some other man might better serve the court none else could serve the army  quest the army truly  max                   and it is a pleasure to behold how all awakes and strengthens and revives around him how mens faculties come forth their gifts grow plainer to themselves from each he can elicit his endowment his peculiar power and does it wisely leaving each to be the man he found him watching only that he always be so i th proper place and thus he makes the talents of all mankind his own  quest         no one denies him skill in men and skill to use them his fault is that in the ruler he forgets the servant as if he had been born to be commander  max and is he not by birth he is invested with all gifts for it and with the farther gift of finding scope to use them of acquiring for the rulers faculties the rulers office  quest so that how far the rest of us have rights or influence if any lies with friedland  max he is no common person he requires no common confidence allow him

the shallows  oct to quest let him have his way my friend the argument will not avail us  max               they invoke the spirit i th hour of need and shudder when he rises the great the wonderful must be accomplished like a thing of course—in war in battle a moment is decisive on the spot must be determind in the instant done with evry noble quality of nature the leader must be gifted let him

labour this grinding labour that has stolen my youth and left my heart uncheerd and void my spirit uncultivated as a wilderness this camps unceasing din the neighing steeds the trumpets clang the neverchanging round of service discipline parade give nothing to the heart the heart that longs for nourishment there is no soul in this insipid busness life has another fate and other joys  oct much

rejoicing people their shouts ring through the air from every tower blithe bells are pealing forth the merry vesper of that bloody day from town and hamlet flow the jocund thousands with their hearty kind impetuosity our march impeding the old man weeping that he sees this day embraces his longlost son a stranger he revisits his old home with spreading boughs the tree oershadows him at his return

with you questenberg when i observd you here a twinge of spleen and bitterness went through me it is you that hinder peace yes you the general must force it and you ever keep tormenting him obstructing all his steps abusing him for what because the good of europe lies nearer his heart than whether certain acres more or less of dirty land be austrias you call him traitor rebel god knows what because he spares the saxons as if that were not the only way to peace for how if during war war end not can peace follow go to go to as i love goodness so i hate this paltry work of yours and here i vow to god for him this rebel traitor wallenstein to shed my blood my hearts blood drop by drop ere i will see you triumph in his fall   the princess thekla is perhaps still dearer to us thekla just entering on life with timid steps with the brilliant visions of a cloister yet undisturbed by the contradictions of reality beholds in max not merely her protector and escort to her fathers camp but the living emblem of her shapeless yet glowing dreams she knows not deception she trusts and is trusted their spirits meet and mingle and clasp each other firmly and forever all this is described by the poet with a quiet inspiration which finds its way into our deepest sympathies such beautiful simplicity is irresistible how long the countess terzky asks   how long is it since you disclosed your heart  max this morning first i risked a word of it  coun not till this morning during twenty days  max twas at the castle where you met us twixt this and nepomuk the last stage of the journey on a balcony she and i were standing our looks in silence turnd upon the vacant landscape and before us the dragoons were riding whom the duke had sent to be her escort heavy on my heart lay thoughts of parting and with a faltering voice at last i said all this reminds me fräulein that today i must be parted from my happiness in few hours you will find a father will see yourself encircled by new friends and i shall be to you nought but a stranger forgotten in the crowd—speak with aunt terzky quick she interrupted me i noticed a quivring in her voice a glowing blush spread oer her cheeks slow rising from the ground her eyes met mine i could control myself no longer—  the princess appears at the door and stops the countess but not piccolomini observing her                  —i claspd her wildly in my arms my lips were joind with hers some footsteps stirring i th next room parted us twas you what then took place you know  coun                and can you be so modest or incurious as not once to ask me for my secret in return  max               your secret  coun yes sure on coming in the moment after how my niece receivd me what i th instant of her first surprise she—  max

affection of these two angelic beings but our feeling is changed and made more poignant when we think that the inexorable hand of destiny is already lifted to smite their world with blackness and desolation thekla has enjoyed two little hours of heavenly beauty but her native gaiety gives place to serious anticipations and alarms she feels that the camp of wallenstein is not a place for hope to dwell in the instructions and explanations of her aunt disclose the secret she is not to love max a higher it may be a royal fate awaits her but she is to tempt him from his duty and make him lend his influence to her father whose daring projects she now for the first time discovers from that moment her hopes of happiness have vanished never more to return yet her own sorrows touch her less than the ruin which she sees about to overwhelm her tender and affectionate mother for herself she waits with gloomy patience the stroke that is to crush her she is meek and soft and maidenlike but she is friedlands daughter and does not shrink from what is unavoidable there is often a rectitude and quick inflexibility of resolution about thekla which contrasts beautifully with her inexperience and timorous acuteness of feeling on discovering her fathers treason she herself decides that max shall obey his first impulse and forsake her  there are few scenes in poetry more sublimely pathetic than this we behold the sinking but still fiery glory of wallenstein opposed to the impetuous despair of max piccolomini torn asunder by the claims of duty and of love the calm but brokenhearted thekla beside her brokenhearted mother and surrounded by the blank faces of wallensteins desponding followers there is a physical pomp corresponding to the moral grandeur of the action the successive revolt and departure of the troops is heard without the walls of the palace the trumpets of the pappenheimers reëcho the wild feelings of their leader what follows too is equally affecting max being forced away by his soldiers from the side of thekla rides forth at their head in a state bordering on frenzy next day come tidings of his fate which no heart is hard enough to hear unmoved the effect it produces upon thekla displays all the hidden energies of her soul the first accidental hearing of the news had almost overwhelmed her but she summons up her strength she sends for the messenger that she may question him more closely and listen to his stern details with the heroism of a spartan virgin   act iv scene x  thekla the swedish captain frÄulein neubrunn  capt approaches respectfully

dreading no surprise we lay slightly entrenchd when towards night a cloud of dust rose from the forest and our outposts rushd into the camp and cried the foe was there scarce had we time to spring on horseback when the pappenheimers coming at full gallop dashd oer the palisado and next moment these fierce troopers passd our camptrench also but thoughtlessly their courage had impelled them to advance without support their infantry was far behind only the pappenheimers boldly following their bold leader—  thekla makes a movement the captain pauses for a moment till she beckons him to proceed  on front and flank with all our horse we charged them and ere long forcd them back upon the trench where rankd in haste our infantry presented an iron hedge of pikes to stop their passage

horror proceeds  and fate put forth his hand inexorable cold my friend it graspd and clutchd with iron hold and—under th hoofs of their wild horses hurld such is the lot of loveliness i th world   thekla has yet another pang to encounter the parting with her mother but she persists in her determination and goes forth to die beside her lovers grave the heartrending emotions which this amiable creature has to undergo are described with an almost painful effect the fate of max and thekla might draw tears from the eyes of a stoic  less tender but not less sublimely poetical is the fate of wallenstein himself we do not pity wallenstein even in ruin he seems too great for pity his daughter having vanished like a fair vision from the scene we look forward to wallensteins inevitable fate with little feeling save expectant awe      this kingly wallenstein wheneer he falls     will drag a world to ruin down with him     and as a ship that in the midst of ocean     catches fire and shivring springs into the air     and in a moment scatters between sea and sky     the crew it bore so will he hurry to destruction     evry one whose fate was joind with his  yet still there is some touch of pathos in his gloomy fall some visitings of nature in the austere grandeur of his slowlycoming but inevitable and annihilating doom the last scene of his life is among the finest which poetry can boast of theklas death is still unknown to him but he thinks of max and almost weeps he looks at the stars dim shadows of superstitious dread pass fitfully across his spirit as he views these fountains of light and compares their glorious and enduring existence with the fleeting troubled life of man the strong spirit of his sister is subdued by dark forebodings omens are against him his astrologer entreats one of the relenting conspirators entreats his own feelings call upon him to watch and beware but he refuses to let the resolution of his mind be overmastered he casts away these warnings and goes cheerfully to sleep with dreams of hope about his pillow unconscious that the javelins are already grasped which will send him to his long and dreamless sleep the death of wallenstein does not cause tears but it is perhaps the most highwrought scene of the play a shade of horror of fateful dreariness hangs over it and gives additional effect to the fire of that brilliant poetry which glows in every line of it except in macbeth or the conclusion of othello we know not where to match it schillers genius is of a kind much narrower than shakspeares but in his own peculiar province the exciting of lofty earnest strong emotion he admits of no superior others are finer more piercing varied thrilling in their influence schiller in his finest mood is overwhelming   this tragedy of wallenstein published at the close of the eighteenth century may safely be rated as the greatest dramatic work of which that century can boast france never rose into the sphere of schiller even in the days of her corneille nor can our own country since the times of elizabeth name any dramatist to be compared with him in general strength of mind and feeling and acquired accomplishment about the time of wallensteins appearance we of this gifted land were shuddering at the castle spectre germany indeed boasts of goethe and on some rare occasions it must be owned that goethe has shown talents of a higher order than are here manifested but he has made no equally regular or powerful exertion of them faust is but a careless effusion compared with wallenstein the latter is in truth a vast and magnificent work what an assemblage of images ideas emotions disposed in the most felicitous and impressive order we have conquerors statesmen ambitious generals marauding soldiers heroes and heroines all acting and feeling as they would in nature all faithfully depicted yet all embellished by the spirit of poetry and all made conducive to heighten one paramount impression our sympathy with the three chief characters of the piece35      footnote 35 wallenstein has been translated into french     by m benjamin constant and the last two parts of it have     been faithfully rendered into english by mr coleridge as to     the french version we know nothing save that it is an     improved one but that little is enough schiller as a     dramatist improved by m constant is a spectacle we feel no     wish to witness mr coleridges translation is also as a     whole unknown to us but judging from many large specimens     we should pronounce it excepting sothebys oberon to be     the best indeed the only sufferable translation from the     german with which our literature has yet been enriched   soon after the publication of wallenstein schiller once more changed his abode the mountain air of jena was conceived by his physicians to be prejudicial in disorders of the lungs and partly in consequence of this opinion he determined henceforth to spend his winters in weimar perhaps a weightier reason in favour of this new arrangement was the opportunity it gave him of being near the theatre a constant attendance on which now that he had once more become a dramatist seemed highly useful for his farther improvement the summer he for several years continued still to spend in jena to which especially its beautiful environs he declared himself particularly attached his little gardenhouse was still his place of study during summer till at last he settled constantly at weimar even then he used frequently to visit jena to which there was a fresh attraction in later years when goethe chose it for his residence which we understand it still occasionally is with goethe he often stayed for months  this change of place produced little change in schillers habits or employment he was now as formerly in the pay of the duke of weimar now as formerly engaged in dramatic composition as the great object of his life what the amount of his pension was we know not that the prince behaved to him in a princely manner we have proof sufficient four years before when invited to the university of tübingen schiller had received a promise that in case of sickness or any other cause preventing the continuance of his literary labour his salary should be doubled it was actually increased on occasion of the present removal and again still farther in 1804 some advantageous offers being made to him from berlin schiller seems to have been what he might have wished to be neither poor nor rich his simple unostentatious economy went on without embarrassment and this was all that he required to avoid pecuniary perplexities was constantly among his aims to amass wealth never we ought also to add that in 1802 by the voluntary solicitation of the duke he was ennobled a fact which we mention for his sake by whose kindness this honour was procured not for the sake of schiller who accepted it with gratitude but had neither needed nor desired it  the official services expected of him in return for so much kindness seem to have been slight if any chiefly or altogether of his own accord he appears to have applied himself to a close inspection of the theatre and to have shared with goethe the task of superintending its concerns the rehearsals of new pieces commonly took place at the house of one of these friends they consulted together on all such subjects frankly and copiously schiller was not slow to profit by the means of improvement thus afforded him in the mechanical details of his art he grew more skilful by a constant observation of the stage he became more acquainted with its capabilities and its laws it was not long till with his characteristic expansiveness of enterprise he set about turning this new knowledge to account in conjunction with goethe he remodelled his own don carlos and his friends count egmont altering both according to his latest views of scenic propriety it was farther intended to treat in the same manner the whole series of leading german plays and thus to produce a national stock of dramatic pieces formed according to the best rules a vast project in which some progress continued to be made though other labours often interrupted it for the present schiller was engaged with his maria stuart it appeared in 1800  this tragedy will not detain us long it is upon a subject the incidents of which are now getting trite and the moral of which has little that can peculiarly recommend it to exhibit the repentance of a lovely but erring woman to show us how her soul may be restored to its primitive nobleness by sufferings devotion and death is the object of maria stuart it is a tragedy of sombre and mournful feelings with an air of melancholy and obstruction pervading it a looking backward on objects of remorse around on imprisonment and forward on the grave its object is undoubtedly attained we are forced to pardon and to love the heroine she is beautiful and miserable and loftyminded and her crimes however dark have been expiated by long years of weeping and woe considering also that they were the fruit not of calculation but of passion acting on a heart not dead though blinded for a time to their enormity they seem less hateful than the cold premeditated villany of which she is the victim elizabeth is selfish heartless envious she violates no law but she has no virtue and she lives triumphant her arid artificial character serves by contrast to heighten our sympathy with her warmhearted forlorn illfated rival these two queens particularly mary are well delineated their respective qualities are vividly brought out and the feelings they were meant to excite arise within us there is also mortimer a fierce impetuous impassioned lover driven onward chiefly by the heat of his blood but still interesting by his vehemence and unbounded daring the dialogue moreover has many beauties there are scenes which have merited peculiar commendation of this kind is the interview between the queens and more especially the first entrance of mary when after long seclusion she is once more permitted to behold the cheerful sky in the joy of a momentary freedom she forgets that she is still a captive she addresses the clouds the sailors of the air who are not subjects of elizabeth and bids them carry tidings of her to the hearts that love her in other lands without doubt in all that he intended schiller has succeeded maria stuart is a beautiful tragedy it would have formed the glory of a meaner man but it cannot materially alter his compared with wallenstein its purpose is narrow and its result is common we have no manners or true historical delineation the figure of the english court is not given and elizabeth is depicted more like one of the french medici than like our own politic capricious coquettish imperious yet on the whole truehearted good queen bess with abundant proofs of genius this tragedy produces a comparatively small effect especially on english readers we have already wept enough for mary stuart both over prose and verse and the persons likely to be deeply touched with the moral or the interest of her story as it is recorded here are rather a separate class than men in general madame de staël we observe is her principal admirer   next year schiller took possession of a province more peculiarly his own in 1801 appeared his maid of orleans jungfrau von orleans the first hint of which was suggested to him by a series of documents relating to the sentence of jeanne darc and its reversal first published about this time by de laverdy of the académie des inscriptions schiller had been moved in perusing them this tragedy gave voice to his feelings  considered as an object of poetry or history jeanne darc the most singular personage of modern times presents a character capable of being viewed under a great variety of aspects and with a corresponding variety of emotions to the english of her own age bigoted in their creed and baffled by her prowess she appeared inspired by the devil and was naturally burnt as a sorceress in this light too she is painted in the poems of shakspeare to voltaire again whose trade it was to war with every kind of superstition this child of fanatic ardour seemed no better than a moonstruck zealot and the people who followed her and believed in her something worse than lunatics the glory of what she had achieved was forgotten when the means of achieving it were recollected and the maid of orleans was deemed the fit subject of a poem the wittiest and most profligate for which literature has to blush our illustrious don juan hides his head when contrasted with voltaires pucelle juans biographer with all his zeal is but an innocent and a novice by the side of this archscorner  such a manner of considering the maid of orleans is evidently not the right one feelings so deep and earnest as hers can never be an object of ridicule whoever pursues a purpose of any sort with such fervid devotedness is entitled to awaken emotions at least of a serious kind in the hearts of others enthusiasm puts on a different shape in every different age always in some degree sublime often it is dangerous its very essence is a tendency to error and exaggeration yet it is the fundamental quality of strong souls the true nobility of blood in which all greatness of thought or action has its rise quicquid vult valdè vult is ever the first and surest test of mental capability this peasant girl who felt within her such fiery vehemence of resolution that she could subdue the minds of kings and captains to her will and lead armies on to battle conquering till her country was cleared of its invaders must evidently have possessed the elements of a majestic character benevolent feelings sublime ideas and above all an overpowering will are here indubitably marked nor does the form which her activity assumed seem less adapted for displaying these qualities than many other forms in which we praise them the gorgeous inspirations of the catholic religion are as real as the phantom of posthumous renown the love of our native soil is as laudable as ambition or the principle of military honour jeanne darc must have been a creature of shadowy yet farglancing dreams of unutterable feelings of thoughts that wandered through eternity who can tell the trials and the triumphs the splendours and the terrors of which her simple spirit was the scene heartless sneering godforgetting french as old suwarrow called them—they are not worthy of this noble maiden hers were errors but errors which a generous soul alone could have committed and which generous souls would have done more than pardon her darkness and delusions were of the understanding only they but make the radiance of her heart more touching and apparent as clouds are gilded by the orient light into something more beautiful than azure itself  it is under this aspect that schiller has contemplated the maid of orleans and endeavoured to make us contemplate her for the latter purpose it appears that more than one plan had occurred to him his first idea was to represent joanna and the times she lived in as they actually were to exhibit the superstition ferocity and wretchedness of the period in all their aggravation and to show us this patriotic and religious enthusiast beautifying the tempestuous scene by her presence swaying the fierce passions of her countrymen directing their fury against the invaders of france till at length forsaken and condemned to die she perished at the stake retaining the same steadfast and lofty faith which had ennobled and redeemed the errors of her life and was now to glorify the ignominy of her death this project after much deliberation he relinquished as too difficult by a new mode of management much of the homeliness and rude horror that defaced and encumbered the reality is thrown away the dauphin is not here a voluptuous weakling nor is his court the centre of vice and cruelty and imbecility the misery of the time is touched but lightly and the maid of arc herself is invested with a certain faint degree of mysterious dignity ultimately represented as being in truth a preternatural gift though whether preternatural and if so whether sent from above or from below neither we nor she except by faith are absolutely sure till the conclusion  the propriety of this arrangement is liable to question indeed it has been more than questioned but external blemishes are lost in the intrinsic grandeur of the piece the spirit of joanna is presented to us with an exalting and pathetic force sufficient to make us blind to far greater improprieties joanna is a pure creation of halfcelestial origin combining the mild charms of female loveliness with the awful majesty of a prophetess and a sacrifice doomed to perish for her country she resembled in schillers view the iphigenia of the greeks and as such in some respects he has treated her  the woes and desolation of the land have kindled in joannas keen and fervent heart a fire which the loneliness of her life and her deep feelings of religion have nourished and fanned into a holy flame she sits in solitude with her flocks beside the mountain chapel of the virgin under the ancient druid oak a wizard spot the haunt of evil spirits as well as of good and visions are revealed to her such as human eyes behold not it seems the force of her own spirit expressing its feelings in forms which react upon itself the strength of her impulses persuades her that she is called from on high to deliver her native france the intensity of her own faith persuades others she goes forth on her mission all bends to the fiery vehemence of her will she is inspired because she thinks herself so there is something beautiful and moving in the aspect of a noble enthusiasm fostered in the secret soul amid obstructions and depressions and at length bursting forth with an overwhelming force to accomplish its appointed end the impediments which long hid it are now become testimonies of its power the very ignorance and meanness and error which still in part adhere to it increase our sympathy without diminishing our admiration it seems the triumph hardly contested and not wholly carried but still the triumph of mind over fate of human volition over material necessity  all this schiller felt and has presented with even more than his usual skill the secret mechanism of joannas mind is concealed from us in a dim religious obscurity but its active movements are distinct we behold the lofty heroism of her feelings she affects us to the very heart the quiet devout innocence of her early years when she lived silent shrouded in herself meek and kindly though not communing with others makes us love her the celestial splendour which illuminates her afterlife adds reverence to our love her words and actions combine an overpowering force with a calm unpretending dignity we seem to understand how they must have carried in their favour the universal conviction joanna is the most noble being in tragedy we figure her with her slender lovely form her mild but spiritspeaking countenance beautiful and terrible bearing the banner of the virgin before the hosts of her country travelling in the strength of a rapt soul irresistible by faith the lowly herdsmaid greater in the grandeur of her simple spirit than the kings and queens of this world yet her breast is not entirely insensible to human feeling nor her faith never liable to waver when that inexorable vengeance which had shut her ear against the voice of mercy to the enemies of france is suspended at the sight of lionel and her heart experiences the first touch of mortal affection a baleful cloud overspreads the serene of her mind it seems as if heaven had forsaken her or from the beginning permitted demons or earthly dreams to deceive her the agony of her spirit involved in endless and horrid labyrinths of doubt is powerfully portrayed she has crowned the king at rheims and all is joy and pomp and jubilee and almost adoration of joanna but joannas thoughts are not of joy the sight of her poor but kind and truehearted sisters in the crowd moves her to the soul amid the tumult and magnificence of this royal pageant she sinks into a reverie her small native dale of arc between its quiet hills rises on her minds eye with its strawroofed huts and its clear greensward where the sun is even then shining so brightly and the sky is so blue and all is so calm and motherly and safe she sighs for the peace of that sequestered home then shudders to think that she shall never see it more accused of witchcraft by her own ascetic melancholic father she utters no word of denial to the charge for her heart is dark it is tarnished by earthly love she dare not raise her thoughts to heaven parted from her sisters cast out with horror by the people she had lately saved from despair she wanders forth desolate forlorn not knowing whither yet she does not sink under this sore trial as she suffers from without and is forsaken of men her mind grows clear and strong her confidence returns she is now more firmly fixed in our admiration than before tenderness is united to our other feelings and her faith has been proved by sharp vicissitudes her countrymen recognise their error joanna closes her career by a glorious death we take farewell of her in a solemn mood of heroic pity  joanna is the animating principle of this tragedy the scenes employed in developing her character and feelings constitute its great charm yet there are other personages in it that leave a distinct and pleasing impression of themselves in our memory agnes sorel the soft languishing generous mistress of the dauphin relieves and heightens by comparison the sterner beauty of the maid dunois the bastard of orleans the lover of joanna is a blunt frank sagacious soldier and well described and talbot the gray veteran delineates his dark unbelieving indomitable soul by a few slight but expressive touches he sternly passes down to the land as he thinks of utter nothingness contemptuous even of the fate that destroys him and      on the soil of france he sleeps as does      a hero on the shield he would not quit  a few scattered extracts may in part exhibit some of these inferior personages to our readers though they can afford us no impression of the maid herself joannas character like every finished piece of art to be judged of must be seen in all its bearings it is not in parts but as a whole that the delineation moves us by light and manifold touches it works upon our hearts till they melt before it into that mild rapture free alike from the violence and the impurities of nature which it is the highest triumph of the artist to communicate   act iii scene iv  the dauphin charles with his suite afterwards joanna she is in

  exit   the introduction of supernatural agency in this play and the final aberration from the truth of history have been considerably censured by the german critics schlegel we recollect calls joannas end a rosy death in this dramaturgic discussion the mere reader need take no great interest to require our belief in apparitions and miracles things which we cannot now believe no doubt for a moment disturbs our submission to the poets illusions but the miracles in this story are rare and transient and of small account in the general result they give our reason little trouble and perhaps contribute to exalt the heroine in our imaginations it is still the mere human grandeur of joannas spirit that we love and reverence the lofty devotedness with which she is transported the generous benevolence the irresistible determination the heavenly mandate is but the means of unfolding these qualities and furnishing them with a proper passport to the minds of her age to have produced without the aid of fictions like these a joanna so beautified and exalted would undoubtedly have yielded greater satisfaction but it may be questioned whether the difficulty would not have increased in a still higher ratio the sentiments the characters are not only accurate but exquisitely beautiful the incidents excepting the very last are possible or even probable what remains is but a very slender evil  after all objections have been urged and this among others has certainly a little weight the maid of orleans will remain one of the very finest of modern dramas perhaps among all schillers plays it is the one which evinces most of that quality denominated genius in the strictest meaning of the word wallenstein embodies more thought more knowledge more conception but it is only in parts illuminated by that ethereal brightness which shines over every part of this the spirit of the romantic ages is here imaged forth but the whole is exalted embellished ennobled it is what the critics call idealised the heart must be cold the imagination dull which the jungfrau von orleans will not move  in germany this case did not occur the reception of the work was beyond example flattering the leading idea suited the german mind the execution of it inflamed the hearts and imaginations of the people they felt proud of their great poet and delighted to enthusiasm with his poetry at the first exhibition of the play in leipzig schiller being in the theatre though not among the audience this feeling was displayed in a rather singular manner when the curtain dropped at the end of the first act there arose on all sides a shout of es lebe friedrich schiller accompanied by the sound of trumpets and other military music at the conclusion of the piece the whole assembly left their places went out and crowded round the door through which the poet was expected to come and no sooner did he show himself than his admiring spectators uncovering their heads made an avenue for him to pass and as he waited along many we are told held up their children and exclaimed that is he36      footnote 36 doering p 176—who adds as follows     another testimony of approval very different in its nature     he received at the first production of the play in weimar     knowing and valuing as he did the public of that city it     could not but surprise him greatly when a certain young     doctor s— called out to him bravo schiller from the     gallery in a very loud tone of voice offended at such     impertinence the poet hissed strongly in which the audience     joined him he likewise expressed in words his displeasure at     this conduct and the youthful sprig of medicine was by     direction of the court farther punished for his indiscreet     applause by some admonitions from the police  this must have been a proud moment for schiller but also an agitating painful one and perhaps on the whole the latter feeling for the time prevailed such noisy formal and tumultuous plaudits were little to his taste the triumph they confer though plentiful is coarse and schillers modest nature made him shun the public gaze not seek it he loved men and did not affect to despise their approbation but neither did this form his leading motive to him art like virtue was its own reward he delighted in his tasks for the sake of the fascinating feelings which they yielded him in their performance poetry was the chosen gift of his mind which his pleasure lay in cultivating in other things he wished not that his habits or enjoyments should be different from those of other men  at weimar his present way of life was like his former one at jena his business was to study and compose his recreations were in the circle of his family where he could abandon himself to affections grave or trifling and in frank and cheerful intercourse with a few friends of the latter he had lately formed a social club the meetings of which afforded him a regular and innocent amusement he still loved solitary walks in the park at weimar he might frequently be seen wandering among the groves and remote avenues with a notebook in his hand now loitering slowly along now standing still now moving rapidly on if any one appeared in sight he would dart into another alley that his dream might not be broken37 one of his favourite resorts we are told was the thicklyovershadowed rocky path which leads to the römische haus a pleasurehouse of the dukes built under the direction of goethe there he would often sit in the gloom of the crags overgrown with cypresses and boxwood shady hedges before him not far from the murmur of a little brook which there gushes in a smooth slaty channel and where some verses of goethe are cut upon a brown plate of stone and fixed in the rock he still continued to study in the night the morning was spent with his children and his wife or in pastimes such as we have noticed in the afternoon he revised what had been last composed wrote letters or visited his friends his evenings were often passed in the theatre it was the only public place of amusement which he ever visited nor was it for the purpose of amusement that he visited this it was his observatory where he watched the effect of scenes and situations devised new schemes of art or corrected old ones to the players he was kind friendly on nights when any of his pieces had been acted successfully or for the first time he used to invite the leaders of the company to a supper in the stadthaus where the time was spent in mirthful diversions one of which was frequently a recitation by genast of the capuchins sermon in wallensteins camp except on such rare occasions he returned home directly from the theatre to light his midnight lamp and commence the most earnest of his labours      footnote 37 whatever he intended to write he first     composed in his head before putting down a line of it on     paper he used to call a work ready so soon as its     existence in his spirit was complete hence in the public     there often were reports that such and such a piece of his     was finished when in the common sense it was not even     begun—jördens lexicon § schiller  the assiduity with which he struggled for improvement in dramatic composition had now produced its natural result the requisitions of his taste no longer hindered the operation of his genius art had at length become a second nature a new proof at once of his fertility and of his solicitude for farther improvement appeared in 1803 the braut von messina was an experiment an attempt to exhibit a modern subject and modern sentiments in an antique garb the principle on which the interest of this play rests is the fatalism of the ancients the plot is of extreme simplicity a chorus also is introduced an elaborate discussion of the nature and uses of that accompaniment being prefixed by way of preface the experiment was not successful with a multitude of individual beauties this bride of messina is found to be ineffectual as a whole it does not move us the great object of every tragedy is not attained the chorus which schiller swerving from the greek models has divided into two contending parts and made to enter and depart with the principals to whom they are attached has in his hands become the medium of conveying many beautiful effusions of poetry but it retards the progress of the plot it dissipates and diffuses our sympathies the interest we should take in the fate and prospects of manuel and cæsar is expended on the fate and prospects of man for beautiful and touching delineations of life for pensive and pathetic reflections sentiments and images conveyed in language simple but nervous and emphatic this tragedy stands high in the rank of modern compositions there is in it a breath of young tenderness and ardour mingled impressively with the feelings of grayhaired experience whose recollections are darkened with melancholy whose very hopes are chequered and solemn the implacable destiny which consigns the brothers to mutual enmity and mutual destruction for the guilt of a past generation involving a mother and a sister in their ruin spreads a sombre hue over all the poem we are not unmoved by the characters of the hostile brothers and we pity the hapless and amiable beatrice the victim of their feud still there is too little action in the play the incidents are too abundantly diluted with reflection the interest pauses flags and fails to produce its full effect for its specimens of lyrical poetry tender affecting sometimes exquisitely beautiful the bride of messina will long deserve a careful perusal but as exemplifying a new form of the drama it has found no imitators and is likely to find none   the slight degree of failure or miscalculation which occurred in the present instance was next year abundantly redeemed wilhelm tell sent out in 1804 is one of schillers very finest dramas it exhibits some of the highest triumphs which his genius combined with his art ever realised the first descent of freedom to our modern world the first unfurling of her standard on the rocky pinnacle of europe is here celebrated in the style which it deserved there is no false timseldecoration about tell no sickly refinement no declamatory sentimentality all is downright simple and agreeable to nature yet all is adorned and purified and rendered beautiful without losing its resemblance an air of freshness and wholesomeness breathes over it we are among honest inoffensive yet fearless peasants untainted by the vices undazzled by the theories of more complex and perverted conditions of society the opening of the first scene sets us down among the alps it is a high rocky shore of the luzern lake opposite to schwytz the lake makes a little bight in the land a hut stands at a short distance from the bank the fisherboy is rowing himself about in his boat beyond the lake on the other side we see the green meadows the hamlets and farms of schwytz lying in the clear sunshine on our left are observed the peaks of the hacken surrounded with clouds to the right and far in the distance appear the glaciers we hear the rance des vaches and the tinkling of cattlebells this first impression never leaves us we are in a scene where all is grand and lovely but it is the loveliness and grandeur of unpretending unadulterated nature these switzers are not arcadian shepherds or speculative patriots there is not one crook or beechen bowl among them and they never mention the social contract or the rights of man they are honest people driven by oppression to assert their privileges and they go to work like men in earnest bent on the despatch of business not on the display of sentiment they are not philosophers or tribunes but frank stalwart landmen even in the field of rütli they do not forget their common feelings the party that arrive first indulge in a harmless little ebullition of parish vanity we are first here they say we unterwaldeners they have not charters or written laws to which they can appeal but they have the traditionary rights of their fathers and bold hearts and strong arms to make them good the rules by which they steer are not deduced from remote premises by a fine process of thought they are the accumulated result of experience transmitted from peasant sire to peasant son there is something singularly pleasing in this exhibition of genuine humanity of wisdom embodied in old adages and practical maxims of prudence of magnanimity displayed in the quiet unpretending discharge of the humblest everyday duties truth is superior to fiction we feel at home among these brave good people their fortune interests us more than that of all the brawling vapid sentimental heroes in creation yet to make them interest us was the very highest problem of art it was to copy lowly nature to give us a copy of it embellished and refined by the agency of genius yet preserving the likeness in every lineament the highest quality of art is to conceal itself these peasants of schillers are what every one imagines he could imitate successfully yet in the hands of any but a true and strongminded poet they dwindle into repulsive coarseness or mawkish insipidity among our own writers who have tried such subjects we remember none that has succeeded equally with schiller one potent but illfated genius has in far different circumstances and with far other means shown that he could have equalled him the cotters saturday night of burns is in its own humble way as quietly beautiful as simplex munditiis as the scenes of tell no other has even approached them though some gifted persons have attempted it mr wordsworth is no ordinary man nor are his pedlars and leechgatherers and dalesmen without their attractions and their moral but they sink into whining drivellers beside rösselmann the priest ulric the smith hans of the wall and the other sturdy confederates of rütli  the skill with which the events are concatenated in this play corresponds to the truth of its delineation of character the incidents of the swiss revolution as detailed in tschudi or müller are here faithfully preserved even to their minutest branches the beauty of schillers descriptions all can relish their fidelity is what surprises every reader who has been in switzerland schiller never saw the scene of his play but his diligence his quickness and intensity of conception supplied this defect mountain and mountaineer conspiracy and action are all brought before us in their true forms all glowing in the mild sunshine of the poets fancy the tyranny of gessler and the misery to which it has reduced the land the exasperation yet patient courage of the people their characters and those of their leaders fürst stauffacher and melchthal their exertions and ultimate success described as they are here keep up a constant interest in the piece it abounds in action as much as the bride of messina is defective in that point  but the finest delineation is undoubtedly the character of wilhelm tell the hero of the swiss revolt and of the present drama in tell are combined all the attributes of a great man without the help of education or of great occasions to develop them his knowledge has been gathered chiefly from his own experience and this is bounded by his native mountains he has had no lessons or examples of splendid virtue no wish or opportunity to earn renown he has grown up to manhood a simple yeoman of the alps among simple yeomen and has never aimed at being more yet we trace in him a deep reflective earnest spirit thirsting for activity yet bound in by the wholesome dictates of prudence a heart benevolent generous unconscious alike of boasting or of fear it is this salubrious air of rustic unpretending honesty that forms the great beauty in tells character all is native all is genuine he does not declaim he dislikes to talk of noble conduct he exhibits it he speaks little of his freedom because he has always enjoyed it and feels that he can always defend it his reasons for destroying gessler are not drawn from jurisconsults and writers on morality but from the everlasting instincts of nature the austrian vogt must die because if not the wife and children of tell will be destroyed by him the scene where the peaceful but indomitable archer sits waiting for gessler in the hollow way among the rocks of küssnacht presents him in a striking light former scenes had shown us tell under many amiable and attractive aspects we knew that he was tender as well as brave that he loved to haunt the mountain tops and inhale in silent dreams the influence of their wild and magnificent beauty we had seen him the most manly and warmhearted of fathers and husbands intrepid modest and decisive in the midst of peril and venturing his life to bring help to the oppressed but here his mind is exalted into stern solemnity its principles of action come before us with greater clearness in this its fiery contest the name of murder strikes a damp across his frank and fearless spirit while the recollection of his children and their mother proclaims emphatically that there is no remedy gessler must perish tell swore it darkly in his secret soul when the monster forced him to aim at the head of his boy and he will keep his oath his thoughts wander to and fro but his volition is unalterable the free and peaceful mountaineer is to become a shedder of blood woe to them that have made him so  travellers come along the pass the unconcern of their everyday existence is strikingly contrasted with the dark and fateful purposes of tell the shallow innocent garrulity of stüssi the forester the maternal vehemence of armgarts wife the hardhearted haughtiness of gessler successively presented to us give an air of truth to the delineation and deepen the impressiveness of the result   act iv scene iii

death of gessler which forms the leading object of the plot happens at the end of the fourth act the fifth occupied with representing the expulsion of his satellites and the final triumph and liberation of the swiss though diversified with occurrences and spectacles moves on with inferior animation a certain want of unity is indeed distinctly felt throughout all the piece the incidents do not point one way there is no connexion or a very slight one between the enterprise of tell and that of the men of rütli this is the principal or rather sole deficiency of the present work a deficiency inseparable from the faithful display of the historical event and far more than compensated by the deeper interest and the wider range of action and delineation which a strict adherence to the facts allows by the present mode of management alpine life in all its length and breadth is placed before us from the feudal halls of attinghausen to ruodi the fisher of the luzern lake and armgart—      the poor wildhayman of the rigiberg     whose trade is on the brow of the abyss     to mow the common grass from craggy shelves     and nooks to which the cattle dare not climb—  we stand as if in presence of the swiss beholding the achievement of their freedom in its minutest circumstances with all its simplicity and unaffected greatness the light of the poets genius is upon the four forest cantons at the opening of the fourteenth century the whole time and scene shine as with the brightness the truth and more than the beauty of reality  the tragedy of tell wants unity of interest and of action but in spite of this it may justly claim the high dignity of ranking with the very best of schillers plays less comprehensive and ambitious than wallenstein less ethereal than the jungfrau it has a look of nature and substantial truth which neither of its rivals can boast of the feelings it inculcates and appeals to are those of universal human nature and presented in their purest most unpretending form there is no highwrought sentiment no poetic love tell loves his wife as honest men love their wives and the episode of bertha and rudenz though beautiful is very brief and without effect on the general result it is delightful and salutary to the heart to wander among the scenes of tell all is lovely yet all is real physical and moral grandeur are united yet both are the unadorned grandeur of nature there are the lakes and green valleys beside us the schreckhorn the jungfrau and their sister peaks with their avalanches and their palaces of ice all glowing in the southern sun and dwelling among them are a race of manly husbandmen heroic without ceasing to be homely poetical without ceasing to be genuine   we have dwelt the longer on this play not only on account of its peculiar fascinations but also—as it is our last schillers faculties had never been more brilliant than at present strong in mature age in rare and varied accomplishments he was now reaping the full fruit of his studious vigils the rapidity with which he wrote such noble poems at once betokened the exuberant riches of his mind and the prompt command which he enjoyed of them still all that he had done seemed but a fraction of his appointed task a bold imagination was carrying him forward into distant untouched fields of thought and poetry where triumphs yet more glorious were to be gained schemes of new writings new kinds of writing were budding in his fancy he was yet as he had ever been surrounded by a multitude of projects and full of ardour to labour in fulfilling them but schillers labours and triumphs were drawing to a close the invisible messenger was already near which overtakes alike the busy and the idle which arrests man in the midst of his pleasures or his occupations and changes his countenance and sends him away  in 1804 having been at berlin witnessing the exhibition of his wilhelm tell he was seized while returning with a paroxysm of that malady which for many years had never wholly left him the attack was fierce and violent it brought him to the verge of the grave but he escaped once more was considered out of danger and again resumed his poetical employments besides various translations from the french and italian he had sketched a tragedy on the history of perkin warbeck and finished two acts of one on that of a kindred but more fortunate impostor dimitri of russia his mind it would appear was also frequently engaged with more solemn and sublime ideas the universe of human thought he had now explored and enjoyed but he seems to have found no permanent contentment in any of its provinces many of his later poems indicate an incessant and increasing longing for some solution of the mystery of life at times it is a gloomy resignation to the want and the despair of any his ardent spirit could not satisfy itself with things seen though gilded with all the glories of intellect and imagination it soared away in search of other lands looking with unutterable desire for some surer and brighter home beyond the horizon of this world death he had no reason to regard as probably a near event but we easily perceive that the awful secrets connected with it had long been familiar to his contemplation the veil which hid them from his eyes was now shortly when he looked not for it to be rent asunder  the spring of 1805 which schiller had anticipated with no ordinary hopes of enjoyment and activity came on in its course cold bleak and stormy and along with it his sickness returned the help of physicians was vain the unwearied services of trembling affection were vain his disorder kept increasing on the 9th of may it reached a crisis early in the morning of that day he grew insensible and by degrees delirious among his expressions the word lichtenberg was frequently noticed a word of no import indicating as some thought the writer of that name whose works he had lately been reading according to others the castle of leuchtenberg which a few days before his sickness he had been proposing to visit the poet and the sage was soon to lie low but his friends were spared the farther pain of seeing him depart in madness the fiery canopy of physical suffering which had bewildered and blinded his thinking faculties was drawn aside and the spirit of schiller looked forth in its wonted serenity once again before it passed away forever after noon his delirium abated about four oclock he fell into a soft sleep from which he ere long awoke in full possession of his senses restored to consciousness in that hour when the soul is cut off from human help and man must front the king of terrors on his own strength schiller did not faint or fail in this his last and sharpest trial feeling that his end was come he addressed himself to meet it as became him not with affected carelessness or superstitious fear but with the quiet unpretending manliness which had marked the tenor of his life of his friends and family he took a touching but a tranquil farewell he ordered that his funeral should be private without pomp or parade some one inquiring how he felt he said calmer and calmer simple but memorable words expressive of the mild heroism of the man about six he sank into a deep sleep once for a moment he looked up with a lively air and said many things were growing plain and clear to him again he closed his eyes and his sleep deepened and deepened till it changed into the sleep from which there is no awakening and all that remained of schiller was a lifeless form soon to be mingled with the clods of the valley   the news of schillers death fell cold on many a heart not in germany alone but over europe it was regarded as a public loss by all who understood its meaning in weimar especially the scene of his noblest efforts the abode of his chosen friends the sensation it produced was deep and universal the public places of amusement were shut all ranks made haste to testify their feelings to honour themselves and the deceased by tributes to his memory it was friday when schiller died his funeral was meant to be on sunday but the state of his remains made it necessary to proceed before doering thus describes the ceremony  according to his own directions the bier was to be borne by private burghers of the city but several young artists and students out of reverence for the deceased took it from them it was between midnight and one in the morning when they approached the churchyard the overclouded heaven threatened rain but as the bier was set down beside the grave the clouds suddenly split asunder and the moon coming forth in peaceful clearness threw her first rays on the coffin of the departed they lowered him into the grave and the moon again retired behind her clouds a fierce tempest of wind began to howl as if it were reminding the bystanders of their great irreparable loss at this moment who could have applied without emotion the poets own words      alas the ruddy morning tinges         a silent cold sepulchral stone     and evening throws her crimson fringes         but round his slumber dark and lone  so lived and so died friedrich schiller a man on whose history other men will long dwell with a mingled feeling of reverence and love our humble record of his life and writings is drawing to an end yet we still linger loth to part with a spirit so dear to us from the scanty and too much neglected field of his biography a few slight facts and indications may still be gleaned slight but distinctive of him as an individual and not to be despised in a penury so great and so unmerited  schillers age was fortyfive years and a few months when he died38 sickness had long wasted his form which at no time could boast of faultless symmetry he was tall and strongly boned but unmuscular and lean his body it might be perceived was wasting under the energy of a spirit too keen for it his face was pale the cheeks and temples rather hollow the chin somewhat deep and slightly projecting the nose irregularly aquiline his hair inclined to auburn withal his countenance was attractive and had a certain manly beauty the lips were curved together in a line expressing delicate and honest sensibility a silent enthusiasm impetuosity not unchecked by melancholy gleamed in his softly kindled eyes and pale cheeks and the brow was high and thoughtful to judge from his portraits schillers face expressed well the features of his mind it is mildness tempering strength fiery ardour shining through the clouds of suffering and disappointment deep but patiently endured pale was its proper tint the cheeks and temples were best hollow there are few faces that affect us more than schillers it is at once meek tender unpretending and heroic      footnote 38 he left a widow two sons and two daughters     of whom we regret to say that we have learned nothing of     his three sisters the youngest died before him the eldest     is married to the hofrath reinwald in meinungen the second     to herr frankh the clergyman of meckmuhl in würtemberg     doering  in his dress and manner as in all things he was plain and unaffected among strangers something shy and retiring might occasionally be observed in him in his own family or among his select friends he was kindhearted free and gay as a little child in public his external appearance had nothing in it to strike or attract of an unpresuming aspect wearing plain apparel his looks as he walked were constantly bent on the ground so that frequently as we are told he failed to notice the salutation of a passing acquaintance but if he heard it he would catch hastily at his hat and give his cordial guten tag modesty simplicity a total want of all parade or affectation were conspicuous in him these are the usual concomitants of true greatness and serve to mitigate its splendour common things he did as a common man his conduct in such matters was uncalculated spontaneous and therefore natural and pleasing  concerning his mental character the greater part of what we had to say has been already said in speaking of his works the most cursory perusal of these will satisfy us that he had a mind of the highest order grand by nature and cultivated by the assiduous study of a lifetime it is not the predominating force of any one faculty that impresses us in schiller but the general force of all every page of his writings bears the stamp of internal vigour new truths new aspects of known truth bold thought happy imagery lofty emotion schiller would have been no common man though he had altogether wanted the qualities peculiar to poets his intellect is clear deep and comprehensive its deductions frequently elicited from numerous and distant premises are presented under a magnificent aspect in the shape of theorems embracing an immense multitude of minor propositions yet it seems powerful and vast rather than quick or keen for schiller is not notable for wit though his fancy is ever prompt with its metaphors illustrations comparisons to decorate and point the perceptions of his reason the earnestness of his temper farther disqualified him for this his tendency was rather to adore the grand and the lofty than to despise the little and the mean perhaps his greatest faculty was a halfpoetical halfphilosophical imagination a faculty teeming with magnificence and brilliancy now adorning or aiding to erect a stately pyramid of scientific speculation now brooding over the abysses of thought and feeling till thoughts and feelings else unutterable were embodied in expressive forms and palaces and landscapes glowing in ethereal beauty rose like exhalations from the bosom of the deep  combined and partly of kindred with these intellectual faculties was that vehemence of temperament which is necessary for their full development schillers heart was at once fiery and tender impetuous soft affectionate his enthusiasm clothed the universe with grandeur and sent his spirit forth to explore its secrets and mingle warmly in its interests thus poetry in schiller was not one but many gifts it was not the lean and flashy song of an ear apt for harmony combined with a maudlin sensibility or a mere animal ferocity of passion and an imagination creative chiefly because unbridled it was what true poetry is always the quintessence of general mental riches the purified result of strong thought and conception and of refined as well as powerful emotion in his writings we behold him a moralist a philosopher a man of universal knowledge in each of these capacities he is great but also in more for all that he achieves in these is brightened and gilded with the touch of another quality his maxims his feelings his opinions are transformed from the lifeless shape of didactic truths into living shapes that address faculties far finer than the understanding  the gifts by which such transformation is effected the gift of pure ardent tender sensibility joined to those of fancy and imagination are perhaps not wholly denied to any man endowed with the power of reason possessed in various degrees of strength they add to the products of mere intellect corresponding tints of new attractiveness in a degree great enough to be remarkable they constitute a poet of this peculiar faculty how much had fallen to schillers lot we need not attempt too minutely to explain without injuring his reputation it may be admitted that in general his works exhibit rather extraordinary strength than extraordinary fineness or versatility his power of dramatic imitation is perhaps never of the very highest the shakspearean kind and in its best state it is farther limited to a certain range of characters it is with the grave the earnest the exalted the affectionate the mournful that he succeeds he is not destitute of humour as his wallensteins camp will show but neither is he rich in it and for sprightly ridicule in any of its forms he has seldom shown either taste or talent chance principally made the drama his department he might have shone equally in many others the vigorous and copious invention the knowledge of life of men and things displayed in his theatrical pieces might have been available in very different pursuits frequently the charm of his works has little to distinguish it from the charm of intellectual and moral force in general it is often the capacious thought the vivid imagery the impetuous feeling of the orator rather than the wild pathos and capricious enchantment of the poet yet that he was capable of rising to the loftiest regions of poetry no reader of his maid of orleans his character of thekla or many other of his pieces will hesitate to grant sometimes we suspect that it is the very grandeur of his general powers which prevents us from exclusively admiring his poetic genius we are not lulled by the syren song of poetry because her melodies are blended with the clearer manlier tones of serious reason and of honest though exalted feeling  much laborious discussion has been wasted in defining genius particularly by the countrymen of schiller some of whom have narrowed the conditions of the term so far as to find but three men of genius since the world was created homer shakspeare and goethe from such rigid precision applied to a matter in itself indefinite there may be an apparent but there is no real increase of accuracy the creative power the faculty not only of imitating given forms of being but of imagining and representing new ones which is here attributed with such distinctness and so sparingly has been given by nature in complete perfection to no man nor entirely denied to any the shades of it cannot be distinguished by so loose a scale as language a definition of genius which excludes such a mind as schillers will scarcely be agreeable to philosophical correctness and it will tend rather to lower than to exalt the dignity of the word possessing all the general mental faculties in their highest degree of strength an intellect ever active vast powerful farsighted an imagination never weary of producing grand or beautiful forms a heart of the noblest temper sympathies comprehensive yet ardent feelings vehement impetuous yet full of love and kindliness and tender pity conscious of the rapid and fervid exercise of all these powers within him and able farther to present their products refined and harmonised and married to immortal verse schiller may or may not be called a man of genius by his critics but his mind in either case will remain one of the most enviable which can fall to the share of a mortal  in a poet worthy of that name the powers of the intellect are indissolubly interwoven with the moral feelings and the exercise of his art depends not more on the perfection of the one than of the other the poet who does not feel nobly and justly as well as passionately will never permanently succeed in making others feel the forms of error and falseness infinite in number are transitory in duration truth of thought and sentiment but chiefly of sentiment truth alone is eternal and unchangeable but happily a delight in the products of reason and imagination can scarcely ever be divided from at least a love for virtue and genuine greatness our feelings are in favour of heroism we wish to be pure and perfect happy he whose resolutions are so strong or whose temptations are so weak that he can convert these feelings into action the severest pang of which a proud and sensitive nature can be conscious is the perception of its own debasement the sources of misery in life are many vice is one of the surest any human creature tarnished with guilt will in general be wretched a man of genius in that case will be doubly so for his ideas of excellence are higher his sense of failure is more keen in such miseries schiller had no share the sentiments which animated his poetry were converted into principles of conduct his actions were as blameless as his writings were pure with his simple and high predilections with his strong devotedness to a noble cause he contrived to steer through life unsullied by its meanness unsubdued by any of its difficulties or allurements with the world in fact he had not much to do without effort he dwelt apart from it its prizes were not the wealth which could enrich him his great almost his single aim was to unfold his spiritual faculties to study and contemplate and improve their intellectual creations bent upon this with the steadfastness of an apostle the more sordid temptations of the world passed harmlessly over him wishing not to seem but to be envy was a feeling of which he knew but little even before he rose above its level wealth or rank he regarded as a means not an end his own humble fortune supplying him with all the essential conveniences of life the world had nothing more that he chose to covet nothing more that it could give him he was not rich but his habits were simple and except by reason of his sickness and its consequences unexpensive at all times he was far above the meanness of selfinterest particularly in its meanest shape a love of money doering tells us that a bookseller having travelled from a distance expressly to offer him a higher price for the copyright of wallenstein at that time in the press and for which he was on terms with cotta of tübingen schiller answering cotta deals steadily with me and i with him sent away this new merchant without even the hope of a future bargain the anecdote is small but it seems to paint the integrity of the man careless of pecuniary concerns in comparison with the strictest uprightness in his conduct in fact his real wealth lay in being able to pursue his darling studies and to live in the sunshine of friendship and domestic love this he had always longed for this he at last enjoyed and though sickness and many vexations annoyed him the intrinsic excellence of his nature chequered the darkest portions of their gloom with an effulgence derived from himself the ardour of his feelings tempered by benevolence was equable and placid his temper though overflowing with generous warmth seems almost never to have shown any hastiness or anger to all men he was humane and sympathising among his friends openhearted generous helpful in the circle of his family kind tender sportive and what gave an especial charm to all this was the unobtrusiveness with which it was attended there was no parade no display no particle of affectation rating and conducting himself simply as an honest man and citizen he became greater by forgetting that he was great  such were the prevailing habits of schiller that in the mild and beautiful brilliancy of their aspect there must have been some specks and imperfections the common lot of poor humanity who knows not that these were small and transient we judge from the circumstance that scarcely any hint of them has reached us nor are we anxious to obtain a full description of them for practical uses we can sufficiently conjecture what they were and the heart desires not to dwell upon them this man is passed away from our dim and tarnished world let him have the benefit of departed friends let him be transfigured in our thoughts and shine there without the little blemishes that clung to him in life  schiller gives a fine example of the german character he has all its good qualities in a high degree with very few of its defects we trace in him all that downrightness and simplicity that sincerity of heart and mind for which the germans are remarked their enthusiasm their patient longcontinuing earnest devotedness their imagination delighting in the lofty and magnificent their intellect rising into refined abstractions stretching itself into comprehensive generalisations but the excesses to which such a character is liable are in him prevented by a firm and watchful sense of propriety his simplicity never degenerates into ineptitude or insipidity his enthusiasm must be based on reason he rarely suffers his love of the vast to betray him into toleration of the vague the boy schiller was extravagant but the man admits no bombast in his style no inflation in his thoughts or actions he is the poet of truth our understandings and consciences are satisfied while our hearts and imaginations are moved his fictions are emphatically nature copied and embellished his sentiments are refined and touchingly beautiful but they are likewise manly and correct they exalt and inspire but they do not mislead above all he has no cant in any of its thousand branches ridiculous or hateful none he does not distort his character or genius into shapes which he thinks more becoming than their natural one he does not hang out principles which are not his or harbour beloved persuasions which he half or wholly knows to be false he did not often speak of wholesome prejudices he did not embrace the roman catholic religion because it was the grandest and most comfortable truth with schiller or what seemed such was an indispensable requisite if he but suspected an opinion to be false however dear it may have been he seems to have examined it with rigid scrutiny and if he found it guilty to have plucked it out and resolutely cast it forth the sacrifice might cause him pain permanent pain real damage he imagined it could hardly cause him it is irksome and dangerous to travel in the dark but better so than with an ignisfatuus to guide us considering the warmth of his sensibilities schillers merit on this point is greater than we might at first suppose for a man with whom intellect is the ruling or exclusive faculty whose sympathies loves hatreds are comparatively coarse and dull it may be easy to avoid this halfwilful entertainment of error and this cant which is the consequence and sign of it but for a man of keen tastes a large fund of innate probity is necessary to prevent his aping the excellence which he loves so much yet is unable to attain among persons of the latter sort it is extremely rare to meet with one completely unaffected schillers other noble qualities would not have justice did we neglect to notice this the truest proof of their nobility honest unpretending manly simplicity pervades all parts of his character and genius and habits of life we not only admire him we trust him and love him  the character of childlike simplicity he has himself observed39 which genius impresses on its works it shows also in its private life and manners it is bashful for nature is ever so but it is not prudish for only corruption is prudish it is clearsighted for nature can never be the contrary but it is not cunning for this only art can be it is faithful to its character and inclinations but not so much because it is directed by principles as because after all vibrations nature constantly reverts to her original position constantly renews her primitive demand it is modest nay timid for genius is always a secret to itself but it is not anxious for it knows not the dangers of the way which it travels of the private habits of the persons who have been peculiarly distinguished by their genius our information is small but the little that has been recorded for us of the chief of them—of sophocles archimedes hippocrates and in modern times of dante and tasso of rafaelle albrecht dürer cervantes shakspeare fielding and others—confirms this observation schiller himself confirms it perhaps more strongly than most of the examples here adduced no man ever wore his faculties more meekly or performed great works with less consciousness of their greatness abstracted from the contemplation of himself his eye was turned upon the objects of his labour and he pursued them with the eagerness the entireness the spontaneous sincerity of a boy pursuing sport hence this childlike simplicity the last perfection of his other excellencies his was a mighty spirit unheedful of its might he walked the earth in calm power the staff of his spear was like a weavers beam but he wielded it like a wand      footnote 39 naive und sentimentalische dichtung   such so far as we can represent it is the form in which schillers life and works have gradually painted their character in the mind of a secluded individual whose solitude he has often charmed whom he has instructed and cheered and moved the original impression we know was faint and inadequate the present copy of it is still more so yet we have sketched it as we could the figure of schiller and of the figures he conceived and drew are there himself and in his hand a glass which shows us many more to those who look on him as we have wished to make them schiller will not need a farther panegyric for the sake of literature it may still be remarked that his merit was peculiarly due to her literature was his creed the dictate of his conscience he was an apostle of the sublime and beautiful and this his calling made a hero of him for it was in the spirit of a true man that he viewed it and undertook to cultivate it and its inspirations constantly maintained the noblest temper in his soul the end of literature was not in schillers judgment to amuse the idle or to recreate the busy by showy spectacles for the imagination or quaint paradoxes and epigrammatic disquisitions for the understanding least of all was it to gratify in any shape the selfishness of its professors to minister to their malignity their love of money or even of fame for persons who degrade it to such purposes the deepest contempt of which his kindly nature could admit was at all times in store unhappy mortal says he to the literary tradesman the man who writes for gain unhappy mortal who with science and art the noblest of all instruments effectest and attemptest nothing more than the daydrudge with the meanest who in the domain of perfect freedom bearest about in thee the spirit of slave as schiller viewed it genuine literature includes the essence of philosophy religion art whatever speaks to the immortal part of man the daughter she is likewise the nurse of all that is spiritual and exalted in our character the boon she bestows is truth truth not merely physical political economical such as the sensual man in us is perpetually demanding ever ready to reward and likely in general to find but truth of moral feeling truth of taste that inward truth in its thousand modifications which only the most ethereal portion of our nature can discern but without which that portion of it languishes and dies and we are left divested of our birthright thenceforward of the earth earthy machines for earning and enjoying no longer worthy to be called the sons of heaven the treasures of literature are thus celestial imperishable beyond all price with her is the shrine of our best hopes the palladium of pure manhood to be among the guardians and servants of this is the noblest function that can be intrusted to a mortal genius even in its faintest scintillations is the inspired gift of god a solemn mandate to its owner to go forth and labour in his sphere to keep alive the sacred fire among his brethren which the heavy and polluted atmosphere of this world is forever threatening to extinguish woe to him if he neglect this mandate if he hear not its small still voice woe to him if he turn this inspired gift into the servant of his evil or ignoble passions if he offer it on the altar of vanity if he sell it for a piece of money  the artist it is true says schiller is the son of his age but pity for him if he is its pupil or even its favourite let some beneficent divinity snatch him when a suckling from the breast of his mother and nurse him with the milk of a better time that he may ripen to his full stature beneath a distant grecian sky and having grown to manhood let him return a foreign shape into his century not however to delight it by his presence but terrible like the son of agamemnon to purify it the matter of his works he will take from the present but their form he will derive from a nobler time nay from beyond all time from the absolute unchanging unity of his nature here from the pure æther of his spiritual essence flows down the fountain of beauty uncontaminated by the pollutions of ages and generations which roll to and fro in their turbid vortex far beneath it his matter caprice can dishonour as she has ennobled it but the chaste form is withdrawn from her mutations the roman of the first century had long bent the knee before his cæsars when the statues of rome were still standing erect the temples continued holy to the eye when their gods had long been a laughingstock and the abominations of a nero and a commodus were silently rebuked by the style of the edifice which lent them its concealment man has lost his dignity but art has saved it and preserved it for him in expressive marbles truth still lives in fiction and from the copy the original will be restored  but how is the artist to guard himself from the corruptions of his time which on every side assail him by despising its decisions let him look upwards to his dignity and his mission not downwards to his happiness and his wants free alike from the vain activity that longs to impress its traces on the fleeting instant and from the discontented spirit of enthusiasm that measures by the scale of perfection the meagre product of reality let him leave to common sense which is here at home the province of the actual while he strives from the union of the possible with the necessary to bring out the ideal this let him imprint and express in fiction and truth imprint it in the sport of his imagination and the earnest of his actions imprint it in all sensible and spiritual forms and cast it silently into everlasting time40      footnote 40 Über die æsthetische erziehung des menschen  nor were these sentiments be it remembered the mere boasting manifesto of a hotbrained inexperienced youth entering on literature with feelings of heroic ardour which its difficulties and temptations would soon deaden or pervert they are the calm principles of a man expressed with honest manfulness at a period when the world could compare them with a long course of conduct in this just and lofty spirit schiller undertook the business of literature in the same spirit he pursued it with unflinching energy all the days of his life the common and some uncommon difficulties of a fluctuating and dependent existence could not quench or abate his zeal sickness itself seemed hardly to affect him during his last fifteen years he wrote his noblest works yet as it has been proved too well no day of that period could have passed without its load of pain41 pain could not turn him from his purpose or shake his equanimity in death itself he was calmer and calmer nor has he gone without his recompense to the credit of the world it can be recorded that their suffrages which he never courted were liberally bestowed on him happier than the mighty milton he found fit hearers even in his lifetime and they were not few his effect on the mind of his own country has been deep and universal and bids fair to be abiding his effect on other countries must in time be equally decided for such nobleness of heart and soul shadowed forth in beautiful imperishable emblems is a treasure which belongs not to one nation but to all in another age this schiller will stand forth in the foremost rank among the masterspirits of his century and be admitted to a place among the chosen of all centuries his works the memory of what he did and was will rise afar off like a towering landmark in the solitude of the past when distance shall have dwarfed into invisibility the lesser people that encompassed him and hid him from the near beholder      footnote 41 on a surgical inspection of his body after     death the most vital organs were found totally deranged     the structure of the lungs was in great part destroyed the     cavities of the heart were nearly grown up the liver had     become hard and the gallbladder was extended to an     extraordinary size doering  on the whole we may pronounce him happy his days passed in the contemplation of ideal grandeurs he lived among the glories and solemnities of universal nature his thoughts were of sages and heroes and scenes of elysian beauty it is true he had no rest no peace but he enjoyed the fiery consciousness of his own activity which stands in place of it for men like him it is true he was long sickly but did he not even then conceive and bodyforth max piccolomini and thekla and the maid of orleans and the scenes of wilhelm tell it is true he died early but the student will exclaim with charles xii in another case was it not enough of life when he had conquered kingdoms these kingdoms which schiller conquered were not for one nation at the expense of suffering to another they were soiled by no patriots blood no widows no orphans tear they are kingdoms conquered from the barren realms of darkness to increase the happiness and dignity and power of all men new forms of truth new maxims of wisdom new images and scenes of beauty won from the void and formless infinite a κτημα ες αιει a possession forever to all the generations of the earth

mine brought home to me from his tour in germany a small book by a herr saupe one of the headmasters of gera highschool—book entitled schiller and his fathers household42—of which though it has been before the world these twenty years and more i had not heard till then the good little book—an altogether modest lucid exact and amiable though not very lively performance offering new little facts about the schiller world or elucidations and once or twice a slight correction of the old—proved really interesting and instructive awoke in me especially multifarious reflections mournfully beautiful old memories—and led to farther readings in other books touching on the same subject particularly in these three mentioned below43—the first two of them earlier than saupes the third later and slightly corrective of him once or twice—all which agreeably employed me for some weeks and continued to be rather a pious recreation than any labour      footnote 42 schiller und sein väterliches

there was meanwhile added another not less unexpected a message namely from bibliopolic headquarters that my own poor old book on schiller was to be reprinted and that in this peoples edition it would want on deduction of the german piece by goethe which had gone into the library edition but which had no fitness here some sixty or seventy pages for the proper size of the volume saupe which i was still reading or idly readingabout offered the ready expedient—and here accordingly saupe is i have had him faithfully translated and with some small omissions or abridgments slight transposals here and there for clearness sake and one or two elucidative patches gathered from the three subsidiary books already named all duly distinguished from saupes text—whereby the gap or deficit of pages is well filled up almost of its own accord and thus i can now certify that in all essential respects the authentic saupe is here made accessible to english readers as to german and hope that to many lovers of schiller among us who are likely to be lovers also of humbly beautiful human worth and of such an unconsciously noble scene of poverty made richer than any california as that of the elder schiller household here manifests it may be a welcome and even profitable bit of reading  chelsea nov 1872  t c                                     saupes                  schiller and his fathers household                               i the father  schillers father johann caspar schiller was born at bittenfeld a parish hamlet in the ancient part of würtemberg a little north of waiblingen on the 27th october 1723 he had not yet completed his tenth year when his father johannes schiller schultheiss petty magistrate of the village and by trade a baker died at the age of fiftyone soon after which the fatherless boy hardly fitted out with the most essential elements of education had to quit school and was apprenticed to a surgeon with whom according to the then custom he was to learn the art of surgery but in reality had little more to do than follow the common employment of a barber  after completing his apprenticeship and prooftime the pushing young lad eager to get forward in the world went during the austriansuccession war in the year 1745 with a bavarian hussar regiment as armydoctor into the netherlands here as his active mind found no full employment in the practice of his art he willingly undertook withal the duties of a subofficer in small military enterprises on the peace of aixlachapelle 1748 when a part of this regiment was disbanded and schiller with them he returned to his homeland and set himself down in marbach a pleasant little country town on the neckar as practical surgeon there here in 1749 he married the poets mother then a young girl of sixteen elisabetha dorothea born at marbach in the year 1733 the daughter of a respectable townsman georg friedrich kodweis who to his trade of baker adding that of innkeeper and woodmeasurer had gathered a little fortune and was at this time counted welloff though afterwards by some great inundation of the neckar date not given he was again reduced to poverty the brave man by this unavoidable mischance came by degrees so low that he had to giveup his house in the marketplace and in the end to dwell in a poor hut as porter at one of the tollgates of marbach elisabetha was a comely girl to look upon slender wellformed without quite being tall the neck long hair highblond almost red brow broad eyes as if a little sorish face covered with freckles but with all these features enlivened by a soft expression of kindliness and goodnature  this marriage for the first eight years was childless after that they gradually had six children two of whom died soon after birth the poet schiller was the second of these six and the only boy the young couple had to live in a very narrow almost needy condition as neither of them had any fortune and the husbands business could hardly support a household there is still in existence a legal marriage record and inventory such as is usual in these cases which estimates the money and moneys worth brought together by the young people at a little over 700 gulden 70l out of the same inventory one sees by the small value put upon the surgical instruments and the outstanding debts of patients distinctly enough that caspar schillers practice at that point of time did not much exceed that of a thirdclass surgeon and was scarcely adequate as above stated to support the thriftiest household and therefore it is not surprising that schiller intent on improving so bare a position should at the breakingout of the sevenyears war have anew sought a military appointment as withal more fit for employing his young strength and ambitions  in the beginning of the year 1757 he went accordingly as ensign and adjutant into the würtemberg regiment prince louis which in several of the campaigns in the sevenyears war belonged to an auxiliary corps of the austrian army—was he at the ball of fulda one wonders yes for certain he was at the ball of fulda tragicomical explosion of a ball not yet got to the dancingpoint and had to run for life as his duke in a highlyridiculous manner had already done and again tragically it is certain that he stood on the fated austrian leftwing at the battle of leuthen had his horse shot under him there and was himself nearly drowned in a quagmire struggling towards breslau that night44      footnote 44 see life of friedrich book xix chap 8     book xviii chap 10 and schiller seniors rough bit of     autobiography called meine lebensgeschichte in     schillers beziehungen zu eltern geschwistern und der     familie von wolzogen mentioned above p 1 et seqq  in bohemia this corps was visited by an infectious fever and suffered by the almost pestilential disorder a good deal of loss in this bad time schiller who by his temperance and frequent movement in the open air had managed to retain perfect health showed himself very active and helpful and cheerfully undertook every kind of business in which he could be of use he attended the sick there being a scarcity of doctors and served at the same time as chaplain to the regiment so far as to lead the psalmody and read the prayers when after this he was changed into another würtemberg regiment which served in hessen and thüringen he employed every free hour in filling up by his own industrious study the many deeplyfelt defects in his young schooling and was earnestly studious by his perseverant zeal and diligence he succeeded in the course of these waryears in acquiring not only many medical military and agricultural branches of knowledge but also as his letters prove in amassing a considerable amount of general culture nor did his praiseworthy efforts remain without recognition and external reward at the end of the sevenyears war he had risen to be a captain and had even saved a little money  his wife who during these wartimes lived on money sent by him in her fathers house at marbach he could only visit seldom and for short periods in winterquarters much as he longed for his faithful wife who after the birth of a daughter in september 1757 was dearer to him than ever but never had the rigid fetters of wardiscipline appeared more oppressive than when two years later in november 1759 a son the poet was born with joyful thanks to god he saluted this dear gift of heaven in daily prayer commended mother and child to the being of all beings and waited now with impatience the time when he should revisit his home and those that were his there yet there still passed four years before father schiller on conclusion of the hubertsburg peace 1763 could return home from the war and again take up his permanent residence in his homecountry where on his return his first garrison quarters were whether at ludwigsburg cannstadt or what other place is not known on the other hand all likelihoods are that so soon as he could find it possible he carried over his wife and his two children the little daughter christophine six and the little friedrich now four out of marbach to his own quarters wherever these were  there is no date to the neckar inundation above mentioned but we have elsewhere evidence that the worthy father kodweis with his wife at this time still dwelt in their comfortable house in the marketplace we know also though it is not mentioned in the text that their pious daughter struggled zealously to the last to alleviate their sore poverty and the small effect so far as money goes may testify how poor and straitened the schiller family itself then was  with the fathers return out of war there came a new element into the family which had so long been deprived of its natural guardian and counsellor to be housefather in the full sense of the word was now all the more captain schillers need and duty the longer his warservice had kept him excluded from the sacred vocation of husband and father for he was throughout a rational and just man simple strong expert active for practical life if also somewhat quick and rough this announced itself even in the outward make and look of him for he was of short stout stature and powerful make of limbs the brow higharched eyes sharp and keen withal his erect carriage his firm step his neat clothing as well as his clear and decisive mode of speech all testified of strict military training which also extended itself over his whole domestic life and even over the daily devotions of the family for although the shallow illuminationism of that period had produced some influence on his religious convictions he held fast by the pious principles of his forebears read regularly to his household out of the bible and pronounced aloud each day the morning and evening prayer and this was in his case not merely an outward decorous bit of discipline but in fact the faithful expression of his christian conviction that mans true worth and true happiness can alone be found in the fear of the lord and the moral purity of his heart and conduct he himself had even in the manner of those days composed a long prayer which he in later years addressed to god every morning and which began with the following lines      true watcher of israel     to thee be praise thanks and honour     praying aloud i praise thee     that earth and heaven may hear45      footnote 45      treuer wächter israels      dir sei preis und dank und ehren      laut betend lob ich dich      dass es erd und himmel hören c  if therefore a certain otherwise accredited witness calls him a kind of crotchety fantastic person mostly brooding over strange thoughts and enterprises this can only have meant that caspar schiller in earlier years appeared such namely at the time when as incipient surgeon at marbach he saw himself forced into a circle of activity which corresponded neither to his inclination strength nor necessities   on the spiritual development of his son this conscientious father employed his warmest interest and activities and appears to have been for some time assisted herein by a near relation a certain johann friedrich schiller from bittenfeld the same who as studiosus philosophiæ was in 1759 godfather to the boy he is said to have given the little godson fritz his first lessons in writing naturalhistory and geography a more effective assistance in this matter the father soon after met with on removing to lorch  in the year 1765 the reigning duke karl of würtemberg sent captain schiller as recruiting officer to the imperial freetown schwäbishgmünd with permission to live with his family in the nearest würtemberg place the village and cloister of lorch lorch lies in a green meadowground surrounded by beechwoods at the foot of a hill which is crowned by the weird buildings of the cloister where the hohenstaufen graves are opposite the cloister and hamlet rise the venerable ruins of hohenstaufen itself with a series of hills at the bottom winds the rems a branch of the neckar towards still fruitfuler regions in this attractive rural spot the schiller family resided for several years and found from the pious and kindly people of the hamlet and especially from a friend of the house moser the worthy parishparson there the kindliest reception the schiller children soon felt themselves at home and happy in lorch especially fritz did who in the parsons son christoph ferdinand moser a soft gentle child met with his first boyfriend in this worthy parsons house he also received along with the parsons own sons the first regular and accurate instruction in reading and writing as also in the elements of latin and greek this arrangement pleased and comforted captain schiller not a little for the more distinctly he with his clear and candid character recognised the insufficiency of his own instruction and stock of knowledge the more impressively it lay on him that his son should early acquire a good foundation in languages and science and learn something solid and effective what he could himself do in that particular he faithfully did bringing out with this purpose partly the grand historical memorials of that neighbourhood partly his own lifeexperiences in instructive and exciting dialogues with his children he would point out to the listening little pair the venerable remains of the hohenstaufen ancestral castle or tell them of his own soldiercareer he took the boy with him into the exercise camp to the woodmen in the forest and even into the fartherdistant pleasurecastle of hohenheim and thereby led their youthful imagination into many changeful imaginings of life46      footnote 46 saupe p 11  externally little fritz and his sister were not like christophine more resembling the father whilst friedrich was the image of the mother on the other hand they had internally very much in common both possessed a lively apprehension for whatever was true beautiful or good both had a temper capable of enthusiasm which early and chiefly turned towards the sublime and grand in short the strings of their souls were tuned on a cognate tone add to this that both in the beautifulest happiest period of their life had been under the sole care and direction of the pious genial mother and that fritz at least till his sixth year was exclusively limited to christophines society and had no other companion they two had to be and were all to each other christophine on this account stood nearer to her brother throughout all his life than the sisters who were born later  in rural stillness and in almost uninterrupted converse with outdoor nature flowed by for fritz and her the greatest part of their childhood and youth especially dear to them was their abode in this romantic region every hour that was free from teaching or other task they employed in roaming about in the neighbourhood and they knew no higher joy than a ramble into the neighbouring hills in particular they liked to make pilgrimages together to a chapel on the calvary hill at gmünd a few miles off to which the way was still through the old monkish griefstations on to the cloister of lorch noticed above often they would sit with closelygrasped hands under the thousandyearsold linden which stood on a projection before the cloisterwalls and seemed to whisper to them longsilent tales of past ages on these walks the hearts of the two clasped each other ever closer and more firmly and they faithfully shared their little childish joys and sorrows christophine would bitterly weep when her vivacious brother had committed some small misdeed and was punished for it in such cases she often enough confessed fritzs faults as her own and was punished when she had in reality had no complicity in them it was with great sorrow that they two parted from their little paradise and both of them always retained a great affection for lorch and its neighbourhood christophine who lived to be ninety often even in her latter days looked back with tender affection to their abode there47      footnote 47 saupe pp 106108   in his familycircle the otherwise hardmannered father showed always to mother and daughters the tenderest respect and the affectionate tone which the heart suggests thus if at table a dish had chanced to be especially prepared for him he would never eat of it without first inviting the daughters to be helped as little could he ever in the longrun withstand the requests of his gentle wife so that not seldom she managed to soften his rough severity the children learned to make use of this feature in his character and would thereby save themselves from the first outburst of his anger they confessed beforehand to the mother their bits of misdoings and begged her to inflict the punishment and prevent their falling into the heavier paternal hand towards the son again whose moral development his father anxiously watched over his wrath was at times disarmed by touches of courage and fearlessness on the boys part thus little fritz once on a visit at hohenheim in the house where his father was calling and which formed part of the sidebuildings of the castle whilst his father followed his business within doors had unobserved clambered out of a saloonwindow and undertaken a voyage of discovery over the roofs the boy who had been missed and painfully sought after was discovered just on the point of trying to have a nearer view of the lions head by which one of the roofgutters discharges itself when the terrified father got eye on him and called out aloud cunning fritz however stood motionless where he was on the roof till his fathers anger had stilled itself and pardon was promised him—here farther is a vague anecdote made authentic another time the little fellow was not to be found at the evening meal while withal there was a heavy thunderstorm in the sky and fiery bolts were blazing through the black clouds he was searched for in vain all over the house and at every new thunderclap the misery of his parents increased at last they found him not far from the house on the top of the highest limetree which he was just preparing to descend under the crashing of a very loud peal in gods name what hast thou been doing there cried the agitated father i wanted to know answered fritz where all that fire in the sky was coming from   three full years the schiller family lived at lorch and this in rather narrow circumstances as the father though in the service of his prince could not during the whole of this time receive the smallest part of his pay but had to live on the little savings he had made during wartime not till 1768 after the most impressive petitioning to the duke was he at last called away from his post of recruiting officer and transferred to the garrison of ludwigsburg where he by little and little squeezed out the pay owing him  upon his removal the fathers first care was to establish his little boy now nine years old—who stirredon probably by the impressions he had got in the parsonage at lorch and the visible wish of his parents had decided for the clerical profession—in the latin school at ludwigsburg this done he made it his chief care that his sons progress should be swift and satisfying there but on that side fritz could never come up to his expectations though the teachers were well enough contented but out of schooltime fritz was not so zealous and diligent as could be wished liked rather to spring about and sport in the garden the arid stony philological instruction of his teacher johann friedrich jahn who was a solid latiner and nothing more was not calculated to make a specially alluring impression on the clever and lively boy thus it was nothing but the reverence and awe of his father that could drive him on to diligence  to this time belongs the oldest completely preserved poem of schillers it is in the form of a little hymn in which on newyears day 1769 the boy now hardly over nine years old presents to his parents the wishes of the season it may stand here by way of glimpse into the position of the son towards his parents especially towards his father           muchloved parents48      parents whom i lovingly honour     today my heart is full of thankfulness     this year may a gracious god increase     what is at all times your support      the lord the

januarii anno 1769  according to the pious wish of their son this year 1769 did bring somewhat which comforted them captain schiller from of old a lover of rural occupations and skilful in gardening and nursery affairs had at ludwigsburg laidout for himself a little nursery it was managed on the same principles which he afterwards made public in his book die baumzucht im grossen neustrelitz 1795 and second edition giessen 1806 and was prospering beautifully the duke who had noticed this signified satisfaction in the thing and he appointed him in 1770 to shift to his beautiful forestcastle die solitüde near stuttgart as overseer of all his forest operations there hereby to the active man was one of his dearest wishes fulfilled and a sphere of activity opened corresponding to his acquirements and his inclination at solitüde by the dukes order he laidout a model nursery for all würtemberg which he managed with perfect care and fidelity and in this post he so completely satisfied the expectations entertained of him that his prince by and by raised him to the rank of major he is reckoned to have raised from seeds and successfully planted 60000 trees in discharge of this function which continued for the rest of his life  his family which already at lorch in 1766 had been increased by the birth of a daughter luise waited but a short time in ludwigsburg till the father brought them over to the new dwelling at solitüde fritz on the removal of his parents was given over as boarder to his actual teacher the rigorous pedant jahn and remained yet two years at the latin school in ludwigsburg during this time the lively and perhaps also sometimes mischievous boy was kept in the strictest fetters and by the continual admonitions exhortations and manually practical corrections of father and of teacher not a little held down and kept in fear the fact for instance that he liked more the potent biblewords and pious songs of a luther a paul gerhard and gellert than he did the frozen lifeless catechismdrill of the ludwigsburg institute gave surly straitlaced jahn occasion to lament from time to time to the alarmed parents that their son had no feeling whatever for religion in this respect however the otherwise so irritable father easily satisfied himself not only by his own observations of an opposite tendency but chiefly by stricter investigation of one little incident that was reported to him the teacher of religion in the latin school superintendent zilling whose name is yet scornfully remembered had once in his dull awkwardness introduced even solomons song as an element of nurture for his class and was droning out in an oldfashioned way his interpretation of it as symbolical of the christian church and its bridegroom christ when he was on the sudden to his no small surprise and anger interrupted by the audible inquiry of little schiller but was this song then actually sung to the church schiller senior took the little heretic to task for this rash act and got as justification the innocent question has the church really got teeth of ivory the father was enlightened enough to take the boys opposition for a natural expression of sound human sense nay he could scarcely forbear a laugh whirled swiftly round and murmured to himself occasionally she has wolfs teeth and so the thing was finished49      footnote 49 saupe p 18  at ludwigsburg schiller and christophine first saw a theatre where at that time in the sumptuous dukes love of splendour only pompous operas and ballets were given the first effect of this new enjoyment which fritz and his sister strove to repeat as often as they could was that at home with little clipped and twisted paper dolls they set about representing scenes and on christophines part it had the more important result of awakening and nourishing at an early age her æsthetic taste schiller considered her ever after these youthful sports as a true and faithful companion in his poetic dreams and attempts and constantly not only told his sister whose silence on such points could be perfect of all that he secretly did in the way of versemaking in the karls school—which as we shall see he entered in 1773—but if possible brought it upon the scene with her scenes from the lyrical operetta of semele were acted by schiller and christophine on those terms which appears in a complete shape for the first time in schillers anthology printed 178250      footnote 50 ibid p 109   so soon as friedrich had gone through the latin school at ludwigsburg which was in 1772 he was according to the standing regulation to enter one of the four lower cloisterschools and go through the farther curriculum for a würtemberg clergyman but now there came suddenly from the duke to captain schiller an offer to take his son who had been represented to him as a clever boy into the new military trainingschool founded by his highness at solitüde in 1771 where he would be brought up and taken charge of free of cost  in the schiller family this offer caused great consternation and painful embarrassment the father was grieved to be obliged to sacrifice a longcherished paternal plan to the whim of an arbitrary ruler and the son felt himself cruelly hurt to be torn away so rudely from his hope and inclination accordingly how dangerous soever for the position of the family a declining of the ducal grace might seem the straightforward father ventured nevertheless to lay open to the duke in a clear and distinct statement how his purpose had always been to devote his son in respect both of his inclination and his hitherto studies to the clerical profession for which in the new trainingschool he could not be prepared the duke showed no anger at this step of the elder schillers but was just as little of intention to let a capable and hopeful scholar who was also the son of one of his officers and dependents escape him he simply with brevity repeated his wish and required the choice of another study in which the boy would have a better career and outlook than in the theological department nill they will they there was nothing for the parents but compliance with the so plainly intimated will of this duke on whom their familys welfare so much depended  accordingly 17th january 1773 friedrich schiller then in his fourteenth year stept over to the military trainingschool at solitüde  in september of the following year schillers parents had conformably to a fundamental law of the institution to acknowledge and engage by a written bond that their son in virtue of his entrance into this ducal institution did wholly devote himself to the service of the würtemberg ducal house that he without special ducal permission was not empowered to go out of it and that he had with his best care to observe not only this but all other regulations of the institute by this time indeed directly upon signature of this strict bond young schiller had begun to study jurisprudence—which however when next year 1775 the trainingschool raised now to be a military academy had been transferred to stuttgart he either of his own accord or in consequence of a discourse and interview of the duke with his father exchanged for the study of medicine  from the time when schiller entered this karls school military academy in official style he was nearly altogether withdrawn from any tutelage of his father for it was only to mothers and to sisters still under age that the privilege of visiting their sons and brothers and this on the sunday only was granted beyond this the karls scholars within their monastic cells were cut off from family and the world by irondoors and sentries guarding them this rigorous seclusion from actual life and all its friendly impressions still more the spiritual constraint of the institution excluding every free activity and all will of your own appeared to the son in a more hateful light than to the father who himself an old soldier found it quite according to order that the young people should be kept in strict military discipline and subordination what filled the son with bitter discontent and indignation and at length brought him to a kind of poetic outburst of revolution in the robbers therein the father saw only a wholesome regularity and indispensable substitute for paternal discipline transient complaints of individual teachers and superiors little disturbed the fathers mind for on the whole the official testimonies concerning his son were steadily favourable the duke too treated young schiller whose talents had not escaped his sharpness of insight with particular goodwill nay distinction to this prince used to the accurate discernment of spiritual gifts the complaints of certain teachers that schillers slow progress in jurisprudence proceeded from want of head were of no weight whatever and he answered expressly leave me that one alone he will come to something yet but that schiller gave his main strength to what in the karls school was a strictly forbidden object to poetry namely this i believe was entirely hidden from his father or appeared to him on occasional small indications the less questionable as he saw that in spite of this the marketablesciences were not neglected   at the same age viz about twentytwo at which captain schiller had made his first military sally into the netherlands and the austriansuccession war his son issued from the karls school 15th december 1780 and was immediately appointed regimentaldoctor at stuttgart with a monthly pay of twentythree gulden 2l 6s11s and a fraction per week with this appointment schiller had as it were openly altogether outgrown all special paternal guardianship or guidance and was from this time treated by his father as come to majority and standing on his own feet if he came out as frequently happened with a comrade to solitüde he was heartily welcome there and the fathers looks often dwelt on him with visible satisfaction if in the conscientious and rigorous old man with his instructive and serious experiences of life there might yet various anxieties and doubts arise when he heard of the exuberantly genial ways of his hopeful son at stuttgart he still looked upon him with joyful pride in remarking how those so promising karls scholars who had entered into the world along with him recognised his superiority of mind and willingly ranked themselves under him nor could it be otherwise than highly gratifying to his old heart to remark always with what deep love the gifted son constantly regarded his parents and sisters51—of schillers first procedures in stuttgart after his emancipation from the karls school and appointment as regimentalsurgeon or rather of his general behaviour and way of life there which are said to have been somewhat wild genially or even ungenially extravagant and to have involved him in many paltry entanglements of debts as one bad consequence—there will be some notice in the next section headed the mother his regimental doctorship and stay in stuttgart altogether lasted twentytwo months      footnote 51 saupe p 25  this is schillers bodily appearance as it first presented itself to an old schoolfellow who after an interval of eighteen months saw him again on parade as doctor of the regiment augé—more to his astonishment than admiration  crushed into the stiff tasteless oldprussian uniform on each of his temples three stiff rolls as if done with gypsum the tiny threecocked hat scarcely covering his crown so much the thicker the long pigtail with the slender neck crammed into a very narrow horsehair stock the felt put under the white spatterdashes smirched by traces of shoeblacking giving to the legs a bigger diameter than the thighs squeezed into their tightfitting breeches could boast of hardly or not at all able to bend his knees the whole man moved like a stork  the poets form says this witness elsewhere a bit of a dilettante artist it seems had somewhat the following appearance long straight stature long in the legs long in the arms pigeonbreasted his neck very long something rigorously stiff in gait and carriage not the smallest elegance his brow was broad the nose thin cartilaginous white of colour springing out at a notably sharp angle much bent—a parrotnose and very sharp in the point according to dannecker the sculptor schiller who took snuff had pulled it out so with his hand the red eyebrows over the deeplying darkgray eyes were bent too close together at the nose which gave him a pathetic expression the lips were thin energetic the underlip protruding as if pushed forward by the inspiration of his feelings the chin strong cheeks pale rather hollow than full freckly the eyelids a little inflamed the bushy hair of the head dark red the whole head rather ghostlike than manlike but impressive even in repose and all expression when schiller declaimed neither the features nor the somewhat shrieky voice could he subdue dannecker adds the satirical witness has unsurpassably cut this head in marble for us52      footnote 52 schwab schillers leben stuttgart 1841     p 68  the publication of the robbers autumn 1781—which schiller driven on by rage and desperation had composed in the fetters of the karls school—raised him on the sudden to a phenomenon on which all eyes in stuttgart were turned what with careless exaggeration he had said to a friend some months before on setting forth his elegy on the death of a young man the thing has made my name hereabouts more famous than twenty years of practice would have done but it is a name like that of him who burnt the temple of ephesus god be merciful to me a sinner might now with all seriousness be said of the impression his robbers made on the harmless townsfolk of stuttgart but how did father schiller at first take up this eccentric product of his son which openly declared war on all existing order astonishment and terror anger and detestation boundless anxiety with touches of admiration and pride stormed alternately through the solid honest mans paternal breast as he saw the frank picture of a prodigal son rolled out before him and had to gaze into the most revolting deeps of the passions and vices yet he felt himself irresistibly dragged along by the uncommon vivacity of action in this wild drama and at the same time powerfully attracted by the depth the tenderness and fulness of true feeling manifested in it so that at last out of those contradictory emotions of his a clear admiration and pride for his sons bold and rich spirit maintained the upper hand by schillers friends and closer connections especially by his mother and sisters all pains were of course taken to keep up this favourable humour in the father and carefully to hide from him all disadvantageous or disquieting tidings about the piece and its consequences and practical effects thus he heard sufficiently of the huge excitement and noise which the robbers was making all over germany and of the seductive approval which came streamingin on the youthful poet even out of distant provinces but heard nothing either of the dukes offended and angry feelings over the robbers a production horrible to him nor of the sons secret journeys to mannheim and the next consequences of these his brief arrest namely nor of the rumour circulating in spiteful quarters that this young doctor was neglecting his own province of medicine and meaning to become a playactor how could the old man in these circumstances have a thought that the robbers would be the loss of family and country to his poor fritz and yet so it proved  excited by all kinds of messagings informings and insinuations the imperious prince in spite of his secret pleasure in this sudden renown of his pupil could in no wise be persuaded to revoke or soften his harsh order which forbade the poet henceforth under pain of military imprisonment either to write anything poetic or to communicate the same to foreign persons nonwürtembergers in vain were all attempts of schiller to obtain his discharge from military service and his entschwäbung unswabianing such petitions had only for result new sharper rebukes and hard threatening expressions to which the mournful fate of schubart in the castle of hohenasperg53 formed a too questionable background      footnote 53 see appendix ii infrà  thus by degrees there ripened in the strong soul of this young man the determination to burst these laming fetters of his genius by flight from despotic würtemberg altogether and in some friendlier country gain for himself the freedom without which his spiritual development was impossible only to one friend who clung to him with almost enthusiastic devotion did he impart his secret this was johann andreas streicher of stuttgart who intended to go next year to hamburg and there under bachs guidance study music but declared himself ready to accompany schiller even now since it had become urgent except to this trustworthy friend schiller had imparted his plan to his elder sister christophine alone and she had not only approved of the sad measure but had undertaken also to prepare their mother for it the father naturally had to be kept dark on the subject all the more that if need were he might pledge his word as an officer that he had known nothing of his sons intention  schiller went out in company of madam meier wife of the regisseur theatremanager at mannheim a native of stuttgart and of this streicher one last time to solitüde to have one more look of it and of his dear ones there especially to soothe and calm his mother on the way which they travelled on foot schiller kept up a continual discourse about the mannheim theatre and its interests without betraying his secret to madam meier the father received these welcome guests with frank joy and gave to the conversation which at first hung rather embarrassed a happy turn by getting into talk with cheery circumstantiality of the grand pleasurehunt of the play and of the illumination which were to take place in honour of the russian grandprince afterwards czar paul and his bride the duke of würtembergs niece on the 17th september instant at solitüde far other was the poor mothers mood she was on the edge of betraying herself in seeing the sad eyes of her son and she could not speak for emotion the presence of streicher and a stranger with whom the elder schiller was carrying on a to him attractive conversation permitted mother and son to withdraw speedily and unremarked not till after an hour did schiller reappear alone now to the company neither this circumstance nor schillers expression of face yet striking the preoccupied father though to the observant streicher his wet red eyes betrayed how painful the parting must have been gradually on the way back to stuttgart amid general talk of the three schiller regained some composure and cheerfulness  the bitter sorrow of this hour of parting renewed itself yet once in schillers soul when on the flight itself about midnight of the 17th in effect it was these same festivities that had decided the young mens time and scheme of journey and under the sheltering noise of which their plan was luckily executed towards midnight of the abovesaid day when the castle of solitüde with all its surroundings was beaming in full splendour of illumination there rolled past almost rubbing elbows with it the humble schiller vehicle from stuttgart which bore the fugitive poet with his true friend on their way schiller pointed out to his friend the spot where his parents lived and with a halfsuppressed sigh and a woebegone exclamation oh my mother sank back upon his seat  mannheim the goal of their flight is in badenbaden under another sovereign lies about 80 miles to nw of stuttgart their dreary journey lasted two days—arrival not till deep in the night of the second their united stock of money amounted to 51 gulden—schiller 23 streicher 28—5l 6s in all streicher subsequently squeezed out from home 3l more and that appears to have been their sumtotal54      footnote 54 schwab schillers leben  great was the astonishment and great the wrath of the father when at length he understood that his son had broken the paternal written bond and withdrawn himself by flight from the ducal service he dreaded not without reason the heavy consequences of so rash an action and a thousand gnawing anxieties bestormed the heart of the worthy man might not the duke in the first outburst of his indignation overwhelm forever the happiness of their family which there was nothing but the income of his post that supported in humble competence and what a lot stood before the son himself if he were caught in flight or if what was nowise improbable his delivery back was required and obtained sure enough there had risen on the otherwise serene heaven of the schiller family a threatening thundercloud which any day might discharge itself bringing destruction on their heads  the thing however passed away in merciful peace whatever may have been the dukes motives or inducements to let the matter in spite of his embitterment silently drop—whether his bright festal humour in presence of those high kinsfolk or the noble frankness with which the runaway first of all to save his family had in a respectful missive dated from mannheim explained to his princely educator the necessity of his flight or the expectation flattering to the ducal pride that the future greatness of his pupil might be a source of glory to him and his karlsschool enough on his part there took place no kind of hostile step against the poet and still less against his family captain schiller again breathed freer when he saw himself delivered from his most crushing anxiety on this side but there remained still a sharp sting in his wounded heart his military feeling of honour was painfully hurt by the thought that they might now look upon his son as a deserter and withal the future of this voluntary exile appeared so uncertain and wavering that it did not offer the smallest justification of so great a risk by degrees however instead of anger and blame there rose in him the most sympathetic anxiety for the poor sons fate to whom from want of a free firm and assuring position in life all manner of contradictions and difficulties must needs arise  and schiller did actually at mannheim find himself in a bad and difficult position the superintendent of the celebrated mannheim theatre the greatly powerful imperial baron von dalberg with whom schiller since the bringing out of his robbers had stood in lively correspondence drew back when schiller himself was here and kept the poet at a distance as a political fugitive leaving him to shift as he could in vain had schiller explained to him in manly open words his economic straits and begged from him a loan of 300 gulden 30l to pay therewith a pressing debt in stuttgart and drag himself along and try to get started in the world dalberg returned the fiesco schillers new republican tragedy which had been sent him with the declaration that he could advance no money on the fiesco in its present form the piece must first be remodelled to suit the stage during this remodelling which the otherwise so passionately vivid and hopeful poet began without murmur he lived entirely on the journeymoney that had been saved up by the faithful streicher who would on no account leave him  what became of this good streicher afterwards i have inquired considerably but with very little success on the total exhaustion of their finance schiller and he had to part company—schiller for refuge at bauerbach as will soon be seen streicher continued about mannheim not as schillers fellowlodger any longer but always at his hand passionately eager to serve him with all his faculties by night or by day and they did not part finally till schiller quitted mannheim two years hence for leipzig after which they never met again streicher in mannheim seems to have subsisted by his musical talent and to have had some connection with the theatre in that capacity in similar dim positions with what shiftings adventures and vicissitudes is quite unknown to me he long survived schiller and at least fifty years after these mannheim struggles wrote some book of bright and loving reminiscences concerning him the exact title of which i can nowhere find—though passages from it are copied by biographer schwab here and there his affection for schiller is of the nature of worship rather of constant adoration and probably formed the sunshine to poor streichers life schiller nowhere mentions him in his writings or correspondences after that final parting at mannheim 1784  the necessities of the two friends reached by and by such a height that schiller had to sell his watch although they had already for several weeks been subsisting on loans to all which now came dalbergs overwhelming message that even this remodelling of fiesco could not be serviceable and of course could not have money paid for it schiller thereupon at once resolute what to do walked off to the worthy bookseller schwann with whom he was already on a trustful even grateful footing and sold him his ms at one louisdor the sheet at the same time too he recognised the necessity of quitting mannheim and finding a new asylum in saxony seeing withal his farther continuance here might be as dangerous for him as it was a matter of apprehension to his friends for although the duke of würtemberg undertook nothing that was hostile to him and his family at solitüde experienced no annoyance yet the impetuous prince might any day take it into his head to have him put in prison in the ever livelier desire after a securelyhidden place of abode where he might execute in peace his poetic plans and enterprises schiller suddenly took up an earlier purpose which had been laid aside  in the stuttgart time he had known wilhelm von wolzogen by and by his brotherinlaw they married two sisters who with three brothers had been bred in the karls school the two had indeed during the academic time wolzogen being some years younger had few points of contact and were not intimate but now on the appearance of the robbers wolzogen took a cordial affection and enthusiasm for the widelycelebrated poet and on closer acquaintance with schiller also affected his mother—who as widow for her three sons sake lived frequently at stuttgart—with a deep and zealous sympathy in schillers fate schiller had with a truly childlike trust confided himself to this excellent lady and after his arrest—a bitter consequence of his secret visit to mannheim—had confessed to her his purpose to run away frau von wolzogen who feared no sacrifice when the question was of the fortune of her friends had then offered him her family mansion bauerbach near meiningen as a place of refuge schillers notion had also been to fly thither though deceived by false hopes he changed that purpose he now wrote at once to stuttgart and announced to frau von wolzogen his wish to withdraw for some time to bauerbach to which as is well known the assent was ready and zealous  before quitting mannheim schiller could not resist the longing wish to see his parents yet one time and wrote to them accordingly 19 nov 1782 in visible haste and excitement       best parents—as i am at present in mannheim and am to go      away forever in five days i wished to prepare for myself      and you the one remaining satisfaction of seeing one another      once more today is the 19th on the 21st you receive this      letter—if you therefore without the least delay that is      indispensable leave stuttgart you might on the 22d be at      the posthouse in bretten which is about half way from      mannheim and where you would find me i think it would be      best if mamma and christophine under the pretext of going      to ludwigsburg to wolzogen should make this journey take      the frau vischerin a captains widow sung of under the      name of laura with whom he had last lodged in stuttgart      and also wolzogen with you as i wish to speak with both of      them perhaps for the last time wolzogen excepted i will      give you a karolin as journeymoney but not till i see you      at bretten by the prompt fulfilment of my prayer i will      perceive whether is still dear to you       your evergrateful son       schiller   from mannheim bauerbach or meiningen lies about 120 miles ne and from stuttgart almost as far straight north bretten a little town on a hill celebrated as melancthons birthplace his fathers house still standing there is some 35 miles se of mannheim and as far nw from stuttgart from mannheim in this wise it is not at all on the road to meiningen though only a few miles more remote in direct distance schillers purpose had been after this affectionate interview to turn at once leftward and make for meiningen by what road or roads there were from bretten thither schillers poor guinea karolin was not needed on this occasion the rendezvous at bretten being found impossible or inexpedient at the stuttgart end of it our author continues  although this meeting on which the loving son and brother wished to spend his last penny did not take effect yet this mournful longing of his evident from the letter and from the purpose itself must have touched the fathers heart with somewhat of a reconciliatory feeling schiller senior writes accordingly 8 december 1782 the very day after his sons arrival at bauerbach to bookseller schwan in mannheim i have not noticed here the smallest symptom that his ducal durchlaucht has any thought of having my son searched for and prosecuted and indeed his post here has long since been filled up a circumstance which visibly indicates that they can do without him this letter to schwan concludes in the following words which are characteristic he my son has by his untimely withdrawal against the advice of his true friends plunged himself into this difficult position and it will profit him in soul and body that he feel the pain of it and thereby become wiser for the future i am not afraid however that want of actual necessaries should come upon him for in such case i should feel myself obliged to lend a hand  and in effect schiller during his abode in bauerbach did once or twice receive little subventions of money from his father although never without earnest and not superfluous admonition to become more frugal and take better heed in layingout his money for economics were by schillers own confession not at all his talent it cost him less he says to execute a whole conspiracy and tragedyplot than to adjust his scheme of housekeeping—at this time it was never the father himself who wrote to schiller but always christophine by his commission and on the other hand schiller too never risked writing directly to his father as he felt but too well how little on his part had been done to justify the flight in his fathers eyes he writes accordingly likewise on that 8th december 1782 to his publisher schwan if you can accelerate the printing of my fiesco you will very much oblige me by doing so you know that nothing but the prohibition to become an author drove me out of the würtemberg service if i now on this side dont soon let my native country hear of me they will say the step i took was useless and without real motive  in bauerbach schiller lived about eight months under the name of doctor ritter unknown to everybody and only the courtlibrarian reinwald in meiningen afterwards his brotherinlaw as we shall see in whom he found a solid friend had been trusted by frau von wolzogen with the name and true situation of the mysterious stranger the most of schillers time here was spent in dramatic labours enterprises and dreams the outcome of all these were his third civic tragedy louise miller or kabale und liebe which was finished in february 1783 and the settling on don carlos as a new tragic subject many reasons meanwhile in the last eight months had been pushing schiller into the determination to leave his asylum and anew turn towards mannheim a passionate though unreturned attachment to charlotte von wolzogen at that time filled schillers soul and his removal therefore must both to frau von wolzogen for her own and her daughters sake and to schiller himself have appeared desirable it was frau von wolzogens own advice to him to go for a short time to mannheim there to get into clear terms with dalberg who had again begun corresponding with him so in july 1783 schiller bade his solitary and by this time dear and loved abode a hasty adieu and much contrary to fond hope never saw it again  in september 1783 his bargainings with dalberg had come to this result that for a fixed salary of 500 gulden 50l a year he was appointed theatrepoet here by this means to use his own words the way was open to him gradually to payoff a considerable portion of his debts and so escape from the drowning whirlpool and remain an honest man now furthermore he thought it permissible to show himself to his family with a certain composure of attitude and opened straightway a regular correspondence with his parents again and captain schiller volunteers a stiffstarched but true and earnest letter to the baron dalberg himself most humbly thanking that gracious nobleman for such beneficent favour shown my poor son and begs withal the far stranger favour that dalberg would have the extreme goodness to appoint the then inexperienced young man some true friend who might help him to arrange his housekeeping and in moral things might be his mentor  soon after this an intermittent fever threw the poet on a sickbed and lamed him above five weeks from all capacity of mental labour not even in june of the following year was the disease quite overcome visits acquaintanceships all kinds of amusements and more than anything else overhasty attempts at work delayed his cure—so that his father had a perfect right to bring before him his schillers own blame in the matter that thou er he the then usual tone towards servants and children for eight whole months hast weltered about with intermittent fever surely that does little honour to thy study of medicine and thou wouldst with great justice have poured the bitterest reproaches on any patient who in a case like thine had not held himself to the diet and regimen that were prescribed to him—  in autumn 1783 there seized schiller so irresistible a longing to see his kindred again that he repeatedly expressed to his father the great wish he had for a meeting either at mannheim or some other place outside the würtemberg borders to the fulfilment of this scheme there were however in the sickness which his mother had fallen into in the fettered position of the father and in the rigorously frugal economies of the family insuperable obstacles whereupon his father made him the proposal that he friedrich either himself or by him the captain should apply to the duke karls serene highness and petition him for permission to return to his country and kindred as schiller to this answered nothing christophine time after time pressingly repeated to him the fathers proposal at the risk of again angering his father schiller gave in his answer to christophine of 1st january 1784 the decisive declaration that his honour would frightfully suffer if he without connection with any other prince without character and lasting means of support after his forceful withdrawal from würtemberg should again show face there that my father adds he as ground of this refusal give his name to such a petition can help me little for every one will at once so long as i cannot make it plain that i no longer need the duke of würtemberg suspect in a return obtained on petition by myself or by another is all one a desire to get settled in würtemberg again sister consider with serious attention these circumstances for the happiness of thy brother may by rash haste in this matter suffer an incurable wound great part of germany knows of my relations to your duke and of the way i left him people have interested themselves for me at the expense of this duke how horribly would the respect of the public and on this depends my whole future fortune how miserably would my own honour sink by the suspicion that i had sought this return that my circumstances had forced me to repent my former step that the support which i had sought in the wide world had misgone and i was seeking it anew in my birthland the open manlike boldness which i showed in my forceful withdrawal would get the name of a childish outburst of mutiny a stupid bit of impotent bluster if i do not make it good love for my dear ones longing for my fatherland might perhaps excuse me in the heart of this or the other candid man but the world makes no account of all that  for the rest if my father is determined to do it i cannot hinder him only this i say to thee sister that in case even the duke would permit it i will not show myself on würtemberg ground till i have at least a character for which object i shall zealously labour and that in case the duke refuses i shall not be able to restrain myself from avenging the affront thereby put upon me by open fooleries sottisen and expressions of myself in print  the intended petition to the duke was not drawn out—and father schiller overcame his anger on the matter as on closer consideration of the sons aversion to this step he could not wholly disapprove him yet he did not hide from schiller junior the steadfast wish that he would in some way or other try to draw near to the duke at any rate he father schiller hoped to god that their parting would not last forever and that in fine he might still live to see his only son near him again  in mannheim schillers financial position in spite of his earnest purpose to manage wisely grew by degrees worse rather than better owing to the many little expenses laid upon him by his connections in society his income would not suffice and the cashbox was not seldom run so low that he had not wherewithal to support himself next day of assistance from home with the rigorous income of his father which scarcely amounted to 40l a year there could nothing be expected and over and above the father himself had in this respect very clearly spoken his mind parents and sisters said schiller senior have as just a right as they have a confidence in cases of necessity to expect help and support from a son to fill to overflowing the measure of the poets economical distress there now stept forth suddenly some secret creditors of his in stuttgart demanding immediate payment whereupon in quick succession there came to captain schiller to his great terror two drafts from the son requiring of him the one 10l the other 5l the captain after stern reflection determined at last to be good for both demands but wrote to the son that he only did so in order that his the sons labour might not be disturbed and in the confident anticipation that the son regardful of his poor sisters and their bit of portion would not leave him in the lurch  but schiller whom still other debts in stuttgart unknown to his father were pressing hard could only repay the smaller of these drafts and thus the worthy father saw himself compelled to pay the larger the 10l out of the savings he had made for outfit of his daughters whereupon as was not undeserved he took his son tightly to task and wrote to him as long as thou my son shalt make thy reckoning on resources that are still to come and therefore are still subject to chance and mischance so long wilt thou continue in thy mess of embarrassments furthermore as long as thou thinkest this gulden or batzen shilling or farthing cant help me to get over it so long will thy debts become never the smaller and what were a sorrow to me thou wilt not be able after a heavy labour of head got done to recreate thyself in the society of other good men but withal to make recreationdays of that kind more numerous than workdays that surely will not turn out well best son thy abode in bauerbach has been of that latter kind hinc illæ lacrymæ for these thou art now suffering and that not by accident the embarrassment thou now art in is verily a work of higher providence to lead thee off from too great trust in thy own force to make thee soft and contrite that laying aside all selfwill thou mayest follow more the counsel of thy father and other true friends must meet every one with due respectful courtesy and readiness to oblige and become ever more convinced that our most gracious duke in his restrictive plans meant well with thee and that altogether thy position and outlooks had now been better hadst thou complied and continued in thy country many a time i find thou hast wayward humours that make thee to thy truest friend scarcely endurable stiff ways which repel the bestwishing man—for example when i sent thee my excellent old friend herr amtmann cramer from altdorf near speier who had come to herr hofrath schwans in the end of last year thy reception of him was altogether dry and stingy though by my letter i had given thee so good an opportunity to seek the friendship of this honourable rational and influential man who has no children of his own and to try whether he might not have been of help to thee thou wilt do well i think to try and make good this fault on another opportunity  at the same time the old man repeatedly pressed him to return to medicine and graduate in heidelberg a theatrepoet in germany he signified was but a small light and as he the son with all his three pieces had not made any footing for himself what was to be expected of the future ones which might not be of equal strength doctorship on the other hand would give him a sure income and reputation as well—schiller himself was actually determined to follow his fathers advice as to medicine but this project and others of the same which were sometimes taken up went to nothing now and always for want of money to begin with  amid these old tormenting hindrances affronts and embarrassments schiller had also many joyful experiences to which even his father was not wholly indifferent to these belong besides many others his reception into the kurpfälzische deutsche gesellschaft german society of the electoral palatinate of this year which he himself calls a great step for his establishment as well as the stormy applause with which his third piece kabale und liebe came upon the boards in march following his father acknowledged receipt of this latter work with the words that i possess a copy of thy new tragedy i tell nobody for i dare not on account of certain passages let any one notice that it has pleased me nevertheless the piece as already the robbers had done came in stuttgart also to the acting point and was received with loud approval schiller now with new pleasure and inspiration laid hands on his don carlos and with the happy progress of this work there began for him a more confident temper of mind and a clearingup of horizon and outlook which henceforth only transiently yielded to embarrassments in his outer life  soon after this however there came upon him an unexpected event so suddenly and painfully that in his extremest excitement and misery he fairly hurt the feelings of his father by unreasonable requirements of him and reproaches on their being refused a principal stuttgart cautioner of his incessantly pressed upon by the stringent measures of the creditors there had fairly run off saved himself by flight from stuttgart and been seized in mannheim and there put in jail were not this prisoner at once got out schillers honour and peace of conscience were at stake and so before his properly streichers landlord the architect hölzel could get together the required 300 gulden and save this unlucky friend the halfdesperate poet had written home and begged from his father that indispensable sum and on the fathers clear refusal had answered him with a very unfilial letter not till after the lapse of seven weeks did the father reply in a letter which as a luminous memorial of his faithful honest fatherheart and of his considerate just character as a man deserves insertion here  very unwilling writes he am i to proceed to the answering of thy last letter 21st november of the past year which i could rather wish never to have read than now to taste again the bitterness contained there not enough that thou in the beginning of the said letter very undeservedly reproachest me as if i could and should have raised the 300 gulden for thee—thou continuest to blame me in a very painful way for my inquiries about thee on this occasion dear son the relation between a good father and his son fallen into such a strait who although gifted with many faculties of mind is still in all that belongs to true greatness and contentment much mistaken and astray can never justify the son in taking up as an injury what the father has said out of love out of consideration and experience of his own and meant only for his sons good as to what concerns those 300 gulden every one alas who knows my position here knows that it cannot be possible for me to have even 50 gulden not to speak of 300 before me in store and that i should borrow such a sum to the still farther disadvantage of my other children for a son who of the much that he has promised me has been able to perform so little—there for certain were i an unjust father farther on the old man takes him up on another side a private family affair schiller had directly and through others in reference to the prospect of a marriage between his elder sister christophine and his friend reinwald the court librarian of meiningen expressed himself in a doubting manner and thereby delayed the settlement of this affair in regard to which his father tells him  and now i have something to remark in respect of thy sister as thou my son partly straight out and partly through frau von kalb hast pictured reinwald in a way to deter both me and thy sister in counselling and negotiating in the way we intended the affair seems to have become quite retrograde for reinwald these two months past has not written a word more whether thou my son didst well to hinder a match not unsuitable for the age and the narrow pecuniary circumstances of thy sister god who sees into futurity knows as i am now sixtyone years of age and can leave little fortune when i die and as thou my son how happily soever thy hopes be fulfilled wilt yet have to struggle years long to get out of these present embarrassments and arrange thyself suitably and as after that thy own probable marriage will always require thee to have more thy own advantages in view than to be able to trouble thyself much about those of thy sisters—it would not all things considered have been ill if christophine had got a settlement she would quite certainly with her apparent regard for reinwald have been able to fit herself into his ways and him all the better as she god be thanked is not yet smit with ambition and the wish for great things and can suit herself to all conditions  the reinwald marriage did take place by and by in spite of schiller juniors doubts and had not christophine been the paragon of wives might have ended very ill for all parties  after these incidents schiller bent his whole strength to disengage himself from the crushing burden of his debts and to attain the goal marked out for him by his parents wishes—an enduring settlement and steady way of life two things essentially contributed to enliven his activity and brighten his prospects into the future one was the original beginning which falls in next june 1784 of his friendly intimacy with the excellent körner in whom he was to find not only the first founder of his outer fortune in life but also a kindred spirit and cordial friend such as he had never before had the second was that he made what shaped his future lot acquaintance with duke karl august of weimar who after hearing him read the first act of don carlos at the court of darmstadt had a long conversation with the poet and officially in consequence of the same bestowed on him the title of rath this new relation to a noble german prince gave him a certain standingground for the future and at the same time improved his present condition by completely securing him in respect of any risk from würtemberg the now schiller as courtcounsellor hofrath to the duke of weimar distinguished in this way by a prince who was acquainted with the muses and accustomed only to what was excellent—stept forth in much freer attitude secure of his position and himself than the poor fugitive under ban of law had done  out of this however and the fact resulting from it that he now assumed a more decisive form of speech in the periodical thalia founded by him and therein spared the players as little as the public there grew for him so many and such irritating brabbles and annoyances that he determined to quit his connection with the theatre leave mannheim altogether and at leipzig with his new title of rath to begin a new honourable career so soon as the necessary moneys and advices from his friend körner had arrived he repaired thither end of march 1785 and remained there all the summer in october of the same year he followed his friend körner to dresden and found in the family of this justminded clearseeing man the purest and warmest sympathy for himself and his fortunes the year 1787 led him at last to weimar but here too he had still long to struggle under the pressure of poverty and want of many things while the world in everincreasing admiration was resounding with his name till in 1789 his longing for a civic existence and therewith the intensest wish of his parents was fulfilled  inexpressible was the joy of the now elderly father to see his deeplybeloved son after so many roamings mischances and battles at last settled as professor in jena and soon thereafter at the side of an excellent wife happy at a hearth of his own the economic circumstances of the son were now also shaped to the fathers satisfaction if his college salary was small his literary labours added thereto yielded him a sufficient income his wife moreover had come to him quite fitted out and her mother had given all that belongs to a household our economical adjustment writes schiller to his father some weeks after their marriage has fallen out beyond all my wishes well and the order the dignity which i see around me here serves greatly to exhilarate my mind could you but for a moment get to me you would rejoice at the happiness of your son  well satisfied and joyful of heart from this time the fathers eye followed his sons career of greatness and renown upon which the admired poet every year stepped onwards powerfuler and richer in results without ever even transiently becoming strange to his fathers house and his kindred there quite otherwise all letters of the son to father and mother bear the evident stamp of truehearted grateful and pious filial love he took throughout the heartiest share in all even the smallest events that befell in his fathers house and in return communicated to his loved ones all of his own history that could soothe and gratify them of this the following letter written by him 26th october 1791 on receipt of a case of wine sent from home furnishes a convincing proof       dearest father—i have just returned with my dear lotte      from rudolstadt her native place where i was passing      part of my holidays and find your letter thousand thanks

follow i have undertaken the      task insignificant as a calendar seems to be it is that      kind of book which the publishers can circulate the most      extensively and which accordingly brings them the best      payment to the authors also they can accordingly offer      much more for this essay on the thirtyyears war they      have given me 80 louisdor and i have in the middle of my

so he continues after some remarks on a      good old friend of his fathers written after      interruption—today is your birthday dearest father      which we both celebrate with a pious joy that heaven has      still preserved you sound and happy for us thus far may      heaven still watch over your dear life and your health and      preserve your days to the latest age that so your grateful      son may be able to spread with all the power he has joy      and contentment over the evening of your life and pay the      debts of filial duty to you       farewell my dearest father loving kisses to our dearest      mother and my dear sisters we will soon write again       the wine has arrived in good condition once more receive      our hearty thanks—your grateful and obedient son       friedrich   in the beginning of this year 1791 the poet had been seized with a violent and dangerous affection of the chest the immediate danger was now over but his bodily health was for the rest of his life shattered to ruin and required for the time coming especially for the time just come all manner of soft treatment and repose the worst therefore was to be feared if his friends and he could not manage to place him for the next few years in a position freer from economic cares than now unexpectedly in this difficulty help appeared out of denmark two warm admirers of schillers genius the then hereditary prince of holsteinaugustenburg grandfather of the prince christian now 1872 conspicuous in our english court and count von schimmelmann offered the poet a pension of 1000 thalers 150l for three years and this with a fineness and delicacy of manner which touched the recipient more even than the offer itself did and moved him to immediate assent the pension was to remain a secret but how could schiller prevail on himself to be silent of it to his parents with tears of thankfulness the parents received this glad message in their pious minds they gathered out of this the beneficent conviction that their sons heavy sorrows and the danger in which his life hung had only been decreed by providence to set in its right light the love and veneration which he far and near enjoyed schiller himself this altogether unexpected proof of tenderest sympathy in his fate visibly cheered and strengthened even in health at lowest the strength of his spirit which now felt itself free from outward embarrassments subdued under it the weakness of his body   in the middle of the year 1793 the love of his native country and the longing after his kindred became so lively in him that he determined with his wife to visit swabia he writes to körner the swabian whom i thought i had altogether got done with stirs himself strongly in me but indeed i have been eleven years parted from swabia and thüringen is not the country in which i can forget it in august he set out and halted first in the then reichstadt imperial freetown heilbronn where he found the friendliest reception and enjoyed the first indescribable emotion in seeing again his parents sisters and early friends my dear ones writes he to körner 27th august from heilbronn i found well to do and as thou canst suppose greatly rejoiced to meet me again my father in his seventieth year is the image of a healthy old age and any one who did not know his years would not count them above sixty he is in continual activity and this it is which keeps him healthy and youthful in large draughts the robust old man enjoyed the pleasure long forborne of gazing into the eyes of his son who now stood before him a completed man he knew not whether more to admire than love him for in his whole appearance and all his speeches and doings there stamped itself a powerful lofty spirit a tender loving heart and a pure noble character his youthful fire was softened a mild seriousness and a friendly dignity did not leave him even in jest instead of his old neglect in dress there had come a dignified elegance and his lean figure and his pale face completed the interest of his look to this was yet added the almost wonderful gift of conversation upon the objects that were dear to him whenever he was not borne down by attacks of illness  from heilbronn soon after his arrival schiller wrote to duke karl in the style of a grateful former pupil whom contradictory circumstances had pushed away from his native country he got no answer from the duke but from stuttgart friends he did get sure tidings that the duke on receipt of this letter had publicly said if schiller came into würtemberg territory he the duke would take no notice to schiller senior too he had at the same time granted the humble petition that he might have leave to visit his son in heilbronn now and then  under these circumstances schiller perfectly secure visited ludwigsburg and even solitüde without as he himself expressed it asking permission of the schwabenkönig and in september in the near prospect of his wifes confinement he went altogether to ludwigsburg where he was a good deal nearer to his kindred and moreover in the clever courtdoctor von hoven a friend of his youth hoped to find counsel help and enjoyment soon after his removal schiller had in the birth of his eldest son karl the sweet happiness of first paternal joy and with delight saw fulfilled what he had written to a friend shortly before his departure from jena i shall taste the joys of a son and of a father and it will between these two feelings of nature go right well with me  the duke ill of gout and perhaps feeling that death was nigh seemed to make a point of strictly ignoring schiller and laid not the least hindrance in his way on the contrary he granted schiller senior on petition the permission to make use of a certain bath as long as he liked and this bath lay so near ludwigsburg that he could not but think the meaning merely was that the father wished to be nearer his son absence was at once granted by the duke useful and necessary as the elder schiller always was to him at home for the old man now major schiller still carried on his overseeing of the ducal gardens and nurseries at solitüde and his punctual diligence fidelity intelligence and other excellences in that function had long been recognised  in a few weeks after 24th october 1793 duke karl died and was by his illustrious pupil regarded as in some sort a paternal friend schiller thought only of the great qualities of the deceased and of the good he had done him not of the great faults which as sovereign and as man he had manifested only to his most familiar friend did he write the death of old herod has had no influence either on me or my family—except indeed that all men who had immediately to do with that sovereign herr as my father had are glad now to have the prospect of a man before them that the new duke is in every good and also in every bad meaning of the word withal however his father to whom naturally the favour of the new duke ludwig eugen was of importance could not persuade schiller to welcome him to the sovereignty with a poem to schillers feelings it was unendurable to awaken for the sake of an external advantage from the new lord any suspicions as if he welcomed the death of the old55      footnote 55 saupe p 60  christophine schillers eldest sister whom he always loved the most was not here in swabia—long hundred miles away poor christophine with her sickly and gloomy husband at meiningen these ten years past—but the younger two luise and nanette were with him the former daily at his hand luise was then twentyseven and is described as an excellent domestic creature amiable affectionate even enthusiastic yet who at an early period though full of admiration about her brother and his affairs had turned all her faculties and tendencies upon domestic practicality and the satisfaction of being useful to her loved ones in their daily life and wants56 her element was altogether housemanagement the aim of her endeavour to attain the virtues by which she saw her pious mother made happy herself in making others happy in the narrow indoor kingdom this quiet household vocation with its manifold labours and its simple joys was luises world beyond which she needed nothing and demanded nothing from her father she had inherited this feeling for the practical and this restless activity from the mother her piety compassion and kindliness from both the love of order regularity and contentment luise in the weak state of schillers wifes health was right glad to take charge of her brothers housekeeping and first at heilbronn and then at ludwigsburg did it to the complete satisfaction both of brother and sisterinlaw schiller himself gives to körner the grateful testimony that she very well understands household management      footnote 56 saupe p 136 et seqq  in this daily relation with her delicate and loving brother to whom luise looked up with a sort of timid adoration he became ever dearer to her with a silent delight she would often look into the soft eyes of the great and wonderful man from whose powerful spirit she stood so distant and to whose rich heart so near alltoo rapidly for her flewby the bright days of his abode in his homeland and long she looked after the vanished one with sad longing and schiller also felt himself drawn closer to his sister than before by whose silent faithful working his abode in swabia had been made so smooth and agreeable  nanette he had as will by and by appear seen at jena on her mothers visit there the year before—with admiration and surprise he then saw the little creature whom he had left a pretty child of five years old now become a blooming maiden beautiful to eye and heart and had often thought of her since she too was often in his house at present a loved and interesting object always she had been a great success in the foreign jena circle last year and had left bright memories there this is what saupe says afterwards of her appearance at jena and now in schillers temporary swabian home  she evinced the finest faculties of mind and an uncommon receptivity and docility and soon became to all that got acquainted with her a dear and precious object to declaim passages from her brothers poems was her greatest joy she did her recitation well and her swabian accent and naïvety of manner gave her an additional charm for her new relatives and even exercised a beneficent influence on the poets own feelings with hearty pleasure his beaming eyes rested often on the dear swabian girl who understood how to awaken in his heart the sweet tones of childhood and home she is good writes he of her to his friend körner and it seems as if something could be made of her she is yet much the child of nature and that is still the best she could be never having been able to acquire any reasonable culture with schillers abode in swabia from august 1793 till may 1794 nanette grew still closer to his heart and in his enlivening and inspiring neighbourhood her spirit and character shot out so many rich blossoms that schiller on quitting his fathers house felt justified in the fairest hopes for the future just before her visit to jena schiller senior writes to his son it is a great pity for nanette that i cannot give her a better education she has sense and talent and the best of hearts much too of my dear fritzs turn of mind as he will himself see and be able to judge57      footnote 57 saupe pp 14950  for the rest on what childlike confidential terms schiller lived with his parents at this time one may see by the following letter of 8th november 1793 from ludwigsburg       right sorry am i dearest parents that i shall not be able      to celebrate my birthday 11th november along with you but      i see well that good papa cannot rightly risk just now to      leave solitüde at all—a visit from the duke being expected      there every day on the whole it does not altogether depend      on the day on which one is to be merry with loved souls and      every day on which i can be where my dear parents are shall      be festal and welcome to me like a birthday       about the precious little one here mamma is not to be      uneasy here follow some more precise details about the      health of this little gold son omitted of watching and      nursing he has no lack that you may believe and he is      indeed a little leanness excepted very lively and has a      good appetite         i have been since i made an excursion to stuttgart      tolerably well and have employed this favourable time to get      a little forward in my various employments which have been      lying waste so long for this whole week i have been very      diligent and getting on briskly this is also the cause that      i have not written to you i am always supremely happy when i      am busy and my labour speeds       for your so precious portrait i thank you a thousand times      dearest father yet glad as i am to possess this memorial of      you much gladder still am i that providence has granted me      to have you yourself and to live in your neighbourhood but      we must profit better by this good time and no longer make      such pauses before coming together again if you once had      seen the duke at solitüde and known how you stand with him      there would be i think no difficulty in a short absence of      a few days especially at this season of the year i will      send up the carriage hired at jena for the visit thither      and back at the very first opportunity and leave it with      you to be ready always when you can come       my and all our hearty and childlike salutations to you      both and to the good nane nanette my brotherly      salutation       hoping soon for a joyful meeting—your obedient son       friedrich schiller   in the newyear time 1794 schiller spent several agreeable weeks in stuttgart whither he had gone primarily on account of some family matter which had required settling there at least he informs his friend körner on the 17th march from stuttgart i hope to be not quite useless to my father here though from the connections in which i stand i can expect nothing for myself  by degrees however the sickly oftenailing poet began to long again for a quiet uniform way of life and this feeling daily strengthened by the want of intellectual conversation which had become a necessary for him grew at length so strong that he with an alleviated heart thought of departure from his birthland and of quitting his loved ones glad that providence had granted him again to possess his parents and sisters for months long and to live in their neighbourhood he gathered himself into readiness for the journey back and returned first to his original quarters at heilbronn and in may 1794 with wife and child to jena   major schiller whom the joy to see his son and grandson seemed to have made young again lived with fresh pleasure in his idyllic calling and in free hours busied himself with writing down his twentyyears experiences in the domain of garden and treeculture—in a work the printing and publication of which were got managed for him by his renowned son in november 1794 he was informed that the young publisher of the first musenalmanach had accepted his ms for an honorarium of twentyfour karolins and that the same was already gone to press along with this the good old major was valued by his prince and by all who knew him his subordinates loved him as a just impartial man feared him too however in his stringent love of order wife and children showed him the most reverent regard and tender love but the son was the ornament of his old age he lived to see the full renown of the poet and his close connection with goethe through which he was to attain complete mastership and lasting composure with hands quivering for joy the old man grasped the mss of his dear son which from jena viâ cottas stuttgart warehouses were before all things transmitted to him in a paper from his hand which is still in existence there is found a touching expression of thanks that god had given him such a joy in his son and thou being of all beings says he in the same to thee did i pray at the birth of my one son that thou wouldst supply to him in strength of intellect and faculty what i from want of learning could not furnish and thou hast heard me thanks to thee most merciful being that thou hast heard the prayer of a mortal  schiller had left his loved ones at solitüde whole and well and with the firm hope that he would see them all again and the nextfollowing years did pass untroubled over the prosperous family but illluck as the proverb says comes with a long stride in the spring of 1796 when the french under jourdan and moreau had overrun south germany there reached schiller on a sudden alarming tidings from solitüde in the austrian chief hospital which had been established in the castle there an epidemic fever had broken out and had visited the schiller family among others the youngest daughter nanette had sunk under this pestilence in the flower of her years and whilst the second daughter luise lay like to die of the same the father also was laid bedrid with gout for fear of infection nobody except the doctors would risk himself at solitüde and so the poor weakly mother stood forsaken there and had for months long to bear alone the whole burden of the household distress schiller felt it painfully that he was unable to help his loved ones in so terrible a posture of affairs and it cost him great effort to hide these feelings from his friends in his pain and anxiety he turned himself at last to his eldest sister christophine wife of hofrath reinwald in meiningen and persuaded her to go to solitüde to comfort and support her people there had not the true sisterheart at once acceded to her brothers wishes he had himself taken the firm determination to go in person to swabia in the middle of may and bring his family away from solitüde and make arrangements for their nursing and accommodation the news of his sisters settingout relieved him of a great and continual anxiety heaven bless thee writes he to her on the 6th may for this proof of thy filial love he earnestly entreats her to prevent his dear parents from delaying out of thrift any wholesome means of improvement to their health and declares himself ready with joy to bear all costs those of travelling included she is to draw on cotta in tübingen for whatever money she needs her husband also he thanks in a cordial letter for his consent to this journey of his wife   july 11 1796 was born to the poet who had been in much trouble about his own household for some time his second son ernst great fears had been entertained for the mother which proving groundless the happy event lifted a heavy burden from his heart and he again took courage and hope but soon after on the 15th august he writes again to the faithful körner about his kinsfolk in swabia from the war we have not suffered so much but all the more from the condition of my father who brokendown under an obstinate and painful disease is slowly wending towards death how sad this fact is thou mayest think  within few weeks after 7th september 1796 the father died in his seventythird year after a sickbed of eight months though his departure could not be reckoned other than a blessing yet the good son was deeply shattered by the news of it what his filially faithful soul suffered in these painful days is touchingly imaged in two letters which may here make a fitting close to this lifesketch of schillers father it was twelve days after his fathers death when he wrote to his brotherinlaw reinwald in meiningen       thou hast here news dear brother of the release of our      good father which much as it had to be expected nay      wished has deeply affected us all the conclusion of so      long and withal so active a life is even for bystanders a      touching object what must it be to those whom it so nearly      concerns i have to tear myself away from thinking of this      painful loss since it is my part to help the dear remaining      ones it is a great comfort to thy wife that she has been      able to continue and fulfil her daughterly duty till her      fathers last release she would never have consoled      herself had he died a few days after her departure home       thou understandest how in the first days of this fatal      breach among us while so many painful things stormin upon      our good mother thy christophine could not have left even      had the post been in free course but this still remains      stopped and we must wait the warevents on the franconian      swabian and palatinate borders how much this absence of thy      wife must afflict i feel along with thee but who can fight      against such a chain of inevitable destinies alas public      and universal disorder rolls up into itself our private      events too in the fatalest way       thy wife longs from her heart for home and she only the      more deserves our regard that she against her inclination      and her interest resolved to be led only by the thought of      her filial duties now however she certainly will not      delay an hour longer with her return the instant it can be      entered upon without danger and impossibility comfort her      too when thou writest to her it grieves her to know thee      forsaken and to have no power to help thee       fare right well dear brother—thine       schiller   nearly at the same time he wrote to his mother       grieved to the heart i take up the pen to lament with you      and my dear sisters the loss we have just sustained in      truth for a good while past i have expected nothing else      but when the inevitable actually comes it is always a sad      and overwhelming stroke to think that one who was so dear      to us whom we hung upon with the feelings of early      childhood and also in later years were bound to by respect      and love that such an object is gone from the world that      with all our striving we cannot bring it back—to think of      this is always something frightful and when like you my      dearest best mother one has shared with the lost friend and      husband joy and sorrow for so many long years the parting      is all the painfuler even when i look away from what the      good father that is gone was to myself and to us all i      cannot without mournful emotion contemplate the close of so      steadfast and active a life which god continued to him so      long in such soundness of body and mind and which he      managed so honourably and well yes truly it is not a small      thing to hold out so faithfully upon so long and toilsome a      course and like him in his seventythird year to part      from the world in so childlike and pure a mood might i but      if it cost me all his sorrows pass away from my life as      innocently as he from his life is so severe a trial and      the advantages which providence in some respects may have      granted me compared with him are joined with so many      dangers for the heart and for its true peace       i will not attempt to comfort you and my dear sisters you      all feel like me how much we have lost but you feel also      that death alone could end these long sorrows with our dear      father it is now well and we shall all follow him ere long      never shall the image of him fade from our hearts and our      grief for him can only unite us still closer together       five or six years ago it did not seem likely that you my      dear ones should after such a loss find a friend in your      brother—that i should survive our dear father god has      ordered it otherwise and he grants me the joy to feel that      i may still be something to you how ready i am thereto i      need not assure you we all of us know one another in this      respect and are our dear fathers not unworthy children   this earnest and manful lamentation which contains also a just recognition of the object lamented may serve to prove think saupe and others what is very evident that caspar schiller with his stiff military regulations spirit of discipline and rugged angular ways was after all the proper father for a wideflowing sensitive enthusiastic somewhat lawless friedrich schiller and did beneficently compress him into something of the shape necessary for his task in this world                               ii the mother  of schillers mother elisabetha dorothea kodweis born at marbach 1733 the preliminary particulars have been given above that she was the daughter of an innkeeper woodmeasurer and baker prosperous in the place when schiller senior first arrived there we should have added what saupe omits that the young surgeon boarded in their house and that by the term woodmeasurer holzmesser measurer of wood is signified an official person appointed not only to measure and divide into portions the wood supplied as fuel from the ducal or royal forests but to be responsible also for payment of the same in which latter capacity kodweis as father schiller insinuates was rash imprudent and unlucky and at one time had like to have involved that prudent parsimonious soninlaw in his disastrous economics we have also said what elisabethas comely looks were and particular features pleasing and hopeful more and more to the strict young surgeon daily observant of her and them  in her circle saupe continues she was thought by her early playmates a kind of enthusiast because she with average faculties of understanding combined deep feeling true piety and love of nature a talent for music nay even for poetry but perhaps it was the very reverse qualities in her the fact namely that what she wanted in culture and it may be also in clearness and sharpness of understanding was so richly compensated by warmth and lovingness of character—perhaps it was this which most attracted to her the heart of her deeplyreasonable husband and never had he cause to repent his choice for she was and remained as is unanimously testified of her by trustworthy witnesses an unpretending soft and dutiful wife and as all her letters testify had the tenderest motherheart she read a good deal even after her marriage little as she had of time for reading favourite books with her were those on natural history but she liked best of all to study the biographies of famous men or to dwell in the spiritual poetising of an utz a gellert and klopstock she also liked and in some measure had the power to express her own feelings in verses which with all their simplicity show a sense for rhythm and some expertness in diction here is one instance her salutation to the husband who was her firstlove on newyears day 1757 the ninth year of their as yet childless marriage      o could i but have found forgetmenot in the valley     and roses beside it then had i plaited thee     in fragrant blossoms the garland for this new year     which is still brighter to me than that of our marriage was      i grumble in truth that the cold north now governs us     and every flowrets bud is freezing in the cold earth     yet one thing does not freeze i mean my loving heart     thine that is and shares with thee its joys and sorrows58      footnote 58      o hätt ich doch im thal vergissmeinnicht gefunden     und rosen nebenbei dann hat ich dir gewunden     in blüthenduft den kranz zu diesem neuen jahr     der schöner noch als der am hochzeittage war      ich zürne traun dass itzt der kalte nord regieret     und jedes blümchens keim in kalter erde frieret     doch eines frieret nicht es ist mein liebend herz     dein ist es theilt mit dir die freuden und den schmerz  the sevenyears war threw the young wife into manifold anxiety and agitation especially since she had become a mother and in fear for the life of her tenderlyloved husband had to tremble for the father of her children too to this circumstance christophine ascribes certainly with some ground the worldimportant fact that her brother had a much weaker constitution than herself he had in fact been almost born in a camp in late autumn 1759 the infantry regiment of majorgeneral romann in which caspar schiller was then a lieutenant had for sake of the autumn manœuvres of the würtemberg soldiery taken camp in its native region the mother had thereupon set out from marbach to visit her longabsent husband in the camp and it was in his tent that she felt the first symptoms of her travail she rapidly hastened back to marbach and by good luck still reached her fathers house in the marketplace there near by the great fountain where she on the 11th november was delivered of a boy for almost four years the little friedrich with christophine and mother continued in the house of the wellcontented grandparents who had not yet fallen poor under her exclusive care with selfsacrificing love and careful fidelity she nursed her little boy whose tender body had to suffer not only from the common ailments of children but was heavily visited with fits of cramp in a beautiful region on the bosom of a tender mother and in these first years far from the oversight of a rigorous father the child grew up and unfolded himself under cheerful and harmonious impressions  on the return of his father from the war little fritz now four years old was quite the image of his mother longnecked freckled and reddishhaired like her it was the pious mothers work too that a feeling of religion early and vivid displayed itself in him the easilyreceptive boy was indeed keenly attentive to all that his father in their familycircle read to them and inexhaustible in questions till he had rightly caught the meaning of it but he listened with most eagerness when his father read passages from the bible or vocally uttered them in prayer it was a touching sight says his eldest sister the expression of devotion on the dear little childs countenance with its blue eyes directed towards heaven its highblond hair about the clear brow and its fastclasped little hands it was like an angels head to look upon  with fathers return the happy mother conscientiously shared with him the difficult and important business of bringing up their son and both in union worked highly beneficially for his spiritual development the practical and rigorous father directed his chief aim to developing the boys intellect and character the mild pious poeticminded mother on the other hand strove for the ennobling nurture of his temper and his imagination it was almost exclusively owing to her that his religious feeling his tender sense of all that was good and beautiful his love of mankind tolerance and capability of selfsacrifice in the circle of his sisters and playmates distinguished the boy  on sunday afternoons when she went to walk with both the children she was wont to explain to them the churchgospel of the day once so stands it in christophines memorials when we two as children had set out walking with dear mamma to see our grandparents she took the way from ludwigsburg to marbach which leads straight over the hill a walk of some four miles it was a beautiful easter monday and our mother related to us the history of the two disciples to whom on their journey to emmaus jesus had joined himself her speech and narrative grew ever more inspired and when we got upon the hill we were all so much affected that we knelt down and prayed this hill became a tabor to us  at other times she entertained the children with fairytales and magic histories already while in lorch she had likewise led the boy so far as his power of comprehension and her own knowledge permitted into the domains of german poetry klopstocks messias opitzs poems paul gerhards and gellerts pious songs were made known to him in this tender age through his mother and were for that reason doubly dear at one time also the artless mother made an attempt on him with hofmannswaldau59 but the sugary and windy tone of him hurt the tender poetfeeling of the boy with smiling dislike he pushed the book away and afterwards was wont to remark when at the new year rustic congratulants with their foolish rhymes would too liberally present themselves mother there is a new hofmannswaldau at the door thus did the excellent mother guide forward the soul of her docile boy with biblepassages and churchsymbols with tales histories and poems into gradual form and stature never forgetting withal to awaken and nourish his sense for the beauties of nature before long nature had become his dearest abode and only love of that could sometimes tempt him to little abridgments of schoolhours often in the pretty region of lorch he wished the sun goodnight in open song or with childish pathos summoned stuttgarts painters to represent the wondrous formation and glorious colouring of the sunset clouds if in such a humour a poor man met him his overflowing little heart would impel him to the most active pity and he liberally gave away whatever he had by him and thought he could dispense with the father who as above indicated never could approve or even endure such unreasonable givingup of ones feelings to effeminate impressions was apt to intervene on these occasions even with manual punishment—unless the mother were at hand to plead the little culprit off      footnote 59 a oncecelebrated silesian of the 17th century     distinguished for his blusterous exaggerations numbfooted     caprioles and tearing of a passion to rags—now extinct  but nothing did the mother forward with more eagerness by every opportunity than the kindling inclination of her son to become a preacher which even showed itself in his sports mother or sister had to put a little cowl on his head and pin round him by way of surplice a bit of black apron then would he mount a chair and begin earnestly to preach ranging together in his own way not without some traces of coherency all that he had retained from teaching and churchvisiting in this kind and interweaving it with verses of songs the mother who listened attentively and with silent joy put a higher meaning into this childish play and in thought saw her son already stand in the pulpit and work rich in blessings in a spiritual office the spiritual profession was at that time greatly esteemed and gave promise of an honourable existence add to this that the course of studies settled for young würtemberg theologians not only offered important pecuniary furtherances and advantages but also morally the fewest dangers and thus the prudent and withal pious father too saw no reason to object to this inclination of the son and wish of the mother  it had almost happened however that the latin school in ludwigsburg where our fritz received the immediately preparatory teaching for his calling had quite disgusted him with his destination for theology the teacher of religion in the institute a narrowminded angrytempered pietist as we have seen used the sad method of tormenting his scholars with continual rigorous altogether soulless drillings and trainings in matters of mere creed nay he threatened often to whip them thoroughly if in the repetition of the catechism a single word were wrong and thus to the finelysensitive boy instruction was making hateful to him what domestic influences had made dear yet these latter did outweigh and overcome in the end and he remained faithful to his purpose of following a spiritual career  when young schiller after the completion of his course at the latin school 1777 was to be confirmed his mother and her husband came across to ludwigsburg the day before that solemn ceremony just on their arrival she saw her son wandering idle and unconcerned about the streets and impressively represented to him how greatly his indifference to the highest and most solemn transaction of his young life troubled her struck and affected hereby the boy withdrew and after a few hours handed to his parents a german poem expressive of his feelings over the approaching renewal of his baptismal covenant the father who either hadnt known the occasion of this or had looked upon his sons idling on the street with less severe eyes was highly astonished and received him mockingly with the question hast thou lost thy senses fritz the mother on the other hand was visibly rejoiced at that poetic outpouring and with good cause for apart from all other views of the matter she recognised in it how firmly her sons inclination was fixed on the study of theology—this anecdote if it were of any moment whatever appears to be a little doubtful  the painfuler therefore was it to the mothers heart when her son at the inevitable entrance into the karls school had to giveup theology and renounce withal for a long time if not forever her farther guidance and influence but she was too pious not to recognise by degrees in this change also a higher hand and could trustfully expect the workings of the same besides her son clung so tenderly to her that at least there was no separation of him from the mothers heart to be dreaded the heartwarm attachment of childish years to the creed taught him by his mother might and did vanish but not the attachment to his mother herself whose dear image often enough charmed back the pious sounds and forms of early days and for a time scared away doubts and unbelief  years came and went and schiller at last about the end of 1780 stept out of the academy into the actual world which he as yet knew only by hearsay delivered from that long unnatural constraint of body and spirit he gave free course to his fettered inclinations and sought as in poetry so also in life unlimited freedom the tumults of passion and youthful buoyancy after so long an imprisonment had their sway and embarrassments in money their natural consequence often brought him into very sad moods  in this season of time so dangerous for the moral purity of the young man his mother again was his good genius a warning and request in her soft tone of love sufficed to recall youthful levity within the barriers again and restore the balance she anxiously contrived too that the son often and willingly visited his fathers house whenever schiller had decided to give himself a good day he wandered out with some friend as far as solitüde only some four or five miles what a baking and a roasting then went on by that good soul says one who witnessed it for the dear prodigy of a son and the comrade who had come with him for whom the good mother never could do enough never have i seen a better maternal heart a more excellent more domestic more womanly woman  the admiring recognition which the son had already found among his youthful friends and in wider circles was no less grateful to her heart than the gradual perception that his powerful soul welling forth from the interior to the outward man diffused itself into his very features and by degrees even advantageously altered the curvatures and the form of his body his face about this time got rid of its freckles and irregularities of skin and strikingly improved moreover by the circumstance that the hitherto rather drooping nose gradually acquired its later aquiline form and withal the youthful poet with the growing consciousness of his strength and of his worth assumed an imposing outward attitude so that a witty stuttgart lady whose house schiller often walked past said of him regiments dr schiller steps out as if the duke were one of his inferior servants  the indescribable impression which the robbers the gigantic firstborn of a karls scholar made in stuttgart communicated itself to the mother too innocently she gave herself up to the delight of seeing her sons name wondered at and celebrated and was in her motherlove inventive enough to overcome all doubts and risks which threatened to dash her joy by christophines mediations and from the son himself as well she learned many a disquieting circumstance which for the present had to be carefully concealed from her husband but nothing whatever could shake her belief in her son and his talent without murmur with faithful trust in god she resigned herself even to the bitter necessity of losing for a long time her only son having once got to see beyond disputing that his purpose was firm to withdraw himself by flight from the dukes despotic interference with his poetical activity as well as with his practical procedures and that this purpose of his was rigorously demanded by the circumstances yet a sword went through her soul when schiller for the last time appeared at solitüde secretly to take leave of her her feelings on this tragic occasion have been described above and may well be pictured as among the painfulest tenderest and saddest that a mothers heart could have to bear our author continues  in reality it was to the poor mother a hard and lamentable time remembrance of the lately bright and safelooking situation now suddenly rent asunder and committed to the dubious unknown anxiety about their own household and the fate of her son the fathers just anger and perhaps some tacit selfreproach that she had favoured a dangerous game by keeping it concealed from her honesthearted husband—lay like crushing burdens on her heart and if many a thing did smooth itself and many a thing which at first was to be feared did not take place one thing remained fixed continually—painful anxiety about her son to the afflicted mother in this heavy time frau von wolzogen devoted the most sincere and beneficent sympathy a lady of singular goodness of heart who during schillers eight hidden months at bauerbach frequently went out to see his family at solitüde by her oral reports about schiller whom she herself several times visited at bauerbach his parents were more soothed than by his own somewhat excited letters with reference to this magnanimous service of friendship schiller wrote to her at stuttgart in february 1783 a letter to my parents is getting on its way yet much as i had to speak of you i have said nothing whatever from prudent motives of your late appearance here or of the joyful moments of our conversation together you yourself still therefore have all that to tell and you will presumably find a pair of attentive hearers frau von wolzogen ventured also to apply to a high court lady countess von hohenheim dukes finale in the illicit way whom he at length wedded personally favourable to schiller and to direct her attention before all upon the heavyladen parents nor was this without effect for the countesss persuasion seems essentially to have contributed to the result that duke karl out of respect for the deserving father left the evasion of his own pupil unpunished  it must therefore have appeared to the stillagitated mother who reverenced the frau von wolzogen as her helpful guardian a flagrant piece of ingratitude when she learnt that her son was allowing himself to be led into a passionate love for the blooming young daughter of his benefactress she grieved and mourned in secret to see him exposed to new storms foreseeing clearly in this passion a ready cause for his removal from bauerbach to such agitations her body was no longer equal a creeping eating misery undermined her health she wrote to her son at mannheim with a soft shadow of reproof that in this year since his absence she had become ten years older in health and looks not long after she had actually to take to bed because of painful cramps which proceeding from the stomach spread themselves over breast head back and loins the medicines which the son upon express account of symptoms by the father prescribed for her had no effect by degrees indeed these cramps abated or leftoff but she tottered about in a state of sickness years long the suffering mind would not let the body come to strength for though her true heart was filled with a pious love which hopes all believes and suffers all yet she was neither blind to the faults of her son nor indifferent to the thought of seeing her familys good repute and wellbeing threatened by his nonperformances and financial confusions  with the repose and peace which the news of her sons appointment to jena and intended marriage had restored to his family there appeared also beginning of 1790 an improvement to be taking place in the mothers health learning this by a letter from his father schiller wrote back with lightened heart how welcome dearest father was your last letter to me and how necessary i had the very day before got from christophine the sad news that my dearest mothers state had grown so much worse and what a blessed turn now has this weary sickness taken if in the future regimen vitæ diet arrangements of my dearest mother there is strict care taken her long and many sufferings with the source of them may be removed thanks to a merciful providence which saves and preserves for us the dear mother of our youth my soul is moved with tenderness and gratitude i had to think of her as lost to us forever and she has now been given back in reference to his approaching marriage with lottchen von lengefeld he adds how did it lacerate my heart to think that my dearest mother might not live to see the happiness of her son heaven bless you with thousandfold blessings best father and grant to my dear mother a cheerful and painless life  soon however his mother again fell sick and lay in great danger not till august following could the father announce that she was saved and from day to day growing stronger the annexed history of the disorder seemed so remarkable to schiller that he thought of preparing it for the public unless the physician courtdoctor consbruch liked better to send it out in print himself on this point says schiller i will write to him by the first post and give him my warmest thanks for the inestimable service he has done us all by his masterly cure of our dear mamma and for his generous and friendly behaviour throughout how heartily my dearest parents writes he farther did it rejoice us both this letter is of 29th december on the 20th february of that year he had been wedded to his lotte this good news of the stillcontinuing improvement of our dearest mother with full soul we both of us join in the thanks which you give to gracious heaven for this recovery and our heart now gives way to the fairest hopes that providence which herein overtops our expectations will surely yet prepare a joyful meeting for us all once more  two years afterwards this hope passed into fulfilment the mother being now completely cured of her last disorder there seized her so irresistible a longing for her son that even her hesitating husband anxious lest her very health should suffer at last gave his consent to the far and difficult journey to jena on the 3d sept 1792 schiller in joyful humour announces to his friend in dresden today i have received from home the very welcome tidings that my good mother with one of my sisters is to visit us here this month her arrival falls at a good time when i hope to be free and loose from labour and then we have ahead of us mere joyful undertakings the mother came in company with her youngest daughter bright little nane or nanette and surprised him two days sooner than by the letters from solitüde he had expected her unspeakable joy and sweet sorrow seized mother and son to feel themselves after ten years of separation once more in each others arms the long journey bad weather and roads had done her no harm she has altered a little in truth writes he to körner from what she was ten years ago but after so many sicknesses and sorrows she still has a healthy look it rejoices me much that things have so come about that i have her with me again and can be a joy to her  the mother likewise soon felt herself at home and happy in the trusted circle of her children only too fast flewby the beautiful and happy days which seemed to her richly to make amends for so many years of sorrows and cares especially it did her heart good to see for herself what a beneficent influence the real and beautiful womanhood of her daughterinlaw exercised upon her son daily she learnt to know the great advantages of mind and heart in her daily she more deeply thanked god that for her son who on account even of his weak health was not an altogether convenient husband there had been so tenderhearted and so finelycultivated a wife given him as lifecompanion the conviction that the domestic happiness of her son was secure contributed essentially also to alleviate the pain of departure  still happier days fell to her when schiller stirred up by her visit came the year after with his wife to swabia and lived there from august 1793 till may 1794 it was a singular and as if providential circumstance which did not escape the pious mother that schiller in the same month in which he had eleven years ago hurried and in danger fled out of stuttgart to ludwigsburg should now in peace and without obstruction come from heilbronn by the same ludwigsburg to the near neighbourhood of his parents with bitter tears of sorrow her eye had then followed the fugitive in his dark trouble and want of everything with sweet tears of joy she now received her famecrowned son whom god through sufferings and mistakes and wanderings had led to happiness and wisdom the birth of the grandson gave to her life a new charm as if of youth returned she felt herself highly favoured that god had spared her life to see her dear sons firstborn with her own eyes it was a touching spectacle to see the grandmother as she sat by the cradle of the little gold son and listened to every breathdrawing of the child or when with swelling heart she watched the approaching steps of her son and observed his true paternal pleasure over his firstborn  well did the excellent grandmother deserve such refreshment of heart for alltoo soon there came again upon her troublous and dark days schiller had found her stronger and cheerfuler than on her prior visit to jena and had quitted his homeland with the soothing hope that his good mother would reach a long and happy age nor could he have the least presentiment of the events which three years later burstin desolating and destroying upon his family and brought the health and life of his dear mother again into peril it is above stated in our sketch of the husband in what extraordinary form the universal public misery under which in 1796 all south germany was groaning struck the schiller family at solitüde already on the 21st march of this year schiller had written to his father how grieved i am for our good dear mother on whom all manner of sorrows have stormeddown in this manner but what a mercy of god it is too that she still has strength left not to sink under these circumstances but to be able still to afford you so much help who would have thought six or seven years ago that she who was so infirm and exhausted would now be serving you all as support and nurse in such traits i recognise a good providence which watches over us and my heart is touched by it to the core  meanwhile the poor mothers situation grew ever frightfuler from day to day and it needed her extraordinary strength of religious faith to keep her from altogether sinking under the pains sorrows and toils which she had for so many weeks to bear all alone with the help only of a hired maid the news of such misery threw schiller into the deepest grief he saw only one way of sending comfort and help to his poor mother and immediately adopted it writing to his eldest sister in meiningen as follows       thou too wilt have heard dearest sister that luise has      fallen seriously ill and that our poor dear mother is      thereby robbed of all consolation if luises case were to      grow worse or our fathers even our poor mother would be      left entirely forsaken such misery would be unspeakable      canst thou make it possible thinkst thou that thy      strength could accomplish such a thing if so at once make      the journey thither what it costs i will pay with joy      reinwald might accompany thee or if he did not like that      come over to me here where i would brotherlike take care      of him       consider my dear sister that parents in such extremity      of need have the justest claim upon their children for      help o god why am not i myself in such health as in my      journey thither three years ago nothing should have      hindered me from hastening to them but that i have scarcely      gone over the threshold for a year past makes me so weak      that i either could not stand the journey or should fall      down into sickness myself in that afflicted house alas i      can do nothing for them but help with money and god knows      i do that with joy consider that our dear mother who has      held up hitherto with an admirable courage must at last      break down under so many sorrows i know thy childlike      loving heart i know the perfect fairness and equitable      probity of my brotherinlaw both these facts will teach      you better than i under the circumstances salute him      cordially—thy faithful brother       schiller  christophine failed not to go as we saw above from the time of her arrival there no week passed without schillers writing home and his letters much contributed to strengthen and support the heavyladen mother the assurance of being tenderly loved by such a son was infinitely grateful to her she considered him as a tried faithful friend to whom one without reluctance yields his part in ones own sorrows schiller thus expressed himself on this matter in a letter to christophine of 9th may the last letter of my dear good mother has deeply affected me ah how much has this good mother already undergone and with what patience and courage has she borne it how touching is it that she opened her heart to me and what woe was mine that i cannot immediately comfort and soothe her hadst thou not gone i could not have stayed here the situation of our dear ones was horrible so solitary without help from loving friends and as if forsaken by their two children living far away i dare not think of it what did not our good mother do for her parents and how greatly has she deserved the like from us thou wilt comfort her dear sister and me thou wilt find heartily ready for all that thou canst propose to me salute our dear parents in the tenderest way and tell them that their son feels their sorrows  the excellent christophine did her utmost in these days of sorrow she comforted her mother and faithfully nursed her father to his last breath nay she saved him and the house with great presence of mind on a sudden inburst of french soldiers nor did she return to meiningen till all tumult of affairs was past and the mother was again a little composed and composure the mother truly needed for in a short space she had seen a hopeful daughter and a faithful husband laid in their graves and by the death of her husband a union severed which originating in mutual affection had for fortyseven years been blessed with the same mutual feeling to all which in her position was now added the doublypressing care about her future days here however the son so dear to her interposed with loving readiness and the tender manner natural to him  you dear mother he writes must now choose wholly for yourself what your way of life is to be and let there be i charge you no care about me or others in your choice ask yourself where you would like best to live—here with me or with christophine or in our native country with luise whithersoever your choice falls there will we provide the means for the present of course in the circumstances given you would remain in würtemberg a little while and in that time all would be arranged i think you might pass the winter months most easily at leonberg pleasant village nearest to solitüde and then with the spring you would come with luise to meiningen where however i would expressly advise that you had a household of your own but of all this more next time i would insist upon your coming here to me if i did not fear things would be too foreign and too unquiet for you but were you once in meiningen we will find means enough to see each other and to bring your dear grandchildren to you it were a great comfort dearest mother at least to know you for the first three or four weeks after christophines departure among people of your acquaintance as the sole company of our luise would too much remind you of times that are gone but should there be no pension granted by the duke and the sale of furniture c did not detain you too long you might perhaps travel with both the sisters to meiningen and there compose yourself in the new world so much the sooner all that you need for a convenient life must and shall be yours dear mother it shall be henceforth my care that no anxiety on that head be left you after so many sorrows the evening of your life must be rendered cheerful or at least peaceful and i hope you will still in the bosom of your children and grandchildren enjoy many a good day in conclusion he bids her send him everything of letters and mss which his dear father left hereby to fulfil his last wish which also shall have its uses to his dear mother  the widow had a pension granted by the duke of 200 gulden near 20l and therein a comfortable proof that official people recognised the worth of her late husband and held him in honour she remained in her native country and lived the next three years according to her sons counsel with luise in the little village of leonberg near to solitüde where an arrangement had been made for her here a certain herr roos a native of würtemberg had made some acquaintance with her in the winter 17978 to whom we owe the following sketch of portraiture she was a stillagreeable old person of sixtyfive or six whose lean wrinkly face still bespoke cheerfulness and kindliness her thin hair was all gray she was of short middle stature and her attitude slightly stooping she had a pleasant tone of voice and her speech flowed light and cheerful her bearing generally showed native grace and practical acquaintance with social life  towards the end of 1799 there opened to the mother a new friendly outlook in the marriage of her luise to the young parson m frankh in cleversulzbach a little town near heilbronn the rather as the worthy soninlaw would on no account have the daughter separated from the mother error on saupes part the mother schiller continued to occupy her own house at leonberg till near the end of her life she naturally made frequent little visits to cleversulzbach and her death took place there60 shortly before the marriage schiller wrote heartily wishing mother and sister happiness in this event it would be no small satisfaction to his sister he said that she could lodge and wait upon her good dear mother in a wellappointed house of her own to his mother also it must be a great comfort to see her children all settled and to live up again in a new generation      footnote 60 beziehungen p 197 n  almost contemporary with the removal of the son from jena to weimar was the mothers with her daughter to cleversulzbach the peaceful silence which now environed them in their rural abode had the most salutary influence both on her temper of mind and on her health all the more as daughter and soninlaw vied with each other in respectful attention to her the considerable distance from her son when at times it fell heavy on her she forgot in reading his letters which were ever the unaltered expression of the purest and truest childlove she forgot it too as often over the immortal works out of which his powerful spirit spoke to her she lived to hear the name of friedrich schiller celebrated over all germany with reverent enthusiasm and ennobled by the german people sooner and more gloriously than an imperial patent could do it truly a mother that has had such joys in her son is a happy one and can and may say lord now let me depart in peace i have lived enough  in the beginning of the year 1802 schillers mother again fell ill her daughter luise hastened at once to stuttgart where she then chanced to be and carried her home to cleversulzbach to be under her own nursing so soon as schiller heard of this he wrote in wellmeant consideration of his sisters frugal economies to dr hoven a friend of his youth at ludwigsburg and empowered him to take his mother over thither under his own medical care he schiller would with pleasure pay all that was necessary for lodging and attendance but the mother stayed with her daughter wrote however in her last letter to schiller thy unwearied love and care for me god reward with thousandfold love and blessings ah me another such son there is not in the world schiller in his continual anxiety about the dear patient had his chief solace in knowing her to be in such tender hands and he wrote at once withal to his sister thou wilt permit me also that on my side i try to do something to lighten these burdens for thee i therefore make this agreement with my bookseller cotta that he shall furnish my dear mother with the necessary money to make good in a convenient way the extra outlays which her illness requires  schillers hope supported by earlier experiences that kind nature would again help his mother did not find fulfilment on the contrary her case grew worse she suffered for months the most violent pains and was visibly travelling towards death two days before her departure she had the medallion of her son handed down to her from the wall and pressed it to her heart and with tears thanked god who had given her such good children on the 29th april 1802 she passed away in the 69th year of her age schiller from the tenor of the last news received had given up all hope and wrote in presentiment of the bitter loss to his sister frankh at cleversulzbach       thy last letter dearest sister leaves me without hope of      our dear mother for a fortnight past i have looked with      terror for the tidings of her departure and the fact that      thou hast not written in that time is a ground of fear not      of comfort alas under her late circumstances life was no      good to her more a speedy and soft departure was the one      thing that could be wished and prayed for but write me      dear sister when thou hast recovered thyself a little from      these mournful days write me minutely of her condition and      her utterances in the last hours of her life it comforts      and composes me to busy myself with her and to keep the      dear image of my mother living before me       and so they are both gone from us our dear parents and we      three alone remain let us be all the nearer to each other      dear sister and believe always that thy brother though so      far away from thee and thy sister carries you both warmly      in his heart and in all the accidents of this life will      eagerly meet you with his brotherly love       but i can write no more today write me a few words soon i      embrace thee and thy dear husband with my whole heart and      thank him again for all the love he has shown our departed      mother       your true brother       schiller  soon after this letter he received from frankh his brotherinlaw the confirmation of his sad anticipations from his answer to frankh we extract the following passage may heaven repay with rich interest the dear departed one all that she has suffered in life and done for her children of a truth she deserved to have loving children for she was a good daughter to her suffering necessitous parents and the childlike solicitude she always had for them well deserved the like from us you my dear brotherinlaw have shared the assiduous care of my sister for her that is gone and acquired thereby the justest claim upon my brotherly love alas you had already given your spiritual support and filial service to my late father and taken on yourself the duties of his absent son how cordially i thank you never shall i think of my departed mother without at the same time blessing the memory of him who alleviated so kindly the last days of her life he then signifies the wish to have from the effects of his dear mother something that without other worth will remain a continual memorial of her and was in effect heartily obliged to his brother who sent him a ring which had been hers it is the most precious thing that he could have chosen for me writes he to luise and i will keep it as a sacred inheritance painfully had it touched him withal that the day of his entering his new house at weimar had been the deathday of his mother he noticed this singular coincidence as if in mournful presentiment of his own early decease as a singular concatenation of events by the hand of destiny  a tree and a plain stone cross with the greatlycomprehensive short inscription here rests schillers mother now mark her grave in cleversulzbach

except parade were considerably awake to the comely jungfers schiller and their promenadings in those pleasant woods one lieutenant of them afterwards a colonel obrist von miller of stuttgart is said to have manifested honourable aspirations and intentions towards christophine—which however and all connection with whom or his comrades the rigorously prudent father strictly forbade his piously obedient daughters christophine it is rather thought with some regret immediately conforming a portrait of this von miller painted by christophine still exists it would appear among the papers of the schillers62      footnote 62 beziehungen p 217 n  the great transaction of her life her marriage with reinwald court librarian of meiningen had its origin in 1783 the fruit of that forced retreat of schillers to bauerbach and of the eight months he spent there under covert anonymously and in secret as dr ritter with reinwald for his one friend and adviser reinwald who commanded the resources of an excellent library and of a sound understanding long seriously and painfully cultivated was of essential use to schiller and is reckoned to be the first real guide or useful counsellor he ever had in regard to literature one of christophines letters to her brother written at her fathers order fell by accident on reinwalds floor and was read by him—awakening in his overclouded heavyladen mind a gleam of hope and aspiration this wise prudent lovinghearted and judicious young woman of such clear and salutary principles of wisdom as to economics too what a blessing she might be to me as wife in this dark lonely home of mine upon which hint he spake and schiller as we saw above who loved him well but knew him to be within a year or two of fifty always ailing in health taciturn surly melancholy and miserably poor was rebuked by papa for thinking it questionable we said it came about all the same schiller had not yet left mannheim for the second and last time when in 1784 christophine paid him a visit escorted thither by reinwald who had begged to have that honour allowed him having been at solitüde and either there or on his road to mannheim concluded his affair streicher an eyewitness of this visit says the healthy cheerful and blooming maiden had determined to share her future lot with a man whose small income and uncertain health seemed to promise little joy nevertheless her reasons were of so noble a sort that she never repented in times following this sacrifice of her fancy to her understanding and to a husband of real worth63 they were married june 1786 and for the next thirty or indeed in all sixty years christophine lived in her dark new home at meiningen and never except in that melancholy time of sickness mortality and war appears to have seen native land and parents again      footnote 63 schwab p 173 citing streichers words  what could have induced in the calm and welldiscerning christophine such a resolution is by no means clear saupe with hesitation seems to assign a religious motive the desire of doing good had that abrupt and peremptory dismissal of lieutenant miller perhaps something to do with it probably her fathers humour on the matter at all times so anxious and zealous to see his daughters settled had a chief effect it is certain christophine consulted her parish clergyman on the affair and got from him as saupe shows us an affirmatory or at least permissive response certain also that she summoned her own best insight of all kinds to the subject and settled it calmly and irrevocably with whatever faculty was in her  to the candid observer reinwalds gloomy ways were not without their excuse scarcely above once before this in his now longish life had any gleam of joy or success shone on him to cheer the strenuous and neverabated struggle his father had been tutor to the prince of meiningen who became duke afterwards and always continued to hold him in honour fathers death had taken place in 1751 young reinwald then in his fourteenth year after passing with distinction his threeyears curriculum at jena reinwald returned to meiningen expecting employment and preferment—the rather perhaps as his mothers bit of property got much ruined in the sevenyears war then raging employment reinwald got but of the meanest kanzlist clerkship kind and year after year in spite of his merits patient faithfulness and undeniable talent no preferment whatever at length however in 1762 the duke perhaps enlightened by experience as to reinwald or by personal need of such a talent did send him as geheimer kanzlist kind of private secretary to vienna with a view to have from him reports about politics and literary objects there this was an extremely enjoyable position for the young man but it lasted only till the dukes death which followed within two years reinwald was then immediately recalled by the new duke who i think had rather been in controversy with his predecessor and thrown back to nearly his old position where without any regard had to his real talents and merits he continued thirteen years under the title of consistorial kanzlist and with the miserablest fraction of yearly pay carried on the slavish spiritkilling labours required of him in 1776—uncertain whether as promotion or as mere abridgment of labour—he was placed in the library as now that is to say had become sublibrarian at a salary of about 15l with all the library duties to do an older and more favoured gentleman perhaps in lieu of pension enjoying the upper office and doing none of the work  under these continual pressures and discouragements poor reinwalds heart had got hardened into mutinous indignation and his health had broken down so that by this time he was noted in his little world as a solitary taciturn morose and gloomy man but greatly respected by the few who knew him better as a clearheaded true and faithful person much distinguished by intellectual clearness and veracity by solid scholarly acquirements and sterling worth of character to bring a little help or cheerful alleviation to such a downpressed man if a wise and gentle christophine could accomplish it would surely be a bit of welldoing but it was an extremely difficult one  the marriage was childless not in the first or in any times of it to be called unhappy but as the weight of years was added christophines problem grew ever more difficult she was of a compassionate nature and had a loving patient and noble heart prudent she was the skilfulest and thriftiest of financiers could well keep silence too and with a gentle stoicism endure much small unreason saupe says withal nobody liked a laugh better or could laugh more heartily than she even in her extreme old age—christophine herself makes no complaint on looking back upon her poor reinwald thirty years after all was over her final record of it is for twentynine years we lived contentedly together but her rugged hypochondriac of a husband morbidly sensitive to the least interruption of his whims and habitudes never absent from their one dim sittingroom except on the days in which he had to attend at the library was in practice infinitely difficult to deal with and seems to have kept her matchless qualities in continual exercise he belonged to the class called in germany stubengelehrten closet literarymen who publish little or nothing that brings them profit but are continually poring and studying study was the one consolation he had in life and formed his continual employment to the end of his days he was deep in various departments antiquarian philological historical deep especially in gothic philology in which last he did what is reckoned a real feat—he reinwald though again it was another who got the reward he had procured somewhere a transcript of the famous anglosaxon poem heliand saviour from the cotton library in england this he with unwearied labour and to great perfection had at last got ready for the press translation glossary original all in readiness—but could find no publisher nobody that would print without a premium not to earn less than nothing by his labour he sent the work to the münchen library where in after years one schmeller found it and used it for an editio princeps of his own sic vos non vobis heavyladen reinwald64—      footnote 64 schillers beziehungen where many of     christophines letters beautiful all of them are given  to reinwald himself christophines presence and presidency in his dim household were an infinite benefit—though not much recognised by him but accepted rather as a natural tribute due to unfortunate downpressed worth till towards the very end when the singular merit of it began to dawn upon him like the brightness of the sun when it is setting poor man he anxiously spent the last two weeks of his life in purchasing and settling about a neat little cottage for christophine where accordingly she passed her long widowhood on stiller terms though not on less beneficent and humbly beautiful than her marriage had offered  christophine by pious prudence faith in heaven and in the good fruits of real goodness even on earth had greatly comforted the gloomy disappointed painstricken man enlightened his darkness and made his poverty noble simplex munditiis might have been her motto in all things her beautiful letters to her brother are full of cheerful though also it is true sad enough allusions to her difficulties with reinwald and partial successes poor soul her hopes too are gently turned sometimes on a blessed future which might still lie ahead of her at last coming as a widow to live with her brother in serene affection like that of their childhood together in a calm blessedness such as the world held no other for her but gloomy reinwald survived bright schiller for above ten years and she had thirty more of lone widowhood under limited conditions to spend after him still in a noble humblyadmirable and even happy and contented manner she was the flower of the schiller sisterhood though all three are beautiful to us and in poor nane there is even something of poetic and tragically pathetic for one blessing christophine lived almost always in good health through life it may be said of her she was helpful to all about her never hindersome to any and merited and had the universal esteem from high and low of those she had lived among at meiningen 31st august 1847 within a few days of her ninetyfirst year without almost one days sickness a gentle stroke of apoplexy took her suddenly away and so ended

told how in 1792 she charmed her brother and his jena circle by her recitations and her amiable enthusiastic nature and how next year on schillers swabian visit his love of her grew to something of admiration and practical hope of helping such a rich talent and noble heart into some clear development—when two years afterwards death put to the dear nanette and his hopes about her a cruel end we are now to give the first buddingout of those fine talents and tendencies of poor nanette and that is all the history the dear little being has saupe proceeds  some two years after schillers flight nanette as a child of six or seven had with her elder sister luise witnessed the first representation of schillers kabale und liebe in the stuttgart theatre with great excitement and breath heldin she had watched the rollingup of the curtain and during the whole play no word escaped her lips but the excited glance of her eyes and her heightened colour from act to act testified her intense emotion the stormy applause with which her brothers play was received by the audience made an indelible impression on her  the players in particular had shone before her as in a magic light the splendour of which in the course of years rather increased than diminished the childs bright fancy loved to linger on those nevertobeforgotten people by whom her brothers poem had been led into her sight and understanding the dawning thought how glorious it might be to work such wonders herself gradually settled the more she read and heard of her dear brothers poetic achievements into the ardent but secret wish of being herself able to represent his tragedies upon the stage on her visit to jena and during her brothers abode in swabia she was never more attentive than when schiller spoke occasionally of the acting of his pieces or unfolded his opinion of the players art  the wish of nanette secretly nourished in this manner to be able on the stage which represents the world to contribute to the glory of her brother seized her now after his return with such force and constancy that schillers sisterinlaw caroline von wolzogen urged him to yield to the same to try his sisters talent and if it was really distinguished to let her enter this longedfor career schiller had no love for the player profession but as in his then influential connections in weimar he might steer clear of many a danger he promised to think the thing over and thus this kind and amiable protectress had the satisfaction of cheering nanettes last months with the friendly prospect that her wishes might be fulfilled—schillers hope after a dialogue with goethe on the subject had risen to certainty when with the liveliest sorrow he learnt that nanette was ill of that contagious hospital fever and in a few days more that she was gone forever65      footnote 65 saupe pp 1505  beautiful nanette with such a softlyglowing soul and such a brief tragicallybeautiful little life like a daughter of the rosyfingered morn her existence all a sungilt soft auroral cloud and no sultry day with its dusts and disfigurements permitted to follow father schiller seems in his rugged way to have loved nanette best of them all in an embarrassed manner we find him more than once recommending her to schillers help and intimating what a glorious thing for her were it a possible one education might be he followed her in few months to her long home and by his own direction was buried in the churchyard at gerlingen by her side   luise born 24th january 1766 married 20th october 1799 died 14th september 1836  of luises life too except what was shown above there need little be said in the dismal pestilential days at solitüde while her father lay dying and poor nanette caught the infection luise with all her tender assiduities and household talent was there but soon after nanettes death the fever seized her too and she long lay dangerously ill in that forlorn household still weak but slowly recovering when christophine arrived  the father a short while before his death summoned to him that excellent young clergyman frankh who had been so unweariedly kind to them in this time of sickness when all neighbours feared to look in to ask him what his intentions towards luise were it was in presence of the good old man that they made solemn promise to each other and at leonberg where thenceforth the nowwidowed mothers dwelling was they were formally betrothed and some two years after that were married  her mothers death so tenderly watched over took place at their parsonage at cleversulzbach as we saw above frankh about two years after was promoted to a better living möckmühl by name and lived there a welldoing and respected parson till his death in 1834 which luises followed in september of the second year afterwards their marriage lasted thirtyfive years luise had brought him three children and seems to have been in all respects an excellent wife she was ingenious in intellectuals as well as economics had a taste for poetry a boundless enthusiasm for her brother seems to have been an anxious mother often ailing herself but strenuously doing her best at all times  a touching memorial of luise is schillers last letter to her letter of affectionate apology for long silence—apology and hope of doing better—written only a few weeks before his own death it is as follows        weimar 27th march 1805       yes it is a long time indeed good dear luise since i      have written to thee but it was not for amusements that i      forgot thee it was because in this time i have had so many      hard illnesses to suffer which put me altogether out of my      regular way for many months i had lost all courage and      cheerfulness and given up all hope of my recovery in such      a humour one does not like to speak and since then on      feeling myself again better there was after the long      silence a kind of embarrassment and so it was still put      off but now when i have been anew encouraged by thy      sisterly love i gladly join the thread again and it shall      if god will not again be broken       thy dear husbands promotion to möckmühl which i learned      eight days ago from our sister christophine has given      us great joy not only because it so much improves your      position but also because it is so honourable a testimony      for my dear brotherinlaws deserts may you feel      yourselves right happy in these new relations and right      long enjoy them we too are got thereby a few miles nearer      you and on a future journey to franconia which we are      every year projecting we may the more easily get over to      you       how sorry am i dear sister that thy health has suffered      so much and that thou wert again so unfortunate with thy      confinement perhaps your new situation might permit you      this summer to visit some tonic wateringplace which might      do thee a great deal of good—       of our family here my wife will write thee more at large      our children this winter have all had chickenpox and      poor little emilie a babe of four months had much to      suffer in the affair thank god things are all come round      with us again and my own health too begins to confirm      itself       a thousand times i embrace thee dear sister and my dear      brotherinlaw as well whom i always wish from the heart to      have more acquaintance with kiss thy children in my name      may all go right happily with you and much joy be in store      how would our dear parents have rejoiced in your good      fortune and especially our dear mother had she been spared      to see it adieu dear luise with my whole soul       thy faithful brother       schiller   schillers tone and behaviour to his sisters is always beautifully human and brotherlike as here full of affection sincerity and the warmest truest desire to help and cheer the noble loving schiller so mindful always of the lowly from his own wildlydangerous and lofty path he was never rich poor rather always but of a spirit royally munificent in these respects never forgets the poor birthdays of his sisters whom one finds afterwards gratefully recognising their beautiful dress or the like—                                       of date some six weeks after this letter to luise let us take from eyewitnesses one glimpse of schillers own deathbed it is the eighth day of his illness his last day but one in this world  morning of 8th may 1805— —schiller on awakening from sleep asked to see his youngest child the baby emilie spoken of above was brought he turned his head round took the little hand in his and with an inexpressible look of love and sorrow gazed into the little face then burst into bitter weeping hid his face among the pillows and made a sign to take the child away—this little emilie is now the baroness von gleichen coeditress with her cousin wolzogen of the clear and useful book beziehungen often quoted above it was to that same cousin wolzogens mother caroline von wolzogen authoress of the biography and in the course of this same day that schiller made the memorable response calmer and calmer—towards evening he asked to see the sun once more the curtain was opened with bright eyes and face he gazed into the beautiful sunset it was his last farewell to nature  thursday 9th may all the morning his mind was wandering he spoke incoherent words mostly in latin about three in the afternoon complete weakness came on his breathing began to be interrupted about four he asked for naphtha but the last syllable died on his tongue he tried to write but produced only three letters in which however the character of his hand was still visible till towards six no change his wife was kneeling at the bedside he still pressed her offered hand his sisterinlaw stood with the doctor at the foot of the bed and laid warm pillows on his feet which were growing cold there now darted as it were an electrical spasm over all his countenance the head sank back the profoundest repose transfigured his face his features were as those of one softly sleeping—wrapt in hardwon victory and peace forevermore66—      footnote 66 schwab p 627 citing voss an eyewitness     and caroline von wolzogen herself                                   appendix i                                 no 1 page 31                             daniel schubart   the enthusiastic discontent so manifest in the robbers has by some been in part attributed to schillers intercourse with schubart this seems as wise as the hypothesis of grays alderman who after half a century of turtlesoup imputed the ruin of his health to eating two unripe grapes he felt them cold upon his stomach the moment they were over he never got the better of them schiller it appears saw schubart only once and their conversation was not of a confidential kind for any influence this interview could have produced upon the former the latter could have merited no mention here it is on other grounds that we refer to him schubarts history not devoid of interest in itself unfolds in a striking light the circumstances under which schiller stood at present and may serve to justify the violence of his alarms which to the happy natives of our island might otherwise appear pusillanimous and excessive for these reasons we subjoin a sketch of it   schubarts character is not a new one in literature nor is it strange that his life should have been unfortunate a warm genial spirit a glowing fancy and a friendly heart every faculty but diligence and every virtue but the understrapping virtue of discretion such is frequently the constitution of the poet the natural result of it also has frequently been pointed out and sufficiently bewailed this man was one of the many who navigate the ocean of life with more sail than ballast his voyage contradicted every rule of seamanship and necessarily ended in a wreck  christian friedrich daniel schubart was born at obersontheim in swabia on the 26th of april 1739 his father a wellmeaning soul officiated there in the multiple capacity of schoolmaster precentor and curate dignities which with various mutations and improvements he subsequently held in several successive villages of the same district daniel from the first was a thing of inconsistencies his life proceeded as if by fits and starts at school for a while he lay dormant at the age of seven he could not read and had acquired the reputation of a perfect dunce but all at once says his biographer the rind which enclosed his spirit started asunder and daniel became the prodigy of the school his good father determined to make a learned man of him he sent him at the age of fourteen to the nordlingen lyceum and two years afterwards to a similar establishment at nürnberg here schubart began to flourish with all his natural luxuriance read classical and domestic poets spouted speculated wrote flowing songs discovered a decided turn for music and even composed tunes for the harpsichord in short he became an acknowledged genius and his parents consented that he should go to jena and perform his cursus of theology  schubarts purposes were not at all like the decrees of fate he set out towards jena and on arriving at erlangen resolved to proceed no farther but perform his cursus where he was for a time he studied well but afterwards tumultuously that is in violent fits alternating with fits as violent of idleness and debauchery he became a bursche of the first water drank and declaimed rioted and ran in debt till his parents unable any longer to support such expenses were glad to seize the first opening in his cursus and recall him he returned to them with a mind fevered by intemperance and a constitution permanently injured his heart burning with regret and vanity and love of pleasure his head without habits of activity or principles of judgment a whirlpool where fantasies and hallucinations and fragments of science were chaotically jumbled to and fro but he could babble collegelatin and talk with a trenchant tone about the revolutions of philosophy such accomplishments procured him pardon from his parents the precentorial spirit of his father was more than reconciled on discovering that daniel could also preach and play upon the organ the good old people still loved their prodigal and would not cease to hope in him  as a preacher schubart was at first very popular he imitated cramer but at the same time manifested firstrate pulpit talents of his own these however he entirely neglected to improve presuming on his gifts and their acceptance he began to play such fantastic tricks before high heaven as made his audience sink to yawning or explode in downright laughter he often preached extempore once he preached in verse his love of company and ease diverted him from study his musical propensities diverted him still farther he had special gifts as an organist but to handle the concordance and to make the heaving bellows learn to blow were inconsistent things  yet withal it was impossible to hate poor schubart or even seriously to dislike him a joyful piping guileless mortal good nature innocence of heart and love of frolic beamed from every feature of his countenance he wished no ill to any son of adam he was musical and poetical a maker and a singer of sweet songs humorous also speculative discursive his speech though aimless and redundant glittered with the hues of fancy and here and there with the keenest rays of intellect he was vain but had no touch of pride and the excellencies which he loved in himself he acknowledged and as warmly loved in others he was a man of few or no principles but his nervous system was very good amid his chosen comrades a jug of indifferent beer and a pipe of tobacco could change the earth into elysium for him and make his brethren demigods to look at his laughing eyes and his effulgent honest face you were tempted to forget that he was a perjured priest that the world had duties for him which he was neglecting had life been all a maygame schubart was the best of men and the wisest of philosophers  unluckily it was not the voice of duty had addressed him in vain but that of want was more impressive he left his fathers house and engaged himself as tutor in a family at königsbronn to teach the young idea how to shoot had few delights for schubart he soon gave up this place in favour of a younger brother and endeavoured to subsist for some time by affording miscellaneous assistance to the clergy of the neighbouring villages ere long preferring even pedagogy to starvation he again became a teacher the bitter morsel was sweetened with a seasoning of music he was appointed not only schoolmaster but also organist of geisslingen a fit of diligence now seized him his late difficulties had impressed him and the parson of the place who subsequently married schubarts sister was friendly and skilful enough to turn the impression to account had poor schubart always been in such hands the epithet poor could never have belonged to him in this little villageschool he introduced some important reforms and improvements and in consequence attracted several valuable scholars also for his own behoof he studied honestly his conduct here if not irreprehensible was at least very much amended his marriage in his twentyfifth year might have improved it still farther for his wife was a good softhearted amiable creature who loved him with her whole heart and would have died to serve him  but new preferments awaited schubart and with them new temptations his fame as a musician was deservedly extending in time it reached ludwigsburg and the grand duke of würtemberg himself heard schubart spoken of the schoolmaster of geisslingen was in 1768 promoted to be organist and banddirector in this gay and pompous court with a bounding heart he tossed away his ferula and hastened to the scene where joys for evermore seemed calling on him he plunged into the heart of business and amusement besides the music which he taught and played publicly and privately with great applause he gave the military officers instruction in various branches of science he talked and feasted he indited songs and rhapsodies he lectured on history and the belles lettres all this was more than schubarts head could stand in a little time he fell in debt took up with virtuosi began to read voltaire and talk against religion in his drink from the rank of genius he was fast degenerating into that of profligate his affairs grew more and more embarrassed and he had no gift of putting any order in them prudence was not one of schubarts virtues the nearest approximation he could make to it was now and then a little touch of cunning his wife still loved him loved him with that perverseness of affection which increases in the inverse ratio of its requital she had long patiently endured his follies and neglect happy if she could obtain a transient hour of kindness from him but his endless course of riot and the straits to which it had reduced their hapless family at length overcame her spirits she grew melancholy almost brokenhearted and her father took her home to him with her children from the spendthrift who had been her ruin schubarts course in ludwigsburg was verging to its close his extravagance increased and debts pressed heavier and heavier on him for some scandal with a young woman of the place he was cast into prison and let out of it with an injunction forthwith to quit the dominions of the grand duke  forlorn and homeless here then was schubart footing the hard highway with a staff in his hand and one solitary thaler in his purse not knowing whither he should go at heilbronn the bürgermeister wachs permitted him to teach his bürgermeisterinn the harpsichord and schubart did not die of hunger for a space of time he wandered to and fro with numerous impracticable plans now talking for his victuals now lecturing or teaching music kind people now attracted to him by his genius and misfortunes and anon repelled from him by the faults which had abased him once a gleam of courtpreferment revisited his path the elector palatine was made acquainted with his gifts and sent for him to schwetzingen to play before him his playing gratified the electoral ear he would have been provided for had he not in conversation with his highness happened to express a rather free opinion of the mannheim academy which at that time was his highnesss hobby on the instant of this luckless oversight the door of patronage was slammed in schubarts face and he stood solitary on the pavement as before  one count schmettau took pity on him offered him his purse and home both of which the wayworn wanderer was happy to accept at schmettaus he fell in with baron leiden the bavarian envoy who advised him to turn catholic and accompany the returning embassy to munich schubart hesitated to become a renegade but departed with his new patron upon trial in the way he played before the bishop of würzburg was rewarded by his princely reverence with gold as well as praise and arrived under happy omens at munich here for a while fortune seemed to smile on him again the houses of the great were thrown open to him he talked and played and fared sumptuously every day he took serious counsel with himself about the great popish question now inclining this way now that he was puzzling which to choose when chance entirely relieved him of the trouble a person of respectability in munich wrote to würtemberg to make inquiries who or what this general favourite was and received for answer that the general favourite was a villain and had been banished from ludwigsburg for denying that there was a holy ghost—schubart was happy to evacuate munich without tap of drum  once more upon the road without an aim the wanderer turned to augsburg simply as the nearest city and—set up a newspaper the deutsche chronik flourished in his hands in a little while it had acquired a decided character for sprightliness and talent in time it became the most widely circulated journal of the country schubart was again a prosperous man his writings stamped with the vigorous impress of his own genius travelled over europe artists and men of letters gathered round him he had money he had fame the rich and noble threw their parlours open to him and listened with delight to his overflowing manycoloured conversation he wrote paragraphs and poetry he taught music and gave concerts he set up a spouting establishment recited newlypublished poems read klopstocks messias to crowded and enraptured audiences schubarts evil genius seemed asleep but schubart himself awoke it he had borne a grudge against the clergy ever since his banishment from ludwigsburg and he now employed the facilities of his journal for giving vent to it he criticised the priesthood of augsburg speculated on their selfishness and cant and took every opportunity of turning them and their proceedings into ridicule the jesuits especially whom he regarded as a fallen body he treated with extreme freedom exposing their deceptions and holding up to public contumely certain quacks whom they patronised the jesuitic beast was prostrate but not dead it had still strength enough to lend a dangerous kick to any one who came too near it one evening an official person waited upon schubart and mentioned an arrest by virtue of a warrant from the catholic bürgermeister schubart was obliged to go to prison the heads of the protestant party made an effort in his favour they procured his liberty but not without a stipulation that he should immediately depart from augsburg schubart asked to know his crime but the council answered him we have our reasons let that satisfy you and with this very moderate satisfaction he was forced to leave their city  but schubart was now grown an adept in banishment so trifling an event could not unhinge his equanimity driven out of augsburg the philosophic editor sought refuge in ulm where the publication of his journal had for other reasons already been appointed to take place the deutsche chronik was as brilliant here as ever it extended more and more through germany copies of it even came to london paris amsterdam and petersburg nor had its authors fortune altered much he had still the same employments and remunerations and extravagances the same sort of friends the same sort of enemies the latter were a little busier than formerly they propagated scandals engraved caricatures indited lampoons against him but this he thought a very small matter a man that has been three or four times banished and as often put in prison and for many years on the point of starving will not trouble himself much about a gross or two of pasquinades schubart had his wife and family again beside him he had money also to support them so he sang and fiddled talked and wrote and built the lofty rhyme and cared no fig for any one  but enemies more fell than these were lurking for the thoughtless man of paragraphs the jesuits had still their feline eyes upon him and longed to have their talons in his flesh they found a certain general ried who joined them on a quarrel of his own this general ried the austrian agent at ulm had vowed inexpiable hatred against schubart it would seem for a very slight cause indeed once schubart had engaged to play before him and then finding that the harpsichord was out of order had refused flatly refused the generals elevated spirit called for vengeance on this impudent plebeian the jesuits encouraged him and thus all lay in eager watch an opportunity ere long occurred one week in 1778 there appeared in schubarts newspaper an extract of a letter from vienna stating that the empress maria theresa had been struck by apoplexy on reading which the general made instant application to his ducal highness requesting that the publisher of this atrocious libel should be given up to him and sent to expiate his crime in hungary by imprisonment—for life the duke desired his gallant friend to be at ease for that he had long had his own eye on this man and would himself take charge of him accordingly a few days afterwards herr von scholl comptroller of the convent of blaubeuren came to schubart with a multitude of compliments inviting him to dinner as there was a stranger wishing to be introduced to him schubart sprang into the schlitten with this wolf in sheeps clothing and away they drove to blaubeuren arrived here the honourable herr von scholl left him in a private room and soon returned with a posse of official majors and amtmen the chief of whom advanced to schubart and declared him—an arrested man the hapless schubart thought it was a jest but alas here was no jesting schubart then said with a composure scarcely to be looked for that he hoped the duke would not condemn him unheard in this too he was deceived the men of office made him mount a carriage with them and set off without delay for hohenasperg the duke himself was there with his duchess when these bloodhounds and their prey arrived the princely couple gazed from a window as the group went past them and a fellowcreature took his farewell look of sun and sky   if hitherto the follies of this man have cast an air of farce upon his sufferings even when in part unmerited such sentiments must now give place to that of indignation at his cruel and coldblooded persecutors schubart who never had the heart to hurt a fly and with all his indiscretions had been no mans enemy but his own was conducted to a narrow subterraneous dungeon and left without book or pen or any sort of occupation or society to chew the cud of bitter thought and count the leaden months as they passed over him and brought no mitigation of his misery his serene transparency of würtemberg nay the heroic general himself might have been satisfied could they have seen him physical squalor combined with moral agony were at work on schubart at the end of a year he was grown so weak that he could not stand except by leaning on the walls of his cell a little while and he bade fair to get beyond the reach of all his tyrants this however was not what they wanted the prisoner was removed to a wholesome upper room allowed the use of certain books the sight of certain company and had at least the privilege to think and breathe without obstruction he was farther gratified by hearing that his wife and children had been treated kindly the boys had been admitted to the stuttgard school where schiller was now studying to their mother there had been assigned a pension of two hundred gulden charles of würtemberg was undoubtedly a weak and heartless man but we know not that he was a savage one in the punishment of schubart it is possible enough that he believed himself to be discharging an important duty to the world the only subject of regret is that any duty to the world beyond the duty of existing inoffensively should be committed to such hands that men like charles and ried endowed with so very small a fraction of the common faculties of manhood should have the destiny of any living thing at their control  another mitigating circumstance in schubarts lot was the character of his gaoler this humane person had himself tasted the tender mercies of paternal government he knew the nature of a dungeon better even than his prisoner for four years we are told he had seen no human face his scanty food had been lowered to him through a trapdoor neither chair nor table were allowed him his cell was never swept his beard and nails were left to grow the humblest conveniences of civilised humanity were denied him67 on this man affliction had produced its softening not its hardening influence he had grown religious and merciful in heart he studied to alleviate schubarts hard fate by every means within his power he spoke comfortingly to him ministered to his infirmities and in spite of orders lent him all his books these it is true were only treatises on theosophy and mystical devotion but they were the best he had and to schubart in his first lonely dungeon they afforded occupation and solace      footnote 67 and yet mr fox is reported to have said     there was one free government on the continent and that     one was—würtemberg they had a parliament and three     estates like the english—so much for paper constitutions  human nature will accommodate itself to anything the king of pontus taught himself to eat poison schubart cut out from intemperance and jollity did not pine away in confinement and abstemiousness he had lost voltaire and gay company he found delight in solitude and jacob böhm nature had been too good to him to let his misery in any case be unalloyed the vague unguided ebullience of spirit which had so often set the table in a roar and made him the most fascinating of debauchees was now mellowed into a cloudy enthusiasm the sable of which was still copiously blended with rainbow colours his brain had received a slight though incurable crack there was a certain exasperation mixed with his unsettled fervour but he was not wretched often even not uncomfortable his religion was not real but it had reality enough for present purposes he was at once a sceptic and a mystic a true disciple of böhm as well as of voltaire for afflicted irresolute imaginative men like schubart this is not a rare or altogether ineffectual resource at the bottom of their minds they doubt or disbelieve but their hearts exclaim against the slightest whisper of it they dare not look into the fathomless abyss of infidelity so they cover it over with the dense and strangelytinted smoke of theosophy schubart henceforth now and then employed the phrases and figures of religion but its principles had made no change in his theory of human duties it was not food to strengthen the weakness of his spirit but an opiate to stay its craving  schubart had still farther resources like other great men in captivity he set about composing the history of his life it is true he had no pens or paper but this could not deter him a fellowprisoner to whom as he one day saw him pass by the grating of his window he had communicated his desire entered eagerly into the scheme the two contrived to unfasten a stone in a wall that divided their apartments when the prisondoors were bolted for the night this volunteer amanuensis took his place schubart trailed his mattress to the friendly orifice and there lay down and dictated in whispers the record of his fitful story these memoirs have been preserved they were published and completed by a son of schubarts we have often wished to see them but in vain  by day schubart had liberty to speak with certain visitors one of these as we have said above was schiller that schubart in their single interview was pleased with the enthusiastic friendly boy we could have conjectured and he has himself informed us excepting schiller said the veteran garreteer in writing afterwards to gleim i scarcely know of any german youth in whom the sacred spark of genius has mounted up within the soul like flame upon the altar of a deity we are fallen into the shameful times when women bear rule over men and make the toilet a tribunal before which the most gigantic minds must plead hence the stunted spirit of our poets hence the dwarf products of their imagination hence the frivolous witticism the heartless sentiment crippled and ricketed by soups ragouts and sweetmeats which you find in fashionable balladmongers  time and hours wear out the roughest day the world began to feel an interest in schubart and to take some pity on him his songs and poems were collected and published their merit and their authors misery exhibited a shocking contrast his highness of würtemberg at length condescended to remember that a mortal of wants and feelings like his own had been forced by him to spend in sorrow and inaction the third part of an ordinary lifetime to waste and worse than waste ten years of precious time time of which not all the dukes and princes in the universe could give him back one instant he commanded schubart to be liberated and the rejoicing editor unacquitted unjudged unaccused once more beheld the blue zenith and the full ring of the horizon he joined his wife at stuttgard and recommenced his newspaper the deutsche chronik was again popular the notoriety of its conductor made amends for the decay which critics did not fail to notice in his faculties schubarts sufferings had in fact permanently injured him his mind was warped and weakened by theosophy and solitude bleak northern vapours often flitted over it and chilled its tropical luxuriance yet he wrote and rhymed discoursed on the corruption of the times and on the means of their improvement he published the first portion of his life and often talked amazingly about the wandering jew and a romance of which he was to form the subject the idea of making old joannes a temporibus the wandering or as schubarts countrymen denominate him the eternal jew into a novel hero was a mighty favourite with him in this antique cordwainer as on a raft at anchor in the stream of time he would survey the changes and wonders of two thousand years the roman and the arab were to figure there the crusader and the circumnavigator the eremite of the thebaid and the pope of rome joannes himself the man existing out of time and space joannes the unresting and undying was to be a deeply tragic personage schubart warmed himself with this idea and talked about it in his cups to the astonishment of simple souls he even wrote a certain rhapsody connected with it which is published in his poems but here he rested and the project of the wandering jew which goethe likewise meditated in his youth is still unexecuted goethe turned to other objects and poor schubart was surprised by death in the midst of his schemes on the 10th of october 1791   of schubarts character as a man this record of his life leaves but a mean impression unstable in his goings without principle or plan he flickered through existence like an ignisfatuus now shooting into momentary gleams of happiness and generosity now quenched in the mephitic marshes over which his zigzag path conducted him he had many amiable qualities but scarcely any moral worth from first to last his circumstances were against him his education was unfortunate its fluctuating aimless wanderings enhanced its ill effects the thrall of the passing moment he had no will the fine endowments of his heart were left to riot in chaotic turbulence and their forces cancelled one another with better models and advisers with more rigid habits and a happier fortune he might have been an admirable man as it is he is far from admirable  the same defects have told with equal influence on his character as a writer schubart had a quick sense of the beautiful the moving and the true his nature was susceptible and fervid he had a keen intellect a fiery imagination and his iron memory secured forever the various produce of so many gifts but he had no diligence no power of selfdenial his knowledge lay around him like the plunder of a sacked city like this too it was squandered in pursuit of casual objects he wrote in gusts the labor limæ et mora was a thing he did not know yet his writings have great merit his newspaper essays abound in happy illustration and brilliant careless thought his songs excluding those of a devotional and theosophic cast are often full of nature heartiness and true simplicity from his youth upwards we are told he studied the true oldgerman volkslied he watched the artisan on the street the craftsman in his workshop the soldier in his guardhouse the maid by the spinningwheel and transferred the genuine spirit of primeval germanism which he found in them to his own songs hence their popularity which many of them still retain in his larger lyrical pieces observes the same not injudicious critic we discover fearless singularity wild imagination dwelling rather on the grand and frightful than on the beautiful and soft deep but seldom longcontinued feeling at times fardarting thoughts original images stormy vehemence and generally a glowing selfcreated figurative diction he never wrote to show his art but poured forth from the inward call of his nature the thought or feeling which happened for the hour to have dominion in him68      footnote 68 jördens lexicon from which most part of the     above details are taken—there exists now a decidedly     compact intelligent and intelligible life of schubart     done in three little volumes by strauss some years ago     note of 1857  such were schubart and his works and fortunes the disjecta membra of a richlygifted but illstarred and infatuated poet the image of his persecutions added speed to schillers flight from stuttgard may the image of his wasted talents and ineffectual life add strength to our resolves of living otherwise                              letters of schiller   a few extracts from schillers correspondence may be gratifying to some readers the letters to dalberg which constitute the chief part of it as yet before the public are on the whole less interesting than might have been expected if we did not recollect that the writer of them was still an inexperienced youth overawed by his idea of dalberg to whom he could communicate with freedom only on a single topic and besides oppressed with grievances which of themselves would have weighed down his spirit and prevented any frank or cordial exposition of its feelings  of the reichsfreiherr von dalberg himself this correspondence gives us little information and we have gleaned little elsewhere he is mentioned incidentally in almost every literary history connected with his time and generally as a mild gentlemanly person a judicious critic and a warm lover of the arts and their cultivators the following notice of his death is extracted from the conversationslexicon part iii p 12 died at mannheim on the 27th of december 1806 in his 85th year wolfgang heribert reichsfreiherr von dalberg knighted by the emperor leopold on his coronation at frankfort a warm friend and patron of the arts and sciences while the german society flourished at mannheim he was its first president and the theatre of that town the school of the best actors in germany of iffland beck beil and many others owes to him its foundation and its maintenance throughout his long intendancy which he held till 1803 as a writer and a poet he is no less favourably known we need only refer to his cora a musical drama and to the monch von carmel—these letters of schiller were found among his papers at his death rescued from destruction by two of his executors and published at carlsruhe in a small duodecimo in the year 1819 there is a verbose preface but no note or comment though some such aid is now and then a little wanted  the letters most worthy of our notice are those relating to the exhibition of the robbers on the mannheim stage and to schillers consequent embarrassments and flight from these accordingly the most of our selections shall be taken it is curious to see with what timidity the intercourse on schillers part commences and how this awkward shyness gradually gives place to some degree of confidence as he becomes acquainted with his patron or is called to treat of subjects where he feels that he himself has a dignity and rights of his own forlorn and humble as he is at first he never mentions dalberg but with all his titles some of which to our unceremonious ears seem ludicrous enough thus in the full style of german reverence he avoids directly naming his correspondent but uses the oblique designation of your excellency or something equally exalted and he begins his two earliest letters with an address which literally interpreted runs thus empirefree highlywellborn particularlymuchtobevenerated lord privy counsellor such sounding phrases make us smile but they entirely depend on custom for their import and the smile which they excite is not by any means a philosophic one it is but fair that in our version we omit them or render them by some more grave equivalent  the first letter is as follows        no date       the proud judgment passed upon me in the flattering letter      which i had the honour to receive from your excellency is      enough to set the prudence of an author on a very slippery      eminence the authority of the quarter it proceeds from      would almost communicate to that sentence the stamp of      infallibility if i could regard it as anything but a mere      encouragement of my muse more than this a deep feeling of my      weakness will not let me think it but if my strength shall      ever climb to the height of a masterpiece i certainly shall      have this warm approval of your excellency alone to thank for      it and so will the world for several years i have had the      happiness to know you from the public papers long ago the      splendour of the mannheim theatre attracted my attention      and i confess ever since i felt any touch of dramatic      talent in myself it has been among my darling projects some      time or other to remove to mannheim the true temple of      thalia a project however which my closer connection with      würtemberg might possibly impede       your excellencys very kind proposal on the subject of the      robbers and such other pieces as i may produce in future      is infinitely precious to me the maturing of it well      deserves a narrower investigation of your excellencys      theatre its special mode of management its actors the non      plus ultra of its machinery in a word a full conception of      it such as i shall never get while my only scale of      estimation is this stuttgard theatre of ours an      establishment still in its minority unhappily my      economical circumstances render it impossible for me to      travel much though i could travel now with the greater      happiness and confidence as i have still some pregnant      ideas for the mannheim theatre which i could wish to have      the honour of communicating to your excellency for the rest      i remain c   from the second letter we learn that schiller had engaged to theatrilise his original edition of the robbers and still wished much to be connected in some shape with mannheim the third explains itself        stuttgard 6th october 1781       here then at last returns the luckless prodigal the      remodelled robbers i am sorry that i have not kept the      time appointed by myself but a transitory glance at the      number and extent of the changes i have made will i trust      be sufficient to excuse me add to this that a contagious      epidemic was at work in our military hospital which of      course interfered very often with my otia poetica after      finishing my work i may assure you i could engage with less      effort of mind and certainly with far more contentment to      compose a new piece than to undergo the labour i have just      concluded the task was complicated and tedious here i had      to correct an error which naturally was rooted in the very      groundwork of the play there perhaps to sacrifice a beauty      to the limits of the stage the humour of the pit the      stupidity of the gallery or some such sorrowful convention      and i need not tell you that as in nature so on the stage      an idea an emotion can have only one suitable expression      one proper tone a single alteration in a trait of character      may give a new tendency to the whole personage and      consequently to his actions and the mechanism of the piece      which depends on them       in the original the robbers are exhibited in strong      contrast with each other and i dare maintain that it is      difficult to draw half a dozen robbers in strong contrast      without in some of them offending the delicacy of the stage      in my first conception of the piece i excluded the idea of      its ever being represented in a theatre hence came it that      franz was planned as a reasoning villain a plan which      though it may content the thinking reader cannot fail to vex      and weary the spectator who does not come to think and who      wants not philosophy but action       in the new edition i could not overturn this arrangement      without breakingdown the whole economy of the piece      accordingly i can predict with tolerable certainty that      franz when he appears on the stage will not play the part      which he has played with the reader and at all events the      rushing stream of the action will hurry the spectator over      all the finer shadings and rob him of a third part of the      whole character       karl von moor might chance to form an era on the stage      except a few speculations which however work as      indispensable colours in the general picture he is all      action all visible life spiegelberg schweitzer hermann      are in the strictest sense personages for the stage in a      less degree amelia and the father       written and oral criticisms i have endeavoured to turn to      advantage the alterations are important certain scenes are      altogether new of this number are hermanns counterplots      to undermine the schemes of franz his interview with that      personage which in the first composition of the work was      entirely and very unhappily forgotten his interview with      amelia in the garden has been postponed to the succeeding      act and my friends tell me that i could have fixed upon no      better act than this no better time than a few moments prior      to the meeting of amelia with moor franz is brought a little      nearer human nature but the mode of it is rather strange a      scene like his condemnation in the fifth act has never to my      knowledge been exhibited on any stage and the same may be      said of the scene where amelia is sacrificed by her lover       if the piece should be too long it stands at the discretion      of the manager to abbreviate the speculative parts of it or      here and there without prejudice to the general impression      to omit them altogether but in the printing i use the      freedom humbly to protest against the leaving out of      anything i had satisfactory reasons of my own for all that i      allowed to pass and my submission to the stage does not      extend so far that i can leave holes in my work and      mutilate the characters of men for the convenience of actors       in regard to the selection of costume without wishing to      prescribe any rules i may be permitted to remark that      though in nature dress is unimportant on the stage it is      never so in this particular the taste of my robber moor      will not be difficult to hit he wears a plume for this is      mentioned expressly in the play at the time when he      abdicates his office i have also given him a baton his      dress should always be noble without ornament unstudied but      not negligent       a young but excellent composer is working at a symphony for      my unhappy prodigal i know it will be masterly so soon as      it is finished i shall take the liberty of offering it to      you       i must also beg you to excuse the irregular state of the      manuscript the incorrectness of the penmanship i was in      haste to get the piece ready for you hence the double sort      of handwriting in it hence also my forbearing to correct it      my copyist according to the custom of all reforming      caligraphers i find has wofully abused the spelling to      conclude i recommend myself and my endeavours to the      kindness of an honoured judge i am c        stuttgard 12th december 1781       with the change projected by your excellency in regard to      the publishing of my play i feel entirely contented      especially as i perceive that by this means two interests      that had become very alien are again made one without as      i hope any prejudice to the results and the success of my      work your excellency however touches on some other very      weighty changes which the piece has undergone from your      hands and these in respect of myself i feel to be so      important that i shall beg to explain my mind at some length      regarding them at the outset then i must honestly confess      to you i hold the projected transference of the action      represented in my play to the epoch of the landfried and      the suppression of private wars with the whole accompaniment      which it gains by this new position as infinitely better      than mine and must hold it so although the whole piece      should go to ruin thereby doubtless it is an objection that      in our enlightened century with our watchful police and      fixedness of statute such a reckless gang should have arisen      in the very bosom of the laws and still more have taken      root and subsisted for years doubtless the objection is well      founded and i have nothing to allege against it but the      license of poetry to raise the probabilities of the real      world to the rank of true and its possibilities to the rank      of probable       this excuse it must be owned is little adequate to the      objection it opposes but when i grant your excellency so      much and i grant it honestly and with complete conviction      what will follow simply that my play has got an ugly fault      at its birth which fault if i may say so it must carry      with it to its grave the fault being interwoven with its      very nature and not to be removed without destruction of the      whole       in the first place all my personages speak in a style too      modern too enlightened for that ancient time the dialect is      not the right one that simplicity so vividly presented to us      by the author of götz von berlichingen is altogether      wanting many long tirades touches great and small nay      entire characters are taken from the aspect of the present      world and would not answer for the age of maximilian in a      word this change would reduce the piece into something like      a certain woodcut which i remember meeting with in an edition      of virgil the trojans wore hussar boots and king agamemnon      had a pair of pistols in his belt i should commit a crime      against the age of maximilian to avoid an error against      the age of frederick the second       again my whole episode of amelias love would make a      frightful contrast with the simple chivalry attachment of      that period amelia would at all hazards need to be      remoulded into a chivalry maiden and i need not tell you      that this character and the sort of love which reigns in my      work are so deeply and broadly tinted into the whole picture      of the robber moor nay into the whole piece that every      part of the delineation would require to be repainted      before those tints could be removed so likewise is it with      the character of franz that speculative      metaphysicorefining knave       in a word i think i may affirm that this projected      transposition of my work which prior to the commencement      would have lent it the highest splendour and completeness      could not fail now when the piece is planned and finished      to change it into a defective quodlibet a crow with      peacocks feathers       your excellency will forgive a father this earnest pleading      in behalf of his son these are but words and in the      longrun every theatre can make of any piece what they think      proper the author must content himself in the present case      he looks upon it as a happiness that he has fallen into such      hands with herr schwann however i will make it a condition      that at least he print the piece according to the first      plan in the theatre i pretend to no vote whatever       that other change relating to amelias death was perhaps      even more interesting to me believe me your excellency      this was the portion of my play which cost me the greatest      effort and deliberation of all which the result was nothing      else than this that moor must kill his amelia and that      the action is even a positive beauty in his character on      the one hand painting the ardent lover on the other the      bandit captain with the liveliest colours but the      vindication of this part is not to be exhausted in a single      letter for the rest the few words which you propose to      substitute in place of this scene are truly exquisite and      altogether worthy of the situation i should be proud of      having written them       as herr schwann informs me that the piece with the music      and indispensably necessary pauses will last about five      hours too long for any piece a second curtailment of it      will be called for i should not wish that any but myself      undertook this task and i myself without the sight of a      rehearsal or of the first representation cannot undertake      it       if it were possible that your excellency could fix the      general rehearsal of the piece some time between the      twentieth and the thirtieth of this month and make good to      me the main expenses of a journey to you i should hope in      some few days i might unite the interest of the stage with      my own and give the piece that proper roundingoff which      without an actual view of the representation cannot well be      given it on this point may i request the favour of your      excellencys decision soon that i may be prepared for the      event       herr schwann writes me that a baron von gemmingen has given      himself the trouble and done me the honour to read my piece      this herr von gemmingen i also hear is author of the      deutsche hausvater i long to have the honour of assuring      him that i liked his hausvater uncommonly and admired in      it the traces of a most accomplished man and writer but what      does the author of the deutsche hausvater care about the      babble of a young apprentice if i should ever have the      honour of meeting dalberg at mannheim and testifying the      affection and reverence i bear him i will then also press      into the arms of that other and tell him how dear to me such      souls are as dalberg and gemmingen       your thought about the small advertisement before our      production of the piece i exceedingly approve of along with      this i have enclosed a sketch of one for the rest i have      the honour with perfect respect to be always c        this is the enclosed scheme of an advertisement which was      afterwards adopted                                the robbers                                 a play       the picture of a great misguided soul furnished with every      gift for excellence and lost in spite of all its gifts      unchecked ardour and bad companionship contaminate his heart      hurry him from vice to vice till at last he stands at the      head of a gang of murderers heaps horror upon horror      plunges from abyss to abyss into all the depths of      desperation great and majestic in misfortune and by      misfortune improved led back to virtue such a man in the      robber moor you shall bewail and hate abhor and love a      hypocritical malicious deceiver you shall likewise see      unmasked and blown to pieces in his own mines a feeble      fond and too indulgent father the sorrows of enthusiastic      love and the torture of ungoverned passion here also not      without abhorrence you shall cast a look into the interior      economy of vice and from the stage be taught how all the      gilding of fortune cannot kill the inward worm how terror      anguish remorse and despair follow close upon the heels of      the wicked let the spectator weep today before our scene      and shudder and learn to bend his passions under the laws of      reason and religion let the youth behold with affright the      end of unbridled extravagance nor let the man depart from      our theatre without a feeling that providence makes even      villains instruments of his purposes and judgments and can      marvellously unravel the most intricate perplexities of      fate   whatever reverence schiller entertained for dalberg as a critic and a patron and however ready to adopt his alterations when they seemed judicious it is plain from various passages of these extracts that in regard to writing he had also firm persuasions of his own and conscientiousness enough to adhere to them while they continued such in regard to the conducting of his life his views as yet were far less clear the following fragments serve to trace him from the first exhibition of his play at mannheim to his flight from stuttgard        stuttgard 17th january 1782       i here in writing repeat my warmest thanks for the      courtesies received from your excellency for your attention      to my slender efforts for the dignity and splendour you      bestowed upon my piece for all your excellency did to exalt      its little merits and hide its weaknesses by the greatest      outlay of theatric art the shortness of my stay at mannheim      would not allow me to go into details respecting the play or      its representation and as i could not say all my time      being meted out to me so sparingly i thought it better to      say absolutely nothing i observed much i learned much and      i believe if germany shall ever find in me a true dramatic      poet i must reckon the date of my commencement from the      past week                                               stuttgard 24th may 1782          my impatient wish to see the piece played a second      time and the absence of my sovereign favouring that      purpose have induced me with some ladies and male friends      as full of curiosity respecting dalbergs theatre and      robbers as myself to undertake a little journey to      mannheim which we are to set about tomorrow as this is the      principal aim of our journey and to me a more perfect      enjoyment of my play is an exceedingly important object      especially since this would put it in my power to set about      fiesco under better auspices i make it my earnest request      of your excellency if possible to procure me this      enjoyment on tuesday the 28th current                                               stuttgard 4th june 1782       the satisfaction i enjoyed at mannheim in such copious      fulness i have paid since my return by this epidemical      disorder which has made me till today entirely unfit to      thank your excellency for so much regard and kindness and      yet i am forced almost to repent the happiest journey of my      life for by a truly mortifying contrast of mannheim with my      native country it has pained me so much that stuttgard and      all swabian scenes are become intolerable to me unhappier      than i am can no one be i have feeling enough of my bad      condition perhaps also feeling enough of my meriting a      better and in both points of view but one prospect of      relief       may i dare to cast myself into your arms my generous      benefactor i know how soon your noble heart inflames when      sympathy and humanity appeal to it i know how strong your      courage is to undertake a noble action and how warm your      zeal to finish it my new friends in mannheim whose respect      for you is boundless told me this but their assurance was      not necessary i myself in that hour of your time which i      had the happiness exclusively to enjoy read in your      countenance far more than they had told me it is this which      makes me bold to give myself without reserve to you to      put my whole fate into your hands and look to you for the      happiness of my life as yet i am little or nothing in this      arctic zone of taste i shall never grow to anything unless      happier stars and a grecian climate warm me into genuine      poetry need i say more to expect from dalberg all support       your excellency gave me every hope to this effect the      squeeze of the hand that sealed your promise i shall      forever feel if your excellency will adopt the two or three      hints i have subjoined and use them in a letter to the      duke i have no very great misgivings as to the result       and now with a burning heart i repeat the request the      soul of all this letter could you look into the interior of      my soul could you see what feelings agitate it could i      paint to you in proper colours how my spirit strains against      the grievances of my condition you would not i know you      would not delay one hour the aid which an application from      you to the duke might procure me       again i throw myself into your arms and wish nothing more      than soon very soon to have it in my power to show by      personal exertions in your service the reverence with which      i could devote to you myself and all that i am   the hints above alluded to are given in a separate enclosure the main part of which is this        i earnestly desire that you could secure my union with the      mannheim theatre for a specified period which at your      request might be lengthened at the end of which i might      again belong to the duke it will thus have the air rather      of an excursion than a final abdication of my country and      will not strike them so ungraciously in this case however      it would be useful to suggest that means of practising and      studying medicine might be afforded me at mannheim this      will be peculiarly necessary lest they sham and higgle      about letting me away        stuttgard 15th july 1782       my long silence must have almost drawn upon me the reproach      of folly from your excellency especially as i have not only      delayed answering your last kind letter but also retained      the two books by me all this was occasioned by a harassing      affair which i have had to do with here your excellency      will doubtless be surprised when you learn that for my last      journey to you i have been confined a fortnight under      arrest everything was punctually communicated to the duke      on this matter i have had an interview with him       if your excellency think my prospects of coming to you      anywise attainable my only prayer is to accelerate the      fulfilment of them the reason why i now wish this with      double earnestness is one which i dare trust no whisper of      to paper this alone i can declare for certain that within      a month or two if i have not the happiness of being with      you there will remain no further hope of my ever being      there ere that time i shall be forced to take a step      which will render it impossible for me to stay at mannheim                                               the next two extracts are from letters to another correspondent doering quotes them without name or date their purport sufficiently points out their place        i must haste to get away from this in the end they might      find me an apartment in the hohenasperg as they have found      the honest and illfated schubart they talk of better      culture that i need it is possible enough they might      cultivate me differently in hohenasperg but i had rather      try to make shift with what culture i have got or may still      get by my unassisted efforts this at least i owe to no one      but my own free choice and volition that disdains      constraint                                            in regard to those affairs concerning which they wish to      put my spirit under wardship i have long reckoned my      minority to be concluded the best of it is that one can      cast away such clumsy manacles me at least they shall not      fetter                                            no date       your excellency will have learned from my friends at      mannheim what the history of my affairs was up to your      arrival which unhappily i could not wait for when i tell      you that i am flying my country i have painted my whole      fortune but the worst is yet behind i have not the      necessary means of setting my mishap at defiance for the      sake of safety i had to withdraw from stuttgard with the      utmost speed at the time of the princes arrival thus were      my economical arrangements suddenly snapped asunder i could      not even pay my debts my hopes had been set on a removal to      mannheim there i trusted by your excellencys assistance      that my new play might not only have cleared me of debt but      have permanently put me into better circumstances all this      was frustrated by the necessity for hastening my removal i      went empty away empty in purse and hope i blush at being      forced to make such disclosures to you though i know they      do not disgrace me sad enough for me to see realised in      myself the hateful saying that mental growth and full      stature are things denied to every swabian       if my former conduct if all that your excellency knows of      my character inspires you with confidence in my love of      honour permit me frankly to ask your assistance pressingly      as i now need the profit i expect from my fiesco it will      be impossible for me to have the piece in readiness before      three weeks my heart was oppressed the feeling of my own      situation drove me back from my poetic dreams but if at the      specified period i could make the play not only ready      but as i also hope worthy i take courage from that      persuasion respectfully to ask that your excellency would      be so obliging as advance for me the price that will then      become due i need it now perhaps more than i shall ever do      again throughout my life i had near 200 florins of debt in      stuttgard which i could not pay i may confess to you that      this gives me more uneasiness than anything about my future      destiny i shall have no rest till i am free on that side       in eight days too my travelling purse will be exhausted      it is yet utterly impossible for me to labour with my mind      in my hand therefore are at present no resources                                            my actual situation being clear enough from what i have      already said i hold it needless to afflict your excellency      with any importuning picture of my want speedy aid is all      that i can now think of or wish herr meyer has been      requested to communicate your excellencys resolution to me      and to save you from the task of writing to me in person at      all with peculiar respect i call myself c                                       it is pleasing to record that the humble aid so earnestly and modestly solicited by schiller was afforded him and that he never forgot to love the man who had afforded it who had assisted him when assistance was of such essential value in the first fervour of his gratitude for this and other favours the poet warmly declared that he owed all all to dalberg and in a state of society where patronage as miss edgeworth has observed directly the antipodes of mercy is in general twice cursed cursing him that gives and him that takes it says not a little for the character both of the obliged and the obliger in the present instance that neither of them ever ceased to remember their connexion with pleasure schillers first play had been introduced to the stage by dalberg and his last was dedicated to him69 the venerable critic in his eightythird year must have received with a calm joy the tragedy of tell accompanied by an address so full of kindness and respect it must have gratified him to think that the youth who was once his and had now become the worlds could after long experience still say of him      and fearlessly to thee may tell be shown     for every noble feeling is thy own      footnote 69 it clearly appears i am wrong here i have     confounded the freiherr wolfgang heribert von dalberg     director of the mannheim theatre with archduke and fürst     primas karl theodor dalberg his younger brother—a man     justly eminent in the politicoecclesiastical world of his     time and still more distinguished for his patronage of     letters and other benefactions to his country than the     freiherr was neither is the play of tell dedicated to     him as stated in the text there is merely a copy presented     with some verses by the author inscribed in it at which time     karl theodor was in his sixtieth year a man of conspicuous     station of wide activity and high influence and esteem in     germany he was the personal friend of herder goethe     schiller wieland by napoleon he was made fürst primas     prince primate of the confederation of the rhine being     already archbishop elector of mentz c the good and brave     deeds he did in his time appear to have been many public and     private pensions to deserving men of letters were among the     number zacharias werner i remember had a pension from     him—and still more to the purpose jean paul he died in     1817 there was a third brother also memorable for his     encouragement of letters and arts ist kein dalberg da is     there no dalberg here the herald cries on a certain     occasion see conv lexicon b iii      to sir edward bulwer in his sketch of the life of schiller     p c i am indebted for very kindly pointing out this     error as well as for much other satisfaction derived from     that work note of 1845  except this early correspondence very few of schillers letters have been given to the world70 in doerings appendix we have found one written six years after the poets voluntary exile and agreeably contrasted in its purport with the agitation and despondency of that unhappy period we translate it for the sake of those who along with us regret that while the world is deluged with insipid correspondences and pictures of mind that were not worth drawing the correspondence of a man who never wrote unwisely should lie mouldering in private repositories ere long to be irretrievably destroyed that the picture of a mind who was among the conscript fathers of the human race should still be left so vague and dim this letter is addressed to schwann during schillers first residence in weimar it has already been referred to in the text      footnote 70 there have since been copious contributions     correspondence with goethe correspondence with madam von     wolzogen and perhaps others which i have not seen note     of 1845                                            weimar 2d may 1788       you apologise for your long silence to spare me the pain      of an apology i feel this kindness and thank you for it      you do not impute my silence to decay of friendship a proof      that you have read my heart more justly than my evil      conscience allowed me to hope continue to believe that the      memory of you lives ineffaceably in my mind and needs not      to be brightened up by the routine of visits or letters of      assurance so no more of this       the peace and calmness of existence which breathes      throughout your letter gives me joy i who am yet drifting      to and fro between wind and waves am forced to envy you      that uniformity that health of soul and body to me also in      time it will be granted as a recompense for labours i have      yet to undergo       i have now been in weimar nearly three quarters of a year      after finishing my carlos i at last accomplished this      longprojected journey to speak honestly i cannot say but      that i am exceedingly contented with the place and my      reasons are not difficult to see       the utmost political tranquillity and freedom a very      tolerable disposition in the people little constraint in      social intercourse a select circle of interesting persons      and thinking heads the respect paid to literary diligence      add to this the unexpensiveness to me of such a town as      weimar why should i not be satisfied       with wieland i am pretty intimate and to him i must      attribute no small influence on my present happiness for i      like him and have reason to believe that he likes me in      return my intercourse with herder is more limited though i      esteem him highly as a writer and a man it is the caprice      of chance alone which causes this for we opened our      acquaintance under happy enough omens besides i have not      always time to act according to my likings with bode no one      can be very friendly i know not whether you think here as i      do goethe is still but expected out of italy the duchess      dowager is a lady of sense and talent in whose society one      does not feel constrained       i thank you for your tidings of the fate of carlos on      your stage to speak candidly my hopes of its success on      any stage were not high and i know my reasons it is but      fair that the goddess of the theatre avenge herself on me      for the little gallantry with which i was inspired in      writing in the mean time though carlos prove a never so      decided failure on the stage i engage for it our public      shall see it ten times acted before they understand and      fully estimate the merit that should counterbalance its      defects when one has seen the beauty of a work and not      till then i think one is entitled to pronounce on its      deformity i hear however that the second representation      succeeded better than the first this arises either from the      changes made upon the piece by dalberg or from the fact      that on a second view the public comprehended certain      things which on a first they—did not comprehend       for the rest no one can be more satisfied than i am that      carlos from causes honourable as well as causes      dishonorable to it is no speculation for the stage its      very length were enough to banish it nor was it out of      confidence or selflove that i forced the piece on such a      trial perhaps out of selfinterest rather if in the affair      my vanity played any part it was in this that i thought      the work had solid stuff in it sufficient to outweigh its      sorry fortune on the boards       the present of your portrait gives me true pleasure i      think it a striking likeness that of schubart a little less      so though this opinion may proceed from my faulty memory as      much as from the faultiness of lobauers drawing the      engraver merits all attention and encouragement what i can      do for the extension of his good repute shall not be      wanting       to your dear children present my warmest love at wielands      i hear much and often of your eldest daughter there in a      few days she has won no little estimation and affection do      i still hold any place in her remembrance indeed i ought      to blush that by my long silence i so ill deserve it       that you are going to my dear native country and will not      pass my father without seeing him was most welcome news to      me the swabians are a good people this i more and more      discover the more i grow acquainted with the other      provinces of germany to my family you will be cordially      welcome will you take a pack of compliments from me to      them salute my father in my name to my mother and my      sisters your daughter will take my kiss                                       and with these hearty words as doering says we shall conclude this paper                             friendship with goethe   the history of schillers first intercourse with goethe has been recorded by the latter in a paper published a few years ago in the morphologie a periodical work which we believe he still occasionally continues or purposes to continue the paper is entitled happy incident and may be found in part i volume 1 pp 9096 of the work referred to the introductory portion of it we have inserted in the text at page 109 the remainder relating to certain scientific matters and anticipating some facts of our narrative we judged it better to reserve for the appendix after mentioning the publication of don carlos and adding that each continued to go on his way apart he proceeds       his essay on grace and dignity was yet less of a kind to      reconcile me the philosophy of kant which exalts the      dignity of mind so highly while appearing to restrict it      schiller had joyfully embraced it unfolded the      extraordinary qualities which nature had implanted in him      and in the lively feeling of freedom and selfdirection he      showed himself unthankful to the great mother who surely      had not acted like a stepdame towards him instead of      viewing her as selfsubsisting as producing with a living      force and according to appointed laws alike the highest      and the lowest of her works he took her up under the aspect      of some empirical native qualities of the human mind      certain harsh passages i could even directly apply to      myself they exhibited my confession of faith in a false      light and i felt that if written without particular      attention to me they were still worse for in that case      the vast chasm which lay between us gaped but so much the      more distinctly       there was no union to be dreamed of even the mild      persuasion of dalberg who valued schiller as he ought was      fruitless indeed the reasons i set forth against any      project of a union were difficult to contradict no one      could deny that between two spiritual antipodes there was      more intervening than a simple diameter of the sphere      antipodes of that sort act as a sort of poles and so can      never coalesce but that some relation may exist between      them will appear from what follows       schiller went to live at jena where i still continued      unacquainted with him about this time batsch had set in      motion a society for natural history aided by some handsome      collections and an extensive apparatus i used to attend      their periodical meetings one day i found schiller there      we happened to go out together some discourse arose between      us he appeared to take an interest in what had been      exhibited but observed with great acuteness and good      sense and much to my satisfaction that such a disconnected      way of treating nature was by no means grateful to the      exoteric who desired to penetrate her mysteries       i answered that perhaps the initiated themselves were      never rightly at their ease in it and that there surely was      another way of representing nature not separated and      disunited but active and alive and expanding from the      whole into the parts on this point he requested      explanations but did not hide his doubts he would not      allow that such a mode as i was recommending had been      already pointed out by experiment       we reached his house the talk induced me to go in i then      expounded to him with as much vivacity as possible the      metamorphosis of plants71 drawing out on paper with      many characteristic strokes a symbolic plant for him as i      proceeded he heard and saw all this with much interest and      distinct comprehension but when i had done he shook his      head and said this is no experiment this is an idea i      stopped with some degree of irritation for the point which      separated us was most luminously marked by this expression      the opinions in dignity and grace again occurred to me      the old grudge was just awakening but i smothered it and      merely said i was happy to find that i had got ideas      without knowing it nay that i saw them before my eyes           footnote 71 a curious physiologicobotanical theory by          goethe which appears to be entirely unknown in this country          though several eminent continental botanists have noticed it          with commendation it is explained at considerable length in          this same morphologie       schiller had much more prudence and dexterity of management      than i he was also thinking of his periodical the horen      about this time and of course rather wished to attract than      repel me accordingly he answered me like an accomplished      kantite and as my stiff necked realism gave occasion to      many contradictions much battling took place between us      and at last a truce in which neither party would consent to      yield the victory but each held himself invincible      positions like the following grieved me to the very soul      how can there ever be an experiment that shall correspond      with an idea the specific quality of an idea is that no      experiment can reach it or agree with it yet if he held as      an idea the same thing which i looked upon as an experiment      there must certainly i thought be some community between      us some ground whereon both of us might meet the first      step was now taken schillers attractive power was great      he held all firmly to him that came within his reach i      expressed an interest in his purposes and promised to give      out in the horen many notions that were lying in my head      his wife whom i had loved and valued since her childhood      did her part to strengthen our reciprocal intelligence all      friends on both sides rejoiced in it and thus by means of      that mighty and interminable controversy between object      and subject we two concluded an alliance which remained      unbroken and produced much benefit to ourselves and      others  the friendship of schiller and goethe forms so delightful a chapter in their history that we long for more and more details respecting it sincerity true estimation of each others merit true sympathy in each others character and purposes appear to have formed the basis of it and maintained it unimpaired to the end goethe we are told was minute and sedulous in his attention to schiller whom he venerated as a good man and sympathised with as an afflicted one when in mixed companies together he constantly endeavoured to draw out the stores of his modest and retiring friend or to guard his sick and sensitive mind from annoyances that might have irritated him now softening now exciting conversation guiding it with the address of a gifted and polished man or lashing out of it with the scorpionwhip of his satire much that would have vexed the more soft and simple spirit of the valetudinarian these are things which it is good to think of it is good to know that there are literary men who have other principles besides vanity who can divide the approbation of their fellow mortals without quarrelling over the lots who in their solicitude about their fame do not forget the common charities of nature in exchange for which the fame of most authors were but a poor bargain                              no 4 page 125                        death of gustavus adolphus  as a specimen of schillers historical style we have extracted a few scenes from his masterly description of the battle of lützen the whole forms a picture executed in the spirit of salvator and though this is but a fragment the importance of the figure represented in it will perhaps counterbalance that deficiency   at last the dreaded morning dawned but a thick fog which lay brooding over all the field delayed the attack till noon kneeling in front of his lines the king offered up his devotions the whole army at the same moment dropping on their right knees uplifted a moving hymn and the fieldmusic accompanied their singing the king then mounted his horse dressed in a jerkin of buff with a surtout for a late wound hindered him from wearing armour he rode through the ranks rousing the courage of his troops to a cheerful confidence which his own forecasting bosom contradicted god with us was the battleword of the swedes that of the imperialists was jesus maria about eleven oclock the fog began to break and wallensteins lines became visible at the same time too were seen the flames of lützen which the duke had ordered to be set on fire that he might not be outflanked on this side at length the signal pealed the horse dashed forward on the enemy the infantry advanced against his trenches                                       meanwhile the right wing led on by the king in person had fallen on the left wing of the friedlanders the first strong onset of the heavy finland cuirassiers scattered the lightmounted poles and croats who were stationed here and their tumultuous flight spread fear and disorder over the rest of the cavalry at this moment notice reached the king that his infantry were losing ground and likely to be driven back from the trenches they had stormed and also that his left exposed to a tremendous fire from the windmills behind lützen could no longer keep their place with quick decision he committed to von horn the task of pursuing the already beaten left wing of the enemy and himself hastened at the head of steinbocks regiment to restore the confusion of his own his gallant horse bore him over the trenches with the speed of lightning but the squadrons that came after him could not pass so rapidly and none but a few horsemen among whom franz albert duke of sachsenlauenburg is mentioned were alert enough to keep beside him he galloped right to the place where his infantry was most oppressed and while looking round to spy out some weak point on which his attack might be directed his shortsightedness led him too near the enemys lines an imperial sergeant gefreiter observing that every one respectfully made room for the advancing horseman ordered a musketeer to fire on him aim at him there cried he that must be a man of consequence the soldier drew his trigger and the kings left arm was shattered by the ball at this instant his cavalry came galloping up and a confused cry of the king bleeds the king is shot spread horror and dismay through their ranks it is nothing follow me exclaimed the king collecting all his strength but overcome with pain and on the point of fainting he desired the duke of lauenburg in french to take him without notice from the tumult the duke then turned with him to the right wing making a wide circuit to conceal this accident from the desponding infantry but as they rode along the king received a second bullet through the back which took from him the last remainder of his strength i have got enough brother said he with a dying voice haste save thyself with these words he sank from his horse and here struck by several other bullets far from his attendants he breathed out his life beneath the plundering hands of a troop of croats his horse flying on without its rider and bathed in blood soon announced to the swedish cavalry the fall of their king with wild yells they rush to the spot to snatch that sacred spoil from the enemy a deadly fight ensues around the corpse and the mangled remains are buried under a hill of slain men  the dreadful tidings hasten in a few minutes over all the swedish army but instead of deadening the courage of these hardy troops they rouse it to a fierce consuming fire life falls in value since the holiest of all lives is gone and death has now no terror for the lowly since it has not spared the anointed head with the grim fury of lions the upland smäland finnish east and west gothland regiments dash a second time upon the left wing of the enemy which already making but a feeble opposition to von horn is now utterly driven from the field                                       but how dear a victory how sad a triumph now first when the rage of battle has grown cold do they feel the whole greatness of their loss and the shout of the conqueror dies in a mute and gloomy despair he who led them on to battle has not returned with them apart he lies in his victorious field confounded with the common heaps of humble dead after long fruitless searching they found the royal corpse not far from the great stone which had already stood for centuries between lützen and the merseburg canal but which ever since this memorable incident has borne the name of schwedenstein the stone of the swede defaced with wounds and blood so as scarcely to be recognised trodden under the hoofs of horses stripped of his ornaments even of his clothes he is drawn from beneath a heap of dead bodies brought to weissenfels and there delivered to the lamentations of his troops and the last embraces of his queen vengeance had first required its tribute and blood must flow as an offering to the monarch now love assumes its rights and mild tears are shed for the man individual grief is lost in the universal sorrow astounded by this overwhelming stroke the generals in blank despondency stand round his bier and none yet ventures to conceive the full extent of his loss  the descriptive powers of the historian though the most popular are among the lowest of his endowments that schiller was not wanting in the nobler requisites of his art might he proved from his reflections on this very incident striking like a hand from the clouds into the calculated horologe of mens affairs and directing the considerate mind to a higher plan of things but the limits of our work are already reached of schillers histories and dramas we can give no farther specimens of his lyrical didactic moral poems we must take our leave without giving any perhaps the time may come when all his writings transplanted to our own soil may be offered in their entire dimensions to the thinkers of these islands a conquest by which our literature rich as it is might be enriched still farther                                  appendix ii   the preceding appendix which is here marked appendix first has hitherto in all editions been the only one and has ended the book as indeed for the common run of english readers it still essentially may or even must but now for a more select class and on inducements that are accidental and peculiar there is in this final or farewell edition which stands without change otherwise something to be added as appendix second by the opportunity that offers  schiller has now many readers of his own in england perhaps the most and best that read this my poor account of his life know something of germany and him at firsthand and have their curiosity awake in regard to things german—to such readers if not to others i can expect that the following reprint or reproduction of a piece from the greatest of germans which connects itself with schiller and this book on schiller may not be unwelcome to myself it has become symbolical touching and memorable and much invites my insertion of it here since there happens to be room   certainly an interesting little circumstance in the history of this book and to me the one circumstance that now has any interest is that a german translation of it had the altogether unexpected honour of an introductory preface by goethe in the last years of his life a beautiful small event to me and mine in our then remote circle coming suddenly upon us like a little outbreak of sunshine and azure in the common gray element there it was one of the more salient points of a certain individual relation and faroff personal intercourse which had arisen some years before with the great man whom we had never seen and never saw and which was very beautiful high singular and dear to us—to myself and to another who is not with me now a little gleam as of celestial radiancy miraculous almost but indisputable shining out on us always from time to time somewhat ennobling for us the much of impediment that lay there and forbidding it altogether to impede truly there are few things i now remember with a more bright or pious feeling than our then relation amid the scottish moors to the man whom of all others i the most honoured and felt that i was the most indebted to looking back on all this through the vista of almost forty years and what they have brought and have taken i decide to reproduce this goethe introduction as a little pillar of memorial while time yet is  many of my present readers too readers especially of this volume may have their curiosities about the introduction einleitung of so small a thing by so great a man which withal is a piece not to be found in the great mans collected works or elsewhere that i know of—and will goodnaturedly allow me to have my own way with it namely to reprint it here in the original words and will not even quarrel with me if i reproduce in facsimile those poor verzierungen copperplates of goethes devising shadows of human dwellings far away judging well how

daraus entstand das gefühl nachbarlicher verhältnisse und anstatt dass man sich bisher zugeschlossen hatte kam der geist nach und nach zu dem verlangen auch in den mehr oder weniger freyen geistigen handelsverkehr mit aufgenommen zu werden  diese bewegung währt zwar erst eine kurze weile aber doch immer lang genug um schon einige betrachtungen darüber anzustellen und aus ihr bald möglichst wie man es im waarenhandel ja auch thun muss vortheil und genuss zu gewinnen                                       gegenwärtiges zum andenken schillers geschriebene werk kann übersetzt für uns kaum etwas neues bringen der verfasser nahm seine kenntnisse aus schriften die uns längst bekannt sind so wie denn auch überhaupt die hier verhandelten angelegenheiten bey uns öfters durchgesprochen und durchgefochten worden  was aber den verehrern schillers und also einem jeden deutschen wie man kühnlich sagen darf höchst erfreulich seyn muss ist unmittelbar zu erfahren wie ein zartfühlender strebsamer einsichtiger mann über dem meere in seinen besten jahren durch schillers productionen berührt bewegt erregt und nun zum weitern studium der deutschen literatur angetrieben worden  mir wenigstens war es rührend zu sehen wie dieser rein und ruhig denkende fremde selbst in jenen ersten oft harten fast rohen productionen unsres verewigten freundes immer den edlen wohldenkenden wohlwollenden mann gewahr ward und sich ein ideal des vortrefflichsten sterblichen an ihm auferbauen konnte  ich halte deshalb dafür dass dieses werk als von einem jüngling geschrieben der deutschen jugend zu empfehlen seyn möchte denn wenn ein munteres lebensalter einen wunsch haben darf und soll so ist es der in allem geleisteten das löbliche gute bildsame hochstrebende genug das ideelle und selbst in dem nicht musterhaften das allgemeine musterbild der menschheit zu erblicken                                       ferner kann uns dieses werk von bedeutung seyn wenn wir ernstlich betrachten wie ein fremder mann die schillerischen werke denen wir so mannigfaltige kultur verdanken auch als quelle der seinigen schätzt verehrt und dies ohne irgend eine absicht rein und ruhig zu erkennen giebt  eine bemerkung möchte sodann hier wohl am platze seyn dass sogar dasjenige was unter uns beynahe ausgewirkt hat nun gerade in dem augenblicke welcher auswärts der deutschen literatur günstig ist abermals seine kräftige wirkung beginne und dadurch zeige wie es auf einer gewissen stufe der literatur immer nützlich und wirksam seyn werde  so sind z b herders ideen bey uns dergestalt in die kenntnisse der ganzen masse übergegangen dass nur wenige die sie lesen dadurch erst belehrt werden weil sie durch hundertfache ableitungen von demjenigen was damals von grosser bedeutung war in anderem zusammenhange schon völlig unterrichtet worden dieses werk ist vor kurzem ins französische übersetzt wohl in keiner andern ueberzeugung als dass tausend gebildete menschen in frankreich sich immer noch an diesen ideen zu erbauen haben                                       in bezug auf das dem gegenwärtigen bande vorgesetzte bild sey folgendes gemeldet unser freund als wir mit ihm in verhältniss traten war damals in edinburgh wohnhaft wo er in der stille lebend sich im besten sinne auszubilden suchte und wir dürfen es ohne ruhmredigkeit sagen in der deutschen literatur hiezu die meiste förderniss fand  später um sich selbst und seinen redlichen literarischen studien unabhängig zu leben begab er sich etwa zehen deutsche meilen südlicher ein eignes besitzthum zu bewohnen und zu benutzen in die grafschaft dumfries hier in einer gebirgigen gegend in welcher der fluss nithe dem nahen meere zuströmt ohnfern der stadt dumfries an einer stelle welche craigenputtock genannt wird schlug er mit einer schönen und höchst gebildeten lebensgefährtin seine ländlich einfache wohnung auf wovon treue nachbildungen eigentlich die veranlassung zu gegenwärtigem vorworte gegeben haben                                       gebildete geister zartfühlende gemüther welche nach fernem guten sich bestreben in die ferne gutes zu wirken geneigt sind erwehren sich kaum des wunsches von geehrten geliebten weitabgesonderten personen das portrait sodann die abbildung ihrer wohnung so wie der nächsten zustände sich vor augen gebracht zu sehen  wie oft wiederholt man noch heutiges tags die abbildung von petrarchs aufenthalt in vaucluse tassos wohnung in sorent und ist nicht immer die bieler insel der schutzort rousseaus ein seinen verehrern nie genugsam dargestelltes local  in eben diesem sinne hab ich mir die umgebungen meiner entfernten freunde im bilde zu verschaffen gesucht und ich war um so mehr auf die wohnung hrn thomas carlyle begierig als er seinen aufenthalt in einer fast rauhen gebirgsgegend unter dem 55ten grade gewählt hatte  ich glaube durch solch eine treue nachbildung der neulich eingesendeten originalzeichnungen gegenwärtiges buch zu zieren und dem jetzigen gefühlvollen leser vielleicht noch mehr dem künftigen einen freundlichen gefallen zu erweisen und dadurch so wie durch eingeschaltete auszüge aus den briefen des werthen mannes das interesse an einer edlen allgemeinen länder und weltannäherung zu vermehren                                                             thomas carlyle an goethe  craigenputtock den 25 septbr 1828  sie forschen mit so warmer neigung nach unserem gegenwärtigen aufenthalt und beschäftigung dass ich einige worte hierüber sagen muss da noch raum dazu übrig bleibt dumfries ist eine artige stadt mit etwa 15000 einwohnern und als mittelpunct des handels und der gerichtsbarkeit anzusehen eines bedeutenden districkts in dem schottischen geschäftskreis unser wohnort ist nicht darin sondern 15 meilen zwei stunden zu reiten nordwestlich davon entfernt zwischen den granitgebirgen und dem schwarzen moorgefilde welche sich westwärts durch gallovay meist bis an die irische see ziehen in dieser wüste von heide und felsen stellt unser besitzthum eine grüne oase vor einen raum von geackertem theilweise umzäumten und geschmückten boden wo korn reift und bäume schatten gewähren obgleich ringsumher von seemöven und hartwolligen schaafen umgeben hier mit nicht geringer anstrengung haben wir für uns eine reine dauerhafte wohnung erbaut und eingerichtet hier wohnen wir in ermangelung einer lehr oder andern öffentlichen stelle um uns der literatur zu befleissigen nach eigenen kräften uns damit zu beschäftigen wir wünschen dass unsre rosen und gartenbüsche fröhlich heranwachsen hoffen gesundheit und eine friedliche gemüthsstimmung um uns zu fordern die rosen sind freylich zum theil noch zu pflanzen aber sie blühen doch schon in hoffnung  zwei leichte pferde die uns überall hintragen und die bergluft sind die besten aerzte für zarte nerven diese tägliche bewegung der ich sehr ergeben bin ist meine einzige zerstreuung denn dieser winkel ist der einsamste in brittanien sechs meilen von einer jeden person entfernt die mich allenfalls besuchen möchte hier würde sich rousseau eben so gut gefallen haben als auf seiner insel st pierre  fürwahr meine städtischen freunde schreiben mein hierhergehen einer ähnlichen gesinnung zu und weissagen mir nichts gutes aber ich zog hierher allein zu dem zweck meine lebensweise zu vereinfachen und eine unabhängigkeit zu erwerben damit ich mir selbst treu bleiben könne dieser erdraum ist unser hier können wir leben schreiben und denken wie es uns am besten däucht und wenn zoilus selbst könig der literatur werden sollte  auch ist die einsamkeit nicht so bedeutend eine lohnkutsche bringt uns leicht nach edinburgh das wir als unser brittisch weimar ansehen habe ich denn nicht auch gegenwärtig eine ganze ladung von französischen deutschen amerikanischen englischen journalen und zeitschriften von welchem werth sie auch seyn mögen auf den tischen meiner kleinen bibliothek aufgehäuft  auch an alterthümlichen studien fehlt es nicht von einigen unsrer höhen entdeck ich ohngefähr eine tagereise westwärts den hügel wo agrikola und seine römer ein lager zurückliessen am fusse desselben war ich geboren wo vater und mutter noch leben um mich zu lieben und so muss man die zeit wirken lassen doch wo gerath ich hin lassen sie mich noch gestehen ich bin ungewiss über meine künftige literarische thätigkeit worüber ich gern ihr urtheil vernehmen möchte gewiss schreiben sie mir wieder und bald damit ich mich immer mit ihnen vereint fühlen möge                                       wir nach allen seiten hin wohlgesinnten nach allgemeinster bildung strebenden deutschen wir wissen schon seit vielen jahren die verdienste würdiger schottischer männer zu schätzen uns blieb nicht unbekannt was sie früher in den naturwissenschaften geleistet woraus denn nachher die franzosen ein so grosses uebergewicht erlangten  in der neuern zeit verfehlten wir nicht den lichen inflows anzuerkennen den ihre philosophie auf die sinnesänderung der franzosen ausübte um sie von dem starren sensualism zu einer geschmeidigern denkart auf dem wege des gemeinen menschenverstandes hinzuleiten wir verdankten ihnen gar manche gründliche einsicht in die wichtigsten fächer brittischer zustände und bemühungen  dagegen mussten wir vor nicht gar langer zeit unsre ethischästhetischen bestrebungen in ihren zeitschriften auf eine weise behandelt sehen wo es zweifelhaft blieb ob mangel an einsicht oder böser wille dabey obwaltete ob eine oberflächliche nicht genug durchdringende ansicht oder ein widerwilliges vorurtheil im spiele sey dieses ereigniss haben wir jedoch geduldig abgewartet da uns ja dergleichen im eignen vaterlande zu ertragen genügsam von jeher auferlegt worden  in den letzten jahren jedoch erfreuen uns aus jenen gegenden die liebevollsten blicke welche zu erwiedern wir uns verpflichtet fühlen und worauf wir in gegenwärtigen blättern unsre wohldenkenden landsleute insofern es nöthig seyn sollte aufmerksam zu machen gedenken                                       herr thomas carlyle hatte schon den wilhelm meister übersetzt und gab sodann vorliegendes leben schillers im jahre 1825 heraus  im jahre 1827 erschien german romances in 4 bänden wo er aus den erzählungen und mährchen deutscher schriftsteller als musäus la motte fouqué tieck hoffmann jean paul und goethe heraushob was er seiner nation am gemässesten zu seyn glaubte  die einer jeden abtheilung vorausgeschickten nachrichten von dem leben den schriften der richtung des genannten dichters und schriftstellers geben ein zeugniss von der einfach wohlwollenden weise wie der freund sich möglichst von der persönlichkeit und den zuständen eines jeden zu unterrichten gesucht und wie er dadurch auf den rechten weg gelangt seine kenntnisse immer mehr zu vervollständigen  in den edinburgher zeitschriften vorzüglich in denen welche eigentlich fremder literatur gewidmet sind finden sich nun ausser den schon genannten deutschen autoren auch ernst schulz klingemann franz horn zacharias werner graf platen und manche andere von verschiedenen referenten am meisten aber von unserm freunde beurtheilt und eingeführt  höchst wichtig ist bey dieser gelegenheit zu bemerken dass sie eigentlich ein jedes werk nur zum text und gelegenheit nehmen um über das eigentliche feld und fach so wie alsdann über das besondere individuelle ihre gedanken zu eröffnen und ihr gutachten meisterhaft abzuschliessen  diese edinburgh reviews sie seyen dem innern und allgemeinen oder den auswärtigen literaturen besonders gewidmet haben freunde der wissenschaften aufmerksam zu beachten denn es ist höchst merkwürdig wie der gründlichste ernst mit der freysten uebersicht ein strenger patriotismus mit einem einfachen reinen freysinn in diesen vorträgen sich gepaart findet                                       geniessen wir nun von dort in demjenigen was uns hier so nah angeht eine reine einfache theilnahme an unsern ethischästhetischen bestrebungen welche für einen besondern charakterzug der deutschen gelten können so haben wir uns gleichfalls nach dem umzusehen was ihnen dort von dieser art eigentlich am herzen liegt wir nennen hier gleich den namen burns von welchem ein schreiben des herrn carlyles folgende stelle enthält  das einzige einigermassen bedeutende was ich seit meinem hierseyn schrieb ist ein versuch über burns vielleicht habt ihr niemals von diesem mann gehört und doch war er einer der entschiedensten genies aber in der tiefsten classe der landleute geboren und durch die verwicklungen sonderbarer lagen zuletzt jammervoll zu grunde gerichtet so dass was er wirkte verhältnissmässig geringfügig ist er starb in der mitte der mannsjahre 1796  wir engländer besonders wir schottländer lieben burns mehr als irgend einen dichter seit jahrhunderten oft war ich von der bemerkung betroffen er sey wenig monate vor schiller in dem jahr 1759 geboren und keiner dieser beiden habe jemals des andern namen vernommen sie glänzten als sterne in entgegengesetzten hemisphären oder wenn man will eine trübe erdatmosphäre fing ihr gegenseitiges licht auf  mehr jedoch als unser freund vermuthen mochte war uns robert burns bekannt das allerliebste gedicht john barleycorn war anonym zu uns gekommen und verdienter weise geschätzt veranlasste solches manche versuche unsrer sprache es anzueignen hans gerstenkorn ein wackerer mann hat viele feinde die ihn unablässig verfolgen und beschädigen ja zuletzt gar zu vernichten drohen aus allen diesen unbilden geht er aber doch am ende triumphirend hervor besonders zu heil und fröhlichkeit der leidenschaftlichen biertrinker gerade in diesem heitern genialischen anthropomorphismus zeigt sich burns als wahrhaften dichter  auf weitere nachforschung fanden wir dieses gedicht in der ausgabe seiner poetischen werke von 1822 welcher eine skizze seines lebens voransteht die uns wenigstens von den aeusserlichkeiten seiner zustände bis auf einen gewissen grad belehrte was wir von seinen gedichten uns zueignen konnten überzeugte uns von seinem ausserordentlichen talent und wir bedauerten dass uns die schottische sprache gerade da hinderlich war wo er des reinsten natürlichsten ausdrucks sich gewiss bemächtigt hatte im ganzen jedoch haben wir unsre studien so weit geführt dass wir die nachstehende rühmliche darstellung auch als unsrer ueberzeugung gemäss unterschreiben können  inwiefern übrigens unser burns auch in deutschland bekannt sey mehr als das conversationslexicon von ihm überliefert wüsste ich als der neuen literarischen bewegungen in deutschland unkundig nicht zu sagen auf alle fälle jedoch gedenke ich die freunde auswärtiger literatur auf die kürzesten wege zu weisen the life of robert burns by j g lockhart edinburgh 1828 rezensirt von unserm freunde im edinburgh review december 1828  nachfolgende stellen daraus übersetzt werden den wunsch das ganze und den genannten mann auf jede weise zu kennen hoffentlich lebhaft erregen                                       burns war in einem höchst prosaischen zeitalter dergleichen brittanien nur je erlebt hatte geboren in den aller ungünstigsten verhältnissen wo sein geist nach hoher bildung strebend ihr unter dem druck täglich harter körperlicher arbeit nach zu ringen hatte ja unter mangel und trostlosesten aussichten auf die zukunft ohne förderniss als die begriffe wie sie in eines armen mannes hütte wohnen und allenfalls die reime von ferguson und ramsay als das muster der schönheit aufgesteckt aber unter diesen lasten versinkt er nicht durch nebel und finsterniss einer so düstern region entdeckt sein adlerauge die richtigen verhältnisse der welt und des menschenlebens er wächst an geistiger kraft und drängt sich mit gewalt zu verständiger erfahrung angetrieben durch die unwiderstehliche regsamkeit seines inneren geistes strauchelt er vorwärts und zu allgemeinen ansichten und mit stolzer bescheidenheit reicht er uns die frucht seiner bemühungen eine gabe dar welche nunmehr durch die zeit als unvergänglich anerkannt worden  ein wahrer dichter ein mann in dessen herzen die anlage eines reinen wissens keimt die töne himmlischer melodien vorklingen ist die köstlichste gabe die einem zeitalter mag verliehen werden wir sehen in ihm eine freyere reinere entwicklung alles dessen was in uns das edelste zu nennen ist sein leben ist uns ein reicher unterricht und wir betrauern seinen tod als eines wohlthäters der uns liebte so wie belehrte  solch eine gabe hat die natur in ihrer güte uns an robert burns gegönnt aber mit allzuvornehmer gleichgültigkeit warf sie ihn aus der hand als ein wesen ohne bedeutung es war entstellt und zerstört ehe wir es anerkannten ein ungünstiger stern hatte dem jüngling die gewalt gegeben das menschliche daseyn ehrwürdiger zu machen aber ihm war eine weisliche führung seines eigenen nicht geworden das geschick—denn so müssen wir in unserer beschränktheit reden—seine fehler die fehler der andern lasteten zu schwer auf ihm und dieser geist der sich erhoben hatte wäre es ihm nur zu wandern geglückt sank in den staub seine herrlichen fähigkeiten wurden in der blüthe mit füssen getreten er starb wir dürfen wohl sagen ohne jemals gelebt zu haben und so eine freundlich warme seele so voll von eingebornen reichthümern solcher liebe zu allen lebendigen und leblosen dingen das späte tausendschönchen fällt nicht unbemerkt unter seine pflugschar so wenig als das wohlversorgte nest der furchtsamen feldmaus das er hervorwühlt der wilde anblick des winters ergötzt ihn mit einer trüben oft wiederkehrenden zärtlichkeit verweilt er in diesen ernsten scenen der verwüstung aber die stimme des windes wird ein psalm in seinem ohr wie gern mag er in den sausenden wäldern dahin wandern denn er fühlt seine gedanken erhoben zu dem der auf den schwingen des windes einherschreitet eine wahre poetenseele sie darf nur berührt werden und ihr klang ist musik  welch ein warmes allumfassendes gleichheitsgefühl welche vertrauenvolle gränzenlose liebe welch edelmuthiges ueberschätzen des geliebten gegenstandes der bauer sein freund sein nussbraunes mädchen sind nicht länger gering und dörfisch held vielmehr und königin er rühmt sie als gleich würdig des höchsten auf der erde die rauhen scenen schottischen lebens sieht er nicht im arkadischen lichte aber in dem rauche in dem unebenen tennenboden einer solchen rohen wirthlichkeit findet er noch immer liebenswürdiges genug armuth fürwahr ist sein gefährte aber auch liebe und muth zugleich die einfachen gefühle der werth der edelsinn welche unter dem strohdach wohnen sind lieb und ehrwürdig seinem herzen und so über die niedrigsten regionen des menschlichen daseyns ergiesst er die glorie seines eigenen gemüths und sie steigen durch schatten und sonnenschein gesänftigt und verherrlicht zu einer schönheit welche sonst die menschen kaum in dem höchsten erblicken  hat er auch ein selbstbewusstseyn welches oft in stolz ausartet so ist es ein edler stolz um abzuwehren nicht um anzugreifen kein kaltes misslaunisches gefühl ein freyes und geselliges dieser poetische landmann beträgt sich möchten wir sagen wie ein könig in der verbannung er ist unter die niedrigsten gedrängt und fühlt sich gleich den höchsten er verlangt keinen rang damit man ihm keinen streitig mache den zudringlichen kann er abstossen den stolzen demüthigen vorurtheil auf reichthum oder altgeschlecht haben bey ihm keinen werth in diesem dunklen auge ist ein feuer woran sich eine abwürdigende herablassung nicht wagen darf in seiner erniedrigung in der äussersten noth vergisst er nicht für einen augenblick die majestät der poesie und mannheit und doch so hoch er sich über gewöhnlichen menschen fühlt sondert er sich nicht von ihnen ab mit wärme nimmt er an ihrem interesse theil ja er wirft sich in ihre arme und wie sie auch seyen bittet er um ihre liebe es ist rührend zu sehen wie in den düstersten zuständen dieses stolze wesen in der freundschaft hülfe sucht und oft seinen busen dem unwürdigen aufschliesst oft unter thränen an sein glühendes herz ein herz andrückt das freundschaft nur als namen kennt doch war er scharf und schnellsichtig ein mann vom durchdringendsten blick vor welchem gemeine verstellung sich nicht bergen konnte sein verstand sah durch die tiefen des vollkommensten betrügers und zugleich war eine grossmüthige leichtgläubigkeit in seinem herzen so zeigte sich dieser landmann unter uns eine seele wie aeolsharfe deren saiten vom gemeinsten winde berührt ihn zu gesetzlicher melodie verwandelten und ein solcher mann war es für den die welt kein schicklicher geschäft zu finden wusste als sich mit schmugglern und schenken herumzuzanken accise auf den talg zu berechnen und bierfässer zu visiren in solchem abmühen ward dieser mächtige geist kummervoll vergeudet und hundert jahre mögen vorüber gehen eh uns ein gleicher gegeben wird um vielleicht ihn abermals zu vergeuden                                       und wie wir den deutschen zu ihrem schiller glück wünschen so wollen wir in eben diesem sinne auch die schottländer segnen haben diese jedoch unserm freunde so viel aufmerksamkeit und theilnahme erwiesen so wär es billig dass wir auf gleiche weise ihren burns bey uns einführten ein junges mitglied der hochachtbaren gesellschaft der wir gegenwärtiges im ganzen empfohlen haben wird zeit und mühe höchlich belohnt sehen wenn er diesen freundlichen gegendienst einer so verehrungswürdigen nation zu leisten den entschluss fassen und das geschäft treulich durchführen will auch wir rechnen den belobten robert burns zu den ersten dichtergeistern welche das vergangene jahrhundert hervorgebracht hat  im jahr 1829 kam uns ein sehr sauber und augenfällig gedrucktes octavbändchen zur hand catalogue of german publications selected and systematically arranged for w h koller and jul cahlmann london  dieses büchlein mit besonderer kenntniss der deutschen literatur in einer die uebersicht erleichternden methode verfasst macht demjenigen der es ausgearbeitet und den buchhändlern ehre welche ernstlich das bedeutende geschäft übernehmen eine fremde literatur in ihr vaterland einzuführen und zwar so dass mann in allen fächern übersehen könne was dort geleistet worden um so wohl den gelehrten den denkenden leser als auch den fühlenden und unterhaltung suchenden anzulocken und zu befriedigen neugierig wird jeder deutsche schriftsteller und literator der sich in irgend einem fache hervorgethan diesen catalog aufschlagen um zu forschen ob denn auch seiner darin gedacht seine werke mit andern verwandten freundlich aufgenommen worden allen deutschen buchhändlern wird es angelegen seyn zu erfahren wie man ihren verlag über dem canal betrachte welchen preis man auf das einzelne setze und sie werden nichts verabsäumen um mit jenen die angelegenheit so ernsthaft angreifenden männern in verhältniss zu kommen und dasselbe immerfort lebendig erhalten                                       wenn ich nun aber das von unserm schottischen freunde vor soviel jahren verfasste leben schillers auf das er mit einer ihm so wohl anstehenden bescheidenheit zurücksieht hiedurch einleite und gegenwärtig an den tag fördere so erlaube er mir einige seiner neusten aeusserungen hinzuzufügen welche die bisherigen gemeinsamen fortschritte am besten deutlich machen möchten                                                              thomas carlyle an goethe  den 22 december 1829  ich habe zu nicht geringer befriedigung zum zweitenmale den briefwechsel gelesen und sende heute einen darauf gegründeten aufsatz über schiller ab für das foreign review es wird ihnen angenehm seyn zu hören dass die kentniss und schätzung der auswärtigen besonders der deutschen literatur sich mit wachsender schnelle verbreitet so weit die englische zunge herrscht so dass bey den antipoden selbst in neuholland die weisen ihres landes ihre weisheit predigen ich habe kürzlich gehört dass sogar in oxford und cambridge unsern beiden englischen universitäten die bis jetzt als die haltpuncte der insularischen eigenthümlichen beharrlichkeit sind betrachtet worden es sich in solchen dingen zu regen anfängt ihr niebuhr hat in cambridge einen geschickten uebersetzer gefunden und in oxford haben zwei bis drei deutsche schon hinlängliche beschäftigung als lehrer ihrer sprache das neue licht mag für gewisse augen zu stark seyn jedoch kann niemand an den guten folgen zweifeln die am ende daraus hervorgehen werden lasst nationen wie individuen sich nur einander kennen und der gegenseitige hass wird sich in gegenwärtige hülfleistung verwandeln und anstatt natürlicher feinde wie benachbarte länder zuweilen genannt sind werden wir alle natürliche freunde seyn                                       wenn uns nach allen diesem nun die hoffnung schmeichelt eine uebereinstimmung der nationen ein allgemeineres wohlwollen werde sich durch nähere kentniss der verschiedenen sprachen und denkweisen nach und nach erzeugen so wage ich von einem bedeutenden inflows der deutschen literatur zu sprechen welcher sich in einem besondern falle höchst wirksam erweisen möchte  es ist nämlich bekannt genug dass die bewohner der drei brittischen königreiche nicht gerade in dem besten einverständnisse leben sondern dass vielmehr ein nachbar an dem andern genügsam zu tadeln findet um eine heimliche abneigung bey sich zu rechtfertigen  nun aber bin ich überzeugt dass wie die deutsche ethischästhetische literatur durch das dreifache brittanien sich verbreitet zugleich auch eine stille gemeinschaft von philogermanen sich bilden werde welche in der neigung zu einer vierten so nahverwandten völkerschaft auch unter einander als vereinigt und verschmolzen sich empfinden werden
