          286       what might have been expected  chapter i  harry loudon makes up his mind   on a wooden bench under a great catalpatree in the front yard of a comfortable countryhouse in virginia sat harry and kate loudon worrying their minds it was all about old aunt matilda  aunt matilda was no relation of these children she was an old colored woman who lived in a cabin about a quarter of a mile from their house but they considered her one of their best friends her old log cabin was their favorite resort and many a fine time they had there when they caught some fish or harry shot a bird or two or when they could get some sweet potatoes or apples to roast and some cornmeal for ashcakes they would take their provisions to aunt matilda and she would cook them sometimes an ashcake would be baked rather harder than it was convenient to bite and it had happened that a fish or two had been cooked entirely away but such mishaps were not common aunt matilda was indeed a most wonderful cookand a cook too who liked to have a boy and a girl by her while she was at work and who would tell them storiesas queer old stories as ever were toldwhile the things were cooking the stories were really the cause of the ashcakes and fish sometimes being forgotten  and it is no wonder that these children were troubled in their minds they had just heard that aunt matilda was to go to the almshouse  harry and kate were silent they had mourned over the news and kate had cried there was nothing more to be done about it so far as she could see  but all of a sudden harry jumped up i tell you what it is kate he exclaimed ive made up my mind aunt matilda is not going to the almshouse i will support her myself  oh that will be splendid cried kate but you can never do it  yes i can said harry there are ever so many ways in which i can earn money  what are you going to do said kate will you let me help  yes said her brother you may help if you can but i dont think you will be of much use as for me i shall do plenty of things i shall go out with my gun  but there is nothing to shoot now in the summertime said kate  no there isnt much yet to be sure said her brother but before very long there will be partridges and hares plenty of them and father and captain caseby will buy all i shoot and you see until it is time for game im going to gather sumac  oh i can help you in that cried kate  yes i believe you can said her brother and now suppose we go down and see aunt matilda and have a talk with her about it  just wait until i get my bonnet said kate and she dashed into the house and then with a pink calico sunbonnet on her head she came down the steps in two jumps and the brother and sister together hurried through the woods to aunt matildas cabin  harry and kate loudon were welleducated children and in many respects knew more than most girls and boys who were older than they harry had been taught by his father to ride and to swim and to shoot as carefully as his schoolteacher had taught him to spell and to parse and he was not only taught to be skillful in these outdoor pursuits but to be prudent and kindhearted when he went gunning he shot birds and game that were fit for the table and when he rode he remembered that his horse had feelings as well as himself being a boy of good natural impulses he might have found out these things for himself but for fear that he might be too long about it his father carefully taught him that it was possible to shoot and to hunt and to ride without being either careless or cruel it must not be supposed that harry was so extremely particular that there was no fun in him for he had discovered that there is just as much fun in doing things right as in doing them wrong and as there was not a boy in all the country round about who could ride or swim or shoot so well as harry so there was none who had a more generally jolly time than he  his sister kate was a sharp bright intelligent girl rather inclined to be wild when opportunity offered but very affectionate and always as ready for outdoor sports as any boy she could not shootat least she never triedand she did not ride much on horseback but she enjoyed fishing and rambles through the woods were to her a constant delight when anything was to be done especially if it was anything novel kate was always ready to help if anybody had a plan on hand it was very hard to keep her finger out of it and if there were calculations to be made it was all the better kate had a fine head for mathematics and on the whole she rather preferred a slate and pencil to needles and spoolcotton  as to aunt matilda there could be no doubt about her case being a pretty hard one she was quite old and decrepit when the war set her free and at the time of our story she was still older and stiffer her former master had gone to the north to live and as she had no family to support her the poor old woman was compelled to depend upon the charity of her neighbors for a time she managed to get along tolerably well but it was soon found that she would suffer if she depended upon occasional charity especially after she became unable to go after food or help mr and mrs loudon were very willing to give her what they could but they had several poor people entirely dependent upon them and they found it impossible to add to the number of their pensioners so it was finally determined among the neighbors that aunt matilda would have to go to the almshouse which place was provided for just such poor persons as she neither harry nor kate knew much about the almshouse but they thought it must be some sort of a horrible place and at any rate it was too hard that aunt matilda should have to leave her old home where she had spent so many many years  and they did not intend she should do it     chapter ii  the adoption   when the children reached aunt matildas cabin they found the old woman seated by a very small fire which was burning in one corner of the hearth  are you cold aunt matilda asked kate  lor bless you no honey but you see there wasnt hardly any coals left and i was tryin to keep the fire alive till somebody would come along and gather me up some wood  then you were going to cook your breakfast i suppose said harry  yes child if somebody ud come along and fetch me something to eat  havent you anything at all in the house asked kate  not a pinch o meal nor nothin else said the old woman but i spected somebody ud be along  did you know aunt matilda said harry that they are going to send you to the almshouse  yes i heerd em talk about it said aunt matilda shaking her head but the almshouse aint no place for me  thats so said kate quickly and youre not going there either  no said harry kate and i intend to take care of you for the rest of your life  lor children you cant do it said the old woman looking in astonishment from one to the other of these youngsters who proposed to adopt her  yes but we can said harry just you wait and see  itll take a good deal o money said the old woman who did not seem to be altogether satisfied with the prospects held out before her moren you all will ever be able to git  how much money would be enough for you to live on aunt matilda asked harry  dunno takes a heap o money to keep a person  well now said kate lets see exactly how much it will take have you a pencil harry i have a piece of paper in my pocket i think yes here it is now lets set down everything and see what it comes to  so saying she sat down on a low stool with her paper on her knees and her pencil in her hand  what shall we begin with said she  well begin with cornmeal said harry how much cornmeal do you eat in a week aunt matilda  dunno said she spect about a couple o pecks  oh aunt matilda cried kate our whole family wouldnt eat two pecks in a week  well then a halfpeck said she pends a good deal on how many is living in a house  yes but we only mean this for you aunt matilda we dont mean it for anybody else  well then i reckon a quarter of a peck would do for jest me  we will allow you a peck said harry and that will be twentyfive cents a week set that down kate  all right said kate and she set down at the top of the paper meal 25 cents  the children proceeded in this way to calculate how much bacon molasses coffee and sugar would suffice for aunt matildas support and they found that the cost per week at the rates of the country stores with which they were both familiar would be seventyseven and threequarter cents  is there anything else aunt matilda asked kate  nuffin i can think on said aunt matilda cept milk  oh i can get that for nothing said kate i will bring it to you from home and i will bring you some butter too when i can get it  and ill pick up wood for you said harry i can gather enough in the woods in a couple of hours to last you for a week  lor bless you chilen said aunt matilda i hope youll be able to do all dat  harry stood quiet a few minutes reflecting  how much would seventyseven and three quarter cents a week amount to in a year kate said he  kate rapidly worked out the problem and answered forty dollars and fortythree cents  lor but thats a heap o money said aunt matilda thats moren i spect to have all the rest of my life  how old are you aunt matilda said harry  i spect about fifty said the old woman  oh aunt matilda cried harry youre certainly more than fifty when i was a very little fellow i remember that you were very oldat least sixty or seventy  well then i spects ise about ninety said aunt matilda  but you cant be ninety said kate the bible says that seventy years is the common length of a persons life  them was jews said aunt matilda it didnt mean no culld people culld people live longer than that but praps a culld jew wouldnt live very long  well said harry it makes no difference how old you are were going to take care of you for the rest of your life  kate was again busy with her paper  in five years harry she said it will be two hundred and two dollars and fifteen cents  lor cried aunt matilda you chilen will nebber git dat  but we dont have to get it all at once aunt matilda said harry laughing and you neednt be afraid that we cant do it come kate its time for us to be off  and then the conference broke up the question of aunt matildas future support was settled they had forgotten clothes to be sure but it is very difficult to remember everything     chapter iii  commencing business   when they reached home harry and kate put together what little money they had and found that they could buy food enough to last aunt matilda for several days this harry procured and carried down to the old woman that day he also gathered and piled up inside of her cabin a good supply of wood fortunately there was a spring very near her door so that she could get water without much trouble  harry and kate determined that they would commence business in earnest the next morning and as this was not the season for game they determined to go to work to gather sumacleaves  most of us are familiar with the sumacbush which grows nearly all over the united states of course we do not mean the poisonous swampsumac but that which grows along the fences and on the edges of the woods of late years the leaves of this bush have been greatly in demand for tanning purposes and in some states especially in virginia sumac gathering has become a very important branch of industry particularly with the negroes many of whom during the sumac season prefer gathering these leaves to doing any other kind of work the sumacbush is quite low and the leaves are easily stripped off they are then carefully dried and packed in bags and carried to the nearest place of sale generally a country store  the next morning harry and kate made preparations for a regular expedition they were to take their dinner and stay all day kate was enrapturedeven more so perhaps than harry each of them had a large bag and harry carried his gun for who could tell what they might meet with a mink perhaps or a fox or even a beaver they had a long walk but it was through the woods and there was always something to see in the woods in a couple of hours for they stopped very often they reached a little valley through which ran crooked creek and on the banks of crooked creek were plenty of sumacbushes this place was at some distance from any settlement and apparently had not been visited by sumac gatherers  hurra cried kate here is enough to fill a thousand bags  harry leaned his gun against a tree and hung up his shot and powder flasks and they both went to work gathering sumac there was plenty of it but kate soon found that what they saw would not fill a thousand bags there were a good many bushes but they were small and when all the leaves were stripped off one and squeezed into a bag they did not make a very great show however they did very well and for an hour or so they worked on merrily then they had dinner harry built a fire he easily found dry branches and he had brought matches and paper with him at a little distance under a great pinetree kate selected a level place and cleared away the dead leaves and the twigs leaving a smooth table of dry and fragrant pineneedles on this she spread the cloth which was a napkin then she took from the little basket she had brought with her a cake of cornmeal several thick and wellbuttered slices of wheat bread some hardboiled eggs a little paper of pepper and salt a piece of cheese and some fried chicken when this was spread out and it would not all go on the cloth harry came and looked at the repast  what is there to cook said he  kate glanced over her table with a perplexed look upon her countenance and said i dont believe there is anything to cook  but we ought to cook something said harry here is a splendid fire whats the good of camping out if you dont cook things  but everything is cooked said kate  so it seems said harry in a somewhat discouraged tone had he built that beautiful fire for nothing we ought to have brought along something raw said he it is ridiculous eating a cold dinner with a splendid fire like that  we might catch some fish said kate we should have to cook them  yes said harry but i brought no lines  so as there was nothing else to be done they ate their dinner cold and when they had finished kate cleared off the table by giving the napkin a flirt and they were ready for work again but first they went to look for a spring where they could get a drink in about half an hour they found a spring and some wild plums and some blackberries and a grapevine which would surely be full of grapes in the fall and was therefore a vine to be remembered and a stone which kate was quite certain was an indian arrowhead and some tracks in the white sand which must have been made by some animal or other although neither of them was able to determine exactly what animal  when they returned to the pinetree kate took up her bag harry followed her example but somewhat slowly as if he were thinking of something else  i tell you harry said kate suppose you take your gun and go along the creek and see what that was that made the tracks if it was anything with fur on it it would come to more than the sumac i will stay here and go on filling my bag  well said harry after a moments hesitation i might go a little way up the creek i neednt be gone long i would certainly like to find that creature if i can  all right said kate i think youll find it  so harry loaded his gun and hurried off to find the tracks of the mysterious and probably furcovered animal  kate worked away cheerfully singing a little song and filling her bag with the sumacleaves it was now much warmer and she began to find that sumac picking all alone was not very interesting and she hoped that harry would soon find his animal whatever it was then after picking a little longer she thought she would sit down and rest awhile so she dragged her bag to the pinetree and sat down leaning her back against the tall trunk she took her bag of sumac in her arms and lifted it up trying to estimate its weight  there must be ten pounds here she said noit dont feel very heavy but then there are so many of the leaves it ought to weigh fifteen pounds and they will be a cent a pound if we take pay in trade and threequarters of a cent if we want cash but of course we will take things in trade  and then she put down the bag and began to calculate  fifteen pounds fifteen cents and at seventyseven and threequarter cents per week that would support aunt matilda nearly a day and a half and then if harry has as much more that will keep her almost three days and if we pick for two hours longer when harry comes back we may get ten pounds more apiece which will make it pretty heavy but then we wont have to come again for nearly five days and if harry shoots an otter i reckon he can get a dollar for the skinor a pair of gloves of itkid gloves and my pink dressand well go in the carriagetwo horsesfour horsesa prince with a feathersome butterflies and kate was asleep  when kate awoke she saw by the sun that she had been asleep for several hours she sprang to her feet where is harry she cried but nobody answered then she was frightened for he might be lost but soon she reflected that that was very ridiculous for neither of them could be lost in that neighborhood which they knew so well then she sat down and waited quite anxiously it must be admitted but harry did not come and the sun sank lower presently she rose with an air of determination  i cant wait any longer she said or it will be dark before i get home harry has followed that thing up the creek ever so far and there is no knowing when he will get back and it wont do for me to stay here ill go home and leave a note for him  she put her hand in her pocket and there was harrys pencil which she had borrowed in the morning and forgot to return and also the piece of paper on which she had made her calculation of the cost of aunt matildas board the back of this would do very well for a note so she wrote on it      i am going home for it is getting late i shall go back by the same     road we came your sumacbag is in the bushes between the tree and     the creek bring this piece of paper with you as it has aunt     matildas expenses on the outside                                                                     kate  this note she pinned up against the pine tree where harry could not fail to see it then she hid her brothers sumacbag in the bushes and shouldering her own bag which bytheway did not weigh so many pounds as she thought it did set out for home     chapter iv  kate very naturally is anxious   kate hurried through the woods for she was afraid she would not reach home until after dark and indeed it was then quite like twilight in the shade of the great trees around her the road on which she was walking was however clear and open and she was certain she knew the way as she hastened on she could not help feeling that she was wasting this delightful walk through the woods her old friends were around her and though she knew them all so well she could not stop to spend any time with them there were the oaksthe blackoak with its shining manypointed leaves the whiteoak with its lighter green though dullerhued foliage and the chestnutoak with its long and thickly clustered leaves then there were the sweetgums fragrant and starleaved and the blackgum tough dark and unpretending no little girl in the county knew more about the trees of her native place than kate for she had made good use of her long rides through the country with her father here were the chincapinbushes like miniature chestnuttrees and here were the beautiful poplars she knew them by their bright leaves which looked as though they had been snipped off at the top with a pair of scissors and here right in front of her was uncle braddock she knew him by his manycolored dressinggown without which he never appeared in public it was one of the most curious dressinggowns ever seen as uncle braddock was one of the most curious old colored men ever seen the gown was not really as old as its wearer but it looked older it was composed of about a hundred pieces of different colors and patternsred green blue yellow and brown striped spotted plain and figured with flowers and vines these pieces from year to year had been put on as patches and some of them were quilted on and some were sewed and some were pinned the gown was very long and came down to uncle braddocks heels which were also very long and bobbed out under the bottom of the gown as if they were trying to kick backward but uncle braddock never kicked he was very old and he had all the different kinds of rheumatism and walked bent over nearly at rightangles supporting himself by a long cane like a beanpole which he grasped in the middle there was probably no particular reason why he should bend over so very much but he seemed to like to walk in that way and nobody objected he was a good old soul and kate was delighted to see him  uncle braddock she cried  the old man stopped and turned around almost standing up straight in his astonishment at seeing the young girl alone in the woods  why miss kate he exclaimed as she came up with him what in the world is you doin hyar  ive been gathering sumac said kate as they walked on together and harrys gone off and i couldnt wait any longer and im just as glad as i can be to see you uncle braddock for i was beginning to be afraid because its getting dark so fast and your dressinggown looked prettier to me than all the trees when i first caught sight of it but i think you ought to have it washed uncle braddock  wash him said uncle braddock with a chuckle as if the suggestion was a very funny joke dat wouldnt do no how hed wash all to bits and the pins would stick em in the hands couldnt wash him miss kate its too late for dat now might have washed him before de war praps we was stronger den but what you getherin sumac for miss kate if you white folks goes pickin it all there wont be none lef soon fur de culled people dats mighty certain  why im picking it for the colored people said kate at least for one colored person  why dont you let em pick it therselves asked the old man  because aunt matilda cant do it said kate  is dat sumac fur aunt matilda said uncle braddock  yes it is said kate and harrys been gathering some and were going to pick enough to get her all she wants harry and i intend to take care of her now you know they were going to send her to the almshouse  well i declar exclaimed the old man i neber did hear de like o dat afore why you all isnt done bein tuk care of youselves kate laughed and explained their plans getting quite enthusiastic about it  lem me carry dat bag said uncle braddock oh no said kate youre too old to be carrying bags  jis lem me hab it said he its trouble enuf fur me to get along anyway and a bag or two dont make no kind o difrence  kate found herself obliged to consent and as the bag was beginning to feel very heavy for her and as it did not seem to make the slightest difference as he had said to uncle braddock she was very glad to be rid of it  but when at last they reached the village and uncle braddock went over the fields to his cabin kate ran into the house carrying her bag with ease for she was excited by the hope that harry had come home by some shorter way and that she should find him in the house  but there was no harry there and soon it was night and yet he did not come  matters now looked serious and about nine oclock mr loudon with two of the neighbors started out into the woods to look for aunt matildas young guardian  kates mother was away on a visit to her relations in another county and so the little girl passed the night on the sofa in the parlor with a colored woman asleep on the rug before the fireplace kate would not go to bed she determined to stay awake until harry should come home but the sofacushions became more and more pleasant and very soon she was dreaming that harry had shot a giraffe and had skinned it and had stuffed the skin full of sumacleaves and that he and she were pulling it through the woods and that the legs caught in the trees and they could not get it along and then she woke up it was bright daylight but harry had not come  there was no news mr loudon and his friends were still absent poor kate was in despair and could not touch the breakfast which was prepared at the usual hour  about nine oclock a company of negro sumac gatherers appeared on the road which passed mr loudons house it was a curious party on a rude cart drawn by two little oxen was a pile of bags filled with sumacleaves which were supported by poles stuck around the cart and bound together by ropes on the top of the pile sat a negro plying a long whip and shouting to the oxen behind the cart and on each side of it were negroes men and women carrying huge bales of sumac on their heads bags pillowcases bedticks sheets and coverlets had been called into requisition to hold the precious leaves here was a woman with a great bundle on her head which sank down so as to almost entirely conceal her face and near her was an old man who supported on his bare head a load that looked heavy enough for a horse even little children carried bundles considerably larger than themselves and all were laughing and talking merrily as they made their way to the village store at the crossroads  kate ran eagerly out to question these people they must certainly have seen harry  the goodnatured negroes readily stopped to talk with kate the oxdriver halted his team and every headburdened man woman and child clustered around her until it seemed as if sumac clouds had spread between her and the sky and had obscured the sun  but no one had seen harry in fact this company with the accumulated proceeds of a weeks sumac gathering had come from a portion of the county many miles from crooked creek and of course they could bring no news to kate     chapter v  the turkeyhunter   when harry left kate he quietly walked by the side of crooked creek keeping his eyes fixed on the tracks of the strange animal and his thumb on the hammer of the righthand barrel of his gun before long the tracks disappeared and disappeared too directly in front of a hole in the bank quite a large hole big enough for a beaver or an otter this was capital luck harry got down on his hands and knees and examined the tracks sure enough the toes pointed toward the hole it must be in there  harry cocked his gun and sat and waited he was as still as a dead mouse there was no earthly reason why the creature should not come out except perhaps that it might not want to come out at any rate it could not know that harry was outside waiting for it  he waited a long time without ever thinking how the day was passing on and it began to be a little darkish just a little before he thought that perhaps he had better go back to kate  but it might be just coming out and what a shame to move a skin that would bring five dollars was surely worth waiting for a little while longer and he might never have such another chance he certainly had never had such a one before  and so he still sat and waited and pretty soon he heard something but it was not in the holenot near him at all it was farther along the creek and sounded like the footsteps of some one walking stealthily  harry looked around quickly and about thirty yards from him he saw a man with a gun the man was now standing still looking steadily at him at least harry thought he was but there was so little light in the woods by this time that he could not be sure about it what was that man after could he be watching him  harry was afraid to move perhaps the man mistook him for some kind of an animal to be sure he could not help thinking that boys were animals but he did not suppose the man would want to shoot a boy if he knew it but how could any one tell that harry was a boy at that distance and in that light  poor harry did not even dare to call out he could not speak without moving something his lips any way and the man might fire at the slightest motion he was so quiet that the muskratit was a muskrat that lived in the holecame out of his house and seeing the boy so still supposed he was nothing of any consequence and so trotted noiselessly along to the water and slipped in for a swim harry never saw him his eyes were fixed on the man  for some minutes longerthey seemed like hourshe remained motionless and then he could bear it no longer  hellow he cried  hellow said the man  then harry got up trembling and pale and the man came toward him  why i didnt know what you were said the man  tony kirk exclaimed harry yes it was tony kirk sure enough a man who would never shoot a boyif he knew it  what are you doing here asked tony asquattin in the dirt at suppertime  harry told him what he was doing and how he had been frightened and then the remark about suppertime made him think of his sister my senses he cried theres kate she must think im lost  kate exclaimed tony what kate you dont mean your sister  yes i do said harry and away he ran down the shore of the creek tony followed and when he reached the big pinetree there was harry gazing blankly around him  shes gone faltered the boy  i should think so said tony if she knew what was good for her whats this his quick eyes had discovered the paper on the tree  tony pulled the paper from the pine trunk and tried to read it but harry was at his side in an instant and saw it was kates writing it was almost too dark to read it but he managed by holding it toward the west to make it out  shes gone home he said and i must be after her and he prepared to start  hold up cried tony im going that way and so youve been getherin sumac harry had read the paper aloud theres no use o leavin yer bag git it out o the bushes and come along with me  harry soon found his bag and then he and tony set out along the road  what are you after asked harry  turkeys said tony  tony kirk was always after turkeys he was a wildturkey hunter by profession it is true there were seasons of the year when he did not shoot turkeys but although at such times he worked a little at farming and fished a little he nearly always found it necessary to do something that related to turkeys he watched their haunts he calculated their increase he worked out problems which proved to him where he would find them most plentiful in the fall and his mind was seldom free from the consideration of the turkey question  isnt it rather early for turkeys asked harry  well yes said tony but im tired o waitin  im goin to make a short cut continued tony striking out of the road into a narrow path in the woods you can save half a mile by comin this way  so harry followed him  i dont mind takin you said tony fur i know you kin keep a secret my turkeyblind is over yander and as he said this he put his hand into his coat pocket and pulled out a handful of shelled corn which he began to scatter along the path a grain or two at a time after ten or fifteen minutes walking tony scattering corn all the way they came to a mass of oak and chestnut boughs piled up on one side of the path like a barrier this was the turkeyblind it was four or five feet high and behind it tony was accustomed to sit in the early gray of the morning waiting for the turkeys which he hoped to entice that way by means of his long line of shelled corn  you see i build my blind said he to harry and then i dont come here till ive sprinkled my corn for about a week and got the turkeys used to comin this way after it then i get back o that thar at night and wait till the airly mornin when theyre sartin to come gobblin along till i can get a good crack at em with this he sat down on a log which harry could scarcely see so dark was it in the woods by this time  are you tired said harry  no answered tony im goin to stop here i want to be ready fur em before it begins to be light  but how am i to get home said harry  oh jist keep straight on in that track itll take yer straight to the store ef ye dont turn out uv it  cant you come along and show me said harry i cant find the way through these dark woods  its easy enough said tony striking a match to light his pipe i could find my way with my eyes shut and it would not do fur me to go ill make too much noise comin back theres no knowin how soon the turkeys will begin to stir about  then you oughtnt to have brought me here said harry much provoked  i wanted to show you a short way home said tony puffing away at his pipe  harry answered not a word but set out along the path in a minute or two he ran against a tree then he turned to the right and stumbled over a root dropping his bag and nearly losing his hold of his gun he was soon convinced that it was all nonsense to try to get home by that path and he slowly made his way back to tony  ill tell ye what it is said the turkeyhunter ef you think youd hurt yerself findin yer way home and i thought you knew the woods better than that you might as well stay here with me ill take you home bright an airly you neednt trouble yerself about yer sister shes home long ago it must have been bright daylight when she wrote on that paper and she could keep the road easy enough  harry said nothing but sat down on the other end of the log tony did not seem to notice his vexation but talked to him explaining the mysteries of turkeyhunting and the delight of spending a night in the woods where everything was so cool and dry and still theres no nonsense here said tony ef theres any place where a feller kin have peace and comfert its in the woods at night  by degrees harry became interested and forgot his annoyance kate was certainly safe at home and as it was impossible for him to find his way out of the depths of the woods he might as well be content he could not even hope to regain the road by the way they came  when tony had finished his pipe he took harry behind his blind all you have to do said he is jist to peep over here and level your gun along that path keepin yer eye fixed straight in front of you and after awhile you can begin to see things suppose that dark lump down yander was a turkey just look at it long enough and you kin make it out you see what i mean dont you  yes said harry peeping over the blind i see it and then with a sudden jump he whispered tony its moving tony did not answer for a moment and then he hurriedly whispered back thats so it is moving     chapter vi  tony strikes out   there was no doubt about it something was moving there was a rise in the ground a short distance in front of the turkeyblind and a little patch of dark sky was visible between the trees across this bit of sky something dark was slowly passing  ye kin see most anything in the darkest night whispered tony ef ye kin only git the sky behind it but thats no turkey  what do you think it is said harry softly its big enough for a turkey  too big said tony lets git after it you slip along the path and ill go round ahead of it feel yer way and dont make no noise if ye run agin anything and mind thisand here tony spoke in one of the most impressive of whispersdont you fire till yer dead certain what it is  with this tony slipped away into the darkness and harry grasping his gun set out to feel his way he felt his way along the path for a short time and then he felt his way out of it then he crept into a low soft place full of ferns and out of that he carefully felt his way into a big bush where he knocked off his hat when he found his hat which took him some time he gradually worked himself out into a place where the woods were a little more open and there he caught another glimpse of the sky just at the top of the ridge there was something dark against the sky and harry watched it for a long time at last as it did not move at all he came to the conclusion that it must be a bush and he was entirely correct for an hour or two he quietly crept among the trees hoping he would either find the thing that was moving or get back to the turkeyblind several times something that he was sure was an old har as hares are often called in virginia rushed out of the bushes near him and once he heard a quick rustling among the dead leaves that sounded as if it were made by a black snake but it might as well have been a chinese pagoda on wheels for all he could see of it at last he became very tired and sat down to rest with his back against a big tree there he soon began to nod and without the slightest intention of doing anything of the kind he went to sleep just as soundly as if he had been in his bed at home and this was not at all surprising considering the amount of walking and creeping that he had done that day and night  when he awoke it was daylight he sprang to his feet and found he was very stiff in the legs but that did not prevent him from running this way and that to try and find some place in the woods with which he was familiar before long he heard what he thought was something splashing in water and making his way toward the sound he pushed out on the bank of crooked creek  the creek was quite wide at this point and out near the middle of it he saw tonys head the turkeyhunter was swimming handoverhand dogfashion for the shore behind him was a boat upsidedown which seemed just on the point of sinking out of sight  hellow there cried harry whats the matter tony  tony never answered a word but spluttered and puffed and struck out slowly but vigorously for the bank  wait a minute cried harry wildly excited ill reach you a pole  but tony did not wait and harry could find no pole when he turned around from his hurried search among the bushes the turkeyhunter had found bottom and was standing with his head out of water but the bottom was soft and muddy and he flopped about dolefully when he attempted to walk to the bank harry reached his gun out toward him but tony with a quick jerk of his arm motioned it away  id rather be drownded than shot he spluttered i dont want no gunmuzzles pinted at me take ahold of that little tree and then reach me your hand  harry seized a young tree that grew on the very edge of the bank and as soon as tony managed to flop himself near enough harry leaned over and took hold of his outstretched hand and gave him a jerk forward with all his strength over went tony splash on his face in the water and harry came very near going in headforemost on top of him but he recovered himself and not having loosed his grip of tonys hand he succeeded with a mighty effort in dragging the turkeyhunters head out of the water and after a desperate struggle with the mud tony managed to get on his feet again  i dont know said he blowing the water out of his mouth and shaking his dripping head but what id most as lieve be shot as ducked that way dont you jerk so hard again hold steady and let me pull  harry took a still firmer grasp of the tree and held steady while tony gradually worked his feet through the sticky mud until he reached the bank and then he laboriously clambered on shore  how did it happen said harry how did you get in the water  boat upsot said tony seating himself all dripping with water and mud upon the bank  why you came near being drowned said harry anxiously  no i didnt answered tony pulling a big bunch of weeds and rubbing his legs with them i kin swim well enough but a fellar has a rough time in the water with big boots on and his pockets full o buckshot  couldnt you empty the shot out asked harry  and lose it all asked tony with an aggrieved expression upon his watery face  but how did it happen harry earnestly inquired what were you doing in the boat  tony did not immediately answer he rubbed at his legs and then he tried to wipe his face with his wet coatsleeve but finding that only made matters worse he accepted harrys offer of his handkerchief and soon got his countenance into talking order  why you see said he i kept on up the creek till i got opposite john walkers cabin where its narrow and theres a big tree alyin across  still following that thing interrupted harry  yes said tony an then i got over on the tree and kep down the creek  still following asked harry  yes and i got a long ways down and had one bad tumble too in a dirty little gully and it was pretty nigh day when i turned to come back an then when i got up here i thought i would look fur john walkers boatfur i knew he kept it tied up somewhere down this wayand save myself all that walk i found the ole boat  and how did it upset said harry  humph said tony easy enough i hadnt nuthin to row with but a bit o pole and i got a sorter cross agettin along so slow and so i stood up and gin a big push and one foot slipped an over she went  and in you went said harry  yesin i went i dont see what ever put john walker up to makin sich a boat as that its jist the meanest lopsidedest lowborndedst boat i ever did see  i dont wonder you think so said harry laughing but if i were you id go home as soon as i could and get some dry clothes  thats so said tony rising these feel like the inside of an eelskin  oh tony said harry as they walked along up the creek did you find out what that thing was  yes i did answered tony  and what was it  it was captain caseby  captain caseby cried harry  yes jist him and nuthin else it was his head we seen agin the sky as he was awalkin on the other side of that little ridge  captain caseby again ejaculated harry in his amazement  yes sir said tony an im glad i found it out before i crossed the creek for my gun wasnt no further use an it was only in my way so i left it in the bushes up here ef it hadnt been for that the ole rifle would ha been at the bottom of the creek  but what was captain caseby doing here in the woods at night asked harry  dunno said tony i jist follered him till i made sure he wasnt ahuntin for my turkeyblind and then i let him go long his business wasnt no consarn o mine  when tony and harry had nearly reached the village who should they meet at a crossroad in the woods but mr loudon and captain caseby  ho ho cried the captain where on earth have you been here ive been ahunting you all night  you have have you said tony with a chuckle and harry and ive been ahuntin you all night too  everybody now began to talk at once harrys father was so delighted to find his boy again that he did not care to explain anything and he and harry walked off together  but captain caseby told tony all about it how he mr loudon and old mr wagner had set out to look for harry how mr wagner soon became so tired that he had to give up and go home and how mr loudon had gone through the woods to the north while he kept down by the creek searching on both sides of the stream and how they had both walked and walked and walked all night and had met at last down by the river  how did you manage to meet mr loudon asked tony  i heard him hollerin said the captain  he hollered pretty near all night he told me  why didnt you holler tony asked  oh i never exercise my voice in the night air said the captain its against my rules  well youd better break your rules next time you go out in the woods where harry is said the turkeyhunter or hell pop you over for a turkey or a muskrat hes a sharp shot i kin tell ye  you dont really mean he was after me last night with a gun exclaimed captain caseby  he truly was declared tony he was atrackin you his sunday best it was bad for you that it was so dark that he couldnt see what you was but it might have been worse for ye if it hadnt been so dark that he couldnt find ye at all  im glad i didnt know it said the captain earnestly thoroughly and completely glad i didnt know it i should have yelled all the skin off my throat if id have known he was after me with a gun  after harry had been home an hour or two and kate had somewhat recovered from her transports of joy and everybody in the village had heard all about everything that had happened and captain caseby had declared in the bosom of his family that he would never go out into the woods again at night without keeping up a steady holler harry remembered that he had left his sumacbag somewhere in the woods hard work for a whole day and a night and nothing to show for it rather a poor prospect for aunt matilda     chapter vii  aunt matildas christmas   when harry and kate held council that afternoon their affairs looked a little discouraging kates sumac was weighed and it was only seven pounds seven whole cents if they took it out in trade or five and a quarter cents as kate calculated if they took cash a woman as large as aunt matilda could not be supported on that kind of an income it was plain enough  but our brave boy and girl were not discouraged harry went after his bag the next day and found it with about ten pounds of leaves in it then for a week or two he and his sister worked hard and sometimes gathered as much as twentyfive pounds of leaves in a day but they had their bad days when there was a great deal of walking and very little picking  and then in due course of time school began and the sumac season was at an end for the leaves are not merchantable after they begin to turn red although they are then a great deal prettier to look at  but then harry went out early in the morning and on saturdays and shot hares and partridges and kate began to sell her chickens of which she had twentyseven eighteen died natural deaths or were killed by weasels during the summer they found that they made more money than they could have made by sumac gathering  its a good deal for you two to do for that old woman said captain caseby one day  but didnt we promise to do it said miss kate bravely wed do twice as much if there were two of her  it was very fortunate however that there were not two of her  sometimes they had extraordinary luck early one november morning harry was out in the woods and caught sight of a fat wildturkey  bangone dollar  that was enough to keep aunt matilda for a week  at least it ought to have kept her but there was something wrong somewhere every week it cost more and more to keep the old colored woman in what harry called eating material  her appetite must be increasing said harry shes eaten two pecks of meal this week  i dont believe it said kate she couldnt do it i believe she has company  and this turned out to be true  on inquiry they found that uncle braddock was in the habit of taking his meals with aunt matilda sometimes three times a day now uncle braddock had a home of his own where he could get his meals if he chose to go after them and harry remonstrated with him on his conduct  why ye see mahsr harry said the old man shes so drefful lonesome down dar all by sheself and sometimes its arainin an a long way fur me to go home and git me wrapper all wet jist fur one little meal o wittles and when i see what you all is adoin fur her i feels dat i oughter try and do somethin fur her too as long as i kin an i cant expect to go about much longer mahsr harry de ole wrappers pretty nigh gin out  i dont mind your taking your meals there now and then said harry but i dont want you to live there we cant afford it  all right mahsr harry said uncle braddock and after that he never came to aunt matildas to meals more than five or six times a week  and now christmas always a great holiday with the negroes of the south was approaching and harry and kate determined to try and give aunt matilda extra good living during christmas week and to let her have company every day if she wanted it  harry had a pig he got it in the spring when it was very small and when its little tail was scarcely long enough to curl there was a story about his getting this pig  he and some other boys had been out walking and several dogs went along with them the dogs chased a cata beautiful smooth cat that belonged to old mr truly matthews the cat put off at the top of her speed which was a good deal better than any speed the dogs could show and darted up a tree right in front of her masters house the dogs surrounded the tree and barked as if they expected to bark the tree down one little fuzzy dog with short legs and hair all over his eyes actually jumped into a low crotch and the boys thought he was going to try to climb the tree if he had ever reached the cat he would have been very sorry he had not stayed at home for she was a good deal bigger than he was harry and his friends endeavored to drive the dogs away from the tree but it was of no use even kicks and blows only made them bark the more directly out rushed mr truly matthews as angry as he could be he shouted and scolded at the boys for setting their dogs on his cat and then he kicked the dogs out of his yard in less time than you could count seventytwo he was very angry indeed and talked about the shocking conduct of the boys to everybody in the village he would listen to no explanations or excuses  harry was extremely sorry that mr matthews was so incensed against him especially as he knew there was no cause for it and he was talking about it to kate one day when she exclaimed  ill tell you what will be sure to pacify mr matthews harry he has a lot of little pigs that he wants to sell just you go and buy one of them and see if he isnt as goodnatured as ever when he sees your money  harry took the advice he had a couple of dollars and with them he bought a little pig the smallest of the lot and mr matthews who was very much afraid he could not find purchasers for all his pigs was as completely pacified as kate thought he would be  harry took his property home and all through the summer and fall the little pig ran about the yard and the fields and the woods and ate acornsand sweet potatoes and turnips when he could get a chance to root them up with his funny little twitchy noseand grunted and slept in the sun and about the middle of december he had grown so big that harry sold him for eleven dollars here was quite a capital for christmas  i cant afford to spend it all on aunt matilda said harry to his mother and kate for i have other things to do with my money but shes bound to have a good christmas and well make her a present besides  kate was delighted with his idea and immediately began to suggest all sorts of things for the present if harry chose to buy anything that she could make up she would go right to work at it but harry could not think of anything that would suit exactly and neither could kate nor their mother and when mr loudon was taken into council at dinnertime he could suggest nothing but an army blanketwhich suggestion met with no favor at all  at last mr loudon advised that they should ask aunt matilda what she would like to have for a present  theres no better way of suiting her than that said he  so harry and kate went down to the old womans cabin that afternoon after school and asked her  aunt matilda did not hesitate an instant  ef you chilen is really agoin to give me a present there aint nothin id rather have than a chrismis tree  a christmas tree cried harry and kate both bursting out laughing  yes indeed chilen ef ye give me anything give me a good big fiery chrismis tree like you all had year fore las  two years before harry and kate had had their last christmas tree there were no younger children and these two were now considered to have outgrown that method of celebrating christmas but they had missed their tree last yearmissed it very much  and now aunt matilda wanted one it was the very thing  hurrah cried harry you shall have it hurrah for aunt matildas christmas tree  hurrah cried kate wont it be splendid hurrah  hurrah said uncle braddock who was just coming up to the cabin door but he did not shout very loud and nobody heard him  hurrah i wonder what deys all hurrahin about he said to himself  harry and kate had started off to run home with the news but aunt matilda told the old man all about it and when he heard there was to be a christmas tree he was just as glad as anybody  when it became generally known that aunt matilda was to have a christmas tree the people of the neighborhood took a great interest in the matter john walker and dick ford two colored men of the vicinity volunteered to get the tree but when they went out into the woods to cut it eighteen other colored people big and little followed them some to help and some to give advice  a very fine tree was selected it was a pine ten feet high and when they brought it into aunt matildas cabin they could not stand it upright for her ceiling was rather low  when harry and kate came home from school they were rather surprised to see so big a tree but it was such a fine one that they thought they must have it after some consideration it was determined to erect it in a deserted cabin near by which had no upper floor and was high enough to allow the tree to stand up satisfactorily this was indeed an excellent arrangement for it was better to keep the decoration of the christmas tree a secret from aunt matilda until all was completed  the next day was a holiday and harry and kate went earnestly to work a hole was dug in the clay floor of the old cabin and the tree planted firmly therein it was very firm indeed for a little colored boy named josephines bobby climbed nearly to the topmost branch without shaking it very much for four or five days the work of decorating the tree went on everybody talked about it a great many laughed at it and nearly everybody seemed inclined to give something to hang upon its branches kate brought a large box containing the decorations of her last christmas tree and she and harry hung sparkling balls and golden stars and silver fishes and red and blue paper angels and candy swans and sugar pears and glittering things of all sorts shapes and sizes upon the boughs harry had a stepladder and dick ford and five colored boys held it firmly while he stood on it and tied on the ornaments very soon the neighbors began to send in their contributions mrs loudon gave a stout woollen dress which was draped over a lower branch while mr loudon who was not to be diverted from his original idea sent an army blanket which kate arranged around the root of the tree so as to look as much as possible like gray moss mr darby who kept the store sent a large paper bag of sugar and a small bag of tea which were carefully hung on lower branches miss jane davis thought she ought to do something and she contributed a peck of sweet potatoes which each tied to a string were soon dangling from the branches then mr truly matthews who did not wish to be behind his neighbors in generosity sent a shoulder of bacon which looked quite magnificent as it hung about the middle of the tree other people sent bars of soap bags of meal packages of smokingtobacco and flannel petticoats a pair of shoes was contributed and several pairs of stockings which latter were filled with apples and hickorynuts by the considerate kate several of the school children gave sticks of candy and old mrs sarah page who had nothing else to spare brought a jug of molasses which was suspended near the top of the tree kate did not fancy the appearance of the jug and she wreathed it with strings of glittering glass balls and the shoulder of bacon she stuck full of red berries and hollyleaves harry contributed a bright red handkerchief for aunt matildas head and kate gave a shawl which was yellower than a sunflower if such a thing could be and harry bore the general expenses of the extras which were not trifling  when christmas eve arrived everybody came to see aunt matildas christmas tree kate and harry were inside superintending the final arrangements and about fifty or sixty persons colored and white were gathered around the closed door of the old cabin when all was ready aunt matilda made her appearance supported on either side by dick ford and john walker while uncle braddock in his manycolored dressinggown followed close behind then the door was opened and aunt matilda entered followed by as many of the crowd as could get in it was certainly a scene of splendor a wood fire blazed in the fireplace at one end of the cabin while dozens of tallow candles lighted up the tree the gold and silver stars glistened the manycolored glass balls shone among the green pine boughs the shoulder of bacon glowed like a bed of flowers while the jug of molasses hung calm and serene surrounded by its glittering beads a universal buzz of approbation and delight arose no one had ever seen such a christmas tree before every bough and every branch bore something useful as well as ornamental  as for aunt matilda for several moments she remained speechless with delight at last she exclaimed  lawsamassey its wuth while being good for ninetyfive years to git such a tree at las     chapter viii  a lively team   i want you to understand harry said mr loudon one day that i do not disapprove of what you and kate are doing for old aunt matilda on the contrary i feel proud of you both the idea was honorable to you and so far you have done very well better than i expected and i believe i was a little more sanguine than any one else in the village but you must not forget that you have something else to think of besides making money for aunt matilda  but dont i think of other things father said harry im sure i get along well enough at school  that may be my boy but i want you to get along better than well enough  this little conversation made quite an impression on harry and he talked to kate about it  i suppose fathers right said she but whats to be done about it is that poor old woman to have only half enough to eat so that you may read twice as much virgil  harry laughed  but perhaps she will have fiveeighths of enough to eat if i only read ninesixteenths as much latin said he  oh youre always poking arithmetic fun at me said kate but i tell you what you can do she continued you can get up half an hour earlier every morning and that will give you a good deal of extra time to think about your lessons  i can think about them in bed said harry  humph said kate and she went on with her work she was knitting a tidy worth two pounds of sugar or half a pound of tea when it should be finished  harry did not get up any earlier for as he expressed it it was dreadfully cold before breakfast on those january mornings but his father and mother noticed that the subject of aunt matildas maintenance did not so entirely engross the conversation of the brother and sister in the evenings and they had their heads together almost as often over slate and schoolbooks as over the little accountbook in which kate put down receipts and expenditures  on a thursday night about the middle of january there was a fall of snow not a very heavy fall the snow might have been deeper but it was deep enough for sledding on the friday harry in connection with another boy tom selden several years older than himself concocted a grand scheme they would haul wood on a sled all day saturday  it was not to be any trifling little boyplay woodhauling harrys father owned a woodsledone of the very few sleds or sleighs in the countywhich was quite an imposing affair as to size at least it was about eight feet long and four feet wide and although it was rough enoughbeing made of heavy boards nailed transversely upon a couple of solid runners with upright poles to keep the load in its placeit was a very good sled as far as it went which had not been very far of late for there had been no good sledding for several seasons old mr truly matthews had a large pile of wood cut in a forest about a mile and a half from the village and the boys knew that he wanted it hauled to the house and that by a good days work considerable money could be made  all the arrangements were concluded on friday which was a halfholiday on account of the snow making travelling unpleasant for those scholars who lived at a distance harrys father gave his consent to the plan and loaned his sled three negro men agreed to help for onefourth of the profits tom selden went into the affair heart and hand agreeing to take his share out in fun what money was made after paying expenses was to go into the aunt matilda fund which was tolerably low about that time  kate gave her earnest sanction to the scheme which was quite disinterested on her part for being a girl she could not very well go on a woodhauling expedition and she could expect to do little else but stay at home and calculate the probable profits of the trips  the only difficulty was to procure a team and nothing less than a fourhorse team would satisfy the boys  mr loudon lent one horse old selim a big brown fellow who was very good at pulling when he felt in the humor tom could bring no horse for his father did not care to lend his horses for such a purpose he was afraid they might get their legs broken and strange as it seemed to the boys most of the neighbors appeared to have similar notions horses were very hard to borrow that friday afternoon but a negro man named isaac waddell agreed to hire them his horse hector for fifty cents for the day and the storekeeper after much persuasion lent a big gray mule grits by name there was another mule in the village which the boys could have if they wanted her but they did not want herthat is if they could get anything else with four legs that would do to go in their team this was polly a little mule belonging to mrs dabney who kept the postoffice polly was not only very little in size but she was also very little given to going she did not particularly object to a walk if it were not too long and would pull a buggy or carry a man with great complacency but she seldom indulged in trotting it was of no use to whip her her skin was so thick or so destitute of feeling that she did not seem to take any notice of a good hard crack polly was not a favorite but she doubtless had her merits although no one knew exactly what they were perhaps the best thing that could be said about her was that she did not take up much room  but on saturday it was evident that polly would have to be taken for no animal could be obtained in her place  so soon after breakfast the team was collected in mr loudons backyard and harnessed to the sled besides the three negroes who had been hired there were seven volunteerssome big and some littlewho were very willing to work for nothing if they might have a ride on the sled the harness was not the best in the world some of it was leather and some was rope and some was chain it was gathered together from various quarters like the teamnobody seemed anxious to lend good harness  grits and thin hector were the leaders and polly and old selim were the polehorses so to speak  when all the straps were buckled and the chains hooked and the knots tied and this took a good while as there were only twelve men and boys to do it dick ford jumped on old selim little johnny sand as black as ink was hoisted on grits and gregory montague a tall yellow boy with high boots and no toes to them bestrode thin hector harry tom and nine negroes two more had just come into the yard jumped on the sled dick ford cracked his whip kate stood on the backdoor step and clapped her hands all the darkies shouted tom and harry hurrahed and away they did not go  polly was not ready  and what was more old brown selim was perfectly willing to wait for her he looked around mildly at the little mule as if he would say now dont be in a hurry my good polly be sure youre right before you go ahead  polly was quite sure she was not right and stood as stiffly as if she had been frozen to the ground and all the cracking of whips and shouting of git up go long what do you mean dar you polly made no impression on her  then harry made his voice heard above the hubbub  never mind polly he shouted let her alone dick and you other fellows just start off your own horses now then get up all of you  at this every rider whipped up his horse or his mule and spurred him with his heels and every darkey shouted hi dar and off they went rattledybang  polly went too there was never such an astonished little mule in this world out of the gate they all whirled at full gallop and up the road tearing along negroes shouting chains rattling snow flying back from sixteen pounding hoofs sled cutting through the snow like a ship at sea and a little darkey shooting out behind at every bounce over a rough place  hurrah cried harry holding tight to an upright pole isnt this splendid  splendid its glorious shouted tom its better than being a pi and down he went on his knees as the big sled banged over a stone in the road and josephines bobby was bounced out into a snowdrift under a fence  whether tom intended to say a pirate or a pyrotechnic was never discovered but in six minutes there was only one of the small darkies left on the sled the men and this one john william webster hung on to the poles as if they were glued there  as for polly she was carried along faster than she ever went before in her life she jumped she skipped she galloped she slid she skated sometimes sitting down and sometimes on her feet but flying along all the same no matter how she chose to go  and so rattling shouting banging bouncing snow flying and whips cracking on they sped until john william websters pole came out and clip he went heels over head into the snow  but john william had a soul above tumbles in an instant he jerked himself up to his feet dropped the pole and dashed after the sled  swiftly onward went the sled and right behind came john william his legs working like steamboat wheels his white teeth shining and his big eyes sparkling  there was no stopping the sled but there was no stopping john william either and in less than two minutes he reached the sled grabbed a man by the leg and tugged and pulled until he seated himself on the end board  i tole yer so said he when he got his breath and yet he hadnt told anybody anything  and now the woods were reached and after a deal of pulling and shouting the team was brought to a halt and then slowly led through a short road to where the wood was piled  the big mule and the horses steamed and puffed a little but polly stood as calm as a rockinghorse  notwithstanding the rapidity of the drive it was late when the party reached the woods the gathering together and harnessing of the team had taken much longer than they expected and so the boys set to work with a will to load the sled for they wanted to make two trips that morning but although they all black and white worked hard it was slow business some of the wood was cut and split properly and some was not and then the sled had to be turned around and there was but little room to do it in and so a good deal of time was lost  but at last the sled was loaded up and they were nearly ready to start when john william webster who had run out to the main road set up a shout  oh mahsr harry mahsr tom  harry and tom ran out to the road and stood there petrified with astonishment  where was the snow  it was all gone excepting a little here and there in the shade of the fence corners the day had turned out to be quite mild and the sun which was now nearly at its noon height had melted it all away  here was a most unlookedfor state of affairs what was to be done the boys ran back to the sled and the colored men ran out to the road and everybody talked and nobody seemed to say anything of use  at last dick ford spoke up  i tell ye what mahsr harry i say just lets go long said he  but how are you going to do it said harry theres no snow  i know that but de muds jist as slippery as grease that thar team kin pull it easy nuff  harry and tom consulted together and agreed to drive out to the road and try what could be done and then if the loaded sled was too much for the team they would throw off the wood and go home with the empty sled  there was snow enough until they reached the roadfor very little had melted in the woodsand when they got fairly out on the main road the team did not seem to mind the change from snow to thin mud  the load was not a very heavy one and there were two horses and two mulesa pretty strong team  polly did very well she was now harnessed with grits in the lead and she pulled along bravely but it was slow work compared to the lively ride over the snow the boys and the men trudged through the mud by the side of the sled and looking at it in the best possible light it was a very dull way to haul wood the boys agreed that after this trip they would be very careful not to go on another mudsledding expedition  but soon they came to a long hill and going down this the team began to trot and harry and tom and one or two of the men jumped on the edges of the sled outside of the load holding on to the poles then grits the big mule began to run and gregory couldnt hold him in and old selim and thin hector and little polly all struck out on a gallop and away they went bumping and thumping down the hill  and then stick after stick two sticks six sticks a dozen sticks at a time slipped out behind  it was of no use to catch at them to hold them on they were not fastened down in any way and harry and tom and the men on the sled had as much as they could do to hold themselves on  when they reached the bottom of the hill the pulling became harder but grits had no idea of stopping for that he was bound for home and so he plunged on at the top of his speed but the rest of the team did not fancy going so fast on level ground and they slackened their pace  this did not suit grits he gave one tremendous bound burst loose from his harness and dashed ahead up went his hind legs in the air off shot gregory montague into the mud and then away went grits clippertyclap home to his stable  when harry and tom the two horses the little mule the eight colored men the sled john william webster and eleven logs of wood reached the village it was considerably after dinnertime  when the horsehire was paid and something was expended for mending borrowed harness and the negroes had received a little present for their labor the aunt matilda fund was diminished by the sum of three dollars and eighty cents  mr truly matthews agreed to say nothing about the loss of his wood that was scattered along the road     chapter ix  business in earnest   although harry did not find his woodhauling speculation very profitable it was really of advantage to him for it gave him an idea  and his idea was a very good one he saw clearly enough that money could be made by hauling wood and he was also quite certain that it would never do for him to take his time especially during school term for that purpose so after consultation with his father and after a great deal of figuring by kate he determined to go into the business in a regular way  about five miles from the village was a railroad station and it was also a wood station here the railroad company paid two dollars a cord for wood delivered on their grounds  two miles from the station on the other side of crooked creek harrys father owned a large tract of forest land and here harry received permission to cut and take away all the wood that he wanted mr loudon was perfectly willing in this way to help his children in their good work  so harry made arrangements with dick ford and john walker who were not regularly hired to any one that winter to cut and haul his wood for him on shares john walker had a wagon which was merely a set of wheels with a board floor laid on the axletrees and the use of this he contributed in consideration of a little larger share in the profits harry hired grits and another mule at a low rate as there was not much for mules to do at that time of the year  the men were to cut up and deliver the wood and get receipts for it from the stationmaster and it was to be harrys business to collect the money at stated times and divide the proceeds according to the rate agreed upon harry and his father made the necessary arrangements with the stationmaster and thus all the preliminaries were settled quite satisfactorily  in a few days the negroes were at work and as they both lived but a short distance from the creek on the village side it was quite convenient for them john walker had a stable in which to keep the mules and the cost of their feed was also to be added to his share of the profits  in a short time harry had quite a number of applications from negroes who wished to cut wood for him but he declined to hire any additional force until he saw how his speculation would turn out  old uncle braddock pleaded hard to be employed he could not cut wood nor could he drive a team but he was sure he would be of great use as overseer  you see mahsr harry he said i lib right on de outside edge ob you pas woods and i kin go ober dar jist as easy as nuffin early every mornin and see dat dem boys does dere work and dont chop down de wrong trees mind now i tell ye you all will make a pile o money ef ye jist hire me to obersee dem boys  for some time harry resisted his entreaties but at last principally on account of kates argument that the old man ought to be encouraged in making something toward his living if he were able and willing to do so harry hired him on his own terms which were ten cents a day  about four oclock every afternoon during his engagement uncle braddock made his appearance in the village to demand his ten cents when harry remonstrated with him on his quitting work so early he said  why you see mahsr harry its a long way from dem woods here and i got to go all de way back home agin and it gits dark mighty early dese short days  in about a week the old man came to hurry and declared that he must throw up his engagement  whats the matter asked harry  im gwine to gib up dat job mahsr harry  but why you wanted it bad enough said harry  but im gwine to gib it up now said the old man  well i want you to tell me your reasons for giving it up persisted harry  uncle braddock stood silent for a few minutes and then he said  well mahsr harry dis is jist de truf dem ar boys dey ses to me dat ef i come foolin around dere any more deyd jist chop me up ole wrapper an all and haul me off fur kindlin wood dey say i was dry enough an dey neednt a made sich a fuss about it fur i didnt trouble em much hardly eber went nigh em ten cents worf o oberseein aint agwine to hurt nobody  well uncle braddock said harry laughing i think youre wise to give it up  dats so said the old negro and away he trudged to aunt matildas cabin where no doubt he ate a very good ten cents worth of cornmeal and bacon  this wood enterprise of harrys worked pretty well on the whole sometimes the men cut and hauled quite steadily and sometimes they did not once every two weeks harry rode over to the station and collected what was due him and his share of the profits kept aunt matilda quite comfortably  but although kate was debarred from any share in this business she worked every day at her tidies for the store and knit stockings besides for some of the neighbors who furnished the yarn and paid her a fair price there were people who thought mrs loudon did wrong in allowing her daughter to work for money in this way but kates mother said that the end justified the work and that so long as kate persevered in her selfappointed tasks she should not interfere  as for kate she said she should work on no matter how much money harry made there was no knowing what might happen  but the most important of kates duties was the personal attention she paid to aunt matilda she went over to the old womans cabin every day or two and saw that she was kept warm and had what she needed  and these visits had a good influence on the old woman for her cabin soon began to look much neater now that a nice little girl came to see her so often  when the spring came on aunt matilda actually took it into her head to whitewash her cabin a thing she had not done for years she and uncle braddock worked at it by turns the old woman was too stiff and rheumatic to keep at such work long at a time but she was very proud of her whitewashing and when she was tired of working at the inside of her cabin she used to go out and whitewash the trunks of the trees around the house she had seen trees thus ornamented and she thought they were perfectly beautiful  kate was violently opposed to anything of this kind and at last told aunt matilda that if she persisted in surrounding her house with what looked like a forest of tombstones she kate would have to stop coming there  so aunt matilda in a manner desisted  but one day she noticed a little birchtree some distance from the house and the inclination to whitewash that little birch was too strong to be resisted  hes so near white anyway she said to herself dat its a pity not to finish him  so off she hobbled with a tin cup full of whitewash and a small brush to adorn the little birchtree leaving her cabin in the charge of holly thomas  holly whose whole name was hollywood cemetery thomas was a little black girl between two and five years old sometimes she seemed nearly five and sometimes not more than two her parents intended christening her minerva but hearing the name of the wellknown hollywood cemetery in richmond they thought it so pretty that they gave it to their little daughter without the slightest idea however that it was the name of a graveyard  holly had come over to pay a morning visit to aunt matilda and she had brought her only child a wooden doll which she was trying to teach to walk by dragging it head foremost by a long string tied around its neck  now den you holly you stay hyar and mind de house while is gone said aunt matilda as she departed  all yite said the little darkey and she sat down on the floor to prepare her child for a coat of whitewash but she had not yet succeeded in convincing the doll of the importance of the operation when her attention was aroused by a dog just outside of the door  it was kates little woolly white dog blinks who often used to come to the cabin with her and who sometimes when he got a chance to run away used to come alone as he did this morning  go way dar litty dog said miss holly yer cant come in deres nobody home yun long now dyer year  but blinks either did not hear or did not care for he stuck his head in at the door  go way dere shouted holly aunt tillum aint home go way now and tum bat in half an hour aunt tillumll be bat den dont yer hear now go way  but instead of going away blinks trotted in as bold as a fourpound lion  go way go way screamed holly squeezing herself up against the wall in her terror and then blinks barked at her he had never seen a little black girl behave so in the whole course of his life and it was quite right in him to bark and let her know what he thought of her conduct then holly in her fright dropped her doll and when blinks approached to examine it she screamed louder and louder and blinks barked more and more and there was quite a hubbub in the midst of it a man put his head in at the door of the cabin  he was a tall man with red hair and a red freckled face and a red bristling moustache and big red hands  whats all this noise about said he and when he saw what it was he came in  get out of this you little beast said he to blinks and putting the toe of his boot under the little dog he kicked him clear out of the door of the cabin then turning to holly he looked at her pretty much as if he intended to kick her out too but he didnt he put out one of his big red hands and said to her  shake hands  holly obeyed without a word and then snatching her wooden child from the floor she darted out of the door and reached the village almost as soon as poor blinks  in a minute or two aunt matilda made her appearance at the door she had heard the barking and the screaming and had come to see what was the matter  when she saw the man she exclaimed  why mahsr george is dat you  yes its me said the man shake hands aunt matilda  i thought you was down in mississippi mahsr george said the old woman and i thought you was gwine to stay dar  couldnt do it said the man it didnt suit me down there five years of it was enough for me  enough fur dem too praps said aunt matilda with a grim chuckle  the man took no notice of her remark but said  i didnt intend to stop here but i heard such a barking and screaming in your cabin that i turned out of my way to see what the row was about ive just come up from the railroad does old michaels keep store here yet  no he dont said aunt matilda hes dead mahsr darby keeps dar now  is that so cried the man why it was on old michaelss account that i was sneakin around the village why im mighty glad i stopped here it makes things different if old michaels isnt about  well ye might as well go long said aunt matilda who seemed to be getting into a bad humor theres others who knows jist as much about yer bad doins as mahsr michaels did  i suppose you mean that meddling humbug john loudon said the man  now look hyar you george mason cried aunt matilda making one long step toward the whitewash bucket jist you git out o dat dar door and she seized the whitewash brush and gave it a terrific swash in the bucket  the man looked at herhe knew her of oldand then he left the cabin almost as quickly as blinks and holly went out of it  ef it hadnt been fur dat little dog said aunt matilda grimly hed a gone on them little dogs is always adoin mischief     chapter x  a meeting on the road   some weeks before the little affair between blinks and holly related in our last chapter harry and kate took a ride over to the railroad station  during the winter harry had frequently gone over on horseback to attend to the payments for his wood and now that the roads were in fit condition for carriage travel he was glad to have an opportunity to take the buggy and give kate a ride  for some days previously crooked creek had been up that is the spring rains had caused it to overflow and all travel across it had been suspended the bridges on such occasionsand crooked creek had a bad habit of being up several times in the course of a yearwere covered and the lowlands were under water for a considerable distance on each side of the stream there were so few boats on the creek and the current in time of freshets was so strong that ferriage was seldom thought of in consequence of this state of affairs harry had not heard from his woodcutters for more than a week as they had not been able to cross the creek to their homes it was therefore as much to see how they were getting along as to attend to financial matters that he took this trip  it was a fine bright day in very early spring and old selim trotted on quite gayly before very long they overtook miles jackson jogging along on a little bay horse  miles was a black man very sober and sedate who for years had carried the mail twice a week from a station farther up the railroad to the village but he was not a mailcarrier now his employer a white man who had the contract for carrying the mails had also gone into another business which involved lettercarrying  a few miles back from the village of akeville where the loudons lived was a mica mine which had recently been bought and was now worked by a company from the north this mica the semitransparent substance that is set into stove doors proved to be very plentiful and valuable and the company had a great deal of business on their hands it was frequently necessary to send messages and letters to the north and these were always carried over to the station on the other side of crooked creek where there was a daily mail and a telegraph office the contract to carry these letters and messages to and from the mines had been given to miless employer and the steady negro man had been taken off the mailroute to attend to this new business  well miles said harry as he overtook him how do you like riding on this road  how d y mahsr harry how d y miss kate said the colored man touching his hat and riding up on the side of the road to let them pass i do know how i likes it yit mahsr harry dont seem xactly natral after ridin de oder road so long  you have a pretty big letterbag there said harry  dats so said miles but taint dis big ebery day sence de creeks been up i haint been able to git across and deres piles o letters to go ober today  it must make it rather bad for the company when the creek rises in this way said harry  dats so answered miles dey gits in a heap o trubble when dey cant send dere letters and git em though taint so many letters dey sends as telegraphs  its a pity they couldnt have had their mine on the other side remarked kate  dats so miss kate said miles gravely i reckon dey didnt know about de creeks gittin up so often or deyd dug dere mine on de oder side  harry and kate laughed and drove on  they soon reached mr loudons woods but found no woodcutters  when they arrived at the station they saw dick ford and john walker on the storeporch  harry soon discovered that no wood had been cut for several days because the creek was up  what had that to do with it asked harry  why you see mahsr harry said john walker de creek was mighty high and dere was no knowin how things ud turn out so we thought wed jist wait and see  so youve been here all the time  yes sir been hyar all de time couldnt go home you know  harry was very sorry to hear of this lost time for he knew that his woodcutting would come to an end as soon as the season was sufficiently advanced to give the men an opportunity of hiring themselves for farmwork but it was of no use to talk any more about it and so after depositing kate at the postoffice where the postmistress who knew her well gave her a nice little snack of buttermilk cold fried chicken and lightbread he went to the station and transacted his business he had not been there for some weeks and he found quite a satisfactory sum of money due him in spite of the holiday his men had taken he then arranged with dick and john to work on for a week or two longerif nothing happened and after attending to some commissions for the family he and kate set out for home  but nothing they had done that day was of so much importance as their meeting with miles tuned out to be     chapter xi  rob   blinks was not the only dog on the loudon place there was another one a much larger fellow named rob  rob was a big puppy in the first place and then he grew up to be a tall longlegged dog who was not only very fond of harry and kate but of almost everybody else in time he filled out and became rather more shapely but he was always an ungainly dogtoo big for his size as harry put it  it was supposed that rob was partly bloodhound but how much of him was bloodhound it would have been very difficult so say kate thought it was only his ears they resembled the ears of a picture of a beautiful african bloodhound that she had in a book at all events rob showed no signs of any fighting ancestry he was as gentle as a calf even blinks was a better watchdog but then rob was only a year old and he might improve in time  but in spite of his general inutility rob was a capital companion on a country ramble  and so it happened one bright day toward the close of april that he and harry and kate went out together into the woods beyond aunt matildas cabin kates objects in taking the walk were wild flowers and general spring investigations into the condition of the woods but harry had an eye to business although to hear him talk you would have supposed that he thought as much about ferns and flowers as kate did  harry had an idea that it might possibly be a good thing to hire negroes that year to pick sumac for him he was not certain that he could make it pay but it was on his mind to such a degree that he took a great interest in the sumacbushes and hunted about the edges of the woods where the bushes were generally found to see what was the prospect for a large crop of leaves that year  they were in the woods about a mile from aunt matildas cabin and not very far from a road when they separated for a short time harry went on ahead continuing his investigations while kate remained in a little open glade where she found some flowers that she determined to dig up by the roots and transplant into her garden at home  while she was at work she heard a heavy step behind her and looking up she saw a tall man standing by her he had red hair a red face a red bristling moustache and big red hands  how dye do said the man  kate stood up with the plants which she had just succeeded in getting out of the ground in her apron  good morning sir said she  the man looked at her from head to foot and then he said shake hands holding out his big red hand  but kate did not offer to take it  didnt you hear me said he i said shake hands  i heard you said kate  well why dont you do it then  kate did not answer and the man repeated his question  well then if i must tell you said she in the first place i dont know you and then id rather not shake hands with you anyway because your hands are so dirty  this might not have been very polite in kate but she was a straightforward girl and the mans hands were very dirty indeed although water was to be had in such abundance  whats your name said the man with his face considerably redder than before  kate loudon said the girl  oh ho loudon is it well kate loudon if my hands too dirty to shake youll find it isnt too dirty to box your ears  kate turned pale and shrank back against a tree she gave a hurried glance into the woods and then she called out as loudly as she could harry  the man who had made a step toward her now stopped and looked around as if he would like to know who harry was before going any further  just then harry who had heard kates call came running up  when the man saw him he seemed relieved and a curious smile stretched itself beneath his bristling red moustache  whats the matter cried harry  oh harry kate exclaimed as she ran to him  matter said the man the matters this im going to box her ears  whose ears  that girls replied the redfaced man moving toward kate  my sister not much  and harry stepped between kate and the man  the man stood and looked at him and he looked very angrily too  but harry stood bravely before his sister his face was flushed and his breath came quickly though he was not frightened not a whit  and yet there was absolutely nothing that he could do he had not his gun with him he had not even a stick in his hand and a stick would have been of little use against such a strong man as that who could have taken harry in his big red hands and have thrown him over the highest fence in the county  but for all that the boy stood boldly up before his sister  the man looked at him without a word and then he stepped aside toward a small dogwoodbush  for an instant harry thought that they might run away but it was only for an instant that longlegged man could catch them before they had gone a dozen yardsat least he could catch kate  the man took out a knife and cut a long and tolerably thick switch from the bush then he cut off the smaller end and began to trim away the twigs and leaves  while doing this he looked at harry and said  i think ill take you first  kates heart almost stopped beating when she heard this and harry turned pale but still the brave boy stood before his sister as stoutly as ever  kate tried to call for help but she had no voice what could she do a boxing on the ears was nothing she now thought she wished she had not called out for it was evident that harry was going to get a terrible whipping  she could not bear it her dear brother  she trembled so much that she could not stand and she sank down on her knees rob the dog who had been lying near by snapping at flies all this time now came up to comfort her  oh rob she whispered i wish you were a cross dog  and rob wagged his tail and lay down by her  i wonder she thought to herself oh i wonder if any one could make him bite  rob she whispered in the dogs ear keeping her eyes fixed on the man who had now nearly finished trimming his stick rob hisssss and she patted his back  rob seemed to listen very attentively  hissss she whispered again her heart beating quick and hard  rob now raised his head his big body began to quiver and the hair on his back gradually rose on end  hiss rob rob whispered kate  the man had shut up his knife and was putting it in his pocket he took the stick in his right hand  all now depended on rob  oh will he thought kate and then she sprang to her feet and clapped her hands  catch him rob she screamed catch him  with a rush rob hurled himself full at the breast of the man and the tall fellow went over backward just like a tenpin  then he was up and out into the road rob after him  you ought to have seen the gravel fly  harry and kate ran out into the road and cheered and shouted away went the man and away went the dog  up the road into the brush out again and then into a field down a hill nip and tuck at tom rileys fence rob got him by the leg but the trowsers were old and the piece came out and then the man dashed into rileys old tobacco barn and slammed the door almost on the dogs nose  rob ran around the house to see if there was an open window and finding none he went back to the door and lay down to wait  harry and kate ran home as fast as they could and after a while rob came too he had waited a reasonable time at the door of the barn but the man had not come out     chapter xii  tony on the warpath   she did it all said harry when they had told the tale to half the village on the storeporch  i exclaimed kate rob you mean  thats a good dog said mr darby the storekeeper whatll you take for him  not for sale said harry  robs all very well remarked tony kirk but it wont do to have a feller like that in the woods a frightnin the children id like to know who he is  just at this moment uncle braddock made his appearance hurrying along much faster than he usually walked with his eyes and teeth glistening in the sunshine  i seed him he cried as soon as he came up  whod you see cried several persons  oh i seed de dog after him and i come along as fas as i could but couldnt come very fas de ole wrapper cotch de wind  who was it asked tony  i seed him arunnin bress my soul de dog like to got him  but who was he uncle braddock said mr loudon who had just reached the store from his house where kate who had run home had told the story do you know him  know him reckon i does said uncle braddock an de dog ud a knowed him too ef hed a cotched him dats so mahsr john  well tell us his name if you know him said mr darby  ob course i knows him said uncle braddock ise done knowed him fur twenty or fifty years hes george mason  the announcement of this name caused quite a sensation in the party  i thought he was down in mississippi said one man  so he was i reckons said uncle braddock but hes done come back now ise seed him afore today and aunt matildas seed him too yah ha dat dere dog come mighty nigh cotchin him  george mason had been quite a noted character in that neighborhood five or six years before he belonged to a good family but was of a lawless disposition and was generally disliked by the decent people of the county just before he left for the extreme southern states it was discovered that he had been concerned in a series of horsethefts for which he would have been arrested had he not taken his departure from the state  few people excepting mr loudon and one or two others knew the extent of his misdemeanors and out of regard to his family these had not been made public but he had the reputation of being a wild disorderly man and now that it was known that he had contemplated boxing kate loudons ears and whipping harry the indignation was very great  harry and kate were favorites with everybodywhite and black  i tell ye what im goin to do said tony kirk im goin after that feller  at this half a dozen men offered to go along with tony  what will you do if you find him asked mr loudon  that depends on circumstances replied tony  i am willing to have you go said mr loudon who was a magistrate and a gentleman of much influence in the village on condition that if you find him you offer him no violence tell him to leave the county and say to him from me that if he is found here again he shall be arrested  all right said tony and he proceeded to make up his party  there were plenty of volunteers and for a while it was thought that uncle braddock intended to offer to go but if so he must have changed his mind for he soon left the village and went over to aunt matildas and had a good talk with her the old woman was furiously angry when she heard of the affair  i wish id been a little quicker she said and dere wouldnt a been a red spot on him  uncle braddock didnt know exactly what she meant but he wished so too  tony didnt want a large party he chose four men who could be depended upon and they started out that evening  it was evident that mason knew how to keep himself out of sight for he had been in the vicinity a week or moreas tony discovered after a visit to aunt matildaand no white person had seen him  but tony thought he knew the country quite as well as george mason did and he felt sure he should find him  his party searched the vicinity quite thoroughly that night starting from tom rileys tobacco barn but they saw nothing of their man and in the morning they made the discovery that mason had borrowed one of rileys horses without the knowledge of its owner and had gone off north of the mica mine some negroes had seen him riding away  so tony and his men took horses and rode away after him each of them carried his gun for they did not know in what company they might find mason a man who steals horses is generally considered especially in the country to be wicked enough to do anything  at a little place called jordans crossroads they were sure they had come upon him tom rileys horse was found at the blacksmiths shop at the crossroads and the blacksmith said that he had been left there to have a shoe put on and that the man who had ridden him had gone on over the fields toward a house on the edge of the woods about a mile away  so tony and his men rode up to within a halfmile of the house and then they dismounted tied their horses and proceeded on foot they kept as far as possible under cover of the tall weeds and bushes and hurried along silently and in single file tony in the lead thus they soon reached the house when they quietly surrounded it  but george mason played them a pretty trick     chapter xiii  cousin maria   after posting one of his men on each side of the house which stood on the edge of a field without any fence around it tony kirk stepped up to the front door and knocked the door was quickly opened by a woman  why cousin maria said tony is this you  certainly its me anthony said the woman who else should it be  cousin maria was a tall woman dressed in black she had gray hair and wore spectacles she seemed very glad to see tony and shook hands with him warmly  i didnt know you lived here said tony  well i dont live here exactly said cousin maria but come in and sit awhile youve been ahuntin have you  well yes said tony i am ahuntin  without mentioning that he had some friends outside tony went in and sat down to talk with cousin maria the man in front of the house had stepped to one side when the door opened and the others were out of sight of course  tony entered a small sittingroom into which the front door opened and took a seat by cousin maria  you see said she old billy simpson let this house fur a hundred dollarstheres eighty acres with itto sarah ann hemphill and her husband and hes gone to richmond to git stock for a wheelwrights shop thats his trade you know and theyre goin to have the shop over there in the wagonhouse that can be fixed up easy enough ef sam hemphill chooses to work at it which i dont believe he will but he can work ef he will and this is just the place for a wheelwrights shop ef the right man goes into the business and they sold their two cowskeeping only the redandwhite heifer i guess you remember that heifer they got her of old joe sanders on the creek and they sold one of their horsesthe sorreland a mule they hadnt no use fur em here fur the lands not worth much and hasnt seen no guano nor nothin fur three or four years and the money they got was enough to start a mighty good coopershop ef sam dont spend it all or most of it in richmond which i think he will and of course he being away sarah ann wanted to go to her mothers and she got herself ready and took them four childrenand i pity the old lady fur sams children never had no bringin up i disremember how old tommy is but it isnt over eight and just as noisy as ef he wasnt the oldest and so i come here to take care of the place but i cant stay no longer than tuesday fortnight as i told sarah ann fur ive got to go to betsey croppers then to help her with her spinnin and theres my own thingsseven pounds of wool to spin fur truly mattherses people besides two bushel baskets easy of carpetrags to sew and i want em done by the time miss jane gits her loom empty or ill git no weavin done this year and what do you think ive had another visitor today and your comin right afterwards kind o struck me as mighty queer both bein akeville people so to speak tho its been a long day since hes been there and youll never guess who it was fur it was george mason  and she stopped and wiped her face with her calico apron  so george mason was here was he said tony where is he now  oh hes gone replied cousin maria it wasnt more n ten or fifteen minutes before you came in and he was asittin here talking about ole timeshes rougher than he was guess he didnt learn no good down there in mississippiwhen all ov a sudden he got up an took his hat and walked off well that was jist like george mason he never had much manners and would always just as soon go off without biddin a body goodby as not  you didnt notice which way he went did you asked tony  yes i did said cousin maria he went out o the back door and along the edge of the woods and he was soon out of sight fur george has got long legs as you well know and the last i saw of him was just out there by that fence and if there isnt jim anderson come in jim what are you doin standin out there  so she went to the window to call jim anderson and tony stepped to the door and whistled for the other men so that when cousin maria came to the door she saw not only jim anderson but thomas campbell and captain bob winters and doctor prices son brinsley  well upon my word an honor said cousin maria lifting up both her hands  come along boys said tony starting off toward the woods weve got no time to lose goodby cousin maria  goodby cousin maria said each of the other men as the party hurried away  cousin maria did not answer a word she sat right down on the doorstep and took off her spectacles she rubbed them with her apron and then put them on again but there was no mistake there were the men if she had seen four ghosts she could not have been more astonished  tony did not for a moment doubt cousin marias word when she told him that george mason had gone away she never told a lie the only trouble with her was that she told too much truth  in about an hour and a half the five men returned to the place where they had left their horses they had found no trace of george mason  when they reached the clump of trees there were no horses there  they looked at each other with blank faces  hes got our horses said jim anderson when his consternation allowed him to speak  yes said tony and sarved us right we oughter left one man here to take care uv em knowin george mason as we do  i had an idea said dr prices son brinsley that we should have done something of that kind  idees aint no good said tony with a grunt as he marched off toward the blacksmiths shop at jordans crossroads  the blacksmith had seen nothing of mason or the horses but tom rileys horse was still there and as the members of the party were all well known to the blacksmith he allowed them to take the animal to its owner so the five men rode the one horse back to akeville not all riding at once but one at a time     chapter xiv  harrys grand scheme   this wholesale appropriation of horses caused of course a great commotion in the vicinity of akeville and half the male population turned out the next day in search of george mason and the five horses  even harry was infected with the general excitement and mounted on old selim he rode away after dinner there was no school that afternoon to see if he could find any one who had heard anything there ought to be news for the men had been away all the morning  about two miles from the village the road on which harry was riding forked and not knowing that the party which had started off in that direction had taken the road which ran to the northeast as being the direction in which a man would probably go if he wanted to get away safely with five stolen horses harry kept straight on  the road was lonely and uninteresting on one side was a wood of oldfield pinespines of recent growth and little value that spring up on the old abandoned tobacco fieldsand on the other a stretch of underbrush with here and there a tree of tolerable size but from which almost all the valuable timber had been cut  selim was inclined to take things leisurely and harry gradually allowed him to slacken his pace into a walk and even occasionally to stop and lower his head to take a bite from some particularly tempting bunch of grass by the side of the road  the fact was harry was thinking he had entirely forgotten the five horses and everything concerning them and was deeply cogitating a plan which in an exceedingly crude shape had been in his mind ever since he had met old miles on the road to the railroad  what he wished to devise was some good plan to prevent the interruption so often caused by the rising of crooked creek of communication between the mica mine belonging to the new york company and the station at hetertown  if he could do this he thought he could make some money by it and it was as we all know very necessary for him or at least for aunt matilda that he should make money  it was of no use to think of a bridge there were bridges already and when the creek was up you could scarcely see them  a bridge that would be high enough and long enough would be very costly and it would be an undertaking with which harry could not concern himself no matter what it might cost  a ferry was unadvisable for the stream was too rapid and dangerous in time of freshets  there was nothing that was really reliable and worthy of being seriously thought of but a telegraph line this harry believed to be feasible  he did not think it would cost very much if this telegraph line only extended across the creek not more than half a mile of wire at the utmost would be required  nothing need be expended for poles as there were tall pinetrees on each side of the creek that would support the wire and there were two cabins conveniently situated in which the instruments could be placed  harry had thoroughly considered all these matters having been down to the creek several times on purpose to take observations  the procuring of the telegraphic instruments however and the necessity of having an operator on the other side presented difficulties not easy to surmount  but harry did not despair  to be sure the machines would cost money and so would the wire insulators etc but then the mica company would surely be willing to pay a good price to have their messages transmitted at times when otherwise they would have to send a man twenty miles to a telegraphic station  so if the money could be raised it would pay to do itat least if the calculations with which harry and kate had been busy for days should prove to be correct  about the operator on the other side harry scarcely knew what to think if it were necessary to hire any one that would eat terribly into the profits  something economical must be devised for this part of the plan  as to the operator on the akeville side of the creek harry intended to fill that position himself he had been interested in telegraphy for a year or two he understood the philosophy of the system and had had the opportunity afforded him by the operator at hetertown of learning to send messages and to read telegraphic hieroglyphics he could not understand what words had come over the wires simply by listening to the clicking of the instrumentan accomplishment of all expert telegraphersbut he thought he could do quite well enough if he could read the marks on the paper slips and there was no knowing to what proficiency he might arrive in time  of course he had no money to buy telegraphic apparatus wire etc etc but he thought he could get it how does any one build railroads or telegraphic lines he had said to kate do they take the money out of their own pockets  kate had answered that she did not suppose they did unless the money was there and harry had told her very confidently that the money was never there no man or at least very few men could afford to construct a railroad or telegraph line the way these things were done was by forming a company  and this was just what harry proposed to do  it was of course quite difficult to determine just how large a company this should be if it were composed of too many members the profits which would be limited owing to the peculiar circumstances of the case would not amount to much for each stockholder and yet there must be members enough to furnish money enough  and more than that a contract must be made with the micamine people so that the business should not be diverted from harrys company into any outside channels  all these things occupied harrys mind and it is no wonder that he hardly looked up when selim stopped the horse had been walking so slowly that stopping did not seem to make much difference  but when he heard a voice call out oh mahsr harry ise mighty glad to see yer he looked up quickly enough  and there was old uncle braddock on horseback  harry could scarcely believe his eyes  and what was more astonishing the old negro had no less than four other horses with him that he was leading or rather trying to lead out of a road through the oldfield pines that here joined the main road  why whats the meaning of this cried harry where did you get those horses uncle braddock  and then without waiting for an answer harry burst out laughing such a ridiculous sight was enough to make anybody laugh  uncle braddock sat on the foremost horse his legs drawn up as if he were sitting on a chair and a low one at that for he had been gradually shortening the stirrups for the last hour hoping in that way to get a firmer seat his long stick was in one hand his old hat was jammed down tightly over his eyes and his dressinggown floated in the wind like a ragbag out for a holiday  oh ise mighty glad to see yer mahsr harry said he pulling at his horses bridle in such a way as to make him nearly run into selim and harry who however managed to avoid him and the rest of the cavalcade by moving off to the other side of the road  i was jist athinkin uv gittin off and lettin em go long they own seves i never seed sich hosses fur twistin up and pullin crooked i spected to have my neck broke mor n a dozen times i never was so disgruntled in all my born days mahsr harry whoa dar you yaller hoss wont you take ahole mahsr harry afore deyre de death uv me  the old man had certainly got the horses into a mixedup condition one of them was beside the horse he rode two were behind and one was wedged in partly in front of these in such a way that he had to travel sidewise the bridle of one horse was tied to that of another so that uncle braddock led them all by the bridle of the horse by his side this was tied to his long cane which he grasped firmly in his left hand  harry jumped down from selim and tying him to the fence went over to the assistance of uncle braddock as he was quite familiar with horses harry soon arranged matters on a more satisfactory footing he disentangled the animals two of which he proposed to take charge of himself and then after making uncle braddock lengthen his stirrups and lead both his horses on one side of him he fastened the other two horses side by side mounted selim and started back for akeville followed by uncle braddock and his reduced cavalcade  the old negro was profuse in his thanks but in the middle of his protestations of satisfaction harry suddenly interrupted him  why look here uncle braddock where did you get these horses these are the horses george mason stole  to be sure they is said uncle braddock what would i be adoin wid em ef they wasnt  but how did you get them tell me about it said harry checking the impatient selim who now that his head was turned homeward was anxious to go on with as much expedition as possible under the circumstances  why ye see mahsr harry said the old man i was up at miss marias she said shed gi me some pieces of caliker to mend me wrapper i put em in me pocket but i spects theys blowed out and when i was acomin away fru de woods right dar whar ole elick potts used to hab his cabinreckon you nebber seed dat cabin it was all tumbled down fore you was bornright dar in de clarin i seed five horses all tied to de trees lors a massy i said to mesef is de war come agin fur i nebber seed so many hosses in de woods sence de war an den while i was alookin roun fur a tree big enough to git behind wrapper an all out comes mahsr george mason from a bush an he hollers hello uncle braddock you come ahere an then he says you aint much uncle braddock but i guess youll do an i says dont believe ill do mahsr george fur you know i cant march an i nebber could shoot none an i got de rheumertiz in both me legs and me back and no jintwater in me kneesyou cant make no soldier out er me mahsr george and then he laughed an says you would make a pretty soldier dats true uncle braddock but i dont want no soldiers what i want you to do is to take these horses home to where says i to akeville says mahsr george an he didnt say much more neither for he jist tied dem horses all together and led em out into a little road dat goes fru de woods dar an he put me on de head horse an he says now go long uncle braddock an ef anything happens to dem hosses youll have to go to jail fur it so look out an bress your soul mahsr harry i did have to look out fur sich a drefful time as i did have specially wid dat yaller hoss i nebber did see     chapter xv  the council   when harrys mother heard that he had gone off to try and meet the horsehunters she was quite anxious about him  but mr loudon laughed at her fears  if there had been the slightest danger he said of course i would not have allowed him to go but i was glad he wanted to go a youngster of his age ought to have a disposition to see what is going on and to take part too for that matter i had much rather find it necessary to restrain harry than to push him you mustnt want to make a girl of him you would only spoil the boy and make a very poor girl  mrs loudon made no reply she thought her husband was a very wise man but she took up her key basket and went off to the pantry with an air that indicated that she had ideas of her own upon the subject in question  kate had no fears for harry she had unbounded faith in his good sense and his bravery if he should happen to get into danger  the fact is she was quite a brave girl herself and brave people are very apt to think their friends as courageous as themselves  when harry and uncle braddock reached the village they found several of the older inhabitants on the store porch and they met with an enthusiastic reception  and when later in the afternoon most of the men who had gone out after george mason returned from their unsuccessful expedition the discussion in regard to masons strange proceeding grew very animated some thought he had only intended to play a trick others that he had been unable to get away with the horses as he had hoped to do when he had taken them  but nobody knew anything about the matter excepting george mason himself and he was not there to give the village any information  as for harry he did not stay long to hear the discussions at the store  his mind was full of a much more important matter and he ran off to find kate he wanted to talk over his latest impressions with her  when he reached the house where his appearance greatly tranquillized his mothers mind he found kate in the yard under the big catalpatrees always a favorite place of resort in fine weather  oh harry she cried when she saw him did they find the horses  no said harry they didnt find them  oh what a pity and some of them were borrowed horses tony kirk had captain casebys mudcolored horse i dont know what the captain will do without him  oh the captain will do very well said harry  but he cant do very well persisted kate its the only horse he has in the world one thing certain they cant go to church  harry laughed at this and then he told his sister all about his meeting with uncle braddock but while she was wondering and surmising in regard to george masons strange conduct harry who could not keep his thoughts from more important matters broke in with  but i say kate ive made up my mind about the telegraph business there must be a company and we ought to plan it all out before we tell people and sell shares  thats right cried kate who was always ready for a plan lets do it now  so down she sat upon the ground and harry sat down in front of her  then they held a council  in the first place we must have a president said harry  that ought to be you said kate  yes said harry i suppose i ought to be president and then we must have a treasurer and i think you should be treasurer  yes said kate that would do very well but where could i keep the money  pshaw said harry its no use to bother ourselves about that wed better get the money first and then see where we can put it i reckon itll be spent before anybody gets a chance to steal it and now then we must have a secretary  how would tom selden do for secretary asked kate  oh he isnt careful enough answered harry i think you ought to be secretary you can write well and youll keep everything in order  very well said kate ill be secretary  i think said harry that we have now about all the officers we want excepting of course an engineer and i shall be engineer for i have planned out the whole thing already  i didnt know there was to be an engine said kate  engine exclaimed harry laughing thats a good one i dont mean an engineer of a steamengine what we want is a civil engineer a man who lays out railroad lines and all that kind of thing im not right sure that a civil engineer does plan out telegraph lines but it dont make any difference what we call the officer hell have to attend to putting up the line  and do you think you can do it said kate i should suppose it would be a good deal harder to be engineer than to be president  yes i suppose it will but ive studied the matter ive watched the men putting up new wires at hetertown and mr lyons told me all he knew about it its easy enough very different from building a railroad  it must be a good deal safer to build a railroad though said kate you dont have to go so high up in the air  youre a little goose said harry laughing at her again  no im not said kate im treasurer and secretary of thewhat shall we call the company harry it ought to have a name  certainly it ought said her brother how would the mica mine telegraph companyno that wouldnt do at all it isnt theirs its ours  call it the loudon telegraph company said kate  that would be nearer the thing but it wouldnt be very modest though people often do call their companies after their own names what do you think of the akeville and hetertown company  but it wont go to either of those places said kate it will only cross the creek  all right exclaimed harry lets call it the crooked creek telegraph company  good said kate thats the very name  so the company was named  now said kate weve got all the head officers and the name what do we want next  we want a good many other things said harry i suppose we ought to have a board of directors  shall we be in that asked kate  harry considered this question before answering it i think the president ought to be in it he said but i dont know about the secretary and treasurer i think they are not generally directors  well said kate with a little sigh i dont mind  you can be if you want to said harry wait until we get the board organized and ill talk to the other fellows about it  are they going to be all boys asked kate quickly  i reckon so said harry we dont want any men in our board theyd be ordering us about and doing everything themselves  i didnt mean that will there be any girls  no said harry a little contemptuously it is to be feared there isnt a girl in the village who knows anything about telegraph lines except you  well if its to be all boys i dont believe i would care to belong to the board said kate but who are we going to have  this selection of the members of the board of directors seemed a little difficult at first but as there were so few boys to choose from it was settled in quite a short time  tom selden harvey davis george purvis dr prices youngest son brandeth and wilson ogden were chosen and these with the addition of harry made up the board of directors of the crooked creek telegraph company  well said kate as the council arose and adjourned i hope well settle the rest of our business as easily as we have settled this part     chapter xvi  company business   after the selection of the directors all of whom accepted their appointments with great readiness although with the exception of tom selden none of them had known anything about the company until informed by harry of their connection with its management it remained only to get subscriptions to the capital stock and then the construction of the line might immediately begin  harry and kate made out a statement of the probable expense and a very good statement it was for as harry had said he had thoroughly studied up the matter aided by the counsel of mr lyons the operator at hetertown  this statement with the probable profits and the great advantages of such a line was written out by harry and the secretary considering all clerical work to be her especial business made six fair copies one of which was delivered to each of the board of directors who undertook to solicit subscriptions  a brief constitution was drawn up and by a clause in this instrument onequarter of the profits were to go to the stockholders and the rest to aunt matilda  the micamine men when visited by harry who carried a letter from his father at first gave the subject but little consideration but after they found how earnest harry was in regard to the matter and how thoroughly he had studied up the subject theoretically and practically under the tuition of his friend mr lyons they began to think that possibly the scheme might prove of advantage to them  after a good deal of talkenough to have settled much more important businessthey agreed to take stock in the telegraph company provided harry and his board purchased firstclass instruments and appliances  their idea in insisting upon this was the suggestion of their manager that if the boys failed in their project they might get possession of the line and work it themselves consequently with a view both to the present success of the association and their own possible acquisition of the line they insisted on firstclass instruments  this determination discouraged harry and his friends for they had not calculated upon making the comparatively large expenditures necessary to procure these firstclass instruments  they had thought to buy some cheap but effective apparatus of which they had heard and which for amateur purposes answered very well  but when the micamine officers agreed to contribute a sum in proportion to the increased capital demanded harry became quite hopeful and the other members of the board agreed that they had better work harder and do the thing right while they were about it  the capital of the company was fixed at one hundred and fifty dollars and to this the micamine people agreed to subscribe fifty dollars they also gave a written promise to give all the business of that kind that they might have for a year from date to harry and his associates provided that the telegraphic service should always be performed promptly and to their satisfaction  a contract fixing rates etc was drawn up and harry the directors the secretary and the treasurer all and severally signed it this was not actually necessary but these officers quite naturally were desirous of doing all the signing that came in their way  private subscriptions came in more slowly mr loudon gave fifteen dollars and dr price contributed ten as his son was a director old mr truly matthews subscribed five dollars and hoped that he should see his money back again but if he didnt he supposed it would help to keep the boys out of mischief small sums were contributed by other persons in the village and neighborhood each of whom was furnished with a certificate of stock proportioned to the amount of the investment  there were fifty shares issued of three dollars each and miss jane davis who subscribed one dollar and a quarter got fivetwelfths of a share the members of the board collectively put in thirty dollars  the majority of the shareholders considered their money as a donation to a good cause for of course it was known that aunt matildas support was the object of the whole business but some hoped to make something out of it and others contributed out of curiosity to see what sort of a telegraph the company would build and how it would work  it was urged by some wise people that if this money had been contributed directly to aunt matilda it would have been of much more service to her but other people equally wise said that in that case the money could never have been raised  the colored people old and young took a great interest in the matter and some of them took parts of shares which was better even john william webster took seventyfive cents worth of stock  the most astonishing subscription was one from aunt matilda herself one day she handed to kate a tencent piecesilver old styleand desired that that might be put into the company for her where she got it nobody knew but she had it and she put it in  explanations were of no use the fact of the whole business being for her benefit made no impression on her she wanted a share in the company and was proud of her onethirtieth part of a share  a shareholder  taking them as a whole the board of directors appeared to have been very well chosen tom selden was a good fellow and a firm friend of harry and kate they might always reckon upon his support although he had the fault when matters seemed a little undecided of giving his advice at great length but when a thing was agreed upon he went to work without a word  harvey davis was a large blueeyed boy very quiet with yellow hair he was one of the best scholars in the akeville school and could throw a stone over the highest oaktree by the churchsomething no other boy in the village could do he made an admirable director  dr prices son brandeth and wilson ogden lived some miles from the village and sometimes one or the other of them did not get to a meeting of the board until the business before it had been despatched but they always attended punctually if there was a horse or a mule to be had in time and made no trouble when they came  george purvis lived just outside of the village he was a tall fellow with a little head his father had been in the legislature and george was a great fellow to talk and he was full of new ideas if harry and kate had not worked out so thoroughly the plan of the company before electing the directors george would have given the rest of the board a great deal of trouble  when about fourfifths of the capital stock had been subscribed and there was not much likelihood of their getting any more at present the board of directors determined to go to work  acting under the advice and counsel of mr lyons who ought to have been a director but who was not offered the position they sent to new york for two sets of telegraphic instrumentsregisters keys batteries reels etc etcone set for each office and for about half a mile of wire with the necessary officewire insulators etc  this took pretty much all their capital but they hoped to economize a good deal in the construction of the line and felt quite hopeful  but it seemed to be a long and dreary time that they had to wait for the arrival of their purchases from new york either harry or one of the other boys rode over to hetertown every day and the attention they paid to the operation of telegraphy while waiting for the train was something wonderful  it was a fortunate thing for the board that on account of the sickness of the teacher the vacation commenced earlier than usual in akeville that year  more than a week passed and no word from new york no wonder the boys became impatient it had been a month or more since the scheme had been first broached in the village and nothing had yet been doneat least nothing to which the boys could point as evidence of progress  the field of operation had been thoroughly explored the pine trees which were to serve as telegraph poles had been selected and contracts had been made with oneeyed lewston a colored preacher who lived near the creek on the akeville side and with aunt judy who had a log house on the hetertown side by which these edifices were to be used as telegraphic stations the instruments and batteries when not in use were to be locked up in stationary cases made by the akeville carpenter after designs by harry  of course while waiting for the arrival of their goods from new york the board met every day having little real business their discussions were not always harmonious  george purvis grew discontented several times he said to brandeth price and harvey ogden that he didnt see why he shouldnt be something more than a mere director and a remark that harvey once made that if harry and kate had not chosen to ask him to join them he would not have been even a director made no impression upon him  one day when a meeting was in session by the roadside near oneeyed lewstons cabinor the akeville telegraph station as i should saygeorge and harry had a slight dispute and purvis took occasion to give vent to some of his dissatisfaction  i dont see what youre president for anyway said he to harry after the board of directors had been organized it ought to have elected all the officers  but none of you fellows knew anything about the business said harry kate and i got up the company and we neednt have had a board of directors at all if we hadnt wanted to if any of you boys had known anything about telegraphs we would have given you an office  i reckon you dont have to know anything about telegraphs to be secretary or treasurer either said george warmly  no answered harry but youve got to know how to keep accounts and to be careful and particular  like your sister kate i suppose said george with a sneer  yes like kate answered harry  id be ashamed of myself said george if i couldnt get a better secretary or treasurer than a girl i dont see what a girl is doing in the company anyway the right kind of a girl wouldnt be seen pushing herself in among a lot of boys that dont want her  without another word the president of the crooked creek telegraph company arose and offered battle to george purvis the contest was a severe one for purvis was a tall fellow but harry was as tough as the sole of your boot and he finally laid his antagonist on the flat of his back in the road  george arose put on his hat dusted off his clothes and resigned his position in the board     chapter xvii  principally concerning kate   during all this work of soliciting subscriptions ordering instruments and batteries and leasing stations kate had kept pretty much in the background true she had not been idle she had covered a great deal of paper with calculations and had issued certificates of stock all in her own plain handwriting to those persons who had put money into the treasury of the company and she had received all that money had kept accurate account of it and had locked it up in a little box which was kindly kept for her in the iron safe owned by mr darby the storekeeper  when the money was all drawn out and sent to new york her duties became easier  school had closed as has been before stated and although kate had home duties and some home studies she had plenty of time for outdoor life but now she almost always had to enjoy that life alone if we except the company of rob who generally kept faithfully near her so long as she saw fit to walk but when she stopped to rest or to pursue some of her botanical or entomological studies he was very apt to wander off on his own account he liked to keep moving  one of her favorite resorts was what was called the near woods a piece of forest land not far from mr loudons house and within calling distance of several dwellings and negro cabins she visited aunt matilda nearly every day but the woods around her cabin were principally pine and pine forests are generally very sombre  but the near woods were principally of oak and hickory with dogwood sweet gum and other smaller trees here and there and there were open spots where the sun shone in and where flowers grew and the insects loved to come as well as heavily shaded places under grand old trees  she thoroughly enjoyed herself in a wood like this she did not feel in the least lonely although she would have found herself sadly alone in a busy street of a great city  here she was acquainted with everything she saw there was company for her on every side she had not been in the habit of passing the trees and the bushes the lichens and ferns and the flowers and mosses as if they were merely people hurrying up and down the street she had stopped and made their acquaintance and now she knew them all and they were her good friends excepting a few such as the poisonvines and here and there a plant or reptile with which she was never on terms of intimacy  she would often sit and swing on a lowbending grapevine that hung between two lofty trees sometimes singing and sometimes listening to the insects that hummed around her and all the while as happy a kate as any kate in the world  it was here on the grapevine swing that harry found her the day after his little affair with george purvis  why harry she cried i thought you were having a meeting  theres nothing to meet about said harry seating himself on a big mosscovered root near kates swing  there will be when the telegraph things come said kate  oh yes therell be enough to do then but it seems as if they were never coming and ive been thinking about something kate it strikes me that perhaps it would be better for you to hold only one office  why dont i do well enough asked kate quickly stopping herself very suddenly in her swinging  oh yes you do better than any one else could but you see the other fellowsi mean the boardmay think that some of them ought to have an office id give them one of mine but none of them would do for engineer they dont know enough about the business  which office would you give up if you were me asked kate  oh id give up the secretaryship of course said harry nobody but you must be treasurer harvey davis would make a very good secretary considering that theres so little writing to do now  well then said kate let harvey be secretary  there was no bitterness or reproachfulness in kates words but she looked a little serious and began to swing herself very vigorously it was evident that she felt this resignation of her favorite office much more deeply than she chose to express and no wonder she had done all the work she had taken a pride in doing her work well and now when the company was about to enter upon its actual public life she was to retire into the background for a treasurer had not much to do especially now that there was so little money there was scarcely a paper for the treasurer to sign but the secretarywell there was no use of thinking any more about it no doubt harry knew what was best he was with the board every day and she scarcely ever met the members  harry saw that kate was troubled but he did not know what to say and so he whittled at the root on which he was sitting  i should think harry said kate directly that george purvis would want to be secretary hes just the kind of a boy to like to be an officer of some kind  oh he cant be an officer said harry still whittling at the root he has resigned  george purvis resigned exclaimed kate why what did he do that for  oh we didnt agree said harry and were better off without him we have directors enough as it is five is a very good number there cant be a tie vote with five members in the board  kate suspected that something had happened that she was not to be told but she asked no questions  after a few minutes of swinging and whittling in which neither of them said anything kate got out of her grapevine swing and picked up her hat from the ground and harry jumped up and whistled for rob  as they walked home together kate said  harry i think id better resign as treasurer perhaps the officers ought all to be boys  look here kate said harry and he stopped as he spoke im not going to have anybody else as treasurer if you resign that office ill smash the company  of course after that there was nothing more to be said and kate remained treasurer of the crooked creek telegraph company  before very long of course she heard the particulars of george purviss resignation she did not say much about it but she was very glad that it was not harry who had been whipped  the next morning quite earlythe birds and the negroes had been up some time but everybody in mr loudons house was still sleeping soundlyharry who had a small room at the front of the house was awakened by the noise of a horse galloping wildly up to the front gate and by hearing his name shouted out at the top of a boys voice  the boy was tom selden and he shouted  oh harry harry loudon hello there the telegraph things have come  harry gave one bound he jerked on his clothes quicker than you could say the multiplication table and he rushed down stairs and into the front yard  it was actually so the instruments and batteries and everything all packed up in boxestom couldnt say how many boxeshad come by a late train and mr lyons had sent word over to his house last night and he had been over there this morning by daybreak and had seen one of the boxes and it was directed all right to the crooked creek telegraph company and  there was a good deal more intelligence it appeared but it wasnt easy to make it out for harry was asking fifty questions and kate was calling out from one of the windows and dick ford and halfadozen other negro boys were running up and shouting to each other that the things had come mr loudon came out to see what all the excitement was about and he had to be told everything by tom and harry both at once and rob and blinks were barking and there was hubbub enough  harry shouted to one of the boys to saddle selim and when the horse was brought around in an incredibly short timefour negroes having clapped on his saddle and bridleharry ran into the house to get his hat but just as he had bounced out again his mother appeared at the front door  harry she cried youre not going off without your breakfast  oh i dont want any breakfast mother he shouted  but you cannot go without your breakfast youll be sick  but just think expostulated harry the things have been there all night  it makes no difference said mrs loudon you must have your breakfast first  mr loudon now put in a word and selim was led back to the stable  well i suppose i must said poor harry with an air of resignation come in tom and have something to eat  the news spread rapidly harvey davis was soon on hand and by the time breakfast was over nearly every body in the village knew that the telegraph things had come  harry and tom did not get off as soon as they expected for mr loudon advised them to take the springwagonfor they would need it to haul their apparatus to the telegraphic stationsand the horse had to be harnessed and the cases which were to protect the instruments when not in use were to be brought from the carpentershop and so it seemed very late before they started  just as they were ready to go up galloped brandeth price and wilson ogden so away they all went together two of the board in the wagon and three on horseback  kate stood at the front gate looking after them do what she would she could not help a tear or two rising to her eyes mr loudon noticed her standing there and he went down to her  never mind kate said he i told them not to unpack the things until they had hauled them to the creek and ill take you over to aunt judys in the buggy well get there by the time the boys arrive     chapter xviii  the arrival   when kate and her father reached aunt judys cabin the boys had not yet arrived but they were anxiously expected by about a dozen colored people of various ages and sizes and by two or three white men who were sitting under the trees waiting to see the telegraph come  telegraph apparatus and wires were not at all novel in that part of the country but this was to be the first time that anything of the kind had been set up in that neighborhood in those familiar old woods about crooked creek  and then it must be remembered too that most of these interested people were stockholders that was something entirely novel and it is no wonder that they were anxious to see their property  i hopes mahsr john said aunt judy to mr loudon dat dem dar merchines aint agoin to bust up when deyre lef hyar all alone by theyselves  oh theres no danger aunt judy said mr loudon if you dont meddle with them but i suppose you cant do that if the boys are going to case them up as they told me they intended doing  why bress your soul mahsr john ye neednt be fraid o my techin em off i wouldnt no more put a finger on em dan id pull de trigger ov a hoss pistol  there isnt really any danger in having these instruments in the house is there father asked kate when she and mr loudon had stepped out of the cabin where aunt judy was busy sweeping and putting things to rights in honor of the expected arrival  that depends upon circumstances said mr loudon if the boys are careful to disconnect the instruments and the wires when they leave the cabins there is no more danger than there would be in a brass clock but if they leave the wires attached to the instruments lightning might be attracted into the cabins during a thunderstorm and aunt judy might find the merchines quite as dangerous as a horsepistol  but they mustnt leave the wires that way said kate i shant let harry forget it why it would be awful to have aunt judy and poor old lewston banged out of their beds in the middle of the night  i should think so said mr loudon but the boysi am sure about harryunderstand their business to that extent at least i dont apprehend any accidents of that kind  kate was just about to ask her father if he feared accidents of any kind when a shout was heard from the negroes by the roadside  dar dey come sang out halfadozen voices and sure enough there was the wagon slowly turning an angle of the road with the mounted members of the board riding close by its side  all now was bustle and eagerness everybody wanted to do something and everybody wanted to see the wagon was driven up as close to the cabin as the trees would allow the boys jumped down from their seats and saddles the horses bridles were fastened to branches overhead white black and yellow folks clustered around the wagon and some twenty hands were proffered to aid in carrying the load into the cabin  harry was the grand director of affairs he had a good loud voice and it served him well on this important occasion  look out there he cried dont any of you touch a box or anything till i tell you what to do theyre not all to go into aunt judys cabin some things are to go across the creek to lewstons house here john william and gregory take this table and carry it in carefully and you dick take that chair dont be in a hurry were not going to open the boxes out here  why harry cried kate i didnt know there were to be tables and chairs  to tell the truth i didnt think of it either said harry but we must have something to put our instruments on and something to sit on while we work them mr lyons reminded us that wed have to have them and we got these in hetertown had to go to three places to get them all and ones borrowed anyway look out there you bobby you cant carry a chair get down off that wheel before you break your neck  lor bress your heart mahsr harry is ye got a bed i never did spect ye was agoin to bring furniture cried aunt judy her eyes rolling up and down in astonishment and delight dats a pooty cheer wont hurt a body to sot in dat cheer when you all aint ausin it will it  blow you right through the roof if you set on the trigger said tom selden so mind youre careful aunt judy  now then cried harry carry in this box easy now well take all the wire over on the other side you see tom that they leave the wire in the wagon do you know father that we forgot to bring a hammer or anything to open these boxes  theres a hammer under the seat of the buggy one of you boys run and get it  at the word two negro boys rushed for the buggy and the hammer  a screwdriver would do better said harvey davis  oneeyed lewstons got a screwdriver said one of the men  dar lewston cried john william webster dar he jist comin ober de bridge  shet up cried aunt judy dont spect he got him screwdriber in him breeches pocket does ye why don ye go long and git it  and away went john william and two other boys for the screwdriver  in spite of so many cooks the broth was not spoiled and after a reasonable time the beautifully polished instruments were displayed to view on the table in aunt judys cabin  everybody looked with all their eyes even mr loudon who had often examined telegraphic apparatus took a great interest in this and the negroes thought there was never anything so wonderful especially were those delighted who owned stock  some o dat dars mine said a shinyfaced black boy wonder ef dat little doorknobs my sheer  you go long dar said dick ford giving him a punch in the ribs with his elbow dat little shiny screws bout as much as you own  as for the members of the board they were radiant there was the telegraphic apparatus or a part of it of the crooked creek telegraph company and here were the officers  each one of them except brandeth price explained some portion of the instruments to some of the bystanders  as for brandeth he had not an idea what was to be done with anything but he had a vote in the board he never forgot that  cant ye work it a little mahsr harry asked gregory montague  dats so cried a dozen voices jist lets see her run a little mahsr harry please even kate wanted to see how the things worked  harry explained that he couldnt run it until he had arranged the battery and had made a great many preparations and he greatly disappointed the assembly by informing them that all that was to be done that day was to put the instruments in their respective houses or stations as the boys now began to call the cabins and to put up the cases which were to protect them when not in use these cases were like small closets with movable tops and there was great fear that they would not fit over the tables that had been brought from hetertown  on the next day mr lyons had promised to come over and show them how to begin the work  therell be plenty for you fellows to do said harry when we put up the wires     chapter xix  constructing the line   the next day was a day of hard work for the board of managers mr lyons who took the greatest interest in the enterprise got another operator to take his place at the hetertown station and came over to help the boys  under his direction and with his help they arranged the instruments and the batteries sunk the groundwires and in a general way put the officeapparatus in working order when night came there were still some things that remained to be done in the two stations but the main part of the office arrangements had been satisfactorily concluded under mr lyonss supervision  now it only remained to put up the wire and this was a piece of work that interested the whole neighborhood there had been lookerson enough while the instruments were being put in working order but the general mind did not comprehend the mechanism and uses of registers and keys and batteries  any one however could understand how a telegraphic wire was put up and what was more quite a number of persons thought they knew exactly how it ought to be put up and made no scruple of saying so  tony kirk was on handas it was not turkey seasonand he made himself quite useful having had some experience in working under surveyors he gave the boys a good deal of valuable advice and what was of quite as much service he proved very efficient in quieting the zeal of some ambitious but undesirable volunteer assistants  certain straight pinetrees at suitable distances from each other and as nearly as possible on a right line between the two cabins were selected as poles and their tops were cut off about twentyfive feet from the ground all trees and branches that would be apt to interfere with the wires were cut down out of the way  at one timefor this matter of putting up the wire occupied several daysthere were ten or twelve negro men engaged in cutting down trees and in topping and trimming telegraph poles  each one of these men received forty cents per day from the company and found themselves it is probable that if the board had chosen to pay but twenty cents there would have been quite as many laborers for this was novel and very interesting work and several farmhands threw up their situations for a day or two and came over to cut fur de telegraph  when the poles were all ready on each side of the creek the insulators or glass knobs to which the wires were to be attached were to be fastened to them a foot or two from the top  this was to be done under harrys direction who had studied up the theory of the operation from his books and under mr lyons  but the actual work proved very difficult the first few insulators harry put up himself he was a good climber but not being provided with the peculiar climbers used by the men who put up telegraph wires he found it very hard to stay up at the top of a pole after he had got there especially as he needed both hands to nail to the tree the wooden block to which the insulator was attached  in fact he made a bad business of it and the insulators he put up in this way looked shackling poorly to say nothing of his trowsers which suffered considerably every time he slipped part way down a pole  but here tony kirk again proved himself a friend in need he got a wagon and drove four miles to a farmhouse where there was a long light ladder this he borrowed and brought over to the scene of operation  this ladder was not quite long enough to reach to the height at which harry had fastened his insulators but it was generally agreed that there was no real necessity for putting them up so high  the ladder was arranged by tony in a very ingenious way he laid it on the ground with the top at the root of the tree to be climbed then he fastened a piece of telegraph wire to one side of the ladder passed it loosely around the tree and fastened it to the other side then as the ladder was gradually raised the wire slipped along up the tree and when the ladder was in position it could not fall although it might shake and totter a little however strong arms at the bottom held it pretty steady and harry was enabled to nail on his insulators with comparative ease and in a very satisfactory manner  after a while tony took his place and being a fellow whom it was almost impossible to tire he finished the whole business without assistance  it may be remarked that when tony mounted the ladder he dispensed with the wire safeguard depending upon the carefulness of the two negro men who held the ladder from below  the next thing was to put up the wire itself and this was done in rather a bungling manner if this wire were compared with that of ordinary telegraph lines  it was found quite impossible to stretch the wire tightly between the poles as the necessary appliances were wanting  various methods of tightening were tried but none were very successful and the wire hung in curves some greater and some less between the poles  but what did it matter there was plenty of wire and the wind had not much chance to blow it about as it was protected by the neighboring treetops  there was no trouble in carrying the wire over the creek as the bridge was very near and as trees close to each bank had been chosen for poles and as the creek was not very wide the wire approached nearer to a straight line where it passed over the water than it did anywhere else  at last all was finished the main line wire was attached to the copper officewire the batteries were charged the register was arranged with its paper strip and everything was ready for the transmission of messages across crooked creek  at least the board hoped that everything was ready it could not be certain until a trial was made  the trial was made and everybody in the neighborhood who could get away from home came to see it made  harry was at the instrument on the akeville side and mr lyons the second operator of the company had not been appointed attended to the other end of the line taking his seat at the table in aunt judys cabin where mr and mrs loudon kate and as many other persons as the room would hold were congregated  as president of the company harry claimed the privilege of sending the first message  surrounded by the board and a houseful of people besides he took his seat at the instrument and after looking about him to see if everything was in proper order he touched the key to call the operator at the other end  but no answer came something was wrong harry tried again but still no answer he jumped up and examined the instrument and the battery  everybody had something to say and some advice to give  even old oneeyed lewston pushed his way up to harry and exclaimed  oh mahsr harry ef you want to grease her i got some hogslard up dar on dat shelf  but harry soon thought he found where the fault lay and adjusting a screw or two he tried the key again this time his call was answered  click click click click went the instrument  wild with excitement everybody crowded closer to harry who with somewhat nervous fingers slowly sent over the line of the crooked creek telegraph company its first message  when received on the other side and translated from the dots and dashes of the register it read thus      to katehoow are you  directly the answer came swiftly from the practised fingers of mr lyons      to harryi am very well  this message had no sooner been received and announced than harry followed by every one else rushed out of the house and there on the other side of the creek he saw his father and mother and kate and all the rest hurrying out of aunt judys cabin  mr loudon waved his hat and shouted hurrah  harry and the board answered with a wild hurrah  then everybody took it up and the woods rang with hurrah hurrah hurrah  the crooked creek telegraph line was a success     chapter xx  an important meeting of the board   now that the telegraphic line was built and in good working order it became immediately necessary to appoint another operator for it was quite evident that harry could not work both ends of the line  it was easy enough to appoint an operator but not so easy for such person to work the instruments in fact harry was the only individual in the company or the neighborhood who understood the duties of a telegrapher and his opportunities for practice had been exceedingly limited  it was determined to educate an operator and harvey davis was chosen as the most suitable individual for the position so day after day was spent by harry and harvey the one in the cabin of oneeyed lewston and the other in that of aunt judy in steady though often unsatisfactory practice in the transmission and reading of telegraphic messages  of course great interest was taken in their progress and some members of the board were generally present at one or the other of the stations kate often came over to aunt judys cabin and almost always there were other persons present each of whom whenever there was a chance was eager to send a telegraphic message gratis even if it were only across crooked creek  sometimes neither harry nor harvey could make out what the other one was trying to say and then they would run out of the station and go down to the bank of the creek and shout across for explanations a great many more intelligible messages were sent in this way for the first few days than were transmitted over the wire  tony kirk remarked after a performance of this kind it pears to me that it wasnt no use to put up that ar wire fur two fellows could a been appinted one to stand on each side o the creek and holler the messages across  but of course such a proceeding would have been extremely irregular tony was not accustomed to the strict requirements of business  sometimes the messages were extremely complicated for instance harry one day about noon carefully telegraphed the following      i would not go home perhaps you can get something to eat from aunt     judy  as harvey translated this it read      i would gph go rapd gradsvlt bodgghip rda goqbsjcm eat dkpx aunt     judy  in answer to this harvey attempted to send the following message      what do you mean by eating aunt judy  but harry read      whatt a xdll mean rummmlgigdd ju  harry thought of course that this seemed like a reflection on his motives in proposing that harvey could ask aunt judy to give him something to eat and so of course there had to be explanations  after a time however the operators became much more expert and although harvey was always a little slow he was very careful and very patientmost excellent qualities in an operator upon such a line  the great desire now not only among the officers of the company but with many other folks in akeville and the neighborhood was to see the creek up so that travel across it might be suspended and the telegraphic business commence  to be sure there might be other interests with which a rise in the creek would interfere but they of course were considered of small importance compared with the success of an enterprise like this  but the season was very dry and the creek very low there were places where a circusman could have jumped across it with all his pockets full of telegraphic messages  in the mean time the affairs of the company did not look very flourishing the men who assisted in the construction of the line had not been paid in full and they wanted their money kate reported that the small sum which had been appropriated out of the capital stock for the temporary support of aunt matilda was all gone this report she made in her capacity as a special committee of one appointed by herself to attend to the wants of aunt matilda as the treasurer of the company she also reported that there was not a cent in its coffers  in this emergency harry called a meeting of the board  it met as this was an important occasion in daviss cornhouse fortunately now empty this was a cool shady edifice and though rather small was very well ventilated the meetings had generally been held under some big tree or in various convenient spots in the woods near the creek but nothing of that kind would be proper for such a meeting as this especially as kate as treasurer was to be present this was her first appearance at a meeting of the board the boys sat on the cornhouse floor which had been nicely swept out by john william webster and kate had a chair on the grass just outside of the door there she could hear and see with great comfort without settin on the floor with a passel of boys as miss eliza davis who furnished the chair elegantly expressed it  when the meeting had been called to order and john william who evinced a desire to hang around and find out what was going on had been discharged from further attendance on the board or in other words had been ordered to clear out and the minutes of the last meeting had been read and the treasurer had read her written report and the secretary had read his an air of despondency seemed to settle upon the assembly  an empty cornhouse seemed as tom selden remarked a very excellent place for them to meet  the financial condition of the company was about as follows  it owed oneeyed lewston and aunt judy one dollar each for one months rent of their homesteads as stations the arrangement having been made about the time the instruments were ordered  it owed four dollars and twenty cents to the woodcutters who worked on the construction of the line and two dollars and a half for other assistance at that time  wish we had done it all ourselves said wilson ogden  it owed three dollars balance on furniture procured at hetertown it also owed one chair borrowed  it owed for spikes and some other hardware procured at the store one dollar and sixty cents  in addition to this it owed john william webster who had been employed as a sort of general agent to run errands and clean up things seventyfive centsbalance of salaryand he wanted his money  to meet these demands as was before remarked they had nothing  fortunately nothing was owing for aunt matildas support harry and kate having from the first determined never to run in debt on her account  but unfortunately poor aunt matildas affairs were never in so bad a condition the great interest which kate and harry had taken in the telegraph line had prevented them from paying much attention to their ordinary methods of making money and now that the companys appropriation was spent there seemed to be no immediate method of getting any money for the old womans present needs  this matter was not strictly the business of the board but they nevertheless considered it     chapter xxi  a last resort   the board was fully agreed that something must be done to relieve aunt matildas present necessities but what to do did not seem very clear  wilson ogden proposed issuing some kind of scrip or bonds redeemable in six or seven months when the company should be on a paying basis  i believe said he that mr darby would take these bonds at the store for groceries and things and we might pay him interest besides redeeming the bonds when they came due  this was rather a startling proposition no one had suspected wilson of having such a financial mind  i dont know said harry how that would work mr darby might not be willing to take the bonds and besides that it seems to me that the company ought not to make any more promises to pay when it owes so much already  but you see that would be different said wilson what we owe now we ought to pay right away the bonds would not have to be paid for ever so long  that may be pretty sharp reasoning remarked tom selden but i cant see into it  it would be all the same as running in debt for aunt matilda wouldnt it asked kate  yes said wilson a kind of running in debt but not exactly the common way you see  but if its any kind at all im against it said kate quickly were not going to support aunt matilda that way  this settled the matter to be sure kate had no vote in the board but this was a subject in which she had what might be considered to be a controlling interest and the bond project was dropped  various schemes were now proposed but there were objections to all of them everyone was agreed that it was very unfortunate that this emergency should have arisen just at this time because as soon as the company got into good working order and the creek had been up a few times it was probable that aunt matilda would really have more money than she would absolutely need  you ought to look out harry and kate said harvey davis that all the darkies she knows dont come and settle down on her and live off her shes a great old woman for having people around her even now  well said kate she has a right to have company if she wants to and can afford it  yes said tom selden but having companys very different from having a lot of goodfornothing darkies eating her out of house and home  she wont have anything of that sort said harry ill see that her moneys spent right  but if its her money said harvey she can spend it as she chooses  a discussion here followed as to the kind of influence that ought to be brought to bear upon aunt matilda to induce her to make a judicious use of her income but harry soon interrupted the arguments with the remark that they had better not bother themselves about what aunt matilda should do with her money when she got it until they had found out some way of preventing her from starving to death while she was waiting for it  this was evidently good common sense but it put a damper on the spirits of the board  there was nothing new to be said on the main question and it was now growing toward suppertime so the meeting adjourned  on their way home harry said to kate has aunt matilda anything to eat at all  oh yes she has enough for her supper tonight and for breakfast too if nobody comes to see her but thats all  all right then said harry  i dont think it is all right replied kate whats two meals id like to know  two meals are very good things provided you dont take them both at once said harry and he began to whistle  the next day harry went off and staid until dinnertime  kate could not imagine where he had gone he was not with the board she knew for harvey davis had been inquiring for him  just before dinner he made his appearance  kate was in the house but he hurried her out under the catalpatree  look here said he putting his hand in his pocket and pulling out several greenbacks i reckon thatll keep aunt matilda until the company begins to make money  kate opened her eyes their very widest  why where on earth did you get all that money harry is it yours  of course its mine said harry i sold my gun  oh harry and the tears actually came into kates eyes  well i wouldnt cry about it said harry theres nothing to shoot now and when we get rich i can buy it back again or get another  got rich said kate i dont see how were going to do that especially when its such dreadfully dry weather     chapter xxii  a quandary   about a week after the meeting of the board in the davis cornhouse old miles the mailrider came galloping up to mr loudons front gate the family were at breakfast but harry and kate jumped up and ran to the door when they saw miles coming with his saddlebags flapping behind him no one had ever before seen miles ride so fast a slow trot or rather a steady waddle was the pace that he generally preferred  hello mahsr harry shouted old miles de creeks up cant git across dar no how  this glorious news for the crooked creek telegraph company was indeed true there had been wet weather for several days and although the rainfall had not been great in the level country about akeville it had been very heavy up among the hills and the consequence was that the swollen hillstreams or branches as they are called in that part of the country had rushed down and made crooked creek rise in a hurry it seemed to be always ready to rise in this way whenever it had a chance  now the company could go to work now it could show the world or as much of the world as chose to take notice the advantages of having a telegraph line across a creek in time of freshets  harry was all alive with excitement he sent for harvey davis and had old selim saddled as quickly as possible  hyars de letters and telegrums mahsr harry said miles unlocking his saddlebags and taking out a bundle of letters and some telegrams written on the regular telegraphic blanks and tied up in a little package  as the mail was a private one and old miles was known to be perfectly honest he carried the key and attended personally to the locking and unlocking of his saddlebags  but i dont want the letters miles said harry ive nothing to do with them give me the telegrams and ill send them across  dont want de letters cried miles his eyes and mouth wide open in astonishment why i cant carry de letters ober no morn i kin de telegrams  well neither can i said harry  den whats de use ob dat wire exclaimed miles i thought you uns ud send de letters an all ober dat wire deres lots more letters dan telegrums  i know that said harry hurriedly but we cant send letters give the telegraphic messages and you go back to the mines with the letters and if theres anything in them that they want to telegraph let them write out the messages and you bring them over to lewstons cabin  harry took the telegrams and old miles rode off very much disturbed in his mind his confidence in the utility of the telegraph company was wofully shaken  by this time harvey had arrived on a mule and the two operators dashed away as fast as their animals would carry them  as they galloped along harry shouted to harvey who kept ahead most of the time for his mule was faster than selim  hello harvey if miles couldnt get across how can either of us go over  oh i reckon the creek isnt much up yet answered harvey miles is easily frightened  so on they rode hoping for the best but when they reached the creek they saw to their dismay that the water was much higher already than it usually rose in the summertime the low grounds on each side were overflowed and nothing could be seen of the bridge but the tops of two upright timbers near its middle  it was certainly very unfortunate that both the operators were on the same side of the stream  this is a pretty piece of business cried harry i didnt expect the creek to get up so quickly as this i was down here yesterday and it hadnt risen at all i tell you harvey you ought to live on the other side  or else you ought said harvey  no said harry this is my station  harvey had no answer ready for this but as they were hurriedly fastening selim and the mule to trees near lewstons cabin he said  perhaps mr lyons may come down and work the other end of the line  he cant get off said harry he has his own office to attend to and besides that wouldnt do we must work our own line especially at the very beginning it would look nicenow wouldnt itto wait until mr lyons could come over from hetertown before we could commence operations  well what can we do asked harvey  why one of us must get across somehow  i dont see how its going to be done said harvey as they ran down to the edge of the water i reckon well have to holler our messages across as tony said only there isnt anybody to holler to  i dont know how its to be done either said harry but one of us must get over some way or other  couldnt we wade to the bridge asked harvey and then walk over on it i dont believe its more than up to our waists on the bridge  you dont know how deep it is said harry and when you get to the bridge ten to one more than half the planks have been floated off and youd go slump to the bottom of the creek before you knew it theres no way but to get a boat  i dont know where youre going to find one said harvey theres a boat up at the millpond but you couldnt get it out and down here in much less than a day  john walker has his boat afloat again said harry but thats over on the other side what a nuisance it is that there isnt anybody over there if we didnt want em thered be about sixty or seventy darkies hanging about now  oh no said harvey not so many as that not over fortyseven  im going over to lewstons perhaps he knows of a boat said harry and away he ran  but lewston was not in his cabin and so harry hurried along a road in the woods that led by another negro cabin about a halfmile away thinking that the old man had gone off in that direction every minute or two he shouted at the top of his voice oh lewston  very soon he heard some one shouting in reply and he recognized lewstons voice it seemed to come from the creek  thereupon harry made his way through the trees and soon caught sight of the old colored man he was in a boat poling his way along in the shallow water as close to dry land as the woods allowed him and sometimes where the trees were wide apart sending the boat right between some of their tall trunks  hello lewston cried harry running as near as he could go without getting his shoes wet for the water ran up quite a distance among the trees in some places what are you about where did you get that boat i want a boat  dats jist what i thought mahsr harry said lewston still poling away as hard as he could i know de compunyd want to git ober de creek an i jist went up to hiram andersons and borrowed his ole boat ise been abailing her out all de mornin  youre a trump lewston said harry pole her down opposite your house and then one of us will go over why dont you go out farther you cant get along half as fast in here by the trees and hummocks as you could in deeper water  you dont ketch me out dar in dat runnin water said lewston id be in the middle afore i knowed it and dis poles pooty short  well come along as fast as you can cried harry and ill run down to your house and get your axe to cut a longer pole  by the time harry had found a tall young sapling and had cut it down and trimmed it off lewston arrived with the boat     chapter xxiii  crossing the creek   now then said harry heres the boat and a good pole and youve nothing to do harvey but just to get in and push yourself over to your station as fast as you can  but the situation did not seem to strike harvey very favorably he looked rather dissatisfied with the arrangement made for him  i cant swim he said at least not much you know  well who wants you to swim said harry laughing thats a pretty joke are you thinking of swimming across and towing the boat after you you can push her over easy enough that pole will reach the bottom anywhere  dats so said old lewston itll touch de bottom ob de water but i dont know bout de bottom ob de mud ye musnt push her down too deep dars bout as much mud as water out dar in de creek  the more they talked about the matter the greater became harveys disinclination to go over he was not a coward but he was not used to the water or the management of a boat and the trip seemed much more difficult to him than it would have appeared to a boy accustomed to boating  i tell you what well do cried harry at last you take my station harvey and ill go over and work your end of the line  there was no opposition to this plan and so harry hurried off with harvey to lewstons cabin and helped him to make the connections and get the line in working order at that end and then he ran down to the boat jumped in and lewston pushed him off  harry poled the boat along quite easily through the shallow water and when he got farther out he found that he proceeded with still greater ease only he did not go straight across but went a little too much down stream  but he pushed out strongly toward the opposite shore and soon reached the middle of the creek then he began to go down stream very fast indeed push and pole as he would he seemed to have no control whatever over the boat he had had no idea that the current would be so strong  on he went right down toward the bridge and as the boat swept over it one end struck an upright beam that projected above the water and the clumsy craft was jerked around with such violence that harry nearly tumbled into the creek  he heard lewston and harvey shouting to him but he paid no attention to them he was working with all his strength to get the boat out of the current and into shallower water but as he found that he was not able to do that he made desperate efforts to stop the boat by thrusting his pole into the bottom it was not easy to get the pole into the mud the current was so strong but he succeeded at last by pushing it out in front of him in forcing it into the bottom and then in a moment it was jerked out of his hand as the boat swept on and a second time he came near tumbling overboard  now he was helpless no there was the short pole that lewston had left in the boat  he picked it up but he could do nothing with it if it had been an oar now it might have been of some use he tried to pull up the seat but it was nailed fast  on he rapidly floated down the middle of the stream the boat sometimes sidewise sometimes with one end foremost and sometimes the other very soon he lost sight of lewston and harvey and the last he saw of them they were hurrying by the edge of the water in the woods now he sat down and looked about him the creek appeared to be getting wider and wider and he thought that if he went on at that rate he must soon come to the river the country seemed unfamiliar to him he had never seen it from the water when it was overflowed in this way  he passed a wide stretch of cultivated fields mostly planted in tobacco but he could not recollect what farmer had tobacco down by the creek this year there were some men at work on a piece of rising ground but they were a long way off still harry shouted to them but they did not appear to hear him  then he passed on among the trees again bumping against stumps turning and twisting but always keeping out in the middle of the current he began to be very uneasy especially as he now saw what he had not noticed before that the boat was leaking badly  he made up his mind that he must do something soon even if he had to take off his clothes and jump in and try to swim to shore but this he was well aware would be hard work in such a current  looking hurriedly around he saw a short distance before him a tree that appeared to stand almost in the middle of the creek with its lower branches not very high above the water the main current swirled around this tree and the boat was floating directly toward it  harrys mind was made up in an instant he stood up on the seat and as the boat passed under the tree he seized the lowest branch  in a moment the boat was jerked from under his feet and he hung suspended over the rushing water  he gripped the branch with all his strength and giving his legs a swing got his feet over it then after two or three attempts he managed to draw himself up and get first one leg and then his whole body over the branch then he sat up and shuffled along to the trunk against which he leaned with one arm around it all in a perspiration and trembling with the exertion and excitement  when he had rested awhile he stood up on the limb and looked toward the land there to his joy he saw at a little distance a small loghouse and there was some one living in it for he saw smoke coming from the log and mud chimney that was built up against one end of the cabin  harry gave a great shout and then another and another and presently a negro woman came out of the cabin and looked out over the creek then three colored children came tumbling out and they looked out over the creek  then harry shouted again and the woman saw him  hello dar she cried whos dat  its me harry loudon  harry loudon shouted the woman running down to the edge of the water mahsr john loudons son harry what you doin dar is you fishin  fishing cried harry no i want to get ashore have you a boat  a boat lors a massy i got no boat mahsr harry how did ye

cried harry havent you a rope and some boards to make a raft  lor no mahsr harry i got no boards  tell ye what ye do dar shouted the biggest boy a woollyheady urchin with nothing on but a big pair of trousers that came up under his arms and were fastened over his shoulders by two bits of string jist you come on dis side and jump down an slosh ashore  its too deep cried harry  no taint said the boy i sloshed out to dat tree dis mornin  you did you pomp cried his mother oh ill lick ye fur dat when i git ahold of ye  did you really cried harry  yes i did shouted the undaunted pomp i sloshed out

dar you kin mahsr harry did ye go out dar sure nuff you pomp mind if ye didnt ill lick ye  yes i did said pomp clar out dar an back agin  then ill try it cried harry and clambering around the trunk of the tree he jumped off as far as he could toward shore     chapter xxiv  the first business telegrams   when harry jumped from the tree he came down on his feet in water not quite up to his waist and then he pushed in toward land as fast as he could go in a few minutes he stood in the midst of the colored family his trousers and coattails dripping and his shoes feeling like a pair of wet sponges  ye ought to have rolled up yer pants and tooked off yer shoes and stockins afore ye jumped mahsr harry said the woman  i wish i had taken off my shoes said harry  the woman at whose cabin harry found himself was charity allen and a good sensible woman she was she made harry hurry into the house and she got him her husbands sunday trousers which she had just washed and ironed and insisted on his putting them on while she dried his own she hung his stockings and his coat before the fire and made one of the boys rub his shoes with a cloth so as to dry them as much as possible before putting them near the fire  harry was very impatient to be off but charity was so certain that he would catch his death of cold if he started before his clothes were dry that he allowed himself to be persuaded to wait  and then she fried some salt pork on which with a great piece of cornbread he made a hearty meal for he was very hungry  have you had your dinner charity he asked  oh yes mahsr harry long time ago she said  then it must be pretty late said harry anxiously  oh no said she taint late i reckon it cant be much mor n four oclock  four oclock shouted harry jumping up in such a hurry that he nearly tripped himself in uncle oscars trousers which were much too long for him why thats dreadfully late where can the day have gone i must be off instantly  so much had happened since morning that it was no wonder that harry had not noticed how the hours had flown  the ride to the creek the discussions there the delay in getting the boat the passage down the stream which was much longer than harry had imagined and the time he had spent in the tree and in the cabin had indeed occupied the greater part of the day  and even now he was not able to start though he urged her as much as he could he could not make charity understand that it was absolutely necessary that he must have his clothes wet or dry and he did not get them until they were fit to put on and then his shoes were not dry but as he intended to run all the way to aunt judys cabin that did not matter so much  how far is it to aunt judys he asked when at last he was ready to start  well i reckons its bout six or seben miles mahsr harry said charity  six or seven miles exclaimed harry when shall i get there  now dont hurry and git yesef all in a heat said charity jist keep along dis path fru de woods till ye strike de road and thatll take ye straight to de bridge wish i had a mule to len ye  goodby charity cried harry im ever so much obliged and hurriedly searching his vest pockets he found a tencent note and a few pennies which he gave to the children who grinned in silent delight and then he started off on a run  but he did not run all the way  before long he began to tire a little and then he settled down into a fast walk he felt that he must hurry along as fast as he was able the fortunes of the crooked creek telegraph company depended upon him if the company failed in this its first opportunity there was no hope for it  so on he walked and before very long he struck the main road here he thought he should be able to get along faster but there was no particular reason for it in fact the open road was rather rougher than that through the woods but it was cooler here than under the heavy overhanging trees  and now harry first noticed that the sun was not shining at least it was behind the western hills it must be growing very late he thought  on he went for a mile or two and then it began to grow dusky night was surely coming on  at a turn in the wood he met a negro boy with a tin bucket on his head harry knew him it was tom haskins  hello tom said harry stopping for a moment i want you  what you want mahsr harry asked tom  i want you to come to aunt judys cabin and carry some messages over to hetertown for me  when you want me said tom tomorrer mornin  no i want you tonight this minute ill pay you  tonight cried the astonished tom go ober dar in de dark cant do dat mahsr harry ise fraid to go fru de woods in de dark  nonsense cried harry nothings going to hurt you come on over  cant do it mahsr harry no how said tom ise got ter tote dis hyar buttermilk home deys awaitin fur it now but praps jimll go fur you he kin borrer a mule and go fur you mahsr harry i spects  well tell jim to get a mule and come to aunt judys just as quick as he can ill pay him right well  dats so mahsr harry jimll go long fur ye ill tell him  now be quick about it cried harry im in a great hurry and off he started again  but as he hurried along his legs began to feel stiff and his feet were sore he had walked very fast so far but now he was obliged to slacken his pace  and it grew darker and darker harry thought he had never seen night come on so fast it was certainly a long distance from charitys cabin to aunt judys  at last he reached the wellknown woods near the bridge and off in a little opening he saw aunt judys cabin it was so dark now that he would not have known it was a cabin had he not been so familiar with it  curiously enough there was no light to be seen in the house harry hurried to the door and found it shut he tried to open it and it was locked had aunt judy gone away she never went away it was foolish to suppose such a thing  he knocked upon the door and receiving no answer he knocked louder and then he kicked in a minute or two during which he kept up a continual banging and calling on the old woman he heard a slight movement inside then he knocked and shouted aunt judy  who dar said a voice within  its me harry loudon cried harry let me in  what ye want dar said aunt judy go way from dar  i want to come in open the door  cant come in hyar ise gone to bed  but i must come in cried harry in desperation ive got to work the line theyre waiting for me open the door do you hear aunt judy  go way wid yer line said aunt judy crossly ise abed come in der mornin time enough in de daytime to work lines  harry now began to get angry he found a stone and he banged the door he threatened aunt judy with the law he told her she had no right to go to bed and keep the company out of their station when the creek was up but from her testy answers his threats seemed to have made but little impression upon her she didnt care if they stopped her pay or fined her or sent her to prison she never heard of sich bisness awakin people out of their beds in the middle o the night fur dem foolin merchines  but harrys racket had a good effect after all it woke aunt judy and after a time she got out of bed uncovered the fire blew up a little blaze lighted a candle and putting on some clothes came and opened the door grumbling all the time  now den said she holding the candle over her head and looking like a black witch of ender just out of the ground what you want  i want to come in said harry  well den come in said she  harry was not slow to enter and having made aunt judy bring him two candles which he told her the company would pay for he set to work to get his end of the line in working order  when all was ready he sat down to the instrument and called harvey  he felt very anxious as he did this how could he be sure that harvey was there what a long time for that poor fellow to wait without having any assurance that harry would get across the creek at all much less reach his post and go to work  he may suppose im drowned thought harry and he may have gone home to tell the folks  but there was such a sterling quality about harvey that harry could not help feeling that he would find him in his place when he telegraphed to him no matter how great the delay or how doubtful the passage of the creek  but when he called there was no answer  still he kept the machine steadily ticking he would not give up hoping that harvey was there although his heart beat fast with nervous anxiety so far he had not thought that his family might be frightened about him he knew he was safe and that had been enough he had not thought about other people  but as these ideas were running through his head and troubling him greatly there came a tick tick from the other side then more of them but they meant nothing some one was there who could not work the instrument  then suddenly came a message  is that you harry  joyfully harry answered  yes who wants to know  the answer was  your father he has just waked me upharvey  with a light heart harry telegraphed as briefly as possible an account of his adventures and then his father sent a message telling him that the family had heard that he had been carried away and had been greatly troubled about him and that men had ridden down the stream after him and had not returned and that he mr loudon had just come to lewstons cabin hoping for news by telegraph harvey had been there all day mr loudon said he would now hurry home with the good news but before bidding his son good night he told him that he must not think of returning until the creek had fallen he must stay at aunt judys or go over to hetertown  when this had been promised and a message sent to his mother and kate harry hastened to business he telegraphed to harvey to transmit the companys messages as fast as he could a boy would soon be there to take them over to hetertown the answer came  what messages  then harry suddenly remembered that he had had the messages in the breastpocket of his coat all the time  he dived at his pocket yes there they were  was there ever such a piece of absurdity he had actually carried those despatches across the creek after all the labor and expense of building the telegraph this had been the way that the first business messages had crossed crooked creek  when harry made this discovery he burst out laughing why he might as well have carried them to hetertown from charitys cabin it would really have been better for the distance was not so great  although he laughed he felt a little humiliated how tom selden and indeed everybody would laugh if they knew it  but there was no need to tell everybody and so when he telegraphed the fact to harvey he enjoined secrecy he knew he could trust harvey  and now he became anxious about jim would he be able to borrow a mule and would he come  every few minutes he went to the door and listened for the sound of approaching hoofs but nothing was to be heard but the low snoring of aunt judy who was fast asleep in a chair by the fireplace  while thus waiting a happy thought came into harrys head he opened the messageshe had a right to do that of course as he was an operator and had undertaken to transmit themand he telegraphed them one by one to harvey with instructions to him to send them back to him  they shall come over the creek on our line anyway said harry to himself  it did not take long to send them and to receive them again for there were only three of them then harvey sent a message congratulating harry on this happy idea and also suggested that he harvey should now ride home as it was getting late and it was not likely that there would be any more business that night  harry agreed to this urging harvey to return early in the morning and then he set to work to write out the messages the company had not yet provided itself with regular forms but harry copied the telegrams carefully on notepaper with which with pen and ink each station was furnished writing them as far as possible in the regular form and style of the ordinary telegraphic despatch then he put them in an envelope and directed them to mr lyons at hetertown indorsing them in haste to be transmitted to destination immediately  now then thought he nobody need know how these came over in the first place until we choose to tell them and we wont do that until weve sent over some messages in the regular way and have proved that our line is really of some use and we wont charge the mica company anything for these despatches but yet i dont know about that i certainly brought them over and trouble enough i had to do it ill see about charging after ive talked it over with somebody i reckon ill ask father about that and i havent delayed the messages either for ive been waiting for jim i wonder where that boy can be and again harry went out of doors to listen  had he known that jim was at that moment fast asleep in his bed at home harry need not have gone to the door so often  at last our operator began to be very sleepy and having made up his mind that if jim arrived he would certainly wake him up he aroused aunt judy who was now too sleepy to scold and having succeeded in getting her to lend him a blanket it was her very best blanket which she kept for high days and holidays and if she had been thoroughly awake she would not have lent it for the purpose and having spread it on the floor he lay down on it and was soon asleep  aunt judy blew out one of the candles and set the other on the hearth then she stumbled drowsily into the next room and shut the door after her in a few minutes every living creature in and about the place was fast asleep excepting some treefrogs and katydids outside who seemed to have made up their minds to stay up all night     chapter xxv  profits and projects   the next morning harry was up quite early and after having eaten a very plain breakfast which aunt judy prepared for him he ran down to the creek to see what chance there was for business  there seemed to be a very good chance for the creek had not fallen that was certain if there was any change at all the water seemed a little higher than it was before  before long harvey arrived on the other side accompanied by tom selden and wilson ogden who were very anxious to see how matters would progress now that there was some real work to do  the boys sent messages and greetings backward and forward to each other for about an hour and then old miles arrived with his mailbag which contained quite a number of telegrams this time  not only were there those on the business of the mica company but mr darby the storekeeper at akeville thought it necessary to send a message to hetertown by the new line and there were two or three other private telegrams that would probably never have been sent had it not been for the novelty of the thing  but that rascal jim haskins did not make his appearance and when harry found that it was not likely that he would come at all he induced aunt judy to go out and look for some one to carry the telegrams to hetertown harry had just finished copying the messagesand this took some time for he wrote each one of them in official formwhen aunt judy returned bringing with her a telegraphic messenger  it was uncle braddock  heres a man to take yer letters said aunt judy as she ushered in the old man  harry looked up from his table in surprise  why uncle braddock said he you cant carry these telegrams i want a boy on a mule or a horse to go as fast as he can  lor bress ye mahsr harry said the old negro i kin git along fas enough aunt judy said ye wanted jim an nobleses mule but dat dar mule he back hindwards jist about as much as he walks frontwards i jist keep right straight along an i kin beat dat dar ole mule all holler jist gim me yer letters an ill tote em ober dar fur ten cents ye see i wuz cotched on dis side de creek an wuz jist comin ober to see aunt judy when she telled me ob dis job ill tote yer letters mahsr harry fur ten cents fur de bagfull  i havent a bagfull said harry but i reckon youll have to take them theres nobody else about it seems and i cant leave the station  so uncle braddock was engaged as telegraphboy and harry having promised him twenty cents to go to hetertown and to return with any telegrams that were there awaiting transmission to the other side of the creek the old man set off with his little package in high good humor with the idea of earning money by no harder work than walking a few miles  shortly after noon he returned with a few messages from hetertown and by that time there were some for him to carry back so he made two trips and forty cents that dayquite an income for uncle braddock  in the evening jim haskins made his appearance with his mule he said his brother hadnt told him anything about harrys wanting him until that afternoon notwithstanding uncle braddocks discouraging account of the mule jim was engaged as messenger during the time that the creek should be up and uncle braddock was promised a job whenever an important message should come during jims absence  the next day it rained and the creek was up altogether for five days during this time the telegraph company did a good deal of paying business harry remained at his station and boarded and lodged with aunt judy he frequently sent messages to his father and mother and kate and never failed from an early hour in the morning until dark to find the faithful harvey at his post  at last the creek fell and the bridge became again passable to miles and his waddling horse the operators disconnected their wires put their apparatus in order locked the wooden cases over their instruments and rode in triumph mr loudon had come in the buggy for harry to akeville  harry was received with open arms by his mother and kate and mrs loudon declared that this should be the last time that he should go on such an expedition  she was right  the next afternoon there was a meeting of the board of managers of the crooked creek telegraph company and the secretary having been hard at work all the morning with the assistance of the treasurer and the president made a report of the financial results of the recent five days working of the companys line  it is not necessary to go into particulars but when the sums due the company from the mica company and sundry private individuals had been set down on the one side and the amounts due from the telegraph company to aunt judy for candles and board and lodging for one operator to uncle braddock and jim haskins for services as messengers to hiram anderson for damages to boat found near the river stuck fast among some fallen timber with one end badly battered by floating logs and for certain extras in the way of additional stationery etc which it had become necessary to procure from hetertown had been set down on the other side and the difference between the sums total had been calculated it was found and duly reported that the company had made six dollars and fiftythree cents  this was not very encouraging it was seldom that the creek was up more than five days at a time and so this was a very favorable opportunity of testing the value of the line as a moneymaking concern  it was urged however by the more sanguine members of the board that this was not a fair trial there had been many expenses which probably would not have to be incurred again  but they didnt amount to so very much said kate who as treasurer was present at the meeting aunt judy only charged a dollar and a half for harrys board and the boat was only a dollar and all the other expenses would have to be expected any time  after some further conversation on the subject it was thought best to attend to present business rather than future prospects and to appoint committees to collect the money due the company  harry and tom selden were delegated to visit the micamine people while harvey wilson ogden and brandeth price composed the committee to collect what was due from private individuals  before harry started for the mica mine he consulted his father in regard to charging full price for the telegrams which he carried across the creek in his pocket  mr loudon laughed a good deal at the transaction but he told harry that there was no reason why he should not charge for those telegrams he had certainly carried them over in the first place and the subsequent double transmission over the wire was his own affair  when harry and tom rode over to the mica mine the next morning and explained their business and presented their bill their account was found to be correct and the amount of the bill was promptly handed to them  when this little business had been transacted mr martin the manager of the mine invited them to sit down in his office and have a talk  this line of yours said he is not going to pay you  why not asked harry somewhat disturbed in mind by this sudden statement of what he had already begun to fear was an unpleasant truth  it has paid us said tom selden why weve only been working it five days on regular business and weve clearedwell weve cleared considerable  that may be said the manager smiling but you cant have made very much for you must have a good many expenses the principal reason why i think it wont pay you is that you have to keep up two stations and you all live on this side of the creek ive heard that one of you had a hard time getting over the creek last week  that was harry said tom  so i supposed said mr martin and it must have been a pretty dangerous trip now it wont do to do that sort of thing often and you cant tell when the creeks going to rise so as to be over before the bridge is flooded  thats true said harry crooked creek doesnt give much notice when its going to rise  no it dont continued mr martin and it wont do either for any one of you to live on the other side just to be ready to work the line in time of freshets the creek isnt up often enough to make that pay  but what can we do asked harry you surely dont think were going to give up this telegraph line just as it begins to work and after all the money thats been spent on it and the trouble weve had  no i dont think you are the kind of fellows to give up a thing so soon and we dont want you to give it up for its been a great deal of use to us already what i think you ought to do is to run your line from the other side of the creek to hetertown then youd have no trouble at all when the creek was up you could go down and work this end and an arrangement could easily be made to have the operator at hetertown work the other end and then it would be all plain sailing he could send the telegrams right on on the regular line and there would be no trouble or expense with messengers from the creek over to hetertown  that would be a splendid plan said harry but it would cost like everything to have a long line like that  it wouldnt cost very much said mr martin there are pine woods nearly all the way by the side of the road and so it wouldnt cost much for poles and youve got the instruments for that end of the line all youll have to do would be to take them over to hetertown you wouldnt have to spend any money except for wire and for trimming off the trees and putting up the wire  but that would be more than we could afford said tom selden you ought just to try to make the people about here subscribe to anything and youd see what trouble it is to raise money out of them  oh i dont think you need let the want of money enough to buy a few miles of wire prevent your putting up a really useful line said mr martin our company would be willing to help you about that im sure  if youd help that would make it altogether another thing said harry but youd have to help a good deal  well we would help a good deal said mr martin it would be to our benefit you know to have a good line thats what we want and were willing to put some money in it i suppose thered be no difficulty in getting permission to put up the line on the land between the creek and hetertown  oh no said harry a good part of the woods along the road belong to father and none of the people along there would object to us boys putting up our line on their land  i thought they wouldnt said mr martin ill talk to our people about this and see what they think of it  as harry and tom rode home harry remarked mr martins a trump isnt he i hope the rest of the micamine people will agree with him  i dont believe they will said tom why you see theyd have to pay for the whole thing and i reckon they wont be in a hurry to do that but wouldnt we have a splendid line if they were to do it  i should say so said harry its almost too good a thing to expect im afraid mr martin wont feel quite so generous when he calculates what it will cost     chapter xxvi  a grand proposition   the summer vacation was now over and the board of managers of the telegraph company as well as the other boys of the vicinity were obliged to go to school again and study something besides the arts of making money and transacting telegraphic business but as there was not much business of this kind to be done the school interfered with the companys affairs in little else than the collection of money due from private individuals for telegraphic services rendered during the late rise in the creek the committee which had charge of this collection labored very faithfully for some time and before and after school and during the noon recess the members thereof made frequent visits to the houses of the companys debtors as there were not more than halfadozen debtors it might have been supposed that the business would be speedily performed but such was not the case mr darby the storekeeper paid his bill promptly and old mr truly matthews who had telegraphed to washington to a nephew in the patent office department just to see how it would go paid what he owed on the eighth visit of wilson ogden to his house he had not seen how it would go for his nephew had not answered him either by telegraph or mail and he was in no hurry to pay up but he could not stand that boy opening his gate three times a day as for the rest they promised to settle as soon as they could get some spare cashwhich happy time they expected would arrive when they sold their tobacco  it is to be supposed that no one ever bought their tobacco for they never paid up  the proceeds of the five days of telegraphing together with the money obtained by the sale of harrys gun were spent by kate for aunt matildas benefit and as she knew that it might be a good while before there would be any more money coming kate was as economical as she could be  it was all very proper and kind to make the old womans income hold out as long as possible but aunt matilda did not like this systematic and economical way of living it was too late in life for her she said to do more measurin at a meal than chewin and so she became discouraged and managed one fine morning to hobble up to see mrs loudon about it  ise afraid dese chillen aint agwine to hold out said she i don know but what id better go long to the poorhouse arter all and theres that money i put inter de compny i aint seen nothin come o dat ar money yit  how much did you put in aunt matilda asked mrs loudon  well i neednt be asayin jist how much it was but it was solid silver anyway and i dont reckon ill ever see any of it back again but it dont differ much ise an old woman and them chillen is adoin their best  yes they are said mrs loudon and i think theyre doing very well too you havent suffered for anything lately have you  well no said the old woman i cant say that ive gone hungry or nuthin but i was only agittin fraid i might dis hyar ticlar way o doin things makes a person scary  i am glad that kate is particular said mrs loudon you know aunt matilda that money isnt very plenty with any of us and we all have to learn to make it go as far as it will i dont think you need feel scary if kates economy is all you have to fear  this interview somewhat reassured aunt matilda but she was not altogether satisfied with the state of things the fact was that she had supposed that the telegraph company would bring in so much money that she would be able to live in what to her would be a state of comparative luxury and instead of that kate had been preaching economy and systematic management to her no wonder she was disappointed and a little out of humor with her young guardians  but for all that if harry or kate had fallen into a fiery crater aunt matilda would have hurried in after them as fast as her old legs would have carried her  she went back to her cabin after a while and she continued to have her three meals a day all the same as usual but if she could have seen as kate saw how steadily the little fund for her support was diminishing day by day she would have had some reason for her apprehensions  it was on a pleasant saturday in early september that harry stood looking over the front gate in his fathers yard kate was at the diningroom window sewing harry was thinking and kate was wondering what he was thinking about she thought she knew and she called out to him i expect old mr matthews would lend you a gun harry  yes i suppose he would said harry turning and slowly walking up toward the house but father told me not to borrow a gun from truly matthews its a shame though to stay here when the fields are just chock full of partridges i never knew them so plenty in all my life its just the way things go  it is a pity about your gun said kate theres some one at the gate harry hadnt you better go and see what he wants father wont be home until after dinner you can tell him  harry turned  its mr martin said he and he went down to the gate to meet him  how do you do mr president said mr martin i rode over here this morning and thought i would come and see you  harry shook hands with his visitor and invited him to walk into the house but after mr martin had dismounted and fastened his horse he thought that the seat under the catalpatree looked so cool and inviting that he proposed that they should sit down there and have a little chat  i have been thinking about the extension of your telegraph line said the manager of the mica mine and have talked it over with our people they agree with me that it would be a good thing and we have determined if it suits you and your company that we will advance the money necessary to carry out the scheme  im glad to hear that said harry but as i said before youll have to bear the whole expense and it will cost a good deal to carry the line from the creek all the way to hetertown  yes it will cost some money said mr martin but our idea is that you ought to have a complete line while you are about it and that it ought to run from our mine to hetertown  from your mine to hetertown exclaimed harry in astonishment  yes said mr martin smiling that is the kind of a line that is really needed you see our business is increasing and we are buying land which we intend to sell out in small farms and so expect to build up quite a little village out there in time so you can understand that we would like to be in direct communication with richmond and the north and if we can have it by means of your line we are ready to put the necessary funds into the work  harry was so amazed at this statement that he could hardly find words with which to express himself  why that would give us a regular firstclass telegraph line he exclaimed  certainly said mr martin and thats the only kind of a line that is really worth anything  i dont know what to think about it said harry i didnt expect you to propose anything like this  well said mr martin rising i must be off i had only a few minutes to spare but i thought i had better come and make you this proposition i think you had better lay it before your board of managers as soon as possible and if you will take my advice as a business man youll accept our offer  so saying he bid harry goodby took off his hat to kate who was still looking out of the window mounted his horse and rode away  there was a meeting of the board of managers of the crooked creek telegraph company that afternoon it was a full meeting for harry sent hasty messengers to those he called the outlying members  a more astonished body of officials has seldom been seen than was our board when harry laid the proposition of mr martin before it  but the boys were not so much amazed that they could not jump at this wonderful opportunity and in a very short time it was unanimously voted to accept the proposition of the micamine people and to build the great line  almost as soon as this important vote had been taken the meeting adjourned and the members hurried to their several homes to carry the news  well have to change our name said tom selden to harry we ought to call our company the united states mica and hetertown lightning express line or something big like that  yes replied harry the a 1 doubleaction backspring copperfastened broadgauge telegraph line from here to the moon  and away he ran to meet kate who was coming down the road     chapter xxvii  how something came to an end   the micamine management appeared to be thoroughly in earnest about this extension of the telegraph line as soon as the assent of the board of managers to the scheme had been communicated to them they sent a note to harry suggesting that he should in the name of his company get the written consent of owners of the lands over which the line would pass to the construction of said line on their property this business was soon settled for none of the owners of the farms between the mines and hetertown all of whom were well acquainted with mr loudon and no man in that part of the country was held in higher estimation by his neighbors had the slightest objection to the boys putting up their telegraph line on their lands  when harry had secured the necessary promises the construction of the line was commenced forthwith the boys had very little trouble with it mr martin got together a gang of men with an experienced man to direct them and came down with them to akeville where harry hired them and finding that the foreman understood the business he told him to go to work and put up the line when paydays came around harry gave each man an order for his money on the mica mine company and their wages were paid them by mr martin  it was not very long before the line was constructed and the instruments were in working order in hetertown and at the mica mines there was a person at the latter place who understood telegraphy and he attended to the business at that end of the line while mr lyons worked the instruments at the hetertown station which was in the same building with the regular telegraph line  it was agreed that the mica company should keep an account of all messages sent by them over the line and should credit the crooked creek telegraph company with the amount due in payment after deducting necessary expenses hire of operators and six per cent on the capital advanced  everything having been arranged on this basis the extended line went into operation without regard to the amount of water in the creek and old miles carried no more telegrams to hetertown  the telegraph business however became much less interesting to kate and the boys it seemed to them as if it had been taken entirely out of their hands which was indeed the true state of the case they were the nominal owners and directors of the line but they had nothing to direct and very vague ideas about the value of the property they owned  i dont know said tom selden as he sat one afternoon in mr loudons yard with harry and kate whether weve made much by this business or not those mica people keep all the accounts and do all the charging and if they want to cheat us i dont see whats to hinder them  but you know said harry that we can examine their accounts and besides mr lyons will keep a tally of all the messages sent and i dont believe that he would cheat us  no i dont suppose he would said tom but i liked the old way best there was more fun in it  yes there was said kate and then we helped old lewston and aunt judy i expect theyll miss the money they got for rent  certainly said harry theyll have to deny themselves many a luxury in consequence of the loss of that dollar a month  now youre making fun said kate but twelve dollars a year is a good deal to those poor people  i suppose it is said harry in fifty years it would be six hundred dollars if they saved it all up and that is a good deal of money even to us rich folks  rich said kate were so dreadfully rich that i have only fortytwo cents left of aunt matildas money and i must have some very soon  the consequence of this conversation was that harry had to ride over to the mica mines and get a small advance on the payment due at the end of the month  the end of the month arrived and the settlement was made when the interest on the money advanced to put up the line hire of operators and other expenses had been deducted from the amount due the crooked creek company there was only two dollars and a quarter to be paid to it  harry was astounded he took the money rode back to akeville and hastened to have a consultation with kate for the first time since he became a guardian he was in despair this money was not enough for aunt matildas needs and if it had been there were stockholders who were expecting great things from the recent extension of the line what was to be said to them  harry did not know and kate could suggest nothing it appeared to be quite plain that they had made a very bad business of this telegraphic affair a meeting of the board was called and when each member had had his say matters appeared worse than ever  it was a very blue time for our friends  as for kate she cried a good deal that afternoon  the time had at last come when she felt they would have to give up aunt matilda she was sure if they had never started this telegraphic company they might have struggled through the winter but now there were stockholders and creditors and she did not know what all she only knew that it was too much for them  three days after this harry received a note from mr martin when he read it he gave a shout that brought everybody out of the housekate first when she read the note which she took from harry as he was waving it around his head she stood bewildered she could not comprehend it  and yet it simply contained a proposition from the mica mine company to buy the crooked creek telegraph line with all its rights and privileges assuming all debts and liabilities and to pay therefor the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars in cash    two days afterward the line was formally sold to the mica company and the crooked creek telegraph company came to an end  when accounts were settled aunt matildas share of the proceeds of the sale were found to amount to two hundred and sixtytwo dollars and fifty cents which kate deposited with mr darby for safe keeping  it was only the sky that now looked blue to harry and kate  the akeville people were a good deal surprised at this apparently singular transaction on the part of the mica company but before long their reasons for helping the boys to put up their line and then buying it became plain enough  the mica company had invested a large capital in mines and lands and the business required telegraphic communication with the north the managers knew that they might have a good deal of trouble to get permission to put up their line on the lands between the mines and hetertown and so they wisely helped the boys to put up the line and then bought it of them with all their rights and privileges  there was probably some sharp practice in this transaction but our young friends and aunt matilda profited by it     chapter xxviii  a meeting   about a week after the dissolution of the crooked creek company harry was riding over from hetertown and had nearly reached the creek on his way home when he met george purvis  this was their first meeting since their fight for george had been away on a visit to some relatives in richmond  when harry saw george riding slowly toward him he felt very much embarrassed and very much annoyed because he was embarrassed  how should he meet george what should he say or should he say anything  he did not want to appear anxious to make up with him nor did he want to seem as if he bore malice toward him if he only knew how george felt about it  as it was he wished he had stopped somewhere on the road he had thought of stopping at the millwhy had he not that would just have given george time to pass  both boys appeared to be riding as slowly as their horses would consent to go and yet when they met harry had not half made up his mind what he would say or how he should say it or whether it would be better or not to say anything  hello george said he quite unpremeditatedly  hello said george reining in his horse where are you going  going home said harry also stopping in the road  thus the quarrel came to an end  so youve sold the telegraph said george  yes said harry and i think we made a pretty good bargain i didnt think wed do so well when we started  no it didnt look like it said george but those mica men maynt find it such a good bargain for them  why asked harry  well suppose some of the people who own the land that the lines on dont want these strangers to have a telegraph on their farms whats to hinder them ordering them off  they wouldnt do that said harry none of the people about here would be so mean theyd know that it might upset our bargain there isnt a man who would do it  all right said george i hope they wont but how are you going to keep the old woman now  how said harry why we can keep her easy enough we got three hundred and fifty dollars from the mica company  and how much is her share  over two hundred and sixty answered harry  is that all said george that wont give her much income the interest on it will only be about fifteen dollars a year and she cant live on that  but we didnt think of using only the interest said harry  so youre going to break in on the principal are you thats a poor way of doing  oh well get along well enough said harry two hundred and sixty dollars is a good deal of money goodby i must get on come up selim  goodby said george and he spurred up his horse and rode off gayly  but not so harry he was quite depressed in spirits by georges remarks he wished he had not met him and he determined that he would not bother his head by looking at the matter as george did it was ridiculous  but the more he thought of it the more sorry he felt that he had met george purvis     chapter xxix  once more in the woods   harry said kate the next day after this meeting when are you going to get your gun back  get my gun back exclaimed harry how am i to do that  why theres money enough answered kate you only lent your gunmoney to aunt matildas fund take out enough and get your gun back  that sounds very well said harry but we havent so much money after all the interest on what we have wont begin to support aunt matilda and we really ought not to break in on the principal  kate did not immediately answer she thought for a while and then she said  well thats what i call talking nonsense you must have heard some one say something like that you never got it out of your own head  it may not have come out of my own head said harry who had not told kate of his meeting with george purvis but it is true for all that it seems to me that whatever we do seems all right at first and then fizzles out this telegraph business has done that straight along  no it hasnt said kate with some warmth its turned out firstrate i think that interest idea is all stuff as if we wanted to set up aunt matilda with an income that would last forever here comes father im going to ask him about the gun  when mr loudon had had the matter laid before him he expressed his opinion without any hesitation  i think harry said he that you certainly ought to go and get your gun  and harry went and got it  the rest of that day which was saturday was delightful both to harry and kate harry cleaned and polished up his gun and kate sat and watched him it seemed like old times during those telegraphic days when they were all thinking of business and making money they seemed to have grown old  but all that was over now and they were a girl and a boy again late in the afternoon harry went out and shot halfadozen partridges which were cooked for supper and mrs loudon said that that seemed like the good old style of things she had feared that they were never going to have any more game on their table  on the following wednesday there was a halfholiday and harry was about to start off with his gun when he proposed that kate should go with him  but youre going after birds said kate and i cant go where youll want to goamong the stubble and bushes  oh i shant go much after birds said harry i wanted to borrow captain casebys dog but hes going to use him himself today and so i dont expect to get much game but we can have a good walk in the woods  all right said kate ill go along and away she went for her hat  the walk was charming it was now september and the fields were full of brightcolored fall flowers while here and there a sweetgum tree began to put on autumn tints the sun was bright and there was a strong breeze full of piney odors from the forests to the west  they saw no game and when they had rambled about for an hour or so they sat down under an oaktree on the edge of the woods and while they were talking an idea came into harrys head he picked a great big fat toadstool that was growing near the roots of the tree and carrying it about sixty feet from the tree he stuck it up on a bush  now then said he taking up his gun cocking it and handing it to kate you take a shot at that mark  do you mean that i shall shoot at it exclaimed kate  certainly said harry you ought to know how to shoot and it wont be the first time you have fired a gun take a shot  all right said kate and she took off her hat and threw it on the grass then she took the gun and raised it to a level with her eye  be easy now said harry hold the butt close against your shoulder take your time and aim right at the middle of the mark  im afraid im shutting the wrong eye said kate i always do  shut your left eye said harry get the sight right between your other eye and the mark  kate took a good long aim and then summoning all her courage she pulled the trigger  the gun went off with a tremendous bang the toadstool trembled for an instant and then tumbled off the bush  hurra shouted harry youve hit it fair and he ran and brought it to her riddled with shotholes kate was delighted with her success and would have been glad to have spent the rest of the afternoon firing at a mark but harry was not well enough supplied with powder and shot for that however he gave her another shot at a piece of paper on the bush she made three shotholes in it and harry said that would do very well he then loaded up again and then they started off for home the path they took led through a corner of the woods  they had not gone far before they met gregory montague  oh mahsr harry said gregory i done foun a bees nes  where cried harry  down in a big tree in de holler dar pointing over toward the thickest part of the woods you have to go fru de brush and bushes but its a powerful big nest mahsr harry right in de holler ob de tree  are you sure its a bees nest said harry how do you know  i knows its a bees nest said gregory somewhat reproachfully didnt i see de bees goin in an out fru a little hole  kate said harry you hold this gun a little while ill run down there and see if it is really a beetree that he has found hold it under your arm that way with the muzzle down thats it ill be back directly and away he ran with gregory  and now kate was left alone in the woods with a gun under her arm it was a new experience for her she felt proud and pleased to have control of a gun and it was not long before she began to think that it would be a splendid thing if she could shoot something that would do for supper how surprised they would all be if she should bring home some game that she had shot all by herself  she made up her mind that she would do it if she could see anything to shoot  and so she walked quietly along the path with her thumb on the hammer of the gun all ready to cock it the instant she should see a good chance for a shot     chapter xxx  a girl and a gun   a short distance beyond the place where kate had been left there was a small bypath and when still carefully carrying her gun she reached this path kate stopped here would be a good place she thought to wait for game something would surely come into that little path if she kept herself concealed  so she knelt down behind a small bush that grew at a corner of the two paths and putting her gun through the bush rested the barrel in a crotch  the gun now pointed up the bypath and there was an opening in the bush through which kate could see for some distance  here then she watched and waited  the first thing that crossed the path was a very little bird it hopped down from a twig it jerked its head about it pecked at something on the ground and then flew up into a tree kate would not have shot it on any account for she knew it was not good to eat but she could not help wondering how people ever did shoot birds if they did not hold still any longer than that little creature did  then there appeared a small brown lizard it came very rapidly right down the path toward kate  if it comes all the way thought kate i shall have to jump  but it did not come all the way and kate remained quiet  for some time no living creatures except butterflies and other insects showed themselves then all of a sudden there popped into the middle of the path not very far from kate a real live rabbit  it was quite a goodsized rabbit and kate trembled from head to foot here was a chance indeed  to carry home a fat rabbit would be a triumph she aimed the gun as straight toward the rabbit as she could having shut the wrong eye several times before she got the matter arranged to her satisfaction then she remembered that she had not cocked the gun and so she had to do that which of course made it necessary for her to aim all over again  she cocked only one hammer and she did it so gently that it did not frighten the rabbit although he flirted his ears a little when he heard the click click everything was so quiet that he probably thought he heard some insect probably a young or ignorant cricket that did not know how to chirp properly  so he sat very still and nibbled at some leaves that were growing by the side of the path he looked very pretty as he sat there taking his dainty little bites and jerking up his head every now and then as if he were expecting somebody  i must wait till hes done eating thought kate it would be cruel to shoot him now  then he stopped nibbling all of a sudden as if he had just thought of something and as soon as he remembered what it was he twisted his head around and began to scratch one of his long ears with his hind foot he looked so funny doing this that kate came near laughing but fortunately she remembered that that would not do just then  when he had finished scratching one ear he seemed to consider the question whether or not he should scratch the other one but he finally came to the conclusion that he would not he would rather hop over to the other side of the path and see what was there  this of course made it necessary for kate to take a new aim at him  whatever it was that he found on the other side of the path it grew under the ground and he stuck his head down as far as he could get it and bent up his back as if he were about to try to turn a somersault or to stand on his head  how round and soft he is thought kate how i should like to pat him i wonder when hell find whatever it is that hes looking for what a cunning little tail  the cunning little tail was soon clapped flat on the ground and mr bunny raised himself up and sat on it he lifted his nose and his forepaws in the air and seemed to be smelling something good his queer little nose wiggled so comically that kate again came very near bursting out laughing  how i would love to have him for a pet she said to herself  after sniffing a short time the rabbit seemed to come to the conclusion that he was mistaken after all and that he did not really smell anything so very good he seemed disappointed however for he lifted up one of his little forepaws and rubbed it across his eyes but perhaps he was not so very sorry but only felt like taking a nap for he stretched himself out as far as he could and then drew himself up in a bunch as if he were going to sleep  i wish he wouldnt do that thought kate anxiously i dont want to shoot him in his sleep  but bunny was not asleep he was thinking he was trying to make up his mind about something there was no way of finding out what it was that he was trying to make up his mind about he might have been wondering why some plants did not grow with their roots uppermost so that he could get at them without rubbing his little nose in the dirt or why trees were not good to eat right through trunk and all or he might have been trying to determine whether it would be better for him to go over to lijah fords garden and try to get a bite at some cabbageleaves or to run down to the field just outside of the woods where he would very likely meet a certain little girl rabbit that he knew very well  but whatever it was he had no sooner made up his mind about it than he gave one big hop and was out of sight in a minute  there cried kate hes gone  i reckon he thought hed guv you bout chance enough miss kate said a voice behind her and turning hurriedly she saw uncle braddock  why how did you come here she exclaimed i didnt hear you  reckon not miss kate said the old man you dont spose i was agoin to frighten away yer game i seed you astoopin down aimin at somethin and i jist creeped along a little at a time to see what it was why what did come over you miss kate to let that ole har go it was the puttiest shot i ever did see  oh i couldnt fire at the dear little thing while it was eating so prettily said kate letting down the hammer of the gun as easily as she could and then he cut up such funny little capers that i came near laughing right out i couldnt shoot him while he was so happy and im glad i didnt do it at all  all right miss kate said uncle braddock as he started off on his way through the woods that may be a werry pious way to go ahuntin but it wont bring you in much meat  when harry came back from hunting for the beetree which he did not find he saw kate walking slowly down the path toward the village the gun under her arm with the muzzle carefully pointed toward the ground     chapter xxxi  a man in a boat   on a very pleasant afternoon that fall a man came down crooked creek in a small flatbottomed boat he rowed leisurely as if he had been rowing a long distance and felt a little tired in one end of the boat was a small trunk  as this man who had red hair and a red face and large red hands pulled slowly along the creek turning his head every now and then to see where he was going he gradually approached the bridge that crossed the creek near oneeyed lewstons cabin just before he reached the bridge he noticed what seemed to him a curious shadow running in a thin straight line across the water resting on his oars and looking up to see what there was above him to throw such a shadow he perceived a telegraph wire stretching over the creek and losing itself to sight in the woods on each side  a telegraph wire was an ordinary sight to this man but this particular wire seemed to astonish him greatly  what on earth is this he asked out loud but there was no one to answer him and so after puzzling his mind for a few minutes he rowed on  when that man reached the point in the creek to which he was bound and with his trunk on his shoulder walked up to the house where he used to live he was still more astonished for a telegraph wire ran through one corner of the back yard  cousin maria now lived in this house and george mason was coming to pay her a visit his appearance was rather a surprise to her but still she welcomed him she was a good soul  almost before he asked her how she was he put the question to her  what telegraph lines that  so cousin maria wiped her hands on her long gingham apron she had been washing her best set of china and she sat down and told him all about it  you see george said she that there line was the boys telegraph line afore they sold it to the mica people and when the boys put it up they expected to make a heap of money which i reckon they didnt do or else they wouldnt have sold it but these mica people wanted it and they lengthened it at both ends and bought it of the boysor rather of harry loudon for he was the smartest of the lot and the real owner of the thinghe and his sister kateas far as i could see and when they stretched the line over to hetertown they came to me and told me how the line ran along the road most of the way but that they could save a lot of time and money though i dont see how they could save much of a lot of money when accordin to all accounts the whole line didnt cost much bein just fastened to pinetrees trimmed off and if it had cost much them boys couldnt have built it for i reckon the mica people didnt help em a great deal after all if i would let them cut across my grounds with their wire and i hadnt no objection anyway for the line didnt do no harm up there in the air and so i said certainly they might and they did and there it is  when george mason heard all this he walked out of the backdoor and over to the woodpile where he got an axe and cut down the pole that was in cousin marias back yard and when the pole fell it broke the wire just as mr martin had got to the sixth word of a message he was sending over to hetertown  cousin maria was outraged  george mason said she you can stay here as long as you like and you can have part of whatever ive got in the house to eat but ill never sit down to the table with you till youve mended that wire and nailed it to another pole  all right answered george mason then ill eat alone  when mr martin and the micamine people and the akeville people and harry and kate and all the boys and everybody black and white heard what had happened there was great excitement it was generally agreed that something must be done with george mason he had no more right to cut down that pole because he had once lived on the place than he had to go and cut down any of the neighbors beanpoles  so the sheriff and some deputy sheriffs tony kirk among them and a constable and a number of volunteer constables went off after george mason to bring him to justice  it was more than a week before they found him and it is probable that they would not have captured him at all had he not persisted in staying in the neighborhood so as to be on hand with his axe in case the line should be repaired  its all along of my tellin him that that line was got up by them loudon children said cousin maria he hates mr loudon worse than pisen because he was the man that found out all his tricks  mason was taken to the courthouse and locked up in the jail almost all the people of the county and some people belonging to adjoining counties made up their minds to be at the courthouse when his trial should take place  on the second night of his imprisonment george mason forced open a window of his cell and went away and what was more he staid away he had no desire to be at the courthouse when his trial took place  no one felt more profound satisfaction when george mason left the country and the telegraph line was once more in working order than harry and kate  they had an idea that if george mason should persist in cutting the telegraph line the mica company would give it up and that they might be called upon to refund the money on which aunt matilda depended for support they had been told that they need not trouble themselves about this as the mica company had taken all risks but still they were delighted when they heard that george mason had cleared out and that there was every reason to suppose that he would not come back     chapter xxxii  aunt matildas letter   one afternoon about the end of october aunt matilda was sitting in her big straightbacked chair on one side of her fireplace there was a wood fire blazing on the hearth for the days were getting cool and the old woman liked to be warm on the other side of the fireplace sat uncle braddock sitting on the floor between the two were john william webster and dick ford in the doorway stood gregory montague he was not on very good terms with aunt matilda and was rather afraid to come in all the way on the bed sat aunt judy  it must not be supposed that aunt matilda was giving a party nothing of the kind these colored people were not very much engrossed with business at this time of the year and as it was not far from suppertime and as they all happened to be near aunt matildas cabin that afternoon they thought theyd step in and see her  does any of you uns know asked aunt matilda whar ole miles is now dey tells me he dont carry de mails no more  no said john william webster who was always quick to speak dey done stop dat ar dey got so many letters up dar at de mica mines dat

pulled out a halfsheet of notepaper from behind the gourd the paper had been there a good while and was rather yellowlooking there was also a drop of molasses on one corner of it which john william said would do to seal it up with but gregory wiped it carefully off on the leg of his trousers  now den said aunt matilda sot yersef right down dar on de floor git off dat ar smooth board you dick an let gregry put his paper dar i haint got no pen but hyars a pencil miss kate lef one day but it aint got no pint ef some of you boys has got a knife ye kin put a pint to it  uncle braddock dived into

kindlinwood  none o yer laughin at dis knife said uncle braddock with a frown i done made dis hyar knife mesef  a better knife however was produced by dick ford and the pencil was sharpened then gregory montague stretched himself out on the floor resting on his elbows with the paper before him and the pencil in his hand  is you ready said aunt matilda  all right said gregory yer can go long  aunt matilda put her elbows on her knees and her chin in her hands and looked into the fire gregory and every one else waited quite a while for her to begin  ye had better put de number ob de year fus suggested uncle braddock  well ye kin put dat said aunt matilda while im aworkin out de letter in my mind  there now arose a discussion as to what was the number of the year aunt judy knew that the war was somewhere along in sixty and thought it must certainly be seventy or eighty by this time while uncle braddock who was accustomed to look back a long way was sure it was nigh on to a hunred  dick ford however although he was not a writer could read and had quite a fancy for spelling out a newspaper and he asserted that the year was eighteen hundred and seventy and so it was put down 180070 much to the disgust of uncle braddock who did not believe it was so much  yer ought to say ef its before christ or after christ said aunt judy old mahsr truly mathers splained dat to me bout years  well then said gregory ready with his pencil which is it  dick ford happened to know a little on the subject and so he told gregory how he should put down b c for before christ and a c for after christ and that a c was right for this year  this was set down in gregorys most careful lettering  dat dar hind letters got the stumicache said john william webster putting his long finger black on top and yellow underneath on the c which was rather doubled up  nobody thought of the month or the day and so the letter was considered dated  now den said gregory whos it to  jist never you mind whos it to answered aunt matilda i know an thats enough to know  but youve got to put de name on de back said aunt judy anxiously  dats so said uncle braddock with equal anxiety  no i haint remarked

what matters dat asked aunt judy  neber you mind replied aunt matilda  slowly and painfully gregory printed this sentence with dick ford close on one side of him with john williams round woolly head stuck almost under his chin with uncle braddock leaning over him from his chair and aunt judy standing peering down upon him from behind  dats wrong said dick ford noticing that gregory had written the last words thus rite 1 ter rite 2 she dont want no figgers  what did she say em fur den asked gregory  now gregry said aunt matilda put down dis      i dont want to make no trouble and i wouldnt do nothin to     trouble dem chillen but ise been awaitin a good long while now     and i been thinkin id better write an see bout it  what you want to see bout asked aunt judy quickly  neber you min

uncle braddock while aunt judy opened her eyes and her mouth simply because she could not open her ears any wider than they were  dats none o your business replied aunt matilda now put down      i spect dem telegram fixins cost a lot o money but i dont     spect its jist right to take all an ole womans money to build     em  lors ee ejaculated uncle braddock dats so  now you gregry continued aunt matilda put down      ef you write me a letter bout dat ar money you kin giv it to ole     miles  now sign my name to dat ar letter  the next day having been summoned by the obliging gregory old miles made his appearance in aunt matildas cabin  the old woman explained to him that the letter was so important that she could trust it to no one who was not accustomed to carry letters and miles was willing and proud to exercise his skill for her benefit  now den said she take dis hyar letter to de man what works de telegrum in hetertown and fotch me back an answer     chapter xxxiii  time to stop   about a week after this letter was written kate said to harry  you really ought to have aunt matildas roof mended there are several holes in it i think her house ought to be made tight and warm before winter dont you  certainly said harry ill get some shingles and nail them over the holes tomorrow  the next day was saturday and a rainy day about ten oclock harry went to aunt matildas cabin with his shingles and a hammer and nails kate walked over with him  to their surprise they found the old woman in bed  why what is the matter aunt matilda asked kate are you sick  no honey i isnt sick

o day  finding that aunt matilda was so much opposed to any carpenterwork on her premises at that time harry went home while kate remained to get the old woman some breakfast  aunt matilda felt better that afternoon and she sat up and ate her supper with uncle braddock who happened to be there but as she was evidently feeling the effects of her great age an arrangement was made by which aunt judy gave up her cabin and came to live with aunt matilda and take care of her  one morning about a week after the rainy saturday mrs loudon came over to see aunt matilda she found the old woman lying on the bed and evidently worried about something  you see miss mary said aunt matilda ise kind o disturbed in me min i rit a letter a long time ago and ole miles aint fetched me no answer yit and it sorter worries me  i didnt know you could write said mrs loudon somewhat surprised  neither i kin said aunt matilda i jist got dat gregry montague to write it fur me and dear knows what he put in it  who was your letter to aunt matilda asked mrs loudon  i do know his name but he works de telegrum at hetertown an i do min tellin you bout it miss mary ef you do worry dem chillen de letter was bout my money in de telegrum compny dat was reel silber money an i haint heerd nor seed nothin of it sence  when mrs loudon went home she told harry and kate of aunt matildas troubles  neither of them said anything at the time but harry put on his hat and went up to the store while kate sat down to her sewing  after a while she said  i think mother its pretty hard in aunt matilda after all weve done for her to think of nothing but the ten cents she put into the stock of the company  it is perfectly natural said mrs loudon that ten cents was her own private property and no matter how small a private property may be it is of greater interest to the owner than any other property in the world to be sure the money that was paid for the telegraph line is for aunt matildas benefit but you and harry have the management and the spending of it but that ten cents was all her own and she could spend it just as she chose  the next day kate went over to aunt matilda with two silver tencent pieces that harry had got from mr darby  aunt matilda said she this is not the very same tencent piece you put into the company but its just as good and harry thinks that you have about doubled your money and so heres another one  the old woman who was sitting alone by the fire wrapped up in a shawl took the money and putting it in the hollow of her bony hand gazed at it with delight  then she looked up at kate  you is good chillen she said you is mighty good chillen i dont spect ill lib much longer in dis hyar world ise so precious old dat its bout time to stop but i dont spects ill find nobody in heben thatll be more reel comfort to me dan you chillen  oh aunt matilda cried kate why youll meet all your friends and relations that you talk so much about and who died so long ago  well said aunt matilda very deliberately perhaps i shall and perhaps i shant deres no tellin but dere aint no mistakin bout you chillen  that afternoon when uncle braddock called aunt matilda said to him  ef you see ole miles ye kin tell him he neednt bring me no answer to dat letter  very early one morning a few days after this kate went over to aunt matildas cabin  she saw aunt judy standing at the door  hows aunt matilda asked kate  gone to glory said aunt judy  aunt matilda was buried under a birchtree near the church that she used to attend when able to walk  that portion of her fund which remained unexpended at the time of her death was used to pay her funeral expenses and to erect a suitable tombstone over her grave on the stone was an inscription harry composed it and kate copied it carefully for the stonecutter  and thus after much hard labor and anxious thought after many disappointments and a great deal of discouragement harry and kate performed to the end the generous task they had set themselves which was just what might have been expected of such a boy and such a girl  the end
