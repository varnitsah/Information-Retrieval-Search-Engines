beneath the alders by the waterside though the cornfields that rolled back up the hill glowed a coppery yellow in the light of the setting sun it was hot and for the most part strangely quiet in the bottom of the valley since the hammers had stopped but now and then an order was followed by a tramp of feet and the rattle of chaintackle along one bank of the river the reflections of the trees quivered in darkgreen masses the rest of the water was dazzlingly bright  a pontoon bridge dotted with figures in khaki crossed a deep pool at its head where a white road ran down the hill a detachment of engineers lounged in the shade their faces were grimed with sweat and dust and some with coats unbuttoned sprawled in the grass they had toiled hard through the heat of the day and now were enjoying an easy until they should be called to attention when their work was put to the test  as lieutenant richard brandon stood where the curve was boldest at the middle of the bridge he had no misgivings about the result so far as the section for which he was responsible was concerned he was young but there was some ground for his confidence for he not only had studied all that textbooks could teach him but he had the constructors eye which sees halfinstinctively where strength or weakness lies brandon began his military career as a prize cadet and after getting his commission he was quickly promoted from subaltern rank his advancement however caused no jealousy for dick brandon was liked he was perhaps a trifle priggish about his workcocksure his comrades called itbut about other matters he was na√Øvely ingenuous indeed acquaintances who knew him only when he was off duty thought him something of a boy  in person he was tall and strongly made with a frank sunburned face his jaw was square and when he was thoughtful his lips set firmly his lightgray eyes were clear and steady he was genial with his comrades but usually diffident in the company of women and older men  presently the adjutant came up and stopping near glanced along the rippling line that marked the curve of the bridge  these center pontoons look rather prominent as if theyd been pushed upstream a foot or two he remarked was that done by captain maitlands order  no sir dick answered with some awkwardness for one thing i found theyd lie steadier out of the eddy  they do but i dont know that its much of an advantage had you any other reason for modifying the construction plans  dick felt embarrassed he gave the adjutant a quick glance but the mans face was inscrutable captain hallam was a disciplinarian where discipline was needed but he knew the value of what he called initiative  well dick tried to explain if you notice how the wash of the headrapid sweeps down the middle of the pool  i have noticed it said the adjutant dryly thats why the bridge makes a slight sweep but go on  we found a heavy drag on the center that flattened the curve of course if we could have pushed it up farther wed have got a stronger form  why  its obvious sir if we disregard the moorings a straight bridge would tend to curve downstream and open out under a shearing strain as we get nearer the arch form it naturally gets stiffer because the strain becomes compressive after making the bridge strong enough for traffic the problem is to resist the pressure of the current  true the adjutant agreed with a smile well well let the pontoons stand the traditions of the british army are changing fast but while we dont demand the old mechanical obedience it might be better not to introduce too marked innovations anyhow its not desirable that they should so to speak strike a commanding officer in the eye some officers are conservative and dont like that kind of thing  he moved on and dick wondered whether he had said too much he was apt to forget his rank and comparative unimportance when technical matters were discussed in fact it was sometimes difficult not to appear presumptuous but when one knew that one was right  in the meantime the adjutant met the colonel and they stopped together at the bridgehead  i think we have made a good job but the brigades transport is pretty heavy the colonel remarked  im satisfied with the bridge sir very creditable work for beginners if the other branches of the new armies are as good  the men are in earnest things of course are changing and i suppose oldfashioned prejudices must go overboard personally i liked the type we had before the war but well let that go young brandon strikes me as particularly keen  keen as mustard the adjutant agreed in other ways perhaps hes more of the kind you have been used to  now i wonder what you mean by that youre something of what theyre pleased to call a progressive arent you however i like the lad his work is good  he knows sir  ah said the colonel i think i understand but what about the drawings of the new pontoons they must be sent tonight  theyre ready to tell the truth i showed them to brandon and he made a good suggestion about the rounding of the waterline  the colonel looked thoughtful  well the idea of a combined pontoon and light boat that would carry troops is by no means new but these are rather an unusual type and if it were known that we were building them it might give the enemy a hint i suppose you told brandon the things to be kept quiet  yes i made it plain the adjutant said and they walked on  dick had been sitting on the bridge but he jumped up as a rhythmic tramp of feet came down the hillside dust rose among the cornfields and hung in a white streak along the edge of a wood and then with a twinkling flash of steel small ochercolored figures swung out of the shadow they came on in loose fours in an unending line that wound down the steep slopes and reached the bridgehead then orders rolled across the stream the line narrowed and the measured tramp changed to a sharp uneven patter the leading platoon were breaking step as they crossed the bridge dick frowned impatiently this was a needless precaution the engineers work was good it would stand the percussive shock of marching feet  he stood at attention with a sparkle in his eyes as the hot and dusty men went by they were for the most part young men newly raised infantry now being hardened and tempered until they were fit to be used as the armys spearhead in some desperate thrust for which engineers and artillery had cleared the way it was some time before the first battalion crossed but the long yellow line still ran back up the hillside to the spot at which it emerged from the deepening shade and the next platoon took the bridge with unbroken step it swayed and shook with a curious regular tremble as the feet came down but there was no giving way of tie and stringerbeam and dick forgot the men who were passing and thought of fastenings and stressed material  he was young and the pomp of war had its effect on him but the human element began to take second place although an officer of the new army he was first of all an engineer his business was to handle wood and iron rather than men the throb of the planks and the swing of the pontoons as the load passed over them fascinated him and his interest deepened when the transport began to cross sweating spumeflecked horses trod the quivering timber with ironshod hoofs grinding wheels jarred the structure as the wagons passed he could feel it yield and bend but it stood and dick was conscious of a strange emotional thrill this in a sense was his triumph the first big task in which he had taken a mans part and his work had passed the test taste inclination and interest had suddenly deepened into an absorbing love for his profession  after a time the adjutant sent for him and held out a large sealed envelope  these are the plans i showed you he said colonel farquhar is driving to newcastle and will stop at storeton grange for supper at midnight the plans must be delivered to him there you have a motorcycle i think  yes  very well it is not a long ride but ill release you from duty now dont be late at storeton take care of the papers and get colonel farquhars receipt  there was a manufacturing town not far off and dick decided to go there and spend the evening with a cousin of his they might go to a theater or if not lance would find some means of amusing him as a rule dick did not need amusing but he felt that he must celebrate the building of the bridge  lance brandon was becoming known as an architect and he had a good deal of constructive talent the physical likeness between him and dick was rather marked but he was older and they differed in other respects lance knew how to handle men as well as material and perhaps he owed as much to this as to his artistic skill his plans for a new church and the remodeling of some public buildings had gained him recognition but he already was popular at country houses in the neighborhood and was courted by the leading inhabitants of the town  dick and he dined at the best hotel and lance listened sympathetically to the description of the bridge he was not robust enough for the army but he hinted that he envied dick and dick felt flattered he sometimes bantered lance about his social gifts and ambitions but he had never resented the favors his father had shown his cousin lance had been left an orphan at an early age and the elder brandona man of means and standinghad brought him up with his son they had been good friends and dick was pleased when his father undertook to give lance a fair start at the profession he chose he imagined that now lance was beginning to make his mark his allowance had stopped but this was not his business lance was a very good sort although he was clever in ways that dick was not and indeed rather despised  what shall we do next dick asked when they had lounged for a time in the smokingroom  lance made a gesture of resignation as he stretched himself in a big chair he was dressed with quiet taste his face was handsome but rather colorless and his movements were languid  youre such an energetic beggar he complained the only theater where they put on plays worth seeing is closed just now but theres a new dancer at the nearest hall and we might look in i hope my churchwarden patrons wont disapprove if they hear of it because they talk about building an ornamental mission room  dick laughed  they wouldnt find fault with you somehow nobody does  theres some truth in that the secret is that i know when to stop one can enjoy life without making the pace too hot people arent really censorious and even the narrowminded sort allow you certain limits in fact i imagine they rather admire you if you can play with fire and not get singed women do anyhow and in a sense their judgments logical the thing that doesnt hurt you cant be injurious and it shows moderation and selfcontrol if you dont pass the danger line  how do you know when you have come to the line  well smiled lance experience helps but i think its an instinct of course if you do show signs of damage youre done for because then the people who envied you throw the biggest stones  lets start said dick im not much of a philosopher building bridges and digging saps is good enough for me  theyre healthy occupations so long as you dont get shot but considering everything its strange that they still monopolize your interest  dick colored he knew what his cousin meant he had been attracted by a girl of whom his father approved and who was wellbred pretty and rich dick imagined that his fathers views were agreeable to helens relatives and that she was not ignorant of this still nothing had been actually arranged and although he admired helen it would be time enough to think of marriage when he was a captain for instance  pontoons and excavations have their charm for men with constructive tastes lance went on but you may find later that they dont satisfy all your needs  get your hat dick returned with a smile jumping up as he spoke  the musichall was badly filled the audience seemed listless and the performance dragged even the muchpraised dancer was disappointing and there was an unusual number of shabby loungers in the bar dick had come prepared to enjoy himself after a day of arduous work and by way of doing so he ordered a drink or two that he did not really want as a rule he was abstemious but the hall was very hot it struck him as glaring and tawdry after the quiet dale where the water sparkled among the stones and the pallid loungers with their stamp of indulgence differed unpleasantly from the hard brownfaced men he led  lets clear out he said at last is there anywhere else to go  my rooms lance suggested  oh i want something fresh tonight dick replied with a smile  lance pondered  well i can show you some keen cardplay and perhaps a clever game of billiards besides a girl whos a great deal prettier than the dancer but its four miles out of town  dick glanced at his watch  i can take you on the carrier he said ive plenty of time yet  they set off and presently stopped at a tall iron gate on the edge of a firwood a glimmer of lights indicated that a house stood at the end of the drive  kenwardine will be glad to receive you as a friend of mine lance said and you neednt play unless you like hes fond of company and generally has a number of young men about the place  a private gambling club  oh no youre very far from the mark kenwardine certainly likes a bet and sometimes runs a bank but all he wins wouldnt do much to keep up a place like this however you can see for yourself  dick was not a gambler and did not play many games but he wanted a little excitement and he looked forward to it as he followed his cousin up the drive     chapter ii  dicks troubles begin   it was with mixed feelings that clare kenwardine got down from the stopping train at a quiet station and waited for the trap to take her home the trap was not in sight but this did not surprise her for nobody in her fathers household was punctual clare sometimes wondered why the elderly groomgardener whose wages were very irregularly paid stayed on unless it was because his weakness for liquor prevented his getting a better post but the servants liked her father for he seldom found fault with them kenwardine had a curious charm which his daughter felt as strongly as anybody else though she was beginning to see his failings and had indeed been somewhat shocked when she came home to live with him not long before  now she knitted her level brows as she sat down and looked up the straight white road it ran through pastures and yellow cornfields where harvesters were at work to a moor on which the ling glowed red in the fading light near the station a dark firwood stretched back among the fields and a row of beeches rose in dense masses of foliage beside the road there was no sound except the soft splash of a stream everything was peaceful but clare was young and tranquillity was not what she desired she had indeed had too much of it in the sleepy cathedral town she had left  her difficulty was that she felt drawn in two different ways for she had inherited something of her fathers recklessness and love of pleasure though her mother who died when clare was young had been a shy puritan clare was kept at school much longer than usual and when she insisted on coming home she found herself puzzled by her fathers way of living young men and particularly army officers frequented the house stylish women came down from town often without their husbands and there was generally some exciting amusement going on this had its attraction for clare but her delicate refinement was sometimes offended and once she was even alarmed one of the young men had shown his admiration for her in a way that jarred and soon afterward there had been a brawl over a game of cards  kenwardine had then suggested that she make a long visit to her aunts in the cathedral town they had received her gladly but she soon found her stay there irksome the aunts were austere religious women who moved in a narrow groove and ordered all their doings by a wornout social code still they were kind and gave clare to understand that she was to stay with them always and have no more to do with kenwardine than duty demanded the girl rebelled she shrank with innate dislike from license and dissipation but the life her aunts led was dreary and she could not give up her father though inexperienced she was intelligent and she saw that her path would not be altogether smooth now that she was going home for good while she thought about it the trap arrived and the shabby groom drove her up the hill with confused apologies  an hour or two after clare reached home lance and dick brandon entered the house and were met by kenwardine in the hall he wore a velvet jacket over his evening clothes and dick noticed a winestain on the breast he was thin but his figure was athletic although his hair was turning gray and there were wrinkles about his eyes  very glad to see your cousin he said to lance and turned to dick with a smile soldiers have a particular claim on our hospitality but my house is open to anybody of cheerful frame of mind one must relax now and then in times like these  thats why i brought dick lance replied he believes in tension but i wonder whether your notion of relaxing is getting lax  theres a difference though its sometimes rather fine kenwardine answered with a twinkle but come in and amuse yourselves as you like if you want a drink you know where to find it  they played a game of billiards and then went into another room where dick lost a sovereign to kenwardine after that he sat in a corner smoking and languidly looking about for he had been hard at work since early morning two or three subaltern officers from a neighboring camp stood by the table besides several other men whose sunburned faces indicated a country life the carpets and furniture were getting shabby but the room was large and handsome with wellmolded cornices and paneled ceiling the play was not high and the men were quiet but the room was filled with cigar smoke and there was a smell of liquor dick did not object to drink and gambling in moderation though it was seldom that he indulged in either he found no satisfaction in that sort of thing and he now felt that some of kenwardines friends would do better to join the new armies than to waste their time as they were doing  at last kenwardine threw down the cards  i think we have had enough for a time he said shall we go into the musicroom for a change  dick followed the others and looked up with surprise when clare came in lance had spoken of a pretty girl but she was not the type dick had expected she wore a very plain white dress with touches of blue that emphasized her delicate coloring her hair was a warm yellow with deeper tones her features were regular and welldefined and dick liked the level glance of her clear blue eyes he thought they rested on him curiously for a moment she had kenwardines slender wellbalanced figure and her movements were graceful but dicks strongest impression was that she was out of place though perfectly at ease she did not fit into her environment she had a freshness that did not harmonize with cigar smoke and the smell of drink  clare gave him a pleasant smile when he was presented and after speaking to one or two of the others she went to the piano when kenwardine asked her to sing dick who was sitting nearest the instrument stooped to take a bundle of music from a cabinet she opened  no she said you may put those down im afraid we have nothing quite so good and perhaps its silly but ive fallen back on our own composers since the fourth of august  dick spread out the music to display the titles  these fellows have been dead some time he argued humorously theyd probably disown their descendants if theyd survived until now but heres a frenchmans work theyre on our side and his stuff is pretty good isnt it  clare smiled  yes she said its certainly good but id rather sing something english tonight  she began a patriotic ballad dick knew and liked he was not much of a musician but his taste was good the song rang true it was poetry and not warlike jingle but he had not heard it sung so well before clares voice had been carefully trained and she used it well but he knew that she had grasped the spirit of the song one or two of the men who had been sitting got up two young subalterns stood very stiff and straight but dick noted that kenwardine did not change his lounging attitude he was smiling and lance glancing at him looked amused dick remembered this afterward but he now felt that lance was not quite showing his usual good form  when the song was finished dick turned to clare he wanted to begin talking to her before anybody else came up  it was very fine i dont understand the technique of music but one felt that you got the song just right and then the way you brought out the idea  that is what the mechanical part is for she answered with a smile and a touch of color as it happens i saw an infantry brigade on the march today and watched the long line of men go by in the dust and sun perhaps that helps one to understand  did you see them cross the bridge dick asked eagerly  no she answered and he felt absurdly disappointed he would have liked to think that his work had helped her to sing  have you another like the first he asked  i never sing more than once she smiled then as lance and another man came toward them she added glancing at an open french window besides the room is very hot it would be cooler in the garden  dick was not a man of affairs but he was not a fool he knew that clare kenwardine was not the girl to attempt his captivation merely because he had shown himself susceptible she wanted him to keep the others off and he thought he understood this as he glanced at lances companion the fellow had a coarse red face and looked dissipated and even lances wellbred air was somehow not so marked as usual well he was willing that she should make any use of him that she liked  they passed the others and after stopping to tell kenwardine that she was going out clare drew back a curtain that covered part of the window dick stepped across the ledge and seeing that the stairs below were iron and rather slippery held out his hand to clare the curtain swung back and cut off the light and when they were near the bottom the girl tripped and clutched him her hand swept downward from his shoulder across his chest and caught the outside pocket of his coat while he grasped her waist to steady her  thank you she said i was clumsy but the steps are awkward and my shoes are smooth  dick was glad it was dark for he felt confused the girl had rested upon him for a moment and it had given him a thrill  they crossed the broad lawn half of it lay in shadow for a wood that rolled up a neighboring hillside cut off the light of the low half moon the air was still it was too warm for dew and there was a smell of flowersstocks dick thought and he remembered their pungent sweetness afterward when he recalled that night clare kept in the moonlight and he noted the elusive glimmer of her white dress she wore no hat or wrap and the pale illumination emphasized the slenderness of her figure and lent her an ethereal grace  they stopped at a bench beneath a copperbeech where the shadow of the leaves checkered with dark blotches the girls white draperies and dicks uniform some of the others had come out for there were voices in the gloom  perhaps you wonder why i brought you here clare said frankly  no dick answered if you had any reason im not curious and id rather be outside  well she said the light was rather glaring and the room very hot she paused and added mr brandons your cousin  he is and a very good sort he brought me tonight but i felt that it was perhaps something of an intrusion when you came in  you didnt feel that before  dick knew that he was on dangerous ground he must not admit that he suspected kenwardines motive for receiving promiscuous guests  well not to the same extent you see lance knows everybody and everybody likes him i thought i might be welcome for his sake  its plain that you are fond of your cousin but why did you imagine that i should think your visit an intrusion  dick was glad he sat in the shadow for his face was getting hot he could not hint that he had expected to find a rather daring coquettethe kind of girl in fact one would imagine a semiprofessional gamblers daughter to be it now seemed possible that he had misjudged kenwardine and he had certainly misjudged clare the girls surroundings were powerless to smirch her dick was sure of that  oh well he answered awkwardly although lance obviously knows your father pretty well it doesnt follow that hes a friend of yours  it does not she said in a curious tone but do you know the man he was with  i never saw him before and somehow i dont feel anxious to improve his acquaintance  clare laughed  thats a quick decision isnt it are you a judge of character she asked  i have been badly mistaken dick admitted with a smile still i know the people im going to like how is it i havent seen you about were not very far off and most of the people in the neighborhood have driven over to our camp  i only came home tonight after being away for some time  dick was relieved to learn this he did not like to think of her living at kenwardines house and meeting his friends it was scarcely half an hour since he met clare kenwardine but she had quite unconsciously he thought strongly impressed him in fact he felt rather guilty about it since he was in a manner expected to marry some one else he had no business to enjoy yielding to this strangers charm and to thrill at her touch  they sat in silence for a few moments and then lance strolled up with his companion  dont forget the time dick he remarked as he passed you mustnt let him keep you too long miss kenwardine he has an important errand to do for his colonel  if you dont mind i wont go just yet dick said to clare and understood from her silence that she did not want to dismiss him  for the first time since they were boys he was angry with his cousin it looked as if lance had meant to take him away when miss kenwardine needed him he was flattered to think she preferred his society to the redfaced mans and had used him to keep the other at a distance well he would stay to the last minute and protect her from the fellow or from anybody else  a little later kenwardine joined them and dick knew that he must go clare gave him her hand with a quick grateful look that made his heart beat and lance met him as he went into the house  youre cutting it very fine he said come along heres your cap  in a moment theres an infantry man i asked over to our camp  you havent time to look for him lance answered and goodhumoredly pushed dick into the hall get off at once a fellow i know will give me a lift home  dick ran down the drive and a few moments later his motorcycle was humming up the road he sped through a dark firwood where the cool air was filled with resinous scent and out across a hillside down which the stocked sheaves stood in silvery rows but he noticed nothing except that the white strip of road was clear in front his thoughts were back in the garden with clare kenwardine and he could smell the clogging sweetness of the stocks this was folly and he changed the gear on moderate hills and altered the control when the engine did not need it to occupy his mind but the picture of the girl he carried away with him would not be banished  for all that he reached storeton grange in time and running up the drive saw lights in the windows and a car waiting at the door getting down and stating his business he was shown into a room where a sternfaced man in uniform sat talking to another in evening clothes  i understand you come from captain hallam said the colonel  yes sir he sent me with some papers  you know what they are  plans of pontoons sir  very well said the colonel taking out a fountain pen let me have them  dick put his hand into his breastpocket which was on the outside of his coat the pocket was unbuttoned and the big envelope had gone he hurriedly felt the other pockets but they too were empty and his face got red  the colonel looked hard at him and then made a sign to the other man who quietly went out  you havent got the plans did you leave them behind  no sir dick said awkwardly i felt to see if they were in my pocket when i left the camp  the colonels face hardened  did you come straight here  no sir i had an hour or twos leave  and spent it with your friends had you anything to drink  yes sir  as much as or more than usual  perhaps a little more dick said in confusion  the colonel studied him with searching eyes and then took some paper from a case on the table and began to write he put the note in an envelope and gave it to dick  its your commanding officers business to investigate the matter and youll take him this report yourself to him or to the adjutant when you reach camp ill telegraph to see if you have done so  he raised his hand in sign of dismissal and dick went out crushed with shame and feeling that he was already under arrest if he were not in camp when the telegram came he would be treated as a deserter     chapter iii  the punishment   on reaching camp and reporting himself dick was sent to his tent where he slept until he was aroused by the bustle at reveille he had not expected to sleep but he was young and physically tired and the shock of trouble had as sometimes happens a numbing effect he awoke refreshed and composed though his heart was heavy as he dressed because he feared it was the last time that he would wear his countrys uniform the suspense was trying as he waited until the morning parade was over then he was summoned to a tent where the colonel and the adjutant sat  i have a telegram asking if you have arrived the colonel said in a curious dry tone you must understand that you have laid yourself open to grave suspicion  yes dick answered wondering whether the colonel meant that it might have been better if he had run away  very well you admitted having received the plans what did you do with them  buttoned them into the left pocket of my coat when i got to storeton the envelope was gone  how do you account for that  i cant account for it sir  the colonel was silent for a few moments and then he looked fixedly at dick  your statements were very unsatisfactory last night and now that you have had time to think over the matter i advise you to be frank its plain that you have been guilty of gross negligence but that is not the worst the drawings are of no direct use to the enemy but if they fell into their hands they might supply a valuable hint of the use to which we mean to put the pontoons you see what this implies  i dont know how we mean to use them sir and i dont want to hide anything  thats a wise resolve the colonel answered meaningly and dick colored after all there was something he meant to hide  you took the plans with you when you left the camp three or four hours before you were due at storeton said the adjutant where did you go  to my cousins rooms in the town  mr lance brandons said the adjutant thoughtfully did you stay there  no we dined at the george  a wellconducted house the adjutant remarked you took some wine at dinner  two glasses of light claret  then where did you go next  to the new musichall  and ordered drinks in the bar who suggested this  i cant remember dick replied with an angry flush of course i see where youre leading but i was quite sober when i left the hall  the adjutants expression puzzled him he had felt that the man was not unfriendly and now he looked disappointed  im not sure your statement makes things better the colonel observed with some dryness did you go straight to storeton from the hall  no sir i spent an hour at a friends house  whose house was it  dick pondered for a few moments and then looked up resolutely  i must decline to answer sir ive lost the plans and must take the consequences but i dont see why my private friends who have nothing to do with it should be involved in the trouble  the adjutant leaned forward across the table and said something quietly to the colonel and neither of them spoke for the next minute or two dick was sensible of physical as well as mental strain as he stood stiffly in the middle of the tent his knees felt weak little quivers ran through his limbs and a ray of hot sunshine struck through the hookedback flap into his face but he dared not relax his rigid pose  the two officers looked puzzled but grave  go back to your tent and stay there until i send for you the colonel said at last  dick saluted and went out and when he sat down on his campbed he moodily lighted a cigarette and tried to think his military career was ended and he was ruined but this was not what occupied him most he was wondering whether clare kenwardine had taken the plans if so it was his duty to accuse her but actuated by some mysterious impulse he had refused  the longer he thought about it the clearer her guilt became he was a stranger and yet she had suggested a stroll through the garden and had slipped and clutched him as they went down the steps her hand had rested on the pocket in which the envelope was she was the daughter of a man who kept a private gaming house it was not surprising that she was an adventuress and had deceived him by her clever acting for all that he could not condemn her there was a shadow of doubt and even if she were guilty she had yielded to some strong pressure from her father his feelings however were puzzling he had spent less than an hour in her society and she had ruined him but he knew that he would remember her as long as he lived  dicks common sense led him to smile bitterly he was behaving like a sentimental fool on the whole it was a relief when the adjutant came in  you must have known what the colonels decision would be he said with a hint of regret youre to be courtmartialed if you take my advice youll keep nothing back                                                    the courtmartial was over and dick could not question the justice of its sentencehe was dismissed from the army indeed it was better than he had expected somewhat to his surprise the adjutant afterward saw him alone  im thankful our official dutys done he said of course im taking an irregular line and if you prefer not to talk  you made me feel that you wanted to be my friend dick replied awkwardly  then i may perhaps remark that you made a bad defense in the army its better to tell a plausible tale and stick to it we like an obvious explanation now if you had admitted being slightly drunk  but i was sober  the adjutant smiled impatiently  so much the worse for you if you had been drunk youd have been turned out all the same but the reason would have been so to speak satisfactory now youre tainted by a worse suspicion personally i dont think the lost plans have any value but if they had it might have gone very hard with you he paused and gave dick a friendly glance well in parting ill give you a bit of advice stick to engineering which you have a talent for  he went out and not long afterward dick left the camp in civilians clothes but stopped his motorcycle on the hill and stood looking back with a pain at his heart he saw the rows of tents stretched across the smooth pasture the flag he had been proud to serve languidly flapping on the gentle breeze and the water sparkling about the bridge along the riverside barearmed men in shirts and trousers were throwing up banks of soil with shovels that flashed in the strong light he could see their cheerful brown faces and a smart young subaltern taking out a measuring line dick liked the boy who now no doubt would pass him without a look and he envied him with the keenest envy he had ever felt he had loved his profession and he was turned out of it in disgrace  it was evening when he stood in the spacious library at home glad that the light was fading as he confronted his father who sat with grim face in a big leather chair dick had no brothers and sisters and his mother had died long before he had not lived much at home and had been on good more than affectionate terms with his father indeed their relations were marked by mutual indulgence for dick had no interest outside his profession while mr brandon occupied himself with politics and enjoyed his prominent place in local society he was conventional and his manners were formal and dignified but dick thought him very much like lance although he had not lances genial humor  well he said when dick had finished you have made a very bad mess of things and it is of course impossible that you should remain here in fact you have rendered it difficult for me to meet my neighbors and take my usual part in public affairs  this was the line dick had expected him to take it was his fathers pride he had wounded and not his heart he did not know what to say and turning his head he looked moodily out of the open window the lawn outside was beautifully kept and the flowerborders were a blaze of tastefully assorted colors but there was something artificial and conventional about the garden that was as marked in the house somehow dick had never really thought of the place as home  i mean to go away he said awkwardly  the puzzling thing is that you should deny having drunk too much brandon resumed  but i hadnt done so you look at it as the others did why should it make matters better if id owned to being drunk  drunkenness his father answered is now an offense against good taste but not long ago it was thought a rather gentlemanly vice and a certain toleration is still extended to the man who does wrong in liquor perhaps this isnt logical but you must take the world as you find it i had expected you to learn more in the army than you seem to have picked up did you imagine that your promotion depended altogether upon your planning trenches and gunpits well  that kind of thing is going to count in the new armies dick replied being popular on guestnight at the mess wont help a man to hold his trench or work his gun under heavy fire  brandon frowned  you wont have an opportunity for showing what you can do i dont know where you got your utilitarian radical views but well keep to the point where do you think of going  to new york to begin with  why not montreal or cape town  well dick said awkwardly after what has happened id rather not live on british soil  then why not try hamburg  dick flushed  you might have spared me that sir i lost the plans i didnt sell them  very well this interview is naturally painful to us both and well cut it short but i have something to say it will not be forgotten that you were turned out of the army and if you succeeded me the ugly story would be whispered when you took any public post i cannot have our name tainted and will therefore leave the house and part of my property to your cousin whether you inherit the rest or not will depend upon yourself in the meantime i am prepared to make you an allowance on the understanding that you stay abroad until you are sent for  dick faced his father standing very straight with knitted brows  thank you sir but i will take nothing  may i ask why  if youd looked at the thing differently and shown a little kindness it would have cut me to the quick dick said hoarsely im not a thief and a traitor though ive been a fool and it hurts to know what you think im going away tomorrow and ill get on somehow without your help i dont know that ill come back if you do send for me  you dont seem to understand your position but you may come to realize it before very long brandon replied  he got up and dick left the library but he did not sleep that night it had been hard to meet his father and what he said had left a wound that would take long to heal now he must say goodby to helen this would need courage but dick meant to see her it was the girls right that she should hear his story and he would not steal away like a cur he did not think helen was really fond of him though he imagined that she would have acquiesced in her relatives plans for them both had things been different now of course that was done with but he must say goodby and she might show some regret or sympathy he did not want her to suffer but he did not think she would feel the parting much and she would not treat him as his father had done  when he called the next morning at an old country house he was told that miss massie was in the garden and going there he stopped abruptly at a gap in a shrubbery beyond the opening there was a stretch of smooth grass checkered by moving shadow and at one side a row of gladioli glowed against the paler bloom of yellow dahlias helen massie held a bunch of the tall crimson spikes and dick thought as he watched her with a beating heart that she was like the flowers they were splendid in form and color but there was nothing soft or delicate in their aggressive beauty helens hair was dark and her color high her black eyes were bright and her yellow dress showed a finely outlined form dick knew that she was proud resolute and selfconfident  then she turned her head and saw him and he knew that she had heard of his disgrace for her color deepened and her glance was rather hard than sympathetic the hand that held the flowers dropped to her side but she waited until he came up  i see you know and it doesnt matter who told you he said i felt i had to come before i went away  yes she answered calmly i heard you have courage dick but perhaps a note would have been enough and more considerate  dick wondered gloomily whether she meant that he might have saved her pain by staying away or that he had involved her in his disgrace by coming since his visit would be talked about he reflected bitterly that the latter was more probable  well he said we have been pretty good friends and im leaving the country i dont suppose i shall come back again  when do you go  now said dick i must catch the train at noon  helens manner did not encourage any indulgence in sentiment and he half resented this although it made things easier he could not say he had come to give her up because there had been no formal engagement still he had expected some sign of pity or regret  you dont defend yourself she remarked thoughtfully couldnt you have fought it out  there was nothing to fight for i lost the papers i was trusted with one cant get over that  but people may imagine you did something worse she paused for a moment and added dont you care what i might think  dick looked at her steadily you ought to know do you believe its possible i stole and meant to sell the plans  no she said with a touch of color but i would have liked you for your friends sake to try to clear yourself if you had lost the papers they would have been found and sent back as they were not it looks as if you had been robbed  that she could reason this out calmly struck dick as curious although he had long known that helen was ruled by her brain and not her heart  ive been careless and theres nothing to be done but take my punishment  she gave him a keen glance are you hiding something dick its your duty to tell all that you suspect  dick winced helen was right it was his duty but he was not going to carry it out he began to see what this meant but his resolution did not falter  if i knew id been robbed it would be different but i dont and if i blamed people who were found to be innocent id only make matters worse for myself  i suppose thats true she agreed coldly however you have made your choice and its too late now where are you going dick  to new york by the first boat from liverpool  he waited watching her and wondering whether she would ask him to stop but she said quietly well i shall no doubt hear how you get on  its unlikely he answered in a hard voice ive lost my friends with my character the best thing i can do is to leave them alone  then he looked at his watch and she gave him her hand for all that i wish you good luck dick  she let him go and as he went back to the gate he reflected that helen had taken the proper and tactful line by dismissing him as if he were nothing more than an acquaintance he could be nothing more now and to yield to sentiment would have been painful and foolish but it hurt him that she had realized this  when he wheeled his bicycle away from the gate he saw a boy who helped his fathers gardener running along the road and waited until he came up hot and panting the boy held out a small envelope  it came after you left mr dick he gasped  then you have been very quick  the lad smiled for dick was a favorite with his fathers servants  i thought youd like to have the note he answered and added awkwardly besides i didnt see you when you went  it was the first hint of kindness dick had received since his disgrace and he took the lads hand before he gave him half a crown though he knew that he must practise stern economy  thank you and goodby jim you must have taken some trouble to catch me he said  then he opened the envelope and his look softened  i heard of your misfortune and am very sorry but something tells me that you are not to blame the note ran and was signed clare kenwardine  for a moment or two dick was sensible of keen relief and satisfaction and then his mood changed this was the girl who had robbed and ruined him she must think him a fool tearing up the note he mounted his bicycle and rode off to the station in a very bitter frame of mind     chapter iv  adversity   when he had sold his motorcycle at liverpool dick found it would be prudent to take a thirdclass passage but regretted this as soon as the liner left the st georges channel the food though badly served was good of its kind and his berth was comfortable enough for a man who had lived under canvas but when the hatches were closed on account of bad weather the foul air of the steerage sickened him and the habits of his companions left much to be desired it was difficult to take refuge in the open air because the steerage deck was swept by bitter spray and often flooded as the big ship lurched across the atlantic against a western gale  a spraycloud veiled her forward when the bows plunged into a combers hollow side and then as they swung up until her forefoot was clear foam and green water poured aft in cataracts sometimes much of her hull before the bridge sank into the crest of a halfmile sea and lower decks and alleyways looked like rivers the gale held all the way across and dick felt jaded and gloomy when they steamed into new york a day late he had some trouble with the immigration officers who asked awkward questions about his occupation and his reason for giving it up but he satisfied them at length and was allowed to land  the first few days he spent in new york helped him to realize the change in his fortunes and the difficulties he must face until the night he lost the plans he had scarcely known a care life had been made easy and his future had looked safe he had seldom denied himself anything he had started well on a career he liked and all his thoughts were centered on fitting himself for it extravagance was not a failing of his but he had always had more money than would satisfy his somewhat simple needs now however there was an alarming difference  to begin with it was obvious that he could only stay for a very limited time at the cheap hotel he went to and his efforts to find employment brought him sharp rebuffs business men who needed assistance asked him curt questions about his training and experience and when he could not answer satisfactorily promptly got rid of him then he tried manual labor and found employment almost as hard to get the few dollars he earned at casual jobs did not pay his board at the hotel where he lived in squalid discomfort but matters got worse when he was forced to leave it and take refuge in a big tenement house overcrowded with unsavory foreigners from eastern europe new york was then sweltering under a heat wave and he came home tired by heavy toil or sickened by disappointment to pass nights of torment in a stifling foulsmelling room  he bore it for some weeks and then when his small stock of money was melting fast set off to try his fortune in the manufacturing towns of pennsylvania and ohio here he found work was to be had but the best paid kind was barred to untrained men by tradeunion rules and the rest was done by poles and ruthenians who led a squalid semicommunistic life in surroundings that revolted him still he could not be fastidious and took such work as he could get until one rainy evening when he walked home dejectedly after several days of enforced idleness a labor agents window caught his eye and he stopped amidst the crowd that jostled him on the wet sidewalk to read the notices displayed  one ticket stated that white men and particularly live mechanics were wanted for a job down south but dick hesitated for a few minutes fingering a dollar in his pocket carefully spent it would buy him his supper and leave something towards his meals next day and he had been walking about since morning without food if he went without his supper the agent in exchange for the dollar would give him the address of the man who wanted help but dick knew from experience that it did not follow that he would be engaged still one must risk something and the situation was getting desperate he entered the office and a clerk handed him a card  its right across the town but youd better get there quick he said the jobs a snap and ive sent a lot of men along  dick boarded a streetcar that took him part of the way but he had to walk the rest and was tired and wet when he reached an office in a side street a smart clerk took the card and gave him a critical glance  it looks as if we were going to be full up but ill put down your name and you can come back in the morning he remarked what do you call yourself  a civil engineer said dick but where is the job and whats the pay  i guess central america is near enough mighty fine country where rums good and cheap payll pan out about twofifty or perhaps three dollars if youre extra smart  you can get as much here dick objected thinking it unwise to seem eager  then why dont you get it the clerk inquired anyhow you wont be charged for board and all youll have to do is to drive breeds and niggers its a soft thing sure but you can light out now and come back if you feel its good enough for you to take your chance  dick went away and had reached the landing when a man who wore loose gray clothes and a big soft hat met him  what do you want he asked  ive been applying for the job in the south  the other gave him a searching glance and dick thought he noted his anxious look and wet and shabby clothes  what can you do he resumed  to begin with i can measure cubic quantities plan out excavating work and use the level if this kind of things not wanted i can handle a spade  where have you done your digging  in this city laying sewers for a contractor who the boys said had to squeeze us to make good the graft he put up to get the job  the other nodded thats so i know the man you can use a spade all right if you satisfied him but the sewers not finished yet why did you quit  the foreman fired three or four of us to make room for friends that a saloonkeeper who commands some votes sent along  well said the other smiling you seem to understand how our city bosses fix these things but my job will mean pretty tough work are you sure you want it  i cant find another dick answered frankly  very well ill put you on look round tomorrow and get your orders ive a notion that youre up against it heres a dollar on account  dick took the money he rather liked the man whose abruptness was disarmed by his twinkling smile for the first time with one exception during his search for employment he had been treated as a human being instead of an instrument for doing a certain amount of work  it was raining hard when he reached the street and supper would be over before he arrived at his cheap hotel where one must eat at fixed times or wait for the next meal there was however a small restaurant with an italian name outside a few blocks further on and going in he was served with wellcooked food and afterwards sat in a corner smoking and thinking hard he now felt more cheerful but the future was dark and he realized the difficulties in his path  american industry was highly organized the man who hoped for advancement must specialize and make himself master of some particular branch dick had specialized in england and thought he knew his subject but could not use his knowledge the americans to whom he tried to sell it would have none of him and dick owned that he could not blame them since it was natural to suppose that the man who was unfaithful to his country would not be loyal to his employer when he looked for other openings he found capital and labor arrayed in hostile camps there was mechanical work he was able to do but this was not allowed because the organized workers who had fought stubbornly for a certain standard of comfort refused to let untrained outsiders share the benefits they had won  business was left but it needed money and if he tried to enter it as a clerk he must first obtain smart clothes and find somebody to certify his ability and character which was impossible it looked as if he must be content with manual labor the wages it commanded were not low and he was physically strong but he shrank from the lives the lower ranks of toilers led when their work was done the crowded bunkhouse and squalid tenement revolted him still he was young and optimistic his luck might change when he went south and chance give him an opportunity of breaking through the barriers that shut him in he sat in the corner pondering until it got late and the tired italian politely turned him out  next morning he joined a group of waiting men at the railroad station they had a dejected look as they sat upon their bundles outside the agents office except for three or four who were cheerfully drunk their clothes were shabby and of different kinds for some wore cheap storesuits and some workstained overalls it was obvious that adversity had brought them together and dick did not think they would make amiable companions about half appeared to be americans but he could not determine the nationality of the rest who grumbled in uncouth english with different accents  by and by the clerk whom dick had met came out of the office with a bundle of tickets which he distributed and soon afterwards the train rolled into the depot dick was not pleased to find that a car had been reserved for the party since he would sooner have traveled with the ordinary passengers indeed when a dispute began as the train moved slowly through the wet street he left the car in passing through the next he met the conductor who asked for his ticket and after tearing off a section of the long paper gave him a card which he gruffly ordered him to stick in his hat then he put his hand on dicks shoulder and pushed him back through the vestibule  thats your car behind and youll stop right there he said next time you come out well put you off the train  dick resigned himself but stopped on the front platform and looked back as the train jolted across a rattling bridge a wide yellow river ran beneath it and the tall factories and rows of dingy houses were fading in the rain and smoke on the other side dick watched them until they grew indistinct and then his heart felt lighter he had endured much in the grimy town but all that was over after confronting with instinctive shrinking industrys grimmest aspect he was traveling toward the light and glamour of the south  entering the smoking compartment he found the disturbance had subsided and presently fell into talk with a man on the opposite seat who asked for some tobacco he told dick he was a locomotive fireman but had got into trouble the nature of which he did not disclose dick never learned much more about his past than this but their acquaintance ripened and kemp proved a useful friend  it was getting dark when they reached an atlantic port and were lined up on the terminal platform by a man who read out a list of their names he expressed his opinion of them with sarcastic vigor when it was discovered that three of the party had left the train on the way and then packed the rest into waiting automobiles which conveyed them to the wharf as fast as the machines would go  guess you wont quit this journey the man who jumps off will sure get hurt he remarked as they started  in spite of his precautions another of the gang was missing when they alighted and kemp the fireman grinned at dick  that fellows not so smart as he allows he said hed have gone in the last car where he could see in front if hed known his job  they were hustled up a steamers gangway and taken to the after end of the deck where their conductor turned his back on them for a few minutes while he spoke to a mate  nows your time said kemp if you feel you want to quit  dick looked about the spardeck on which the boats were stowed covered the spot where he stood and the passage beneath the stanchions was dark there was nobody at the top of the gangway under the big cargolamp and its illumination did not carry far across the wharf if he could reach the latter he would soon be lost in the gloom and he was sensible of a curious impulse that urged him to flight it almost amounted to panic and he imagined that the other mens desertion must have daunted him for a few moments he struggled with the feeling and then conquered it  no he said firmly ill see the thing through  kemp nodded well i guess its too late now  two seamen sent by the mate went to the top of the gangway and the fellow who had brought the party from the station stood on guard near dick afterward realized that much depended on the choice he swiftly made and wondered whether it was quite by chance he did so  you were pretty near going his companion resumed  yes said dick thoughtfully i believe i was as a matter of fact i dont know why i stopped  the other smiled ive felt like that about risky jobs i took sometimes i lit out and sometimes i didnt but found out afterward i was right either way if you feel you have to go the best thing you can do is to get a move on  dick agreed with this he did not understand it but knew that while he had still had time to escape down the gangway and felt strongly tempted to do so it was impressed upon him that he must remain  a few minutes later their conductor left them with a sarcastic farewell the ropes were cast off and the steamer swung out from the wharf when with engines throbbing steadily she headed down the bay dick went to his berth and on getting up next morning found the american coast had sunk to a low gray streak to starboard a fresh southwest breeze was blowing under a cloudy sky and the vessel rolling viciously lurched across the whitetopped combers of the warm gulf stream  after breakfast some of his companions gathered into listless grumbling groups and some brought out packs of greasy cards but dick sat by himself wondering with more buoyant feelings what lay before him he had known trouble and somehow weathered it and now he was bound to a country where the sun was shining it was pleasant to feel the soft air on his face and the swing of the sprayveiled bows after all good fortune might await him down south     chapter v  the concrete truck   it was very hot in the deep hollow that pierced the mountain range behind santa brigida on the caribbean sea the black peaks cut against a glaring sky and the steep slopes of red soil and volcanic cinders on one side of the ravine were dazzlingly bright the other was steeped in blue shadow that scarcely seemed to temper the heat and the darkskinned men who languidly packed the ballast among the ties of a narrowgage railroad that wound up the hill panted as they swung their shovels at its lower end the ravine opened on to a valley that got greener as it ran down to the glittering sea on the edge of which feathery palms clustered round santa brigida  the old city dominated by its twin cathedral towers shone ethereally white in the distance with a narrow fringe of flashing surf between it and the vivid blue of the caribbean it was a thriving place as the black dots of steamers in the roadstead showed for of late years american enterprise had broken in upon its lethargic calm the population was for the most part of spanish stock that had been weakened by infusions of indian and negro blood but there were a number of chinamen and french creoles besides these americans britons and european adventurers had established themselves and the town was a hotbed of commercial and political intrigue the newcomers were frankly there for what they could get and fought cunningly for trading and agricultural concessions the leading citizens of comparatively pure spanish strain despised the grasping foreigners in their hearts but as a rule took their money and helped them in their plots moreover they opened a handsome casino and less reputable gambling houses with the object of collecting further toll  such wealth as the country enjoyed was largely derived from the fertile soil but the district about santa brigida was less productive than the rest and had been long neglected there was rain enough all round but much of the moisture condensed on the opposite side of the range and left the slopes behind the town comparatively arid to remedy this an irrigation scheme was being carried out by american capitalists and the narrowgage railroad formed part of the undertaking  a man dressed in rather baggy gray clothes and a big soft hat sat in the shadow of the rock his thin face had been recently browned by the sun for the paler color where his hat shaded it showed that he was used to a northern climate though his pose was relaxed and he had a cigar in his mouth there was a hint of energy about him and he was following the curves of the railroad with keenly observant eyes a girl in white dress of fashionable cut sat near him holding a greenlined sunshade for although they were in the shadow the light was strong the likeness between them indicated they were father and daughter  i expect youre feeling it pretty hot fuller remarked  it is not oppressive and i rather like the brightness the girl replied besides its cool enough about the tent after the sun goes behind the range of course you are used to the climate  i was but that was twentyfour years ago and before you were born got my first lift with the ten thousand dollars i made in the next state down this coast besides the ague and shivers that have never quite left me however its pretty healthy up here and i guess it ought to suit jake all right  ida fuller looked thoughtful and her pensive expression added to the charm of her attractive face she had her fathers keen eyes but they were like her hair a soft darkbrown and the molding of brows and nose and mouth was rather firm than delicate while her features hinted at decision of character there was nothing aggressive in her look which indeed was marked by a gracious calm though she was tall her figure was slender  yes she agreed if he would stay up here  fuller nodded id have to fix him up with work enough to keep him busy and ask for a fulllength report once a week that would show me what he was doing and hed have to stick right to his job to find out what was going on  unless he got somebody to tell him or perhaps write the report jake you know is smart  youre fond of your brother but i sometimes think youre a bit hard on him i admit i was badly riled when they turned him down from yale but it was a harmless fooltrick he played and when he owned up squarely i had to let it go  thats jakes way you cant be angry with him still perhaps its a dangerous gift it might be better for him if he got hurt now and then  fuller who did not answer watched her as she pondered her mother had died long ago and fuller who was largely occupied by his business knew that jake might have got into worse trouble but for the care ida had exercised he admitted that his daughter rather than himself had brought up the lad and her influence had been wholly for good by and by she glanced at santa brigida  its the casino and other attractions down there im afraid of if you had some older man you could trust to look after jake one would feel more satisfied  well said fuller with a twinkle theres nobody i know who could fill the bill and im not sure the older men are much steadier than the rest  he stopped as a puff of smoke rose at the lower end of the ravine and moved up the hill then a flash of twinkling metal broke out among the rocks and ida saw that a small locomotive was climbing the steep track  shes bringing up concrete blocks for the dam fuller resumed we use them large in the lower courses and i had the bogie car theyre loaded on specially built for the job but im afraid well have to put down some pieces of the line again the grades pretty stiff and the curves are sharp  ida was not bored by these details she liked her father to talk to her about his business and her interest was quickly roused fuller who was proud of her keen intelligence told her much and she knew the importance of the irrigation scheme he had embarked upon land in the arid belt could be obtained on favorable terms and fuller thought be made as productive as that watered by the natural rainfall it was however mainly because he had talked about finding her scapegrace brother employment on the work that ida had made him take her south  as she glanced at the track she noted that room for it had been dug out of the hillside which was seamed by gullies that the rails twisted round the loose soil consisting largely of volcanic cinders appeared to offer a very unsafe support it had slipped away here and there leaving gaps between the ties which were unevenly laid and at the sharper bends overhung the steep slope below in the meantime the small locomotive came nearer panting loudly and throwing up showers of sparks and ida remarked how the rails bent and then sprang up again as the truck which carried two ponderous blocks of stone rolled over them the engine rocked sparks flashed among the wheels as their flanges bit the curves and she wondered what the driver felt or if he had got used to his rather dangerous work  as a matter of fact dick brandon who drove the engine felt some nervous strain he had applied for the post at kemps suggestion after the latter had given him a few lessons in locomotive work and had since been sorry that he had obtained it still he had now a room to himself at the shed where the engine was kept and a halfbreed fireman to help him with the heavier part of his task he preferred this to living in a hot bunkhouse and carrying bags of cement in the grinding mill though he knew there was a certain risk of his plunging down the ravine with his engine  the boiler primed when he started and was not steaming well the pistons banged alarmingly as they compressed the water that spurted from the draincocks and his progress was marked by violent jerks that jarred the couplings of the bogie truck though dick only wore a greasy shirt and overall trousers he felt the oppressive heat and his eyes ached with the glare as he gazed up the climbing track the dust that rolled about the engine dimmed the glasses the footplate rattled and it looked as if his fireman was performing a clumsy dance  by and by he rather doubtfully opened the throttle to its widest if the boiler primed again he might knock out the cylinderheads but there was a steep pitch in front that was difficult to climb the short locomotive rocked and hammered the wheels skidded and gripped again and dick took his hand from the lever to dash the sweat from his eyes  they were going up and he would be past the worst if he could get his load round the curve ahead they were half way round when there was a clang behind him and the engine seemed to leap forward glancing over his shoulder as he shut off steam dick saw the fireman gazing back and a wide gap between the concrete blocks and his load of coal the couplings had snapped as they strained round the bend and the truck would run down the incline until it smashed through the sheds that held the grinding and mixing plant at the bottom he saw that prompt action was needed and reversing the machinery gave the fireman an order in uncouth castilian  the fellow looked at him stupidly as if his nerve had failed or he thought the order too risky to obey there was only one thing to be done and since it must be done at once dick must undertake it himself the engine was now running down the line after the truck which had not gathered much speed yet and he climbed across the coal and dropped upon the rear bufferframe balancing himself upon it he waited until the gap between him and the truck got narrower and then put his hand on top of the concrete and swung himself across he got his foot upon the side of the car and made his way along holding the top of the block while the dust rolled about him and he thought he would be jolted off indeed there was only an inchwide ledge of smooth iron to support his foot which slipped once or twice but he reached the brakegear and screwed it down then crawling back he hooked on the spare coupling and returned breathless and shaky to his engine a minute or two later he brought it to a stop and had got down upon the line when somebody called him  looking round he saw fuller standing near and knew him as the man who had given him the dollar in the american town he had heard that his employer had come out to see what progress was being made but had not yet encountered him he did not notice ida who was sitting in the shadow of the rock  you were smart said fuller thered have been an ugly smash if the blocks had got away down the grade but why didnt you stick to the throttle and send your fireman  i dont think he understood what he ought to do and there was no time to explain  fuller nodded so you did it yourself but why didnt you push the car you could have held her up better then  i couldnt get behind it the looptrack down at the switches has caved in  i see but its a stiff grade and you didnt seem to be hustling your engine much  the boiler was priming and i was afraid of the cylinders  just so you pumped up the water pretty high  no it was at the usual working level said dick who paused and resumed thoughtfully i cant account for the thing why does a boiler prime  there are one or two obvious reasons for a boilers priming that is to say throwing water as well as steam into the engine but this sometimes happens when no cause can be assigned and fuller saw that dick did not expect an answer to his question it was rather an exclamation prompted by his failure to solve a fascinating problem and as such indicated that his interest in his task was not confined to the earning of a living fuller recognized the mind of the engineer  well he replied theres a good deal we dont know yet about the action of fluids under pressure but do you find the grade awkward when shes steaming properly  i can get up still i think it will soon cost you as much in extra fuel as it would to relay this bit of line two hundred cubic yards cut out at the bend would make things much easier  two hundred yards said fuller studying the spot  two hundred and fifty at the outside dick answered confidently and then felt embarrassed as he saw miss fuller for the first time his clothes were few and dirty and he was awkwardly conscious that his hands and face were black but his employer claimed his attention  what would you reckon the weight of the stuff  dick told him after a short silence and fuller asked twothousandpound tons  yes i turned it into american weight  well said fuller you must get on with your job now but come up to my tent after supper  dick started his locomotive and when it panted away up the incline fuller looked at his daughter with a smile  what do you think of that young man  he has a nice face of course hes not the type one would expect to find driving a locomotive  pshaw said fuller im not talking about his looks  nor am i in the way you mean ida rejoined i thought he looked honest though perhaps reliable is nearest what i felt then he was very professional  fuller nodded thats what i like the man who puts his job before what he gets for it naturally makes the best work what do you think of his manner  it was good confident but not assertive with just the right note of deference ida answered and then laughed it rather broke down after he saw me  thats not surprising anyhow i expect hes used to wearing different clothes and more of them when he meets stylish young women it doesnt follow that the young fellow isnt human because hes professional however i want to see what the boys are doing farther on     chapter vi  a step up   dusk was falling when dick went to keep his appointment with his employer fireflies glimmered in the brush beside the path and the lights of santa brigida flashed in a brilliant cluster on the edge of the shadowy sea high above rugged peaks cut black against the sky and the land breeze that swept their lower slopes brought with it instead of coolness a warm spicy smell there was more foliage when dick reached the foot of a projecting spur for a dark belt of forest rolled down the hill and by and by he saw a big tent that gleamed with a softened radiance like a paper lantern among a clump of palms it seemed to be well lighted inside and dick remembered having heard orders for electric wires to be connected with the powerhouse at the dam  fuller obviously meant to give his daughter all the civilized comfort possible and dick was glad he had been able to find a clean duck suit though he was not sure he had succeeded in removing all the oily grime from his face nothing could be done with his hands the knuckles were scarred the nails broken and the black grease from the engine had worked into his skin still this did not matter much because he had gradually overcome his fastidiousness and it was not likely that miss fuller would notice him  she was however sitting outside the tent from which an awning extended so as to convert its front into a covered veranda and dick was half surprised when she gave him a smile of recognition that warranted his taking off his hat then fuller beckoning him to come forward switched on another lamp and the light fell on a table covered with plans dick stopped when he reached it and waited not knowing how his employer meant to receive him  sit down said fuller indicating a chair and then gave him one of the plans some paper and a fountain pen study that piece of digging and let me know the weight of stuff to be moved the number of men youd use and what you think the job would cost  dick set to work and at once became absorbed twenty minutes passed and he did not move or speak nor did he see the smile with which ida answered fullers look in another ten minutes he put down the pen and gave fuller his calculations  i think thats near it sir im reckoning on the use of colored peons  fuller nodded you havent left much margin for what we call contingencies but theyre going to bring us some coffee will you take a cigar  a chinaman brought out a silver coffeepot on a tray which he placed on a folding table in front of ida and since it was two or three yards from the other dick got up when she filled the cups she gave him two which he carried back but remained where she was within hearing but far enough away not to obtrude her society upon the others dick who lighted his cigar felt grateful to fuller it was some time since he had met people of any refinement on friendly terms and until he took up his quarters in the locomotive shed had been living in squalor and dirt  there was not much furniture outside the tent but the neat folding tables comfortable canvas chairs delicate china and silver coffeepot gave the place a luxurious look and though miss fuller was so to speak outside the circle the presence of a welldressed attractive girl had its charm indeed dick felt half embarrassed by the pleasantness of his surroundings they were unusual and reminded him poignantly of the privileges he had enjoyed in england  where did you learn to make these calculations fuller asked after a time  in the british army royal engineers dick answered with a flush  were you an officer  dick had dreaded the question it looked as if truthfulness would cost him much but he determined that his new friends should know the worst  yes  then why did you quit  dick glanced at ida and imagined that she was interested though she did not look up  i was turned out sir  ah said fuller without surprise may i ask why its not impertinent curiosity  i was sent with some important papers which i lost this was bad enough but there was some ground for suspecting that i had stolen them  do you know how they were lost  dick was grateful for the way the question was put since it hinted that fuller did not doubt his honesty  no he said that is i have a notion but im afraid ill never quite find out  fuller did not reply for a minute or two and dick whose face was rather hot glanced back at ida her eyes were now fixed on him with quiet interest and something in her expression indicated approval  well said fuller im going to give you a chance of making good because if you had done anything crooked you wouldnt have told me that tale youll quit driving the locomotive and superintend on a section of the dam im not satisfied with the fellow whos now in charge hes friendly with the dago subcontractors and i suspect im being robbed  dicks eyes sparkled his foot was on the ladder that led to success and he did not mean to stay at the bottom moreover it caused him an exhilarating thrill to feel that he was trusted again  ill do my best sir he said gratefully  very well youll begin tomorrow and can use the rooms behind the iron office shack but theres something you have forgotten  dick looked at him with a puzzled air and fuller laughed  you havent asked what im going to pay you yet  no said dick to tell the truth it didnt seem to matter  profession comes first fuller suggested well thats right but ive hired professional men engineering and medical experts who charged pretty high anyhow heres my offer  dick was satisfied as was fuller the latter was often generous and would not have taken unfair advantage of dicks necessity but he did not object to engaging a talented young man at something below the market rate  while im here youll come over twice a week to report he resumed and now if theres anything youd like to ask  first of all i owe you a dollar dick remarked putting the money on the table the payclerk wouldnt take it because he said it would mix up his accounts im glad to pay you back but this doesnt cancel the debt  it wasnt a big risk i thought you looked played out  i was played out and hungry in fact it took me five minutes to make up my mind whether id pay the agent who gave me your address his fee because it meant going without a meal  fuller nodded did you hesitate again after you knew youd got the job  i did when we were hustled on board the steamer there was nobody at the gangway for a few moments and i felt i wanted to run away there didnt seem to be any reason for this but i very nearly went  that kind of things not quite unusual fuller answered with a smile in my early days when every dollar was of consequence i often had a bad time after id made a risky deal used to think id been a fool and id be glad to pay a smart fine if the other party would let me out yet if hed made the proposition i wouldnt have clinched with it  such vacillation doesnt seem logical in a man ida interposed dont you practical people rather pride yourselves on being free from our complexities still i suppose there is an explanation  im not a philosopher fuller replied if you have the constructive faculty its your business to make things and not examine your feelings but my explanations something like thiswhen you take a big risk you have a kind of unconscious judgment that tells you if youre right but human natures weak and scares you really dont believe in begin to grip then it depends on your nerve whether you make good or not  dont they call it subconscious ida asked and how does that judgment come  i guess its built up on past experience on things youve learned long since and stored away in a sense theyre done with you dont call them up and argue from them but all the same theyre the driving force when you set your teeth and go ahead  ida looked at dick that cant apply to us who have no long experience to fall back upon  ive only made one venture of the kind but ive just discovered that it turned out right  fuller smiled thats neat then he turned to ida but i wasnt talking about women they dont need experience  sometimes youre merely smart and sometimes youre rather deep but i cant decide which you are just now ida rejoined however i expect youre longing to get back to the plans  no said fuller they have to be thought of but life isnt all a matter of building dams now im getting old ive found that out  and you have you any opinion on the subject ida asked dick  dick hesitated wondering whether she meant to put him at his ease or was amused by his seriousness  i dont imagine my views are worth much and theyre not very clear in a way of course its plain that mr fullers right  but after all building dams and removing rocks may very well come first  dick pondered this so far his profession had certainly come first he was not a prig or a recluse but he found engineering more interesting than people now he came to think of it he had been proud of helens beauty but she had not stirred him much or occupied all his thoughts indeed he had only once been overwhelmingly conscious of a womans charm and that was in kenwardines garden he had lost his senses then but did not mean to let anything of the kind happen again  well he said diffidently so long as youre content with your occupation it doesnt seem necessary to make experiments and look for adventures i expect it saves you trouble to stick to what you like and know  he noted idas smile and was silent afterwards while she argued with her father he did not want to obtrude himself and since they seemed to expect him to stay it was pleasant enough to sit and listen  the air was getting cooler and the moon had risen and cast a silver track across the sea the distant rumble of the surf came up the hillside in a faint rhythmic beat and the peaks above the camp had grown in distinctness a smell of spice drifted out of the jungle and dick who was tired was sensible of a delightful languor the future had suddenly grown bright and besides this idas gracious friendliness had given him back his confidence and selfrespect he was no longer an outcast he had his chance of making good and regaining the amenities of life that he had learned to value by their loss he was very grateful to the girl and fuller but at length took his leave and returned to the locomotive shed with a light heart and a springy step  next morning he began his new work with keen energy it absorbed him and as the dam slowly rose in a symmetrical curve of molded stone its austere beauty commanded his attention hitherto he had given utility the leading place but a change had begun the night he sat beneath the copperbeech with clare kenwardine the design of the structure was good but dick determined that the work should be better and sometimes stopped in the midst of his eager activity to note the fine sweeping lines and silverygray luster of the concrete blocks there were soft lights at dawn and when the sun sank in which the long embankment glimmered as if carved in motherofpearl  in the meantime he went to fullers tent twice a week and generally met ida there once or twice he pleaded with his employer for extra labor and cement to add some grace of outline to the dam and although this was unproductive expenditure fuller agreed  i like a good job but its going to cost high if you mean to turn out a work of art he said however if bethune thinks the notion all right i suppose ill have to consent  dick colored and wondered whether he had been given a hint for bethune was his superior and a man of ability  he doesnt object sir  thats good fuller replied with a twinkle still if you hustle him too much youll make him tired  dick did not smile because he did not know how far it was wise to go but he suspected that bethune had been tired before he came to the dam the latter was generally marked by an air of languid indifference and while his work was well done he seldom exceeded his duty  next evening dick went to see bethune and found him lying in a hammock hung between the posts of the veranda of his galvanized iron hut a syphon and a tall glass filled with wine in which a lump of ice floated stood on a table within his reach and an open book lay upside down upon the floor he wore white duck trousers a green shirt of fine material and a red sash very neatly wound round his waist his face was sunburned but the features were delicately cut and his hands which hung over the edge of the hammock were well cared for  mix yourself a drink he said to dick theres a glass and some ice in the bureau inside anyhow my steward boy put some there  dick who went into the hut came back with a grin theres a bit of wet blanket but the ice has gone it seems to have run into your papers  theyll dry bethune said tranquilly you had better put some of the gaseosa in the wine its sour spanish tinto then if you like to pick up the book ill read you some fran√ßois villon there was red blood in that fellow and its a pity hes dead you get into touch with him better beside the spanish main than you can in new york  i never heard of him and perhaps i ought to explain  what you came for then go ahead and ease your mind its business first with you  it occurred to me that i had perhaps taken too much upon myself now and then you are my chief of course and i dont want to look pushing  that shows good taste bethune remarked but how are you going to get over the difficulty that you are what you call pushing anyhow im surprised it did occur to you  to tell the truth it was something fuller said  so i imagined well when you go too far ill pull you up but we neednt bother about it in the meantime you were obviously born a hustler but you have an ingenuousness that disarms resentment in fact you quite upset our views of the british character  then the feelings mutual dick rejoined with a grin you dont harmonize with what ive seen of americans  ours is a big country and weve room for different types but i come from georgia and we havent all learned to hustle yet in the south thats probably why im here when i could have had a much better paid job  dick did not doubt this because he had seen something of the others mathematical powers he was not a fool at figures himself but bethune could solve by a flash of genius problems that cost him laborious calculation it was strange that such a man should be content to make a very modest use of his talents  i suppose you have met miss fuller bethune resumed  yes said dick she made things pleasant for me when i first went to the tent i like her very much  miss fuller has most of the new england virtues including a stern sense of her responsibility i expect you dont know if she shares her fathers good opinion of yourself  i dont know what fullers opinion is dick replied awkwardly  bethune laughed well hes given you a good job but why i asked was this if miss fullers quite satisfied about you shell probably put her maverick brother in your charge she came here not long ago with the object of finding out if i was suited for the post and i imagined learned something about me in a quiet way it was a relief when she obviously decided that i wasnt the proper man the girl has intelligence if she had asked me i could have recommended you  do you know much about her brother  ive learned something the lads a breakaway from the sober fuller type and i think his views of life rather agree with mine however perhaps we had better let miss fuller tell you what she thinks fit and now would you like some fran√ßois villon  no said dick firmly i want to see that moran turns out his gang at sunrise and must get back  pick me up the book anyhow bethune replied and laughed goodhumoredly when dick left him     chapter vii  dick undertakes a responsibility   the glare of the big arclights flooded the broad white plaza when dick crossed it on his way to the hotel magellan the inhabitants of santa brigida had finished their evening meal and as was their custom were taking the air and listening to the military band they were of many shades of color and different styles of dress for darkskinned peons in plain white cotton chattering negroes and grave blueclad chinamen mingled with the citizens who claimed to spring from european stock these however for the most part were by no means white and though some derived their sallow skin from andalusian and catalan ancestors others showed traces of carib origin  the men were marked by southern grace the younger women had a dark languorous beauty and although their dress was as a rule an out of date copy of parisian modes their color taste was good and the creamy white and soft yellow became them well a number of the men wore white duck with black or red sashes and panama hats but some had spanish cloaks and mexican sombreros  flattopped houses colored white and pink and lemon with almost unbroken fronts ran round the square a few had green lattices and handsome iron gates to the arched entrances that ran like a tunnel through the house but many showed no opening except a narrow slit of barred window santa brigida was old and the part near the plaza had been built four hundred years ago  dick glanced carelessly at the crowd as he crossed the square he liked the music and there was something interesting and exotic in the play of moving color but his mind was on his work and he wondered whether he would find a man he wanted at the hotel one could enter it by a moorish arch that harmonized with the eastern style of its front but this had been added and he went in by the older tunnel and across the patio to the openfronted american bar that occupied a space between the balcony pillars  he did not find his man and after ordering some wine lighted a cigarette and looked about while he waited to see if the fellow would come in one or two steamship officers occupied a table close by a frenchman was talking excitedly to a handsome spanish halfbreed and a fat redfaced german with spectacles sat opposite a big glass of palecolored beer dick was not interested in these but his glance grew keener as it rested on a spaniard who had a contract at the irrigation works sitting with one of fullers storekeepers at the other end of the room though there was no reason the spaniard should not meet the man in town dick wondered what they were talking about particularly since they had chosen a table away from everybody else  the man he wanted did not come and by and by he determined to look for him in the hotel he went up an outside staircase from the patio round which the building ran and had reached a balcony when he met ida fuller coming down she stopped with a smile  i am rather glad to see you she said my father who went on board the american boat has not come back as he promised and the french lady he left me with has gone  im going off to a cargo vessel to ask when theyll land our cement and we might find out what is keeping mr fuller if you dont mind walking to the mole  they left the hotel and shortly afterwards reached the mole which sheltered the shallow harbor where the cargo lighters were unloaded the long smooth swell broke in flashes of green and gold phosphorescence against the concrete wall and the moon threw a broad glittering track across the sea there was a rattle of cranes and winches and a noisy tug was towing a row of barges towards the land the measured thud of her engines broke through the splash of water flung off the lighters bows as they lurched across the swell and somebody on board was singing a spanish song farther out a mailboats gently swaying hull blazed with electric light and astern of her the reflection of a tramp steamers cargo lamp quivered upon the sea by and by dick who ascertained that fuller had not landed hailed a steam launch which came panting towards some steps  i can put you on board the american boat and bring you back if mr fuller isnt there he said and when ida agreed helped her into the launch  then he took the helm while the fireman started the engine and the craft went noisily down the harbor as they passed the end of the mole dick changed his course and the white town rose clear to view in the moonlight behind the sparkling fringe of surf the flattopped houses rose in tiers up a gentle slope interspersed with feathery tufts of green and draped here and there with masses of creepers narrow gaps of shadow opened between them and the slender square towers of the cathedral dominated all but in places a steep red roof struck a picturesque but foreign note  santa brigida has a romantic look at night dick remarked somehow it reminds me of pictures of the east  that is not very strange ida answered with a smile the flat roof and straight unbroken wall is the oldest type of architecture man naturally adopted it when he gave up the tent and began to build  yes said dick two uprights and a beam across you couldnt get anything much simpler but how did it come here  the arabs found it in palestine and took it to northern africa as the moslem conquest spread the cube however isnt beautiful and the moors elaborated it as the greeks had done but in a different way the latter broke the square from the cornices and pillars the moors with the saracenic arch minarets and fretted stone and then forced their model upon spain still the primitive type survives longest and the spaniards brought that to the new world  no doubt its the explanation but the high red roofs yonder arent moorish the flat top would suit the dry east but these indicate a country where they need a pitch that will shed the rain and snow in fact one would imagine that the original model came from germany  it really did spain was overrun by the visigoths who were teutons  well said dick this is interesting im not an architect but constructions my business as well as my hobby  then dont you think you are a fortunate man  in a sense perhaps dick answered still thats no reason you should be bored for my entertainment he paused and resumed im grateful because you mean to be kind as you were the night i met you first at the tent although you had heard my story i saw you wanted to make me feel i was being given a fresh start  ida studied him with a thoughtful calm that he found embarrassing perhaps i did but suppose we talk about something else  very well if its not bad form i wasnt in the least astonished by your lecture about the roofs because one finds your people have a breadth of knowledge thats remarkable i once showed an old abbey near our place at home to some american tourists and soon saw they knew more about its history than i did there was a girl of seventeen who corrected me once or twice and when i went to the library i found that she was right the curious thing is that youre so to speak rather parochial with it all one of my american employers treated me pretty well until he had to make some changes in his business took me to his house now and then and i found his wife and daughters knew the old french and italian cities yet they thought them far behind marlin bluff which is really a horribly ugly place  i know it said ida laughing still the physical attractiveness of a town isnt its only charm besides are you sure you dont mean patriotic when you say parochial you ought to sympathize with the former feeling  i dont know patriotism is difficult when your country has no use for you  ida did not reply and it was a few minutes later when she said im glad i met you tonight because we go home soon and theres a favor i want to ask my brother is coming out to take a post on the irrigation work and i want you to look after him  but he maynt like being looked after and its very possible he knows more about the work than i do ive only had a military training  jake has had no training at all and is three or four years younger than i think you are  then of course ill be glad to teach him all i can  that isnt exactly what i mean although we want him to learn as much as possible about engineering  i dont see what else i could teach him  ida smiled then i must explain jake is rash and fond of excitement and gay society he makes friends easily and trusts those he likes but this has some drawbacks because his confidence is often misplaced now i dont think you would find it difficult to gain some influence over him  and what would you expect me to do afterwards  you might begin by trying to make him see how interesting his new occupation is  that might be harder than you think dick replied molding concrete and digging irrigation ditches have a fascination for me but i dare say its an unusual taste your brother mightnt like weighing cement in the hot mixing sheds or dragging a measuring chain about in the sun  its very possible ida agreed with a hint of dryness i want you to show him what it means make him feel the sense of power over material jakes rather boyish and a boy loves to fire a gun because something startling happens in obedience to his will when he pulls the trigger isnt it much the same when one gives the orders that shatter massive rocks and move ponderous stones however thats not all i want you to keep him at the dam and prevent his making undesirable friends  though its not the thing im cut out for ill try said dick with some hesitation im surprised that you should put your brother in my charge after what you know about me  you were unfortunate negligent perhaps for once  the trouble is that my friends and relations seemed to think me dishonest at least they believed that my getting into disgrace was quite as bad  i dont said ida calmly what i ask will need some tact but if youll promise to look after jake i shall feel satisfied  dick was silent for the next few moments watching the phosphorescent foam stream back from the launchs bows then he said thank you miss fuller in a way its embarrassing to feel you trust me but ill do what i can to deserve it  three or four minutes afterwards the launch steamed round the liners stern and ran into the gloom beneath her tall side there was a blaze of light above that fell upon the farthest off of the row of boats past which the launch ran with her engine stopped and the dark water broke into a fiery sparkle as the swell lapped the steamers plates a man came down the ladder when the launch jarred against its foot and ida finding that fuller was still on board went up while dick steamed across to the cargoboat that lay with winches hammering not far off after talking to her mate he returned to the harbor and when he landed lighted a cigarette and studied some alterations that were being made at the landward end of the mole he had noticed the work as he passed with ida but was now able to examine it a number of concrete blocks and cement bags were lying about  beckoning a peon who seemed to be the watchman dick gave him a cigarette and asked how far are they going to reface the mole  as far as the post yonder se√±or  it was obvious that a large quantity of cement would be required and dick resumed who is doing the work  don ramon oliva  dick hid his interest ramon oliva was the man he had seen talking to fullers storekeeper at the hotel  where does one buy cement in this town  se√±or vaz the merchant sells it now and then  dick let the peon go and leaving the mole found vaz in a caf√© sitting down at his table he asked do you keep cement in your warehouse  sometimes said the other when work it is required for is going on but i sold the last i had two or three months ago  i believe we run short now and then but we have a big lot being landed now as our sheds will be pretty full i could let you have a quantity if you like  thanks but no said the merchant i do not think anybody would buy it from me for some time and it is bad to keep when ones store is damp  dick who drank a glass of wine with him went away in a thoughtful mood he wondered where don ramon got his cement and meant to find out though he saw that caution would be needed he owed much to fuller and had made his masters business his now it looked as if fuller were being robbed and although he had no doubt cunning rogues to deal with dick determined that the thing must be stopped when he returned to the dam he went to bethunes hut and found him lying in his hammock  whose duty is it to check the storekeepers lists he asked i suppose you strike a balance between the goods delivered him and the stuff he hands out for use on the works  its done of course said bethune i havent examined the books myself fran√ßois the creole clerk is responsible however one would imagine you had duties enough without taking up another but if you mean to do so you had better begin soon your energy wont stand this climate long  i dont know what i may do yet dick replied still it struck me that our stores might be sold in the town  i expect they are to some extent bethune carelessly agreed that kind of thing is hard to stop anywhere and these folks are very smart at petty pilfering anyway you might get yourself into trouble by interfering and any small theft you stopped probably wouldnt pay for the time youd have to spend on the job leave it alone and take matters as you find them is my advice  dick talked about something else but when he went back to his shack he knew what he meant to do     chapter viii  an informal court   one morning soon after fuller and his daughter had gone home dick stood at a table in the testing house behind the mixing sheds the small galvanized iron building shook with the throb of engines and rattle of machinery and now and then a shower of cinders pattered upon the roof for the big mill that ground up the concrete was working across the road the lattice shutters were closed for the sake of privacy and kept out the glare though they could not keep out the heat which soaked through the thin iron walls and dicks face was wet with perspiration as he arranged a number of small concrete blocks some of these were broken and some partly crushed delicate scales and glass measures occupied a neighboring shelf and a big steel apparatus that looked rather like a lever weighing machine stood in the shadow  where the draught that came through the lattices flowed across the room bethune lounged in a canvas chair and another man with a quiet sunburned face sat behind him this was stuyvesant whose authority was only second to fullers  brandon seems to have taken a good deal of trouble but this kind of investigation needs the strictest accuracy and we havent the best of testing apparatus bethune remarked i expect hell allow that the results he has got may be to some extent misleading and i doubt if its worth while to go on with the matter are you sure you have made no mistakes dick  dick pondered for a few moments if he were right as he thought he was the statements he had to make would lead to the discharge of the subcontractor remembering his own disgrace he shrank from condemning another he knew what he had suffered and the man might be innocent although his guilt seemed plain it was a hateful situation but his duty was to protect his masters interests and he could not see him robbed  you can check my calculations he answered quietly  thats so agreed stuyvesant who added with a dry smile as he noted bethunes disapproving look we can decide about going on with the thing when we have heard brandon  very well said dick giving him some papers and then indicated two different rows of the small concrete blocks these marked a were made from cement in our store the lot b from some i took from olivas stock on the mole they were subjected to the same compressive shearing and absorbent tests and youll see that theres very little difference in the results the quality of standard makes of cement is no doubt much alike but you wouldnt expect to find that of two different brands identical my contention is that the blocks were made from the same stuff  stuyvesant crossed the floor and measured the blocks with a micrometer gage after which he filled two of the graduated glass measures and then weighed the water  well he said to bethune who had picked up dicks calculations  the figures are right hes only out in a small decimal  stuyvesant took the papers and compared them with a printed form he produced from his pocket  they correspond with the tests the maker claims his stuff will stand and we can take it that theyre accurate still this doesnt prove that oliva stole the cement from us the particular make is popular on this coast and he may have bought a quantity from somebody else did you examine the bags on the mole brandon  no said dick i had to get my samples in the dark if oliva bought the cement he must have kept it for some time because the only man in the town who stocks it sold the last he had three months ago the next thing is our storekeepers tally showing the number of bags delivered to him i sat up half the night trying to balance this against what he handed out and could make nothing of the entries  let me see said bethune and lighted a cigarette when dick handed him a book and a bundle of small numbered forms you can talk if you like he added as he sharpened a pencil  dick moved restlessly up and down the floor examining the testing apparatus but he said nothing and stuyvesant did not speak he was a reserved and thoughtful man after a time bethune threw the papers on the table  fran√ßois isnt much of a bookkeeper he remarked one or two of the delivery slips have been entered twice and at first i suspected he might have conspired with oliva still thats against my notion of his character and i find hes missed booking stuff that had been given out which of course wouldnt have suited the others plans  you can generally count on a frenchmans honesty stuyvesant observed but do you make the deliveries exstore tally with what went in  i dont said bethune dryly heres the balance i struck it shows the storekeeper is a good many bags short  he passed the paper across and dick examined it with surprise  you have worked this out already from the muddled and blotted entries do you think youve got it right  im sure said bethune smiling ill prove it if you like we know how much cement went into stock how many molded blocks of the top course have we put down at the dam  dick told him and after a few minutes calculation bethune looked up then here you are our concretes a standard density we know the weight of water and sand and what to allow for evaporation you see my figures agree very closely with the total delivery exstore  they did so and dick no longer wondered how bethune who ostentatiously declined to let his work interfere with his comfort held his post the man thought in numbers using the figures as one used words to express his knowledge rather than as a means of obtaining it by calculation dick imagined this was genius  well said stuyvesant i guess we had better send for the storekeeper next  get it over agreed bethune its an unpleasant job  dick sent a halfnaked peon to look for the man and was sensible of some nervous strain as he waited for his return he hated the task he had undertaken but it must be carried out bethune who had at first tried to discourage him now looked interested and dick saw that stuyvesant was resolute in the meanwhile the shed had grown suffocatingly hot his face and hands were wet with perspiration and the rumble of machinery made his head ache he lighted a cigarette but the tobacco tasted bitter and he threw it away then there were footsteps outside and stuyvesant turned to him  we leave you to put the thing through youre prosecutor  dick braced himself as a man came in and stood by the table looking at the others suspiciously he was an american but his face was heavy and rather sullen and his white clothes were smeared with dust  we have been examining your stockbook said dick its badly kept  the fellow gave him a quick glance mr fuller knows im not smart at figuring and if you want the books neat youll have to get me a better clerk anyhow ive my own tally and allow i can tell you what stuff i get and where it goes  that is satisfactory look at this list and tell me where the cement youre short of has gone  into the mixing shed i guess said the other with a halfdefiant frown  then it didnt come out we havent got the concrete at the dam are there any full bags not accounted for in the shed  no sir you ought to know the bags are skipped right into the tank as the mill grinds up the mush  very well perhaps youd better consult your private tally and see if it throws any light upon the matter  the man took out a notebook and while he studied it bethune asked will you let me have the book  i guess not said the other who shut the book with a snap and then turned and confronted dick  i want to know why youre getting after me  its fairly plain youre responsible for the stores and cant tell us what has become of a quantity of the goods  suppose i own up that my tallys got mixed  then youd show yourself unfit for your job but that is not the worst if you had made a mistake the bags wouldnt vanish you had the cement it isnt in the store and hasnt reached us in the form of concrete it must have gone somewhere  where do you reckon it went if it wasnt into the mixing shed  to the santa brigida mole dick answered quietly and noting the mans abrupt movement went on what were you talking to ramon oliva about at the hotel magellan  the storekeeper did not reply but the anger and confusion in his face were plain and dick turned to the others  i think well send for oliva said stuyvesant keep this fellow here until he comes  oliva entered tranquilly though his black eyes got very keen when he glanced at his sullen accomplice he was picturesquely dressed with a black silk sash round his waist and a big mexican sombrero taking out a cigarette he remarked that it was unusually hot  you are doing some work on the town mole dick said to him where did you get the cement  i bought it oliva answered with a surprised look  from whom  a merchant at anagas down the coast but se√±ores my contract on the mole is a matter for the port officials i do not see the object of these questions  you had better answer them stuyvesant remarked and signed dick to go on  dick paused for a moment or two remembering how he had confronted his judges in a tent in an english valley the scene came back with poignant distinctness  he could hear the river brawling among the stones and feel his colonels stern condemning gaze fixed upon his face for all that his tone was resolute as he asked what was the brand of the cement you bought  the tenax se√±or oliva answered with a defiant smile  then dick turned to the others with a gesture which implied that there was no more to be said and quietly sat down tenax was not the brand that fuller used and its different properties would have appeared in the tests the subcontractor had betrayed himself by the lie and his accomplice looked at him with disgust  youve given the thing away he growled think they dont know what cement is now they have you fixed  there was silence for the next minute while stuyvesant studied some figures in his pocketbook then he wrote upon a leaf which he tore out and told dick to give it to oliva  heres a rough statement of your account up to the end of last month don ramon he said you can check it and afterwards hand the payclerk a formal bill brought up to date but youll notice i have charged you with a quantity of cement thats missing from our store your engagement with mr fuller ends today  oliva spread out his hands with a dramatic gesture se√±ores this is a scandal a grand injustice you understand it will ruin me it is impossible that i submit  very well well put the matter into the hands of the justicia  it is equal oliva declared with passion you have me marked as a thief the port officials give me no more work and my friends talk at the justicia all the world hears my defense  as you like said stuyvesant but the storekeeper turned to oliva with a contemptuous grin  i allow youre not such a blamed fool he remarked take the chance theyve given you and get from under before the roof falls in  oliva pondered for a few moments his eyes fixed on stuyvesants unmoved face and then shrugged with an air of injured resignation  it is a grand scandal but i make my bill  he moved slowly to the door but paused as he reached it and gave dick a quick malignant glance then he went out and the storekeeper asked stuyvesant what are you going to do with me  fire you right now go along to the payclerk and give him your time i dont know if thats all we ought to do but well be satisfied if you and your partner get off this camp  ill quit said the storekeeper who turned to dick youre a smart kid but wed have bluffed you all right if the fool had allowed he used the same cement  then he followed oliva and stuyvesant got up  that was olivas mistake he remarked i saw where you were leading him and you put the questions well now however youll have to take on his duties until we get another man  they left the testinghouse and as bethune and dick walked up the valley the former said its my opinion that you were imprudent in one respect you showed the fellows that it was you who found them out it might have been better if you had so to speak divided the responsibility  theyve gone and thats the most important thing dick rejoined  from the works it doesnt follow that theyll quit santa brigida payne the storekeeper is of course an american tough but i dont think hell make trouble hed have robbed us cheerfully but i expect hell take his being found out as a risk of the game besides stuyvesant will have to ship him home if he asks for his passage but i didnt like the look oliva gave you these dago halfbreeds are a revengeful lot  im not in the town often and ill be careful if i go there after dark to tell the truth i didnt want to interfere but i couldnt let the rogues go on with their stealing  i suppose not bethune agreed the trouble about doing your duty is that it often costs you something     chapter ix  jake fuller   a month after fuller sailed his son arrived at santa brigida and dick who met him on the mole got something of a surprise when a handsome youth landed and came straight towards him jake fuller was obviously very young but had an ease of manner and a calm selfconfidence that would have done credit to an elderly man of the world his clothes showed nice taste and there was nothing about him to indicate the reckless scapegrace dick had expected  youre brandon of course he said as he shook hands glad to meet you knew you a quarter of a mile off  hows that dick asked you havent seen me before  for one thing youre stamped britisher then you had a kind of determined look as if youd come down to yank me right off to the irrigation ditches before id time to run loose in the city matter of duty to you and you were going to put it through  dick said nothing and jake laughed well thats all right i guess well hit it and now well put out when you like i laid in a pretty good breakfast on the boat i like smart service and a wellchosen menu and dont suppose you have either at the camp  they might be better dick agreed feeling that he had promised miss fuller more than he might be able to perform then he told a peon to take jakes luggage and led the way to a mule carriage at the end of the mole  i didnt expect to ride in a transferwagon jake remarked havent you any autos yet if not ill indent for one when the next stock order goes home  perhaps you had better wait until you see the roads  youre surely british jake replied if youd been an american youd get the car first and make the roads fit in however you might tell the ancient dago to get a move on  dick was silent for the next few minutes on the whole he thought he would like fuller and made some allowance for the excitement he no doubt felt at beginning his career in a foreign country but none for any wish to impress his companion it was unlikely that the selfpossessed lad would care what dick thought of him although it looked as if he meant to be friendly then as the sweating mules slowly climbed the rutted track out of the town dick began to point out the changing level of the land the ravines or barrancos that formed natural drainage channels from the high watershed and the influence of drought and moisture on the cultivation jake showed a polite interest but inquired what amusements were to be had in santa brigida about which dick gave him as little information as possible if he had understood miss fullers hints the spanish city was no place for her brother  jake spent the day following dick about the works and made no complaint about the heat and dust though he frowned when a shower of cement or a splash of oil fell upon his clothes it was obvious that he knew nothing about engineering but the questions he asked indicated keen intelligence and dick was satisfied a room adjoining the latters quarters had been prepared for the newcomer and they sat smoking on the veranda after the evening meal  do you think youll like your work dick asked  ive got to like it and it might be worse since im not allowed to draw or model things i can make them and i guess thats another form of the same talent though its considerably less interesting than the first  but perhaps more useful dick suggested  well i dont know our taste is pretty barbarous as a rule and you cant claim that yours is more advanced but i allow that the spaniards who built santa brigida had an eye for line and color these dagos have a gift we lack you can see it in the way they wear their clothes my notion is that its some use to teach your countrymen to admire beauty and grace were great at making things but theres no particular need to make them ugly  then youre a bit of an artist  i meant to be a whole one and might have made good although the old man has not much use for art unfortunately however i felt i had to kick against the conventionality of the life i led and the protest i put up was a little too vigorous it made trouble and in consequence my folks decided id better be an engineer i couldnt follow their arguments but had to acquiesce  its curious how you artists claim to be exempt from the usual rules as if you were different from the rest of us  we are different jake rejoined with a twinkle its our business to see the truth of things while you try to make it fit your formulas about what you think is most useful to yourself or society a formulas like bad spectacles it distorts the sight and yours is plainly out of focus for example i guess youre satisfied with the white clothes youre wearing  i dont know that its important but whats the matter with them  well said jake with a critical glance theyre all wrong now youve got good shoulders your figures well balanced and i like the way you hold your head but your tailor has spoiled every prominent line ill show you some time when i model you in clay he paused and grinned i guess the roman sentinel pose would suit you best as i noted it when you stood on the mole waiting for me determined to do your duty at any cost besides there is something of the soldier about you  i wish youd stop rotting said dick with a touch of awkwardness though he saw that jake knew nothing about his leaving the army was it your fathers notion that you should be an engineer  he thinks so jake answered grinning my opinion is that you have to thank my sister ida for the job of looking after me she made this her business until i went to yale when of course she lost control ida has a weakness for managing people for their good but you ought to take it as a delicate compliment that she passed me on to you  after all miss fullers age must be nearly the same as mine dick remarked  i see what you mean but in some respects shes much older in fact i guess i could give you a year or two myself but it seems to me youve kind of wilted since we began to talk youve gone slack and your eyes look heavy say im sorry if ive made you tired  i dont think you had much to do with it said dick my head aches and ive a shivery feeling that came on about this time last night a touch of malarial fever perhaps they get it now and then in the town though we ought to be free from it on the hill anyhow if you dont mind ill get off to bed  he went away and jake looked about the veranda and the room that opened on to it there was a canvas chair or two a folding table a large drawing board on a trestle frame and two cheap tin lamps it was obvious that dick thought of nothing much except his work and had a spartan disregard for comfort  a good sort but its concrete first and last with him jake remarked guess ive got to start by making this shack fit for a white man to live in  dick passed a restless night but felt better when he began his work on the dam next morning though he did not touch the small hard roll and black coffee his colored steward had put ready for him the air was fresh the jungle that rolled down the hill glittered with dew and the rays of the red sun had so far only a pleasant warmth cranes were rattling locomotives snorted as they moved the ponderous concrete blocks and hauled away loads of earth and a crowd of picturesque figures were busy about the dam some wore dirty white cotton and ragged crimson sashes the dark limbs of others projected from garments of vivid color dick drove the men as hard as he was able they worked well chattering and laughing in the early morning and there was much to be done because olivas dismissal had made a difference  the men flagged as the sun got higher and at length dick sat down in the thin shade of a tree the light was now intense the curving dam gleamed a dazzling pearlygray through a quivering radiance and the water that had gathered behind it shone like molten silver one could imagine that the pools reflected heat as well as light dicks eyes ached and for a few minutes he let them rest upon the glossy green jungle and the belts of cultivation down the hill  then he roused himself because he must watch what was going on the great blocks must be properly fitted into place and one could not trust the dusky laborers to use the care that was needed besides they were getting slack and the fresh blocks the locomotives brought would soon begin to accumulate since this would mean extra handling and consequent expense the track must be kept clear still dick wished noon would come for his head ached badly and he felt the heat as he had not felt it before  it was hard to force himself to begin again after the short midday rest but he became a little more vigorous as the sun sank and the shadow of the black cordillera lengthened across the valley after dinner when he lounged on the veranda the headache and lassitude returned and he listened to jakes talk vacantly and soon went to bed he knew he was not well but while malarial fever was not unusual in the neighborhood people seldom took it in a virulent form and as there was a good doctor at santa brigida he determined to consult him when he had occasion to visit the town as it happened a crane broke next day and when evening came he set off to inquire if new castings could be made for it in the spanish foundry while he waited for an engine to take him down the line jake announced his intention of coming  ive never been round a spanish town he said  youre not going round a spanish town now if i can prevent it dick rejoined however i suppose i cant order you off your fathers locomotive  jake smiled you can resent my taking the line you hint at when ive done so but i guess one must make allowances youre getting the fever badly partner  its the heat dick answered in an apologetic tone anyhow santa brigidas a dirty uninteresting place  i expect your ideas of whats interesting are different from mine concretes all right in the daytime though you can have too much of it then but you want to please your eye and relax your brain at night  i was afraid of something of the kind but heres the locomotive get up if youre coming  dick was silent as the engine jolted down the track for he was feverish and his companions talk irritated him besides he had promised ida fuller to take care of the lad and knew something of the license that ruled in the city jake seemed to claim the supposititious privileges of the artistic temperament and there were wineshops gamblers pretty creole girls with easy manners and ragged desperados who carried knives in santa brigida in fact it offered too many opportunities for romantic adventures in consequence dick went to the hotel magellan which they reached after walking from the end of the line and took jake into the bar  you had better stop here i wont be longer than i can help he said theyll make you a rather nice iced drink of canary tinto  just so jake replied tintos a thin sour claret isnt it in new york not long ago you could get iced buttermilk cant say i was fond of it but i reckon its as exhilarating as the other stuff  dick left him with some misgivings and went about his business it was eight oclock in the evening and the foundry would be closed but he knew where the manager lived and went to his house which was situated in the older part of the city he had not taken jake because he had to pass some of the less reputable caf√©s and gambling dens and thought it undesirable that the lad should know where they were the foundry manager was not at home but a languishing young woman with a thickly powdered face who called her mother before she conferred with dick told him where don tomas had gone and dick set off again in search of the caf√© she named  a half moon hung low in the clear sky but for the most part its light only reached a short distance down the white and yellow fronts of the flattopped houses these got light and air from the central courtyard or patio and the outer walls were only pierced by one or two very narrow windows at some height from the ground the openings were marked here and there by a faint glow from within which was often broken by a shadowy female form leaning against the bars and speaking softly to another figure on the pavement below  there were few street lamps and in places the houses crowded in upon the narrow strip of gloom through which dick picked his way with echoing steps most of the citizens were in the plaza and the streets were quiet except for the measured beat of the surf and the distant music of the band a smell of rancid oil and garlic mingled with the strong perfumes spanish women use hung about the buildings but now and then a puff of cooler air flowed through a dark opening and brought with it the keen freshness of the sea once the melancholy note of a guitar came down from a roof and somebody began to sing in a voice that quivered with fantastic tremolos  dick went carefully keeping as far as possible away from the walls in santa brigida all white men were supposed to be rich and the honesty of the darker part of its mixed population was open to doubt besides he had learned that the fairskinned northerners were disliked they brought money which was needed into the country but they also brought machines and business methods that threatened to disturb the tranquillity the latin halfbreed enjoyed the latter must be beaten in industrial strife and exchanging independence for higher wages become subject to a more vigorous mercantile race the halfbreeds seemed to know this and regarded the foreigners with jealous eyes for all that dick carried no weapons a pistol large enough to be of use was an awkward thing to hide and he agreed with bethune that to wear it ostentatiously was more likely to provoke than avoid attack  once he thought he was followed but when he stopped to look round the shadowy figure behind turned into a side street and he presently found the man he was in search of in a quiet caf√© he spent some time explaining the drawings of the patterns that would be required before don tomas undertook to make the castings and then languidly leaned back in his chair his head had begun to ache again and he felt strangely limp and tired the fever was returning as it did at night but he roused himself by and by and set off to visit the doctor  on his way he passed the casino and to his surprise saw jake coming down the steps dick frowned when they met  how did you get in he asked its the rule for somebody to put your name down on your first visit  so it seemed said jake there are however ways of getting over such difficulties and a dollar goes some distance in this country much farther in fact than it does in ours  its some consolation to think youve had to pay for your amusement dick answered sourly  jake smiled on the contrary i found it profitable you make a mistake thats common with serious folks by taking it for granted that a cheerful character marks a fool he put his hand in his pocket and brought it out filled with silver coin say what do you think of this  put the money back dick said sharply for there was a secondrate wineshop not far off and a group of untidy halfbreeds lounged about its front jake however took out another handful of silver  my luck was pretty good i reckon it says something for me that i knew when to stop  he jingled the money as he passed the wineshop and dick looking back thought one of the men inside got up but nobody seemed to be following them when they turned into another street this was the nearest way to the doctors but it was dark and narrow and dick did not like its look  keep in the middle he warned jake  they were near the end of the street when two men came out of an arch and waited for them  have you a match se√±or one who held a cigarette in his hand asked  no said dick suspiciously keep back  but it is only a match we want said the other and jake stopped  whats the matter with giving him one wait till i get my box  he gave it to the fellow who struck a match and after lighting his cigarette held it so that the faint illumination touched dicks face  thanks se√±or said the halfbreed who turned to his companion as he added softly in castilian the other  dick understood it was not jake but himself who was threatened and he thought he knew why  look out for that fellow jake he cried get back to the wall  jake to dicks relief did as he was told but next moment another man ran out of the arch and somebody in the darkness called out in castilian dick thought he knew the voice but the men were behind him now and he turned to face them the nearest had his hand at his ragged sash and dick saw that he must act before the long spanish knife came out he struck hard leaning forward as he did so and the man reeled back but the other two closed with him and although his knuckles jarred as a second blow got home he felt a stinging pain high up in his side his breathing suddenly got difficult but as he staggered towards the wall he saw jake dash his soft hat in the face of another antagonist and spring upon the fellow there seemed to be four men round them and one was like oliva the contractor but dicks sight was going and he had a fit of coughing that was horribly painful  he heard jake shout and footsteps farther up the street and tried to lean against the house for support but slipped and fell upon the pavement he could neither see nor hear well but made out that his assailants had slunk away and men were running towards jake who stood calling for help in the middle of the street shortly afterwards a group of dark figures gathered round and he heard confused voices he thought jake knelt down and tried to lift him but this brought on a stab of burning pain and he knew nothing more     chapter x  la mignonne   a cool sea breeze blew through the halfopened lattice and a ray of sunshine quivered upon the ochercolored wall when dick awoke from a refreshing sleep he felt helplessly weak and his side which was covered by a stiff bandage hurt him when he moved but his head was clear at last and he languidly looked about the room was spacious but rather bare there was no carpet but a rug made a blotch of cool green on the smooth dark floor two or three religious pictures hung upon the wall and he noted how the soft blue of the virgins dress harmonized with the yellow background an arch at one end was covered by a leather curtain like those in old spanish churches but it had been partly drawn back to let the air circulate outside the hookedback lattice he saw the rails of a balcony and across the narrow patio a purple creeper spread about a dazzling white wall  all this was vaguely familiar because it was some days since dick had recovered partial consciousness though he had been too feeble to notice his surroundings much or find out where he was now he studied the room with languid interest as he tried to remember what had led to his being brought there the scanty furniture was dark and old and he knew the wrinkled brownfaced woman in black who sat by the window with a dark shawl wound round her head she had a place in his confused memories as had another woman with a curious lifeless face and an unusual dress who had once or twice lifted him and done something to his bandages still it was not of her dick was thinking there had been somebody else brighter and fresher than either who sat beside him when he lay in fevered pain and sometimes stole in and vanished after a pitiful glance  a bunch of flowers stood upon the table and their scent mingled with the faint smell of decay that hung about the room lying still dick heard the leather curtain rustle softly in the draught muffled sounds of traffic and the drowsy murmur of the surf its rhythmic beat was soothing and he thought he could smell the sea by and by he made an abrupt move that hurt him as a voice floated into the room it was singularly clear and sweet and he thought he knew it as he seemed to know the song but could not catch the words and the singing stopped then light footsteps passed the arch and there was silence again  whos that he asked with an energy he had not been capable of until then  la mignonne said the old woman with a smile that showed her thick red lips and firm white teeth  and whos mignonne  la la said the woman soothingly cest ma mignonne but you jess go to sleep again  how can i go to sleep when im not sleepy and you wont tell me what i want to know dick grumbled but the woman raised her hand and began to sing an old plantation song  im not a child he protested weakly but thats rather nice  closing his eyes he tried to think his nurse was not a spanish mulatto as her dark dress suggested it was more likely that she came from louisiana where the old french stock had not died out but dick felt puzzled she had spoken obviously with affection of ma mignonne but he was sure the singer was no child of hers there was no creole accent in that clear voice and the steps he heard were light the feet that had passed his door were small and arched not flat like a negros he had seen feet of the former kind slip on an iron staircase and brush in pretty satin shoes across a lawn on which the moonlight fell besides a girl whose skin was fair and whose movements were strangely graceful had flitted about his room while he puzzled over this he went to sleep and on waking saw with a start of pleasure jake sitting near his bed his nurse had gone  hullo he said im glad youve come there are a lot of things i want to know  the trouble is ive been ordered not to tell you much its a comfort to see you looking brighter  i feel pretty well but can you tell me where i am and how i got there  certainly well take the last question first somebody tore off a shutter and we carried you on it i guess you know you got a dagos knife between your ribs  i seem to remember something like that said dick who added with awkward gratitude i believe the brutes would have killed me if you hadnt been there  it was a pretty near thing does it strike you as curious that while you made yourself responsible for me i had to take care of you  you did so anyhow dick remarked with feeling but go on  somebody brought a spanish doctor who said you couldnt be moved much and must be taken into the nearest house so we brought you here  where is here thats what i want to know  my orders are not to let you talk weve changed our positions now youve got to listen for all that you ought to be thankful youre not in the santa brigida hospital which was too far away its three hundred years old and smells older felt as if you could bake bricks in it and no air gets in  but what were you doing at the hospital  i went to see a fellow who told me hed been fired out of our camp he came up just after the dago knifed you and knocked out the man i was grappling with but got an ugly stab from one of the gang we didnt find this out until we had disposed of you however hes nearly all right and theyll let him out soon  ah said dick that must be payne the storekeeper but you see i fired him why did he interfere  i dont know he said something about your being a white man and it was three to one  dick pondered this and then his thoughts resumed their former groove  whos the mulatto woman in black  shes called lucille a nice old thing and seems to have looked after you well when i came in she was singing you to sleep voice all gone of course but id like to write down the song it sounded like the genuine article  what do you mean by the genuine article  well i think it was one of the plantation lullabies they used to sing before the war not the imitation trash fourthrate composers turned out in floods some years ago that of course has no meaning but the other expressed the spirit of the race words quaint coonenglish with a touch of real feeling air something after the style of a campmeeting hymn and yet somehow african in fact its unique music but its good  hadnt i another nurse dick asked  jake laughed i ought to have remembered that youre not musical there was a nursing sister of some religious order  i dont mean a nun dick persisted a girl came in now and then  its quite possible some of them are sympathetic and some are curious no doubt you were an interesting patient anyhow you gave the spanish doctor plenty trouble he was rather anxious for a time the fever you had before the dago stabbed you complicated things jake paused and looked at his watch now ive got to quit i had orders not to stay long but ill come back soon to see how youre getting on  dick let him go and lay still thinking drowsily jake had apparently not meant to answer his questions he wanted to know where he was and had not been told it looked as if his comrade had been warned not to enlighten him but there was no reason for this above all he wanted to know who was the girl with the sweet voice and light step jake who had admitted that she might have been in his room had no doubt seen her and dick could not understand why he should refuse to speak of her while he puzzled about it he went to sleep again  it was dark when he awoke and perhaps he was feverish or his brain was weakened by illness for it reproduced past scenes that were mysteriously connected with the present he was in a strange house in santa brigida for he remarked the shadowy creeper on the wall and a pool of moonlight on the dark floor of his room yet the cornfields in an english valley through which he drove his motor bicycle seemed more real and he could see the rows of stocked sheaves stretch back from the hedgerows he sped past something sinister and threatening awaited him at the end of the journey but he could not tell what it was then the cornfields vanished and he was crossing a quiet walled garden with a girl at his side he remembered how the moonlight shone through the branches of a tree and fell in silver splashes on her white dress her face was in the shadow but he knew it well  after a time he felt thirsty and moving his head looked feebly about the room a slender white figure sat near the wall and he started because this must be the girl he had heard singing  i wonder if you could get me something to drink he said  the girl rose and he watched her intently as she came towards him with a glass when she entered the moonlight his heart gave a sudden throb  clare miss kenwardine he said and awkwardly raised himself on his arm  yes she said i am clare kenwardine but drink this then ill put the pillows straight and you must keep still  dick drained the glass and lay down again for he was weaker than he thought  thanks dont go back into the dark you have been here all the time i mean since i came  as you were seldom quite conscious until this morning how did you know  i didnt know in a way and yet i did there was somebody about who made me think of england and then you see i heard you sing  still she said smiling i dont quite understand  dont you said dick who felt he must make things plain well you stole in and out and sat here sometimes when lucille was tired i didnt exactly notice youperhaps i was too illbut i felt you were there and that was comforting  and yet you are surprised to see me now  i cant have explained it properly i didnt know you were miss kenwardine but i felt i knew you and kept trying to remember but i was feverish and my mind wouldnt take your image in for all that something told me it was really there already and id be able to recognize it if i waited it was like a photograph that wasnt developed  youre feverish now clare answered quietly i mustnt let you talk so much  youre as bad as jake he wouldnt answer my questions dick grumbled then you see i want to talk  clare laughed as if she found it a relief to do so that doesnt matter if it will do you harm  ill be very quiet dick pleaded ill only speak a word or two now and then but dont go away  clare sat down and after a few minutes dick resumed you passed my door today and its curious that i knew your step though if you can understand without actually recognizing it it was as if i was dreaming something that was real the worst of being ill is that your brain gets working independently bringing things up on its own account without your telling it anyhow i remembered the iron steps with the glow of the window through the curtain and how you slippedyou wore little white shoes and the moonlight shone through the branches on your dress  he broke off and frowned for a vague unpleasant memory obtruded itself something that had had disastrous consequences had happened in the quiet garden but he could not remember what it was  why did lucille call you ma mignonne he asked doesnt it mean a petted child  not always she was my nurse when i was young  then you have lived here before  not here but in a country where there are people like lucille though its long ago but you mustnt speak another word go to sleep at once  then stay where i can see you and ill try dick answered and although he did not mean to do so presently closed his eyes  clare waited until his quiet breathing showed that he was asleep and then crossed the floor softly and stood looking down on him there was light enough to see his face and it was worn and thin his weakness moved her to pity but there was something else he had remembered that night in england he knew her step and voice and his rambling talk had caused her a thrill for she remembered the night in england well brandon had shielded her from a man whom she had good ground for wishing to avoid he had no doubt not quite understood the situation but had seen that she needed help and chivalrously offered it she knew he could be trusted and had without much hesitation made her unconventional request he had then been marked by strong vitality and cheerful confidence but he was ill and helpless now and his weakness appealed to her as his vigor had not done he was in a way dependent on her and clare felt glad this was so she blushed as she smoothed the coverlet across his shoulders and then quietly stole away  there was no sea breeze next morning and the sun shone through a yellow haze that seemed to intensify the heat the white walls reflected a curious subdued light that was more trying to the eyes than the usual glare and the beat of the surf was slow and languid the air was still and heavy and dicks fever which had been abating recovered force he was hot and irritable and his restlessness did not vanish until clare came in at noon  ive been watching for you since daybreak and you might have come before he said lucille means well but shes clumsy she doesnt help one to be quiet as you do  youre not quiet clare answered in a reproving tone lucille is a very good nurse better than i am  well said dick in a thoughtful tone perhaps she is in a way she never upsets the medicine on my pillow as you did the last time the nasty stuff got into my hair  clare raised her hand in remonstrance you really mustnt talk  im going to talk dick answered defiantly its bad for me to keep puzzling over things and i mean to get them straight lucilles very patient but she isnt soothing as you are it rests ones eyes to look at you but thats not altogether why i like you about i expect its because you knew i hadnt stolen those plans when everybody else thought i had but then why did i tear your letter up  clare made an abrupt movement she knew he must be kept quiet and his brain was not working normally but his statement was disturbing  you tore it up she asked with some color in her face  yes said dick in a puzzled voice i tore it all to bits there was a reason though i cant remember it in fact i cant remember anything today but dont go off if i shut my eyes for a minute it wouldnt be fair  clare turned her head but except for this she did not move and it was a relief when after a few disjointed remarks his voice died away she was moved to pity but for a few moments she had quivered in the grasp of another emotion it was obvious that dick did not altogether know what he was saying but he had shown her plainly the place she had in his mind and she knew she would not like to lose it  half an hour later lucille came in quietly and clare went away     chapter xi  clare gets a shock   for a week the stagnant heat brooded over santa brigida sucking up the citizens energy and leaving limp depression steaming showers that broke at intervals filled the air with an enervating damp and the nights were worse than the days no draught crept through the slits of windows into the darkened houses and the musty smell that characterizes old spanish cities gathered in the patios and sweltering rooms  this reacted upon dick who had a bad relapse and for some days caused his nurses grave anxiety there was sickness in the town and the doctor could spare but little time to him the nursing sister was occupied and dick was for the most part left to clare and lucille they did what they could the girl with pitiful tenderness the mulatto woman with patience and some skill but dick did not know until afterwards that in a measure he owed his life to them youth however was on his side the delirium left him and after lying for a day or two in halfconscious stupor he came back to his senses weak but with unclouded mind he knew he was getting better and his recovery would not be long but his satisfaction was marred by keen bitterness clare had stolen his papers and ruined him  point by point he recalled his visit to kenwardines house trying to find something that could be urged in the girls defense and when he failed seeking excuses for her but her guilt was obvious he hated to own it but the proof was overwhelming she knew the power of her beauty and had treated him as a confiding fool he was not revengeful and had been a fool but it hurt him badly to realize that she was not what he had thought he hardly spoke to lucille who came in now and then and did not ask for clare as he had hitherto done the girl did not know this because she was taking the rest she needed after a week of strain  jake was his first visitor next morning and dick asked for a cigarette  im well enough to do what i like again he said i expect you came here now and then  i did but they would only let me see you once i suppose you know you were very ill  yes i feel like that but i dare say you saw kenwardine it looks as if this is his house  it is we brought you here because its near the street where you got stabbed  dick said nothing for a minute and then asked whats kenwardine doing in santa brigida  its hard to say like other foreigners in the town hes probably here for what he can get looking for concessions or a trading monopoly of some kind  ah said dick im not sure but do you like him  yes he strikes me as a bit of an adventurer but so are the rest of them and hes none the worse for that trying to get ahead of dago politicians is a risky job  is he running this place as a gambling house  no said jake warmly thats much too strong there is some card play evenings and ive lost a few dollars myself but the stakes are moderate and anything he makes on the bank wouldnt be worth while he enjoys a game thats all so do other people were not all like you  did you see miss kenwardine when you came for a game  i did but i want to point out that i came to see you she walked through the patio where we generally sat and spoke to us pleasantly but seldom stopped more than a minute a matter of politeness i imagine and no doubt shed sooner have stayed away  kenwardine ought to keep her away one wonders why he brought the girl to a place like this  jake frowned thoughtfully perhaps your remark is justified in a sense but you mustnt carry the idea too far hes not using his daughter as an attraction its unthinkable  that is so agreed dick  well said jake i allow that our talking about it is in pretty bad taste but my view is this somehow i dont think kenwardine has much money and he may feel he has to give the girl a chance  to marry some gambling rake  no said jake sharply it doesnt follow that a man is trash because he stakes a dollar or two now and then and there are some pretty straight fellows in santa brigida then he paused and grinned take yourself for example youve talent enough to carry you some way and im open to allow youre about as sober as a man could be  as it happens im not eligible dick rejoined with a touch of grimness kenwardine wouldnt think me worth powder and shot and ive a disadvantage you dont know of yet  anyhow it strikes me youre taking a rather strange line kenwardine let us bring you here when you were badly hurt and miss kenwardine has given herself a good deal of trouble about you in fact i guess you owe it to her that youre recovering  thats true i think said dick i cant remember much about my illness but ive a notion that she took very good care of me still theres no reason i should give her further trouble when im getting better and i want you to make arrangements for carrying me back to the dam perhaps a hammock would be the best plan  youre not fit to be moved yet  im going anyhow dick replied with quiet resolution  after trying in vain to persuade him jake went away and soon afterwards kenwardine came in the light was strong and dick noted the touches of gray in his short dark hair but except for this he looked young and athletic his figure was graceful his dress picturesque for he wore white duck with a colored silk shirt and red sash and he had an easy goodhumored manner sitting down close by he gave dick a friendly smile  im glad to find you looking better but am surprised to hear you think of leaving us he said  my work must be falling behind and stuyvesant has nobody to put in my place  he sent word that they were getting on all right kenwardine remarked  im afraid he was overstating it with a good motive then you see i have given you and miss kenwardine a good deal of trouble and cant take advantage of your kindness any longer it would be an unfair advantage because im getting well of course im very grateful particularly as i have no claim on you  that is a point you can hardly urge you are a countryman and your cousin is a friend of mine i think on that ground we are justified in regarding you as an acquaintance  dick was silent for a few moments he felt that had things been different he would have liked kenwardine the man had charm and had placed him under a heavy obligation dick admitted this frankly but could not stay any longer in his house he had however a better reason for going than his dislike to accepting kenwardines hospitality clare had robbed him and he must get away before he thought of her too much it was an awkward situation and he feared he had not tact enough to deal with it  the truth is ive no wish to renew my acquaintance with people i met in england and i went to america in order to avoid doing so he said you know what happened before i left  yes but i think you are exaggerating its importance after all youre not the only man who has through nothing worse than carelessness had a black mark put against his name you may have a chance yet of showing that the thing was a mistake  then i must wait until the chance comes dick answered firmly  very well said kenwardine since this means youre determined to go we must try to make it as easy as possible for you ill see the doctor and mr fuller  he went out and by and by clare came in and noted a difference in dick he had generally greeted her as eagerly as his weakness allowed and showed his dependence on her but now his face was hard and resolute the change was puzzling and disturbing  my father tells me you want to go away she remarked  i dont want to but i must dick answered with a candor he had not meant to show you see things i ought to be looking after will all go wrong at the dam  isnt that rather egotistical clare asked with a forced smile i have seen mr bethune who doesnt look overworked and probably doesnt mind the extra duty in fact he said so  people sometimes say such things but when they have to do a good deal more than usual they mind very much anyhow it isnt fair to ask them and thats one reason for my going away  clare colored and her eyes began to sparkle do you think we mind  i dont dick answered awkwardly feeling that he was not getting on very well i know how kind you are and that you wouldnt shirk any trouble but still  suppose we dont think it a trouble  dick knitted his brows it was hard to believe that the girl who sat watching him with a puzzled look was an adventuress he had made her blush and had come near to making her angry while an adventuress would not have shown her feelings so easily the light that shone through the window touched her face and he noted its delicate modeling the purity of her skin and the softness of her eyes the sparkle had gone and they were pitiful clare had forgiven his ingratitude because he was ill  well he said what you think doesnt alter the fact that i have given you trouble and kept you awake looking after me at night i wasnt always quite sensible but i remember how often you sat here and brought me cool things to drink indeed i expect you helped to save my life he paused and resumed in a voice that thrilled with feeling this wasnt all you did when i was having a very bad time before i left england and everybody believed the worst you sent me a letter saying that you knew i was innocent  you told me you tore up the letter clare remarked quietly  dicks face got red he had not taken the line he meant to take and was obviously making a mess of things  are you sure i wasnt delirious  i dont think so did you tear up the letter  he gave her a steady look for he saw that he must nerve himself to face the situation it was unfortunate that he was too ill to deal with it properly but he must do the best he could  ill answer that if youll tell me how you knew i was innocent  clare looked puzzled as if his manner had jarred and dick saw that she was not acting her surprise was real he could not understand this but felt ashamed of himself  in a sense of course i didnt know she answered with a touch of embarrassment still i felt you didnt steal the plans it seemed impossible  thank you said dick who was silent for the next few moments he thought candor was needed and had meant to be frank but he could not wound the girl who had taken care of him  anyhow i lost the papers and that was almost as bad he resumed feebly when you get into trouble people dont care much whether youre a rogue or a fool youre in disgrace and thats all that matters however i mustnt bore you with my grumbling im getting better and they want me at the dam  then i suppose you must go as soon as you are able clare agreed and began to talk about something else  she left him soon and dick lay still frowning it had been a trying interview and he doubted if he had come through it well but hoped clare would make allowances for his being ill he did not want her to think him ungrateful and had certainly no wish to punish her for what had happened in the past but she had stolen his papers and he must get away  he was taken away next morning with the consent of the doctor who agreed that the air would be more invigorating on the hill clare did not come down to see him off and dick felt strangely disappointed although she had wished him a quick recovery on the previous evening kenwardine however helped him into his hammock and after the carriers started went back to the room where clare sat he noted that although the sun was hot the shutter was not drawn across the window which commanded the street  well he said mr brandon has gone and on the whole thats a relief  do you know why he went so soon clare asked  kenwardine sat down and looked at her thoughtfully he was fond of clare though he found her something of an embarrassment now and then he was not rich and ran certain risks that made his ability to provide for her doubtful while she had no marked talents to fall back upon if things went against him there was however the possibility that her beauty might enable her to make a good marriage and although kenwardine could not do much at present to forward this plan he must try to prevent any undesirable entanglement brandon for example was not to be thought of but he suspected clare of some liking for the young man  yes he said i know and sympathize with him in fact i quite see why he found it difficult to stay the situation was only tolerable while he was very ill  why  kenwardine meant to tell her it was better that she should smart a little now than suffer worse afterwards  as soon as he began to get better brandon remembered that we were the cause of his misfortunes you can see how this complicated things  but we had nothing to do with them clare said sharply what made him think we had  its not an illogical conclusion when he imagines that he lost his papers in our house  clare got up with a red flush in her face and her eyes sparkling its absurd she exclaimed he must have been delirious when he said so  he didnt say so in as many words brandon has some taste but he was perfectly sensible and intended me to see what he meant  the girl stood still trembling with anger and confusion and kenwardine felt sorry for her she was worse hurt than he had expected but she would rally  but he couldnt have been robbed while he was with us she said with an effort trying to understand dicks point of view he hadnt an overcoat so the plans must have been in the pocket of his uniform and nobody except myself was near him  she stopped with a gasp as she remembered how she had slipped and seized dick in doing so her hand had caught his pocket everything was plain now and for a few moments she felt overwhelmed her face blanched but her eyes were hard and very bright  kenwardine left her feeling that brandon would have cause to regret his rashness if he ever attempted to renew her acquaintance and clare sat down and tried to conquer her anger this was difficult because she had received an intolerable insult brandon thought her a thief it was plain that he did so because the change in his manner bore out all her father had said and there was no other explanation then she blushed with shame as she realized that from his point of view her unconventional behavior warranted his suspicions she had asked him to come into the garden and had written him a note this was horribly foolish and she must pay for it but she had been mistaken about his character  she had as a rule avoided the men she met at her fathers house and had shrunk with frank repugnance from one or two but brandon had seemed different then he had watched for her when he was ill and she had seen his heavy eyes get brighter when she came into the room now however she understood him better she had some beauty and he had been satisfied with her physical attractiveness although he thought her a thief this was worse than the coarse admiration of the men she had feared it was unthinkably humiliating but her anger helped her to bear the blow after all she was fortunate in finding out what brandon was since it might have been worse had the knowledge come later there was a sting in this that rankled but she could banish him from her thoughts now     chapter xii  dick keeps his promise   twinkling points of light that pierced the darkness lower down the hill marked the colored laborers camp and voices came up faintly through the still air the range cut off the land breeze though now and then a wandering draught flickered down the hollow spanned by the dam and a smell of hot earth and damp jungle hung about the veranda of dicks iron shack he sat near a lamp with a drawingboard on his knee while jake lounged in a canvas chair smoking and occasionally glancing at the sheet of figures in his hand his expression was gloomily resigned  i suppose youll have things ready for us in the morning dick said presently  fran√ßois accounts are checked and im surprised to find them right but i imagine the other calculations will not be finished anyhow it wont make much difference whether they are or not i guess you know that  well of course if you cant manage to do the lot  i dont say its impossible jake rejoined but beginning work before breakfast is bad enough without going on after dinner understand that i dont question your authority to find me a job at night its your object that makes me kick  we want the calculations made before we set the boys to dig  then why didnt you give me them when i was doing nothing this afternoon jake inquired  i hadnt got the plans ready  just so you havent had things ready for me until after dinner all this week as youre a methodical fellow thats rather strange still if you really want the job finished ill have to do my best but im going out first for a quarter of an hour  you neednt dick said dryly if you mean to tell the engineer not to wait hes gone i sent him off some time since  of course you had a right to send him off jake replied in an injured tone but i dont quite think  you know what your father pays for coal have you reckoned what it costs to keep a locomotive two or three hours for the purpose of taking you to santa brigida and back  i havent but i expect the old man wouldnt stand for my running a private car jake admitted however its the only way of getting into town  you were there three nights last week whats more you tried to draw your next months wages that struck me as significant though id fortunately provided against it  so i found out i suppose i ought to be grateful for your thoughtfulness but cant say i am i wanted the money because i had a run of wretched luck  at the casino  no said jake shortly  then you were at kenwardines ill own thats what i wanted to prevent hes a dangerous man and his house is no place for you  one would hardly expect you to speak against him considering everything its perhaps not quite in good taste  dick put down the drawingboard and looked at him steadily its very bad taste in fact i find myself in a very awkward situation your father gave me a fresh start when i needed it badly and agreed when your sister put you in my charge  idas sometimes a bit officious jake remarked  well dick continued i promised to look after you and although i didnt know what i was undertaking the promise must be kept its true that kenwardine afterwards did me a great service but his placing me under an obligation doesnt relieve me from the other which id incurred first  somewhat to his surprise jake nodded agreement no not from your point of view but what makes you think kenwardine is dangerous  i cant answer you had better take it for granted that i know what im talking about and keep away from him  as a matter of fact it was miss kenwardine to whom you owed most jake said meaningly do you suggest that shes dangerous too  dick frowned and his face got red but he said nothing and jake resumed theres a mystery about the matter and you know more than you intend to tell but if you blame the girl for anything youre absolutely wrong if youll wait a minute ill show you what i mean  he went into the shack and came back with a drawingblock which he stood upon the table under the lamp and dick saw that it was a watercolor portrait of clare kenwardine he did not know much about pictures but it was obvious that jake had talent the girl stood in the patio with a paleyellow wall behind her over which a vivid purple creeper trailed her lilac dress showed the graceful lines of her slender figure against the harmonious background and matched the soft blue of her eyes and the delicate white and pink of her skin the patio was flooded with strong sunlight but the girl looked strangely fresh and cool  i didnt mean to show you this but its the best way of explaining what i think jake said with some diffidence im weak in technique because i havent been taught but i imagine ive got sensibility its plain that when you paint a portrait you must study form and color but theres something else that you can only feel i dont mean the character thats expressed by the mouth and eyes its something vague and elusive that psychologists give you a hint of when they talk about the aura of course you cant paint it but unless it so to speak glimmers through the work your portraits dead  i dont quite understand but sometimes things do give you an impression you cant analyze dick replied  well allowing for poor workmanship all you see heres harmonious the blues and purples and yellows tone and yet if ive got the hot glare of the sun right you feel that the figures exotic and doesnt belong to the scene the latter really needs an oliveskinned daughter of the passionate south but the girl ive painted ought to walk in the moonlight through cool forest glades  dick studied the picture silently for he remembered with disturbing emotion that he had felt what jake suggested when he first met clare kenwardine she was frank but somehow remote and aloof marked by a strange refinement he could find no name for he was glad that jake did not seem to expect him to speak but after a few moments the latter wrapped up the portrait and took it away when he came back he lighted a cigarette  now he said do you think its sensible to distrust a girl like that admitting that her father makes a few dollars by gambling can you believe that living with him throws any taint on her  dick hesitated clare had stolen his papers this seemed impossible but it was true yet when he looked up he answered as his heart urged him  no it sounds absurd  it is absurd jake said firmly  neither spoke for the next minute and then dick frowned at a disturbing thought could the lad understand clare so well unless he loved her  that picture must have taken some time to paint did miss kenwardine often pose for you  no said jake rather dryly in fact she didnt really pose at all i had trouble to get permission to make one or two quick sketches and worked up the rest from memory  yet she let you sketch her it was something of a privilege  jake smiled in a curious way i think i see what you mean miss kenwardine likes me but although ive some artistic taste im frankly flesh and blood and thats not quite her style she finds me a little more in harmony with her than the rest but this is all still its something to me now you understand matters perhaps you wont take so much trouble to keep me out of santa brigida  ill do my best to keep you away from kenwardine dick declared  very well jake answered with a grin youre quite a good sort though youre not always very smart and i cant blame you for doing what you think is your duty  then he set to work on his calculations and there was silence on the veranda  dick kept him occupied for the next week and then prudently decided not to press the lad too hard by finding him work that obviously need not be done if he was to preserve his power it must be used with caution the first evening jake was free he started for santa brigida though as there was no longer a locomotive available he got two laborers to take him down the line on a handcar after that he had some distance to walk and arrived at kenwardines powdered with dust it was a hot night and he found kenwardine and three or four others in the patio  a small shaded lamp stood upon the table they had gathered round and the light sparkled on delicate green glasses and a carafe of wine it touched the mens white clothes and then cut off by the shade left their faces in shadow and fell upon the tiles a colored paper lantern however hung from a wire near an outside staircase and jake saw clare a short distance away it looked as if she had stopped in crossing the patio but as he came forward kenwardine got up  its some time since we have seen you he remarked  yes said jake i meant to come before but couldnt get away  then you have begun to take your business seriously  my guardian does  ah said kenwardine speaking rather louder if you mean mr brandon i certainly thought him a serious person but what has this to do with your coming here  he found me work that kept me busy evenings  with the object of keeping you out of mischief  i imagine he meant something of the kind jake admitted with a chuckle he glanced round and felt he had been too frank as his eyes rested on clare he could not see her face but thought she was listening  then it looks as if he believed we were dangerous people for you to associate with kenwardine remarked with a smile well i suppose were not remarkable for the conventional virtues  jake remembering dick had insisted that kenwardine was dangerous felt embarrassed as he noted that clare was now looking at him to make things worse he thought kenwardine had meant her to hear  i expect he really was afraid of my going to the casino he answered as carelessly as he could  though he would not be much relieved to find you had come to my house instead well i suppose one must make allowances for the puritan character  brandon isnt much of a puritan and hes certainly not a prig jake objected  kenwardine laughed im not sure this explanation makes things much better but well let it go we were talking about the new water supply its a harmless subject and you ought to be interested  jake sat down and stole a glance at clare as he drank a glass of wine there was nothing to be learned from her face but he was vexed with kenwardine who had intentionally involved him in an awkward situation jake admitted that he had not dealt with it very well for all that he began to talk about the irrigation works and the plans for bringing water to the town and was relieved to see that clare had gone when he next looked round  as a matter of fact clare had quietly stolen away and was sitting on a balcony in the dark tingling with anger and humiliation she imagined that she had banished brandon from her thoughts and was alarmed to find that he had still power to wound her it had been a shock to learn he believed that she had stolen his papers but he had now warned his companion against her father and no doubt herself jakes manner when questioned had seemed to indicate this  by and by she tried not to make excuses for brandon but to understand his point of view and was forced to admit that it was not unreasonable her father now and then allowed or perhaps encouraged his guests to play for high stakes and she had hated to see the evening gatherings of extravagant young men at their house in england indeed she had eagerly welcomed the change when he had offered to take her abroad because business necessitated his leaving the country things had been better at santa brigida but after a time the card playing had begun again the men who now came to their house were however of a different type from the rather dissipated youths she had previously met they were quieter and more reserved men of experience who had known adventure still she disliked their coming and had sometimes felt she must escape from a life that filled her with repugnance the trouble was that she did not know where to find a refuge and could not force herself to leave her father who had treated her with goodhumored indulgence  then she began to wonder what was the business that had brought him to santa brigida he did not talk about it but she was sure it was not gambling as brandon thought no doubt he won some money from his friends but it could not be much and he must lose at times she must look for another explanation and it was hard to find men who did not play cards came to the house in the daytime and occasionally late at night and kenwardine who wrote a good many letters now and then went away down the coast there was a mystery about his occupation that puzzled and vaguely alarmed her and she could turn to nobody for advice she had refused her aunts offer of a home and knew it would not be renewed they had cast her off and done with her getting up presently with a troubled sigh she went to her room  in the meantime jake stayed in the patio with the others a thin dark spaniard who spoke english well and two americans occupied the other side of the table a fat german sat nearly opposite the spaniard and next to jake the heat made them languid and nobody wanted to play cards although there was a pack on the table this happened oftener than brandon thought  its a depressing night and an enervating country kenwardine remarked i wonder why we stay here as we do since were apt to leave it as poor as when we came the people are an unstable lot and when youve spent your time and energy developing what you hope is a profitable scheme some change of policy or leaders suddenly cuts it short  i guess that explains why we are here one of the americans replied the south is the home of the dramatic surprise and this appeals to us in the north they act by rule and one knows more or less what will happen but this gives one no chances to bet upon  the fat german nodded it is the gamblers point of view you people take with pleasure steep chances as they say but mine act not so the system is better one calculates beforehand what may happen and it is provided for if things do not go as one expects one labors to change them and when this is not possible adopts an alternative plan  but there always is a plan se√±or richter the spaniard remarked  richter smiled with us i think that is true luck is more fickle than a woman and we like not the surprise but our effort is to be prepared for it  youre a pretty hard crowd to run up against said the other american  jake who had taken no part in the recent talk and leaned languidly back in his chair turned his head as he heard footsteps in the patio they were quick and decided as if somebody was coming straight towards the table but they stopped suddenly this seemed strange and jake who had caught a glimpse of a man in white clothes looked round to see if kenwardine had made him a sign the latter however was lighting his pipe but the spaniard leaned forward a little as if trying to see across the patio jake thought he would find this difficult with the light of the lamp in his eyes but richter who sat opposite got up and reached across the table  with excuses don sebastian but the wine is on your side he said and filled his glass from the decanter before he sat down  in the meantime the man who had come in was waiting but seemed to have moved because jake could only see an indistinct figure in the gloom  is that you enrique kenwardine asked when he had lighted his pipe  s√≠ se√±or a voice answered and kenwardine made a sign of dismissal  bueno you can tell me about it tomorrow i am engaged now  the footsteps began again and when they died away kenwardine picked up the cards  shall we play for half an hour he asked  the others agreed but the stakes were moderate and nobody took much interest in the game and jake presently left the house without seeing anything more of clare he felt he had wasted the evening but as he walked back to the line he thought about the man whom kenwardine had sent away he did not think the fellow was one of the servants and it seemed strange that richter should have got up and stood in front of don sebastian when the latter was trying to see across the patio still there was no apparent reason why the spaniard should want to see who had come in and jake dismissed the matter     chapter xiii  the return from the fiesta   the surefooted mules braced hard against the weight of the carriage slid down a steep descent across slippery stones when clare who wondered what would happen if the wornout harness broke rode into adexe gleaming white houses rose one above another among feathery palms with a broad streak of darker green in their midst to mark the shady alameda behind the dark range towered against the sky in front lay a foamfringed beach and the vast blue sweep of dazzling sea music came up through the languid murmur of the surf and the steep streets were filled with people whose clothes made patches of brilliant color the carriage jolted safely down the hill and clare looked about with interest as they turned into the central plaza where the driver stopped  its a picturesque little town and im glad you brought me she said but what does the fiesta theyre holding celebrate  i dont know the first landing of the spaniards perhaps kenwardine replied anyhow its a popular function and as everybody in the neighborhood takes part in it i came with the object of meeting some people i do business with in fact i may have to leave you for a time with the wife of a spaniard whom i know  when coming down the hillside clare had noticed a sugar mill and an ugly coaling wharf that ran out into the bay two steamers lay not far off rolling gently on the glittering swell and several lighters were moored against the wharf since she had never heard him speak of coal she imagined her fathers business was with the sugar mill but he seldom talked to her about such matters and she did not ask he took her to an old yellow house with tarnished brass rails barring its lower windows and a marble fountain in the patio where brilliant creepers hung from the balconies the soft splash of falling water was soothing and the spray cooled the air  it is very pretty clare said while they waited i wish we could make our patio like this  we may be able to do so when brandon and his friends bring us the water kenwardine replied with a quick glance at the girl have you seen him recently  not for three or four weeks said clare  there was nothing to be learned from her face but kenwardine noted a hint of coldness in her voice next moment however a stout lady in a black dress and a thin brownfaced spaniard came down to meet them kenwardine presented clare and for a time they sat on a balcony talking in a mixture of french and castilian then a man came up the outside staircase and took off his hat as he turned to kenwardine he had a swarthy skin but clare carelessly remarked that the hollows about his eyes were darker than the rest of his face as if they had been overlooked in a hurried wash and his bare feet were covered with fine black dust  don martin waits you se√±or he said  kenwardine excused himself to his hostess and after promising to return before long went away with the man  who is don martin and does he own the coaling wharf clare asked  no said the spaniard what makes you imagine so  there was some coaldust on his messenger  the spaniard laughed your eyes are as keen as they are bright se√±orita but your father spoke of business and he does not deal in coal they use it for the engine at the sugar mill  could i follow him to the mill i would like to see how they extract the sugar from the cane  it is not a good day for that the machinery will not be running said the spaniard who looked at his wife  i meant to take you to the cathedral everybody goes on the fiesta the lady broke in  clare agreed she suspected that her father had not gone to the sugar mill but this did not matter and she presently left the house with her hostess the small and rather dark cathedral was crowded and clare who understood very little of what went on was impressed by the close rows of kneeling figures while the candles glimmering through the incense and the music had their effect she came out in a thoughtful mood partly dazzled by the change of light and it was with something of a shock she stopped to avoid collision with a man at the bottom of the steps it was brandon and she noted that he looked well again but although they were face to face and he waited with his eyes fixed on her she turned away and spoke to her companion dick crossed the street with his hand clenched and his face hot but felt that he had deserved his rebuff he could not expect miss kenwardine to meet him as a friend  an hour or two later kenwardine returned to the house with richter the german and said he found he must drive to a village some distance off to meet an official whom he had expected to see in the town he doubted if he could get back that night but a sailing barquillo would take passengers to santa brigida and clare could go home by her the girl made no objection when she heard that two french ladies whom she knew were returning by the boat and stayed with her hostess when kenwardine and richter left towards evening the spaniard came in and stated that the barquillo had sailed earlier than had been announced but a steam launch was going to santa brigida with some friends of his on board and he could get clare a passage if she would sooner go se√±or kenwardine he added might drive home by another road without calling there again  half an hour later clare went with him to the coaling wharf where a launch lay at some steps a few people were already on board and her host left after putting her in charge of a spanish lady the girl imagined that he was glad to get rid of her and thought there was something mysterious about her fathers movements something he had not expected must have happened because he would not have brought her if he had known he could not take her home it was however not a long run to santa brigida by sea and the launch which had a powerful engine looked fast  in another few minutes a man came down the steps and threw off a rope before he jumped on board taking off his hat to the passengers he started the engine and sat down at the helm clare did not see his face until the launch was gliding away from the wharf and then hid her annoyance and surprise for it was brandon his eyes rested on her for a moment as he glanced about the boat but she saw he did not expect recognition perhaps she had been wrong when she passed him outside the cathedral but it was now too late to change her attitude  the water was smooth the sun had sunk behind the range and a warm breeze that ruffled the shining surface with silky ripples blew off the shore the rumble of the surf came in a deep undertone through the throb of the engine and the launch sped on with a frothy wave curling at her bows now and then clare glanced quickly at the helmsman who sat with his arm thrown round the tiller she thought he looked disturbed and felt sorry though she told herself that she had done the proper thing  after a time the launch swung in towards the beach and stopped at a rude landing behind a reef houses showed among the trees not far off and clare thought this was the pueblo of arenas then she was disturbed to see that all her companions were going to land when the spanish lady said goodby she got up with the idea of following the rest but dick stopped her  do you expect mr kenwardine to meet you he asked  no i was told the launch was going to santa brigida but didnt know that she was yours  dick eyes twinkled i am going to santa brigida and the boat is one we use but my colored fireman refused to leave the fiesta now you cant stay at arenas and i doubt if you can get a mule to take you home because theyll all have gone to adexe but if you like well go ashore and try  you dont think i could find a carriage clare asked irresolutely seeing that if she now showed herself determined to avoid him it would be humiliating to be forced to fall back upon his help  i dont besides its some distance to santa brigida over a rough steep road that youd find very awkward in the dark while as i can land you in an hour it seems unnecessary for you to leave the boat here  yes said clare perhaps it is  dick threw some coal into the furnace and restarted the launch the throb of the engine was quicker than before and when a jet of steam blew away from the escapepipe clare imagined that he meant to lose no time she glanced at him as he sat at the helm with a moody face and then away at the black hills that slid past the silence was embarrassing and she wondered whether he would break it on the whole she wanted him to do so but would give him no help  of course he said at length you neednt talk if youd sooner not but you gave me the cut direct in adexe and although i may have deserved it it hurt  i dont see why it should hurt clare answered coldly  dont you he asked well you have the right to choose your acquaintances but i once thought we were pretty good friends and i mightnt have got better if you hadnt taken care of me that ought to count for something  clare blushed but her eyes sparkled and her glance was steady if we are to have an explanation it must be complete and without reserve very well why did you change when you were getting better and why did you hint that i must know you hadnt stolen the plans  dick studied her with some surprise he had thought her gentle and trustful but saw that she burned with imperious anger it certainly was not acting and contradicted the supposition of her guilt  if i did hint anything of the kind i must have been a bit lightheaded he answered awkwardly you get morbid fancies when you have fever  the fever had nearly gone you were braver then than you seem to be now  i suppose thats true sometimes a shock gives you pluck and i got a nasty one as i began to remember things  both were silent for the next few moments clares pose was tense and her look strained but her anger had vanished dick thought she was calmer than himself but after all she was so to speak on her defense and her part was easier than his he had forgiven her for robbing him kenwardine had forced her to do so and dick regretted he had not hidden his knowledge of the deed she must have hated it was bodily weakness that had led him to show his suspicion but he knew that if they were to be friends again no reserve was possible as clare had said the explanation must be complete it was strange after what had happened that he should want her friendship but he did want it more than anything else yet she must be told plainly what he had thought her he shrank from the task  what did you remember clare asked forcing herself to look at him  that i had the plans in the left top pocket of my uniform when i reached your house i felt to see if they were there as i came up the drive he answered doggedly soon afterward you slipped as we went down the steps into the garden and in clutching me your hand caught and pulled the pocket open it was a deep pocket and the papers could not have fallen out  so you concluded that i had stolen them clare said in a cold strained voice though her face flushed crimson  what else could i think  then though she tried to hide the breakdown clares nerve gave way she had forced the crisis in order to clear herself but saw that she could not do so dicks statement was convincing the papers had been stolen while he was in their house and she had a horrible suspicion that her father was the thief it came with a shock though she had already been tormented by a vague fear of the truth that she had resolutely refused to face she remembered the men who were at the house on the eventful night they were somewhat dissipated young sportsmen and not remarkable for intelligence none of them was likely to take part in such a plot  you must understand what a serious thing you are saying she faltered trying to doubt him and finding that she could not  i do he said regarding her with gravely pitiful eyes still you rather forced it out of me perhaps this is a weak excuse because i had meant to forget the matter  but didnt you want to clear yourself and get taken back  no i knew it was too late id shown i couldnt be trusted with an important job and id made a fresh start here  his answer touched the girl and after a quick halfashamed glance she thought she had misjudged him it was not her physical charm that had made him willing to condone her offense for he showed none of the bold admiration she had shrunk from in other men instead he was compassionate and she imagined anxious to save her pain  she did not answer and turning her head vacantly watched the shore slide past the mountains were growing blacker trails of mist that looked like gauze gathered in the ravines and specks of light began to pierce the gloom ahead they marked santa brigida and something must still be said before the launch reached port it was painful that brandon should take her guilt for granted but she feared to declare her innocence  you were hurt when i passed you at adexe she remarked without looking at him you must however see that friendship between us is impossible while you think me a thief  i must try to explain dick said slowly when i recovered my senses at your house after being ill i felt i must get away as soon as possible though i ought to have remembered only that you had taken care of me still you see my mind was weak just then afterwards i realized how ungratefully i had behaved the plans didnt matter they werent really of much importance and i knew if you had taken them it was because you were forced that made all the difference in a way you were not to blame im afraid he concluded lamely i havent made it very clear  clare was moved by his na√Øve honesty which seemed to be guarded by something finer than common sense after all he had made things clear he owned that he believed she had taken the plans and yet he did not think her a thief on the surface this was rather involved but she saw what he meant still it did not carry them very far  it is not long since you warned mr fuller against us she resumed  not against you that would have been absurd however jakes something of a gambler and your fathers friends play for high stakes the lad was put in my hands by people who trusted me to look after him i had to justify their confidence  of course but you must understand that my father and i stand together what touches him touches me  dick glanced ahead the lights of santa brigida had drawn out in a broken line and those near the beach were large and bright a hundred yards away two twinkling yellow tracks stretched across the water from the shadowy bulk of a big cargo boat farther on he could see the black end of the mole washed by frothy surf there was little time for further talk and no excuse for stopping the launch  thats true in a sense he agreed with forced quietness ive done you an injustice miss kenwardine so much is obvious but i cant understand the rest just yet i suppose i mustnt ask you to forget the line i took  we cant be friends as if nothing had happened  dick made a gesture of moody acquiescence well perhaps something will clear up the matter by and by i must wait because while its difficult now i feel it will come right  a minute or two later he ran the launch alongside a flight of steps on the mole and helping clare to land went with her to her house they said nothing on the way but she gave him her hand when he left her at the door     chapter xiv  complications   it was dark outside the feeble lamplight and very hot when dick sat on his veranda after a day of keen activity in the burning sun he felt slack and jaded for he had had difficult work to do and his dusky laborers had flagged under the unusual heat there was now no touch of coolness in the stagnant air and although the camp down the valley was very quiet a confused hum of insects came out of the jungle it rose and fell with a monotonous regularity that jarred upon dicks nerves as he forced himself to think  he was in danger of falling in love with clare kenwardine indeed he suspected that it would be better to face the truth and admit that he had already done so the prudent course would be to fight against and overcome his infatuation but suppose he found this impossible as he feared it seemed certain that she had stolen his papers but after all he did not hold her accountable some day he would learn more about the matter and find that she was blameless he had been a fool to think harshly of her but he knew now that his first judgment was right clare who could not have done anything base and treacherous was much too good for him this however was not the subject with which he meant to occupy himself because if he admitted that he hoped to marry clare there were serious obstacles in his way  to begin with he had made it difficult if not impossible for the girl to treat him with the friendliness she had previously shown besides which kenwardine would no doubt try to prevent his meeting her and his opposition would be troublesome then it was plainly desirable that she should be separated from her father who might involve her in his intrigues because there was ground for believing that he was a dangerous man in the next place dick was far from being able to support a wife accustomed to the extravagance that kenwardine practised it might be long before he could offer her the lowest standard of comfort necessary for an englishwoman in a hot foreign country  he felt daunted but not altogether hopeless and while he pondered the matter bethune came in on the whole dick found his visit a relief  i expect youll be glad to hear we can keep the machinery running bethune said as he sat down  dick nodded their fuel was nearly exhausted for owing to strikes and shortage of shipping fuller had been unable to keep them supplied  then you have got some coal as theres none at santa brigida just now wheres it coming from  adexe four big lighter loads stuyvesant has given orders to have them towed round  i understood the adexe people didnt keep a big stock the wharf is small  so did i but it seems that kenwardine came to stuyvesant and offered him as much as he wanted  kenwardine dick exclaimed  bethune lighted his pipe yes kenwardine as the wharfs supposed to be owned by spaniards i dont see what he has to do with it unless hes recently bought them out anyhow its highgrade navigation coal  better stuff than we need but the difference in price wont matter if we can keep the concrete mill going dick remarked thoughtfully still its puzzling if kenwardine has bought the wharf whys he sending the coal away instead of using it in the regular bunkering trade  theres a hint of mystery about the matter i expect you heard about the collier tramp that was consigned to the french company at arucas owing to some dispute they wouldnt take the cargo and the shippers put it on the market fuller tried to buy some but found that another party had got the lot well stuyvesant believes it was the german richter who bought it up  jake tells me that richters a friend of kenwardines  i didnt know about that said bethune they may have bought the cargo for some particular purpose for which they afterwards found it wouldnt be required and now want to sell some off  then kenwardine must have more money than i thought  the money may be richters bethune replied however since well now have coal enough to last until fuller sends some out i dont know that we have any further interest in the matter  he glanced keenly at dicks thoughtful face and then as the latter did not answer talked about something else until he got up to go after he had gone dick leaned back in his chair with a puzzled frown he had met richter and rather liked him but the fellow was a german and it was strange that he should choose an english partner for his speculations as he seemed to have done but while kenwardine was english dicks papers had been stolen at his house and his distrust of the man grew stronger there was something suspicious about this coal deal but he could not tell exactly what his suspicions pointed to and by and by he took up the plan of a culvert they were to begin next morning  a few days later jake and he sat one night in the stern of the launch which lay head to sea about half a mile from the adexe wharf the promised coal had not arrived and as fuel was running very short at the concrete mill dick had gone to see that a supply was sent it was late when he reached adexe and found nobody in authority about but three loaded lighters were moored at the wharf and a gang of peons were trimming the coal that was being thrown on board another ahead of the craft lay a small tug with steam up as the halfbreed foreman declared that he did not know whether the coal was going to santa brigida or not dick boarded the tug and found her spanish captain drinking ca√±a with his engineer dick thought one looked at the other meaningly as he entered the small hot cabin  i suppose its se√±or fullers coal in the barges and were badly in want of it he said as you have steam up youll start soon  we start yes answered the skipper who spoke some english and then paused and shrugged i do not know if we get to santa brigida tonight  why dick asked theres not very much wind and its partly off the land  the halfbreed engineer described in uncouth castilian the difficulties he had had with a defective pump and leaking glands and dick who did not understand much of it went back to his launch stopping the craft a short distance from the harbor he said to jake well wait until they start somehow i dont think they meant to leave tonight if i hadnt turned them out  jake looked to windward there was a moon in the sky which was however partly obscured by driving clouds the breeze was strong but blowing obliquely off the land did not ruffle the sea much near the beach a long swell however worked in and farther out the white tops of the combers glistened in the moonlight now and then a fresher gust swept off the shadowy coast and the water frothed in angry ripples about the launch  they ought to make santa brigida though theyll find some sea running when they reach offshore to go round the tajada reef he remarked  theres water enough through the inside channel  thats so jake agreed still its narrow and bad to find in the dark and i expect the skipper would sooner go outside then he glanced astern and said theyre coming out  two white lights one close above the other with a pale red glimmer below moved away from the wharf behind them three or four more twinkling red spots appeared and dick told the fireman to start the engine halfspeed steering for the beach he followed the fringe of surf but kept abreast of the tug which held to a course that would take her round the end of the reef  when the moon shone through he could see her plunge over the steep swell and the white wash at the lighters bows as they followed in her wake then as a cloud drove past their dark hulls faded and left nothing but a row of tossing lights by and by the launch reached a bend in the coastline and the breeze freshened and drew more ahead the swell began to break and showers of spray blew on board while the sea got white offshore  well get it worse when we open up the arenas bight said jake as he glanced at the lurching tug it looks as if the skipper meant to give the reef a wide berth hes swinging off to starboard watch his smoke  you have done some yachting then  i have said jake i used to sail a shoaldraught sloop on long island sound anyway if id been towing those coalscows id have edged in near the beach for the sake of smoother water and wouldnt have headed out until i saw the reef it will be pretty wet on board the scows now and theyll have had to put a man on each to steer  dick nodded agreement and signed the fireman to turn on more steam as he followed the tug outshore the swell got steadily higher and broke in angry surges the launch plunged and rattled as she swung her screw out of the sea but dick kept his course abreast of the tug which he could only distinguish at intervals between the clouds of spray her masthead lights reeled wildly to and fro but the low red gleam from the barges was hidden and he began to wonder why her captain was steering out so far it was prudent not to skirt the reef but the fellow seemed to be giving it unnecessary room the lighters would tow badly through the white curling sea and there was a risk of the hawsers breaking besides the engineer had complained that his machinery was not running well  a quarter of an hour later a belt of foam between them and the land marked the reef and the wind brought off the roar of breaking surf soon afterwards the white surge faded and only the tugs lights were left as a long cloudbank drove across the moon jake stood up shielding his eyes from the spray  hes broken his rope the coals adrift he cried  dick saw the tugs lights vanish which meant that she had turned with her stern towards the launch and then two or three twinkling specks some distance off  hed tow the first craft with a double rope a bridle from his quarters he said its strange that both parts broke and so far as i can make out the tail barge has parted her hawser too  a whistle rang out and dick called for fullspeed as the tugs green light showed  well help him to pick up the barges he remarked  the moon shone out as they approached the nearest and a bright beam swept across the sea until it touched the lurching craft her wet side glistened about a foot above the water and then vanished as a white surge lapped over it and washed across her deck a rope trailed from her bow and her long tiller jerked to and fro it was obvious that she was adrift with nobody on board and dick cautiously steered the launch towards her  thats curious but perhaps the rest drove foul of her and the helmsman lost his nerve and jumped he said ill put maccario on board to give us the hawser  then ill go with him jake offered he cant handle the big rope alone  dick hesitated it was important that they should not lose the coal but he did not want to give the lad a dangerous task the barge was rolling wildly and he durst not run alongside while some risk would attend a jump across the three or four feet of water between the craft  i think youd better stop here he objected  i dont jake answered with a laugh guess youve got to be logical you want the coal and it will take us both to save it  he followed the fireman who stood balancing himself for a spring on the forward deck while dick let the launch swing in as close as he thought safe the man leapt and dick watched jake with keen anxiety as the launch rose with the next comber but the lad sprang off as the bows went up and came down with a splash in the water that flowed across the lighters deck then dick caught the line thrown him and with some trouble dragged the end of the hawser on board he was surprised to find that it was not broken but he waved his hand to the others as he drove the launch ahead steering for the beach near which he expected to find a passage through the reef  before he had gone far the tug steamed towards him with the other barges in tow apparently bound for adexe  it is not possible to go on the skipper hailed give me a rope we take the lighter  you shant take her to adexe dick shouted we want the coal  though there was danger in getting too close the captain let the tug drift nearer  we bring you the lot when the wind drops  no said dick ill stick to what ive got  he could not catch the captains reply as the tug forged past but it sounded like an exclamation of anger or surprise and he looked anxiously for the foam upon the reef it was some time before he distinguished a glimmer in the dark for the moon was hidden and his progress was slow the lighter was big and heavily laden and every now and then her weight putting a sudden strain on the hawser jerked the launch to a standstill it was worse when lifting with the swell she sheered off at an angle to her course and dick was forced to maneuver with helm and engine to bring her in line again at some risk of fouling the hawser with the screw he knew little about towing but he had handled small sailing boats before he learned to use the launch the coal was badly needed and must be taken to santa brigida though an error of judgment might lead to the loss of the barge and perhaps of his comrades life  the phosphorescent gleam of the surf got plainer and the water smoother for the reef was now to windward and broke the sea but the moon was still covered and dick felt some tension as he skirted the barrier he did not know if he could find the opening or tow the lighter through the narrow channel the surf however was of help for it flashed into sheets of spangled radiance as it washed across the reef leaving dark patches among the lambent foam the patches had a solid look and dick knew that they were rocks  at length he saw a wider break in the belt of foam and the sharper plunging of the launch showed that the swell worked through this was the mouth of the channel and there was water enough to float the craft if he could keep off the rocks snatching the enginelamp from its socket he waved it and blew the whistle a shout reached him and showed that the others understood  dick felt his nerves tingle when he put the helm over and the hawser tightened as the lighter began to swing if she took too wide a sweep he might be unable to check her before she struck the reef and there seemed to be a current flowing through the gap glancing astern for a moment he saw her dark hull swing through a wide curve while the strain on the hawser dragged the launchs stern down but she came round and the tension slackened as he steered up the channel  for a time he had less trouble than he expected but the channel turned at its outer end and wind and swell would strike at him at an awkward angle when he took the bend as he entered it the moon shone out and he saw the black top of a rock dangerously close to leeward he waved the lantern but the lighter with sea and current on her weather bow forged almost straight ahead and the straining hawser dragged the launch back reaching forward dick opened the throttle valve to its limit and then sat grim and still while the throb of the screw shook the trembling hull something would happen in the next half minute unless he could get the lighter round glancing back he saw her low wet side shine in the moonlight two dark figures stood aft by the tiller and he thought the foam about the rock was only a fathom or two away  the launch was hove down on her side though the screw thudded furiously she seemed to gain no ground and then the strain on the hawser suddenly slackened dick wondered whether it had broken but he would know in the next few seconds there was a sharp jerk the launch was dragged to leeward but recovered and forged ahead she plunged her bows into a broken swell and the spray filled dicks eyes but when he could see again the foam was sliding past and a gap widened between the lighters hull and the white wash on the rock  the water was deep ahead and since he could skirt the beach and the wind came strongly off the land the worst of his difficulties seemed to be past still it would be a long tow to santa brigida and bracing himself for the work he lit his pipe     chapter xv  the missing coal   early next morning dick stood in front of the hotel magellan where he had slept for a few hours after his return and was somewhat surprised to see that jake had got up before him and was talking to a pretty darkskinned girl she carried a large bunch of flowers and a basket of fruit stood close by while jake seemed to be persuading her to part with some  dick stopped and watched them for the glow of color held his eye jakes white duck caught the strong sunlight while the girls dark hair and eyes were relieved by the brilliant lemontinted wall and the mass of crimson bloom her attitude was coquettish and jake regarded her with an ingratiating smile after a few moments however dick went down the street and presently heard his comrade following him when the lad came up he saw that he had a basket of dark green fruit and a bunch of the red flowers  i thought you were asleep early rising is not a weakness of yours he said  as it happens i didnt sleep at all jake replied steering that unhandy coalscow rather got upon my nerves and when she took the awkward sheer as we came through the reef the tiller knocked maccario down and nearly broke my ribs i had to stop the helm going the wrong way somehow  dick nodded it was obvious that the lad had been quick and cool at a critical time but his twinkling smile showed that he was now in a different mood  you seem to have recovered but why couldnt you leave the girl alone  im not sure shed have liked that jake replied its a pity you have no artistic taste or you might have seen what a picture she made  as a matter of fact i did see it but she has no doubt a halfbreed lover whod seriously misunderstand your admiration which might lead to your getting stabbed some night anyhow why did you buy the flowers  for one thing she was taking them to the magellan and i couldnt stand for seeing that blaze of color wasted on the guzzling crowd you generally find in a hotel diningroom  that doesnt apply to the fruit you cant eat those things they preserve them  eat them jake exclaimed with a pitying look well i suppose its the only use you have for fruit he took a stalk fringed with rich red bloom and laid it across the dark green fruit which was packed among glossy leaves now perhaps youll see why i bought it i rather think it makes a dainty offering  ah said dick to whom do you propose to offer it  miss kenwardine jake replied with a twinkle though of course her proper colors madonna blue  dick said nothing but walked on and when jake asked where he was going answered shortly to the telephone  well said jake knowing you as i do i suspected something of the kind with the romance of the south all round you you cant rise above concrete and coal  he followed dick to the public telephone office and sat down in the box with the flowers in his hands a line had recently been run along the coast and although the service was bad dick after some trouble got connected with a port official at arenas  did a tug and three coal barges put into your harbor last night he asked  no se√±or was the answer and dick asked for the coal wharf at adexe  why didnt you call them first jake inquired  i had a reason the tug was standing to leeward when she left us but if her skipper meant to come back to santa brigida hed have to put into arenas where hed find shelter  then youre not sure he meant to come back  ive some doubts dick answered dryly and was told that he was connected with the adexe wharf  what about the coal for the fuller irrigation works he asked  the tug and four lighters left last night somebody answered in castilian and dick imagined from the harshness of the voice that one of the wharfhands was speaking  that is so he said has she returned yet  no se√±or said the man the tug  he broke off and there was silence for some moments after which a different voice took up the conversation in english  sorry it may be a day or two before we can send more of your coal the tugs engines  has she got back dick demanded sharply  speak louder i cannot hear  dick did so but the other did not seem to understand  in two or three days you have one lighter  we have i want to know if the tug  the damage is not serious the other broke in  then im to understand shes back in port  a broken murmur answered but by and by dick caught the words not longer than two days  then he rang off and pushing jakes chair out of the way shut the door  its plain that they dont mean to tell me what i want to know he remarked the first man might have told the truth if they had let him but somebody pulled him away my opinion is that the tugs not at adexe and didnt go there  they went back to the hotel and dick sat down on a bench in the patio and lighted his pipe  theres something very curious about the matter he said  when the tug left us she seemed to be heading farther off shore than was necessary jake agreed still the broken water wouldnt matter so much when she had the wind astern  her skipper wouldnt run off his course and lengthen the distance because the wind was fair  no i dont suppose he would  well said dick my impression is that he didnt mean to start at all and wouldnt have done so if i hadnt turned him out  jake laughed after all theres no use in making a mystery out of nothing the people offered us the coal and you dont suspect a dark plot to stop the works what would they gain by that  nothing that i can see i dont think they meant to stop the works but they wanted the coal its not at adexe and theres no other port the tug could reach where has it gone  it doesnt seem to matter so long as we get a supply before our stock runs out  try to look at the thing as i do dick insisted with a frown i forced the skipper to go to sea and as soon as he had a good excuse his towrope parted besides which the last barge went adrift from the rest her hawser however wasnt broken it was slipped from the craft she was made fast to then though the tugs engines were out of order she steamed to leeward very fast and i firmly believe hasnt gone back to adexe  i expect theres a very simple explanation jake replied the truth is you have a rather senseless suspicion of kenwardine  ill own i dont trust him dick answered quietly  jake made an impatient gesture lets see if we can get breakfast because im going to his house afterwards  they wont have got up yet  its curious that you dont know more about their habits after living there miss kenwardine goes out with lucille before the sun gets hot and her fathers about as early as you are  what does he do in the morning  i havent inquired but ive found him in the room he calls his office youre misled by the idea that his occupation is gambling  dick did not reply and was silent during breakfast he understood jakes liking for kenwardine because there was no doubt the man had charm his careless genial air set one at ones ease he had a pleasant smile and a surface frankness that inspired confidence dick admitted that if he had not lost the plans at his house he would have found it difficult to suspect him but jake was right on one point kenwardine might play for high stakes but gambling was not his main occupation he had some more important business the theft of the plans however offered no clue to this kenwardine was an adventurer and might have thought he could sell the drawings but since he had left england shortly afterwards it was evident that he was not a regular foreign spy it was some relief to think so and although there was a mystery about the coal which dick meant to fathom if he could nothing indicated that kenwardines trickery had any political aim  dick dismissed the matter and remembered with halfjealous uneasiness that jake seemed to know a good deal about kenwardines household the lad of course had gone to make inquiries when he was ill and had probably been well received he was very little younger than clare and fuller was known to be rich it would suit kenwardine if jake fell in love with the girl and if not his extravagance might be exploited for all that dick determined that his comrade should not be victimized  when breakfast was over they left the hotel and presently met clare who was followed by lucille carrying a basket she looked very fresh and cool in her white dress on the whole dick would sooner have avoided the meeting but jake stopped and clare included dick in her smile of greeting  i have been to the market with lucille she said the fruit and the curious things they have upon the stalls are worth seeing but you seem to have been there though i did not notice you  no said jake indicating the flowers and fruit he carried i got these at the hotel the colors matched so well that i felt i couldnt let them go and then it struck me that you might like them dick warned me that the things are not eatable in their present state which is a pretty good example of his utilitarian point of view  clare laughed as she thanked him and he resumed lucille has enough to carry and id better bring the basket along  very well said clare my father was getting up when i left  dick said nothing and stood a yard or two away the girl had met him without embarrassment but it was jake she had addressed he felt that he was so to speak being left out  then ill come and talk to him for a while said jake i dont know a nicer place on a hot morning than your patio  but what about your work are you not needed at the dam  my work can wait i find from experience that it will keep for quite a long time without shriveling away though often it gets very stale anyhow after being engaged on the companys business for the most part of last night im entitled to a rest my partner of course doesnt look at things like that hes going back as fast as he can  dick hid his annoyance at the hint it was impossible to prevent the lad from going to kenwardines when clare was there to hear his objections and he had no doubt that jake enjoyed his embarrassment turning away he tried to forget the matter by thinking about the coal since kenwardine was at home it was improbable that he had been at adexe during the night if clare had a part in her fathers plots she might of course have made the statement about his getting up with an object but dick would not admit this she had helped the man once but this was an exception and she must have yielded to some very strong pressure for all that dick hoped his comrade would not tell kenwardine much about their trip in the launch  as a matter of fact jake handled the subject with some judgment when kenwardine who had just finished his breakfast gave him coffee in the patio they sat beneath the purple creeper while the sunshine crept down the opposite wall the air was fresh and the murmur of the surf came languidly across the flat roofs  arent you in town unusually early kenwardine asked  well said jake with a twinkle you see we got here late  then brandon was with you this makes it obvious that you spent a perfectly sober night  jake laughed he liked kenwardine and meant to stick to him but although rash and extravagant he was sometimes shrewd and admitted that there might perhaps be some ground for dicks suspicions he was entitled to lose his own money but he must run no risk of injuring his fathers business however since kenwardine had a share in the coaling wharf he would learn that they had been to adexe and to try to hide this would show that they distrusted him  our occupation was innocent but rather arduous he said we went to adexe in the launch to see when our coal was coming  did you get it the manager told me something about the tugs engines needing repairs  we got one scow that broke adrift off the tajada reef they had to turn back with the others  then perhaps id better telephone to find out what they mean to do kenwardine suggested  jake wondered whether he wished to learn if they had already made inquiries and thought frankness was best  brandon called up the wharf as soon as the office was open but didnt get much information something seemed to be wrong with the wire  i suppose he wanted to know when the coal would leave  yes said jake but he began by asking if the tug had come back safe and got no further because the other fellow couldnt hear  why was he anxious about the tug  kenwardines manner was careless but jake imagined he felt more interest than he showed  it was blowing pretty fresh when she left us and if the scows had broken adrift again thered have been some risk of losing them this would delay the delivery of the coal and were getting very short of fuel  i see said kenwardine well if anything of the kind had happened i would have heard of it you neednt be afraid of not getting a supply  jake waited he thought it might look significant if he showed any eagerness to change the subject but when kenwardine began to talk about something else he followed his lead half an hour later he left the house feeling that he had used commendable tact but determined not to tell brandon about the interview dick had a habit of exaggerating the importance of things and since he already distrusted kenwardine jake thought it better not to give him fresh ground for suspicion there was no use in supplying his comrade with another reason for preventing his going to the house     chapter xvi  jake gets into difficulties   day was breaking though it was still dark at the foot of the range when dick returned wearily to his iron shack after a nights work at the dam there had been a local subsidence of the foundations on the previous afternoon and he could not leave the spot until precautions had been taken to prevent the danger spreading bethune came with him to look at some plans and on entering the veranda they were surprised to find the house well lighted and smears of mud and water upon the floor  looks as if a bathing party had been walking round the shack and your boy had tried to clean up when he was halfasleep bethune said  dick called his colored servant and asked him why are all the lights burning and whats this mess  se√±or fuller say he no could see the chairs  why did he want to see them  he fall on one se√±or trow it wit mucha force and fall on it again say dozenas of malditos sillas if he fall other time he kill my head  ah said dick sharply where is he now  he go in your bed se√±or  what has happened is pretty obvious bethune remarked fuller came home with a big jag on and scared this fellow wed better see if hes all right  dick took him into his bedroom and the negro followed the room was very hot and filled with a rank smell of kerosene for the lamp was smoking and the negro explained that jake had threatened him with violence if he turned it down the lad lay with a flushed face on dicks bed his muddy boots sticking out from under the crumpled coverlet he seemed to be fully dressed and his wet clothes were smeared with foul green slime there was a big red lump on his forehead  why didnt you put him into his own bed dick asked the negro  he go in se√±or and come out quick say no possible he stop maldito bed is damp  bethune smiled therell be a big washbasket for the lavenderas tomorrow but we must take his wet clothes off he shook jake youve got to wake up  after a time jake opened his eyes and blinked at bethune all right youre not as fat as salvador and you can catch that chair the fool thing follows me and keeps getting in my way  come out bethune ordered him and turned to the negro wheres his pyjamas  salvador brought a suit and dick who dragged jake out of bed asked how did you get into this mess  fell into pond behind the dam not safe that pond put a shingle up tomorrow keep off the grass no thatsh not right letsh try again twenty dollars fine if you spit on the sidewalk  bethune grinned at dick its not an unusual notice in some of our smaller towns and one must admit its necessary however we want to get him into dry clothes  jake gave them some trouble but they put him in a remade bed and went back to the verandah where bethune sat down  fuller has his good points but i guess you find him something of a responsibility he remarked  i do said dick with feeling still this is the first time he has come home the worse for liquor im rather worried about it because its a new trouble  and you had enough already bethune suggested well though youre not very old yet i think miss fuller did well to make you his guardian and perhaps im to blame for his relapse because i sent him to santa brigida fran√ßois was busy and there were a number of bills to pay for stores we bought in the town i hope fuller hasnt lost the money  dick felt disturbed but he said i dont think so jakes erratic but hes surprised me by his prudence now and then  bethune left soon afterwards and dick went to bed but got up again after an hour or two and began his work without seeing jake they did not meet during the day and dick went home to his evening meal uncertain what line to take he had no real authority and finding jake languid and silent decided to say nothing about his escapade when the meal was finished they left the hot room as usual for the verandah and jake dropped listlessly into a canvas chair  i allow youre more tactful than i thought he remarked with a feeble smile guess i was pretty drunk last night  it looked rather like it from your clothes and the upset in the house dick agreed  jake looked thoughtful well he said ingenuously i have been on a jag before but i really dont often indulge in that kind of thing and dont remember drinking enough to knock me out you see kenwardines a fastidious fellow and sticks to wine the sort he keeps is light  then you got drunk at his house id sooner have heard you were at the casino where the spaniards would have turned you out  you dont know the worst yet jake replied hesitatingly as im in a very tight place id better fess up fran√ßois doesnt seem to have told you that i tried to draw my pay for some months ahead  ah said dick remembering with uneasiness what he had learned from bethune that sounds ominous did you  let me get it over jake interrupted richter was there besides a spanish fellow and a man called black wed been playing cards and id won a small pile when my luck began to turn it wasnt long before i was cleaned out and heavily in debt kenwardine said id had enough and had better quit i sometimes think you dont quite do the fellow justice  never mind that said dick i suppose you didnt stop  no i took a drink that braced me up and soon afterwards thought i saw my chance the cards looked pretty good and i put up a big bluff and piled on all i had  but you had nothing youd lost what you began with  jake colored bethune had given me a check to bearer  i was afraid of that dick said gravely but go on  i thought id bluff them but black and the spaniard told me to play though kenwardine held back at first said they didnt want to take advantage of my rashness and i couldnt make good well i saw how i could put it over and it looked as if they couldnt stop me until black brought out a trump i didnt think he ought to have after that i dont remember much but imagine i turned on the fellow and made some trouble  can you remember how the cards went  no said dick awkwardly not now and i may have been mistaken about the thing i believe i fell over the table and they put me on a couch after a time i saw there was nobody in the room and thought id better get out he paused and added with a flush i was afraid miss kenwardine might find me in the morning  you cant pay back the money you lost  i cant the check will show in the works accounts and therell sure be trouble if the old man hears of it  dick was silent for a few moments it was curious that jake had tried to defend kenwardine but this did not matter the lads anxiety and distress were plain  if youll leave the thing entirely in my hands ill see what can be done he said ill have to tell bethune  ill do whatever you want if youll help me out jake answered eagerly and after asking some questions about his losses dick went to bethunes shack  bethune listened thoughtfully to what he had to say and then remarked well take it for granted that you mean to see him through have you enough money  no thats why i came  you must get the check back anyhow said bethune who opened a drawer and took out a roll of paper currency heres my pile and its at your service but it wont go far enough  i think it will with what i can add said dick after counting the bills you see i dont mean to pay the full amount  bethune looked at him and smiled well thats rather unusual but if they made him drunk and the game was not quite straight have you got his promise not to play again  i havent what im going to do will make it awkward if not impossible besides hell have no money ill stop what he owes out of his pay  a good plan however i wont lend you the money ill lend it jake which makes him responsible but your pays less than mine and youll have to economize for the next few months  that wont matter dick answered quietly i owe fuller something and i like the lad  he went back to his shack and said to jake well be able to clear off the debt but you must ask no questions and agree to any arrangement i think it best to make  youre a good sort jake said with feeling but dick cut short his thanks and went off to bed  next morning he started for santa brigida and when he reached kenwardines house met clare on a balcony at the top of the outside stairs somewhat to his surprise she stopped him with a sign and then stood silent for a moment looking disturbed  mr brandon she said hesitatingly i resented your trying to prevent mr fuller coming here but i now think it better that he should keep away hes young and extravagant and perhaps  yes said dick who felt sympathetic knowing what her admission must have cost im afraid hes also rather unsteady  clare looked at him with some color in her face i must be frank something happened recently that showed me he oughtnt to come i dont think i realized this before  then you know what happened  not altogether clare replied but i learned enough to alarm and surprise me you must understand that i didnt suspect she paused with signs of confusion and then resumed of course people of different kinds visit my father on business and sometimes stay an hour or two afterwards and he really cant be held responsible for them the customs of the country force him to be friendly you know in santa brigida ones office is something like an english club well a man who doesnt come often began a game of cards and when mr fuller  just so said dick as quietly as he could jakes rash and not to be trusted when there are cards about indeed i expect hes a good deal to blame but im now going to ask your father not to encourage his visits ive no doubt hell see the reason for this  im sure hell help you when he understands clare replied and after giving dick a grateful look moved away  dick went along the balcony thinking hard it was obvious that clare had found the interview painful though he had tried to make it easier for her she had been alarmed but he wondered whether she had given him the warning out of tenderness for jake it was probable that she really thought kenwardine was not to blame but it must have been hard to acknowledge that his house was a dangerous place for an extravagant lad still a girl might venture much when fighting for her lover dick frowned as he admitted this jake was a good fellow in spite of certain faults but it was disturbing to think that clare might be in love with him  it was something of a relief when kenwardine met him at the door of his room and took him in dick felt that tact was not so needful now because the hospitality shown him was counterbalanced by the theft of the plans and he held kenwardine not clare accountable for this kenwardine indicated a chair and then sat down  as you havent been here since you got better i imagine theres some particular reason for this call he said with a smile  that is so dick agreed ive come on fullers behalf he gave you a check the other night have you cashed it yet  no i imagined he might want to redeem it  he does but to begin with id like to know how much he lost before he staked the check i understand he increased the original stakes during the game  i dare say i could tell you but i dont see your object  ill explain it soon we cant get on until i know the sum  kenwardine took a small cardscoring book from a drawer and after a few moments stated the amount jake had lost  thank you said dick ill pay you the money now in exchange for the check  but he lost the check as well  dick hesitated he had a repugnant part to play since he must accuse the man who had taken him into his house when he was wounded of conspiring to rob a drunken lad for all that his benefactors son should not be ruined and he meant to separate him from kenwardine  i think not he answered coolly but suppose we let that go the check is worthless because payment can be stopped but im willing to give you what fuller had already lost  kenwardine raised his eyebrows in ironical surprise this is a somewhat extraordinary course is mr fuller in the habit of disowning his debts you know the rule about a loss at cards  fuller has left the thing in my hands and you must hold me responsible i mean to stick to the line ive taken  then perhaps you wont mind explaining on what grounds you take it  since you insist fuller was drunk when he made the bet as you were his host it was your duty to stop the game  the exact point when an excited young man ceases to be sober is remarkably hard to fix kenwardine answered dryly it would be awkward for the host if he fixed it too soon and insulting to the guest  thats a risk you should have taken for another thing fuller states that a trump was played by a man who ought not to have had it  kenwardine smiled doesnt it strike you that youre urging conflicting reasons first you declare that fuller was drunk and then that he was able to detect clever players at cheating your argument contradicts itself and is plainly absurd  anyhow i mean to urge it dick said doggedly  well said kenwardine with a steady look ive no doubt you see what this implies you charge me with a plot to intoxicate your friend and take a mean advantage of his condition  no i dont go so far i think you should have stopped the game but fuller accuses a man called black of playing the wrong card in fact i admit that you dont mean to harm him by taking it for granted that youll let me have the check because if you kept it youd have some hold on him  a firm hold kenwardine remarked  dick had partly expected this and had his answer ready not so firm as you think if there was no other way it would force me to stop payment and inform my employer it would be much better that jake should have to deal with his father than with your friends  you seem to have thought over the matter carefully kenwardine rejoined well personally im willing to accept your offer and give up the check but i must consult the others since their loss is as much as mine will you wait while i go to the telephone  dick waited for some time after which kenwardine came back and gave him the check as soon as he got it dick left the house satisfied because he had done what he had meant to do and yet feeling doubtful kenwardine had given way too easily it looked as if he was not convinced that he must leave fuller alone  on reaching the dam dick gave jake the check and told him how he had got it the lad flushed angrily but was silent for a moment and then gave dick a curious look  i cant deny your generosity and ill pay you back but you see the kind of fellow you make me out  i told kenwardine you left me to deal with the matter and the plan was mine said dick  jake signified by a gesture that the subject must be dropped as i did agree to leave it to you i cant object after all i expect you meant well     chapter xvii  the blackfunnel boat   the breeze had fallen and the shining sea was smooth as glass when the launch passed adexe dick who lounged at the helm was not going there some alterations to a mole along the coast had just been finished and stuyvesant had sent him to engage the contractor who had done the concrete work jake who occasionally found his duties irksome had insisted on coming  as they crossed the mouth of the inlet dick glanced shorewards through his glasses the whitewashed coalsheds glistened dazzlingly and a fringe of snowy surf marked the curve of beach but outside this a belt of cool blue water extended to the wharf the swell surged to and fro among the piles checkered with purple shadows and laced with threads of foam but it was the signs of human activity that occupied dicks attention he noticed the cloud of dust that rolled about the mounds of coal upon the wharf and blurred the figures of the toiling peons and the way the tubs swung up and down from the hatches of an american collier until the rattle of her winches suddenly broke off  they seem to be doing a big business he remarked it looks as if that boat had stopped discharging but she must have landed a large quantity of coal  theres pretty good shelter at adexe jake replied in ordinary weather steamers can come up to the wharf instead of lying a quarter of a mile off as they do at santa brigida however theres not much cargo shipped and a captain who wanted his bunkers filled would have to make a special call with little chance of picking up any freight that must tell against the place  they were not steaming fast and just before a projecting point shut in the inlet the deep blast of a whistle rang across the water and the colliers dark hull swung out from the wharf a streak of foam cut sharply between her black side and the shadowed blue of the sea marked her loadline and she floated high but not as if she were empty  going on somewhere else to finish i guess said jake how much do you reckon she has discharged  fifteen hundred tons if she was full when she came in and i imagine they hadnt much room in the sheds before i wonder where kenwardine gets the money unless his friend richter is rich  richter has nothing to do with the business jake replied he was to have had a share but they couldnt come to a satisfactory agreement  dick looked at him sharply how do you know  i really dont know much kenwardine said something about it one night when i was at his house  did somebody ask him  no said jake i dont think so the subject so to speak cropped up and he offered us the information  then he talked of something else and soon afterwards the coast receded as they crossed a wide bay it was about four oclock in the afternoon when they reached the farthest point from land there was no wind and in the foreground the sea ran in long undulations whose backs blazed with light farther off the gentle swell was smoothed out and became an oily expanse that faded into the glitter on the horizon but at one point the latter was faintly blurred a passing vessel dick thought and occupied himself with the engine for he had not brought the fireman looking round some time afterwards he saw that the ship had got more distinct and picked up his glasses  she was a twomasted steamer and cut off by the play of reflected light floated like a mirage between sky and sea after studying her for a minute dick gave jake the glasses  its a curious effect but not uncommon on a day like this he said shes like the big spanish boats and has their tall black funnel  shes very like them jake agreed theres no smoke and no wash about her it looks as if theyd had some trouble in the engineroom and shed stopped  dick nodded and glanced across the dazzling water towards the high blue coast he did not think the steamer could be seen from the land and the launch would no doubt be invisible from her deck but this was not important and he began to calculate how long it would take them to reach a point ahead some time later he looked round again the steamer was fading in the distance but no smoke trailed behind her and he did not think she had started yet his attention however was occupied by the headland he was steering for because he thought it marked the neighborhood of their port  he spent an hour in the place before he finished his business and started home and when they were about halfway across the bay the light began to fade the sun had sunk and the high land cut harshly blue against a saffron glow the sea was shadowy and colorless in the east presently jake who sat facing aft called out  theres a steamers masthead light coming up astern of us now i see her side lights and by the distance between them shes a big boat  dick changed his course because the steamers three lights would not have been visible unless she was directly following him and the launchs small yellow funnel and dingy white topsides would be hard to distinguish when he had shut out one of the colored side lights and knew he was safe he stopped the engine to wait until the vessel passed there was no reason why he should do so but somehow he felt interested in the ship lighting his pipe he studied her through the glasses which he gave to jake  shes the boat we saw before he said  thats so jake agreed her engines are all right now because shes steaming fast  dick nodded for he had marked the mass of foam that curled and broke away beneath the vessels bow but jake resumed it looks as if her dynamo had stopped theres nothing to be seen but her navigation lights and shes certainly a passenger boat they generally glitter like a ginsaloon  the ship was getting close now and dick who asked for the glasses examined her carefully as she came up foreshortened on their quarter her dark bow looked very tall and her funnel loomed huge and shadowy against the sky above its top the masthead light shed a yellow glimmer and far below the sea leapt and frothed about the line of hull this drew out and lengthened as she came abreast of them but now he could see the tiers of passenger decks one above the other there was something mysterious in the gloom that reigned on board no ring of light pierced her long dark side and the gangways behind the rails and rows of stanchions looked like shadowy caves in the open spaces forward and aft however bodies of men were gathered their clothes showing faintly white but they stood still in a compact mass until a whistle blew and the indistinct figures scattered across the deck  a big crew jake remarked guess theyve been putting them through a boat or fire drill  dick did not answer but when the vessel faded into a hazy mass ahead he started the engine and steered into her eddying wake which ran far back into the dark then after a glance at the compass he beckoned jake look how shes heading  jake told him and he nodded i made it half a point more to port but this compass swivels rather wildly where do you think shes bound  to santa brigida but as you can see not direct i expect her skipper wants to take a bearing from the adexe lights you are going there and her course is the same as ours  no said dick im edging in towards the land rather short of adexe as we have the current on our bow i want to get hold of the beach as soon as i can for the sake of slacker water anyway a big boat would keep well clear of the shore until she passed the tajada reef  then she may be going into adexe for coal  that vessel wouldnt float alongside the wharf and her skipper would sooner fill his bunkers where hed get passengers and freight  well i expect well find her at santa brigida when we arrive  they looked round but the sea was now dark and empty and they let the matter drop when they crossed the adexe bight no steamer was anchored near but a cluster of lights on the dusky beach marked the coaling wharf  theyre working late dick said can you see the tug  youd have to run close in before you could do so jake replied i expect theyre trimming the coal the collier landed into the sheds  its possible dick agreed and after hesitating for a few moments held on his course he remembered that one can hear a launchs engines and the splash of tornup water for some distance on a calm night  after a time the lights of santa brigida twinkled ahead and when they steamed up to the harbor both looked about the american collier and a big cargoboat lay with the reflections of their anchorlights quivering on the swell but there was no passenger liner to be seen a man came to moor the launch when they landed and jake asked if the vessel he described had called  no se√±or said the man the only boats i know like that are the cadiz liners and the next is not due for a fortnight  her models a pretty common one for big passenger craft jake remarked to dick as they went up the mole still the things curious she wasnt at adexe and she hasnt been here she certainly passed us steering for the land and i dont see where she could have gone  dick began to talk about something else but next morning asked stuyvesant for a days leave stuyvesant granted it and dick resumed do you mind giving me a blank order form im going to adexe and the storekeeper wants a few things we cant get in santa brigida  stuyvesant signed the form there it is the new coaling people seem an enterprising crowd and you can order anything they can supply  dick hired a mule and took the steep inland road but on reaching adexe went first to the sugar mill and spent an hour with the american engineer whose acquaintance he had made then having as he thought accounted for his visit he went to the wharf and carefully looked about as he made his way to the managers office  a few grimy peons were brushing coaldust off the planks their thinlyclad forms silhouetted against the shining sea their movements were languid and dick wondered whether this was due to the heat or if it was accounted for by forced activity on the previous night a neatly built stack of coal stood beside the whitewashed sheds but nothing suggested that it had been recently broken into passing it carelessly dick glanced into the nearest shed which was almost full though its proximity to deep water indicated that supplies would be drawn from it before the other feeling rather puzzled he stopped in front of the next shed and noted that there was much less coal in this moreover a large number of empty bags lay near the entrance as if they had been used recently and the storekeeper had not had time to put them away  two men were folding up the bags but by contrast with the glitter outside the shed was dark and dicks eyes were not accustomed to the gloom still he thought one of the men was oliva the contractor whom stuyvesant had dismissed next moment the fellow turned and threw a folded bag aside after which he walked towards the other end of the shed his movements were leisurely but he kept his back to dick and the latter thought this significant although he was not sure the man had seen him  as he did not want to be seen loitering about the sheds he walked on feeling puzzled since he did not know what stock the company had held it was difficult to tell if coal had recently been shipped but he imagined that some must have left the wharf after the collier had unloaded he was used to calculating weights and cubic quantities and the sheds were not large taking it for granted that the vessel had landed one thousand five hundred tons he thought there ought to be more about than he could see still if some had been shipped he could not understand why it had been taken at a greater cost for labor from the last shed where one would expect the company to keep their reserve supply he might perhaps find out something from the manager but this would need tact  entering the small hot office he found a suave spanish gentleman whom he had already met the latter greeted him politely and gave him a cigar  it is not often you leave the works but a change is good he said  were not quite so busy and i promised to pay allen at the sugar mill a visit dick replied besides i had an excuse for the trip were short of some engine stores that i dare say you can let us have  he gave the manager a list and the spaniard nodded as he marked the items  we can send you most of the things it pays us to stock goods that the engineers of the ships we coal often want but there are some we have not got  very well said dick ill fill up our form for what you have and you can put the things on board the tug the first time she goes to santa brigida  she will go in three or four days  dick decided that as the launch had probably been seen he had better mention his voyage  that will be soon enough if our storekeeper had told me earlier i would have called here yesterday i passed close by on my way to orava  one of the peons saw your boat it is some distance to orava  the sea was very smooth said dick i went to engage a contractor who had been at work upon the mole  so far conversation had been easy and he had satisfactorily accounted for his passing the wharf without he hoped appearing anxious to do so but he had learned nothing yet although he thought the spaniard was more interested in his doings than he looked  the collier was leaving as we went by he resumed trade must be good because she seemed to have unloaded a large quantity of coal  sixteen hundred tons said the manager in war time when freights advance it is wise to keep a good stock  as this was very nearly the quantity dick had guessed he noted the mans frankness but somehow imagined it was meant to hide something  so long as you can sell the stock he agreed war however interferes with trade and the french line have reduced their sailings while i expect the small british tramps wont be so numerous  they have nothing to fear in these waters  i suppose they havent and vessels belonging to neutral countries ought to be safe said dick still the spanish company seem to have changed their sailings because i thought i saw one of their boats yesterday but she was a long way off on the horizon  he thought the other gave him a keen glance but as the shutters were partly closed the light was not good and the man answered carelessly  they do not deal with us adexe is off their course and no boats so large can come up to the wharf  well said dick who believed he had admitted enough to disarm any suspicion the other might have entertained doesnt coal thats kept exposed to the air lose some of its heating properties  it does not suffer much damage but we will drink a glass of wine and then i will show you how we keep our coal  thanks these things interest me but i looked into the sheds as i passed dick answered as he drank his wine  they went out and when they entered the first shed the spaniard called a peon and gave him an order dick did not catch then he showed dick the cranes and the trucks that ran along the wharf on rails and how they weighed the bags of coal after a time they went into a shed that was nearly empty and dick carefully looked about several peons were at work upon the bags but oliva was not there dick wondered whether he had been warned to keep out of sight  as they went back to the office his companion looked over the edge of the wharf and spoke to a seaman on the tug below her fires were out and the hammering that came up through the open skylights indicated that work was being done in her engineroom then one of the workmen seemed to object to something another said for dick heard no it must be tightened it knocked last night  he knew enough castilian to feel sure he had not been mistaken and the meaning of what he had heard was plain a shaftjournal knocks when the bearings it revolves in have worn or shaken loose and the machinery must have been running when the engineer heard the noise dick thought it better to light a cigarette and was occupied shielding the match with his hands when the manager turned round a few minutes later he stated that as it was a long way to santa brigida he must start soon and after some spanish compliments the other let him go  he followed the hill road slowly in a thoughtful mood the manager had been frank but dick suspected him of trying to show that he had nothing to hide then he imagined that a quantity of coal had been shipped since the previous day and if the tug had been at sea at night she must have been used for towing lighters the large vessel he had seen was obviously a passenger boat but fast liners could be converted into auxiliary cruisers there were however so far as he knew no enemy cruisers in the neighborhood indeed it was supposed that they had been chased off the seas still there was something mysterious about the matter and he meant to watch the coaling company and kenwardine     chapter xviii  dick gets a warning   on the evening of one payday dick took a short cut through the halfbreed quarter of santa brigida as not infrequently happens in old spanish cities this unsavory neighborhood surrounded the cathedral and corresponded in character with the localities known in western america as across the track indeed a castilian proverb bluntly plays upon the juxtaposition of vice and bells  ancient houses rose above the dark and narrow street flakes of plaster had fallen from their blank walls the archways that pierced them were foul and strewn with refuse and a sour smell of decay and garbage tainted the stagnant air here and there a grossly fat slatternly woman leaned upon the rails of an outside balcony negroes chinamen and halfbreeds passed along the broken pavements and the dirty openfronted wineshops where swarms of flies hovered about the tables were filled with loungers of different shades of color  by and by dick noticed a man in clean white duck on the opposite side of the street he was a short distance in front but his carriage and the fit of his clothes indicated that he was a white man and probably an american and dick slackened his pace he imagined that the other would sooner not be found in that neighborhood if he happened to be an acquaintance the fellow however presently crossed the street and when he stopped and looked about dick meeting him face to face saw with some surprise that it was kemp the fireman who had shown him an opportunity of escaping from the steamer that took them south  kemp had turned out a steady sober man and dick who had got him promoted wondered what he was doing there though he reflected that his own presence in the disreputable locality was liable to be misunderstood kemp however looked at him with a twinkle  i guess youre making for the harbor mr brandon  dick said he was and kemp studied the surrounding houses  well he resumed im certainly up against it now i dont know much spanish and these fool dagos cant talk american while theyre packed so tight in their blamed tenements that its curious they dont fall out of the windows its a tough proposition to locate a man here  then youre looking for somebody  yes ive tracked payne to this calle but i guess theres some trailing down to be done yet  ah said dick for payne was the dismissed storekeeper why do you want him  i met him a while back and hed struck bad luck hurt his arm for one thing hed been working among the breeds on the mole and living in their tenements and couldnt strike another job i reckoned he might want a few dollars and i dont spend all my pay  dick nodded because he understood the unfortunate position of the white man who loses caste in a tropical country an englishman or american may engage in manual labor where skill is required and the pay is high but he must live up to the standards of his countrymen if forced to work with natives and adopt their mode of life he risks being distrusted and avoided by men of his color remembering that payne had interfered when he was stabbed dick had made some inquiries about him but getting no information decided that he had left the town  then hes lodging in this street he said  thats what they told me at the wineshop he had to quit the last place because he couldnt pay  wasnt he with oliva dick inquired  he was but oliva turned him down i allow it was all right to fire him but hes surely up against it now  dick put his hand in his pocket if you find him you might let me know in the meantime heres five dollars  hold on said kemp dont take out your wallet here ill fix the thing and ask for the money when i get back  dick left him and when he had transacted his business returned to the dam an hour or two later kemp arrived and stated that he had not succeeded in finding payne the man had left the squalid room he occupied and nobody knew where he had gone  during the next week dick had again occasion to visit the harbor and while he waited on the mole for a boat watched a gang of peons unloading some fertilizer from a barge it was hard and unpleasant work for the stuff which had a rank smell escaped from the bags and covered the perspiring men the dust stuck to their hot faces almost hiding their color but one though equally dirty looked different from the rest and dick noting that he only used his left arm drew nearer as he did so the man walked up the steep plank from the lighter with a bag upon his back and staggering across the mole dropped it with a gasp his heaving chest and set face showed what the effort had cost and the smell of the fertilizer hung about his ragged clothes dick saw that it was payne and that the fellow knew him  you have got a rough job he remarked cant you find something better  nope said the man grimly do you reckon id pack dirt with a crowd like this if i could help it  dick who glanced at the lighter where halfnaked negroes and mulattos were at work amid a cloud of nauseating dust understood the social degradation the other felt  whats the matter with your arm he asked  payne pulled up his torn sleeve and showed an inflamed and halfhealed wound  that got it nipped in a cranewheel and it doesnt get much better guess this dirt is poisonous anyway it keeps me here ive been trying to make enough to buy a ticket to jamaica but cant work steady as soon as ive put up two or three dollars i have to quit  dick could understand this the man looked gaunt and ill and must have been heavily handicapped by his injured arm he did not seem anxious to excite dicks pity though the latter did not think he cherished much resentment  i tried to find you when i got better after being stabbed he said i dont quite see why you came to my help  payne grinned sourly you certainly hadnt much of a claim but you were a white man and that dago meant to kill now if id held my job with fuller and you hadnt dropped on to olivas game id have made my little pile but i allow you had to fire us when something put you wise  i see said dick with a smile at the fellows candor well i couldnt trust you with the cement again but were short of a man to superintend a peon gang and ill talk to mr stuyvesant about it if youll tell me your address  payne gave him a fixed eager look you get me the job and take me out of this and you wont be sorry ill make it good to youand i reckon i can  dick who thought the others anxiety to escape from his degrading occupation had prompted his last statement turned away saying he would see what could be done and in the evening visited stuyvesant bethune was already with him and dick told them how he had found payne  you felt you had to promise the fellow a job because he butted in when the dagos got after you stuyvesant suggested  no said dick with some embarrassment it wasnt altogether that he certainly did help me but i cant pass my obligations on to my employer if you think he cant be trusted ill pay his passage to another port  well i dont know that if i had the option id take the fellow out of jail so long as he was shut up decently out of sight but this is worse in a way what do you think bethune  bethune smiled you ought to know im a bit of a philosopher but when you stir my racial feelings im an american first the mean whites a troublesome proposition at home but we cant afford to exhibit him to the dagos here he turned to dick thats our attitude brandon and though you were not long in our country you seem to sympathize with it i dont claim its quite logical but there it is were white and different  do you want me to hire the man stuyvesant asked with an impatient gesture  yes said dick  then put him on if he steals anything ill hold you responsible and ship him out on the next cement boat whether he wants to go or not  next morning dick sent word to payne who arrived at the dam soon afterwards and did his work satisfactorily on the evening of the first payday he went to santa brigida but dick who watched him in the morning noted somewhat to his surprise that he showed no signs of dissipation when work stopped at noon he heard a few pistol shots but was told on inquiring that it was only one or two of the men shooting at a mark a few days afterwards he found it necessary to visit santa brigida since bethune confined his talents to constructional problems and languidly protested that he had no aptitude for commerce much of the companys minor business gradually fell into dicks hands as a rule he went to the town in the evening after he had finished at the dam while a handcar was being got ready to take him down the line payne came up to the veranda where dick sat with jake  youre going down town mr brandon he said have you got a gun  i have not said dick  payne pulled out an automatic pistol then youd better take mine i bought her secondhand with my first pay but shes pretty good i reckon you can shoot  a little said dick who had practised with the british army revolver still i dont carry a pistol  you ought payne answered meaningly and walking to the other end of the veranda stuck a scrap of white paper on a post say suppose you try her i want to see you put a pill through that  dick was surprised by the fellows persistence but there is a fascination in shooting at a target and when jake urged him he took the pistol steadying it with stiffened wrist and forearm he fired but hit the post a foot below the paper  you havent allowed for the pulloff and youre slow payne remarked you want to sight high with a squeeze on the trigger and then catch her on the drop  he took the pistol and fixed his eyes on the paper before he moved then his arm went up suddenly and the glistening barrel pointed above the mark there was a flash as his wrist dropped and a black spot appeared near the middle of the paper  use her like that youd want a mighty steady hand to hold her dead on the mark while you pull off  sit down and tell us why you think mr brandon ought to have the pistol jake remarked i go to santa brigida now and then but you havent offered to lend it me  payne sat down on the steps and looked at him with a smile youre all right mr fuller theyre not after you  then you reckon it wasnt me they wanted the night my partner was stabbed i had the money  nope said payne firmly i allow theyd have corralled the dollars if they could but it was mr brandon they meant to knock out he paused and added in a significant tone theyre after him yet  hadnt you better tell us whom you mean by they dick asked  olivas gang there are toughs in the city whod kill you for fifty cents  does that account for your buying the pistol when you came here  it does payne admitted dryly i didnt mean to take any chances when it looked as if i was going back on my dago partner  he turned you down first and i dont see how you could harm him by working for us  payne did not answer and dick who thought he was pondering something resumed these halfbreeds are a revengeful lot but after all oliva wouldnt run a serious risk without a stronger motive than he seems to have  well said payne if i talked spanish i could tell you more but i was taking my siesta one day in a dark wineshop when two or three hardlooking peons came in they maynt have seen me because there were some casks in the way and anyhow theyd reckon i couldnt understand them i didnt very well but i heard your name and caught a word or two their patron had given them some orders and one called him don ramon you were to be watched because mirar came in but i didnt get the rest and they went out soon i lay as if i was asleep but id know the crowd again payne got up as he concluded anyway you take my gun and keep in the main calles where the lights are  when he had gone jake remarked i guess his advice is good and im coming along  no said dick smiling as he put the pistol in his pocket the trouble is that if i took you down there i mightnt get you back besides there are some calculations i want you to make  lighting his pipe he took his seat on the handcar and knitted his brows as two colored laborers drove him down the hill below the lights of santa brigida gleamed in a cluster against the dusky sea and he knew something of the intrigues that went on in the town commercial and political jealousies were very keen and citizens of all ranks fought and schemed against their neighbors the place was rank with plots but it was hard to see how he could be involved yet it certainly began to look as if he had been stabbed by olivas order and oliva was now employed at the adexe coaling wharf  this seemed to throw a light upon the matter something mysterious was going on at adexe and perhaps he had been incautious and had shown his suspicions the spaniards were subtle the manager might have imagined he knew more than he did but if it was worth defending by the means payne had hinted at the secret must be very important and the plotters would hesitate about betraying themselves by another attempt upon his life so long as there was any possibility of failure besides it was dangerous to attack a foreigner since if he were killed the representative of his country would demand an exhaustive inquiry  while dick pondered the matter the handcar stopped and he alighted and walked briskly to santa brigida keeping in the middle of the road when he reached the town he chose the wide welllighted streets but saw nothing suspicious after transacting his business he ventured by way of experiment across a small dark square and returned to the main street by a narrow lane but although he kept a keen watch nothing indicated that he was followed reaching the handcar without being molested he determined to be cautious in future though it was possible that payne had been deceived     chapter xix  jake explains matters   the sun had sunk behind the range when clare kenwardine stood musing on a balcony of the house voices and footsteps reached her across the roofs for santa brigida was wakening from its afternoon sleep and the traffic had begun again in the cooling streets the girl listened vacantly as she grappled with questions that had grown more troublesome of late  the life she led often jarred and yet she could find no escape she hoped she was not unnecessarily censorious and tried to argue that after all there was no great harm in gambling but rarely succeeded in convincing herself then she had deliberately thrown in her lot with her fathers when she first insisted on joining him in england he had for her sake as she now realized discouraged the plan but had since come to depend upon her in many ways and she could not leave him besides it was too late she had made her choice and must stick to it  yet she rebelled against the feeling that she had brought a taint or stigma upon herself she had no women friends except the wives of one or two spanish officials whose reputation for honesty was not of the best the english and american women left her alone most of the men she met she frankly disliked and imagined that the formal respect they showed her was due to her fathers hints kenwardines moral code was not severe but he saw that his guests preserved their manners clare had heard the spaniards call him muy caballero and they knew the outward points of a gentleman while she pondered he came out on the balcony  brooding he said with a smile well it has been very dull lately and we need cheering up suppose you send mr fuller a note and ask him to dinner tomorrow hes sometimes amusing and i think you like him  clare braced herself for a struggle for it was seldom she refused her fathers request  yes she said i like him but it would be better if he didnt come  kenwardine gave her a keen glance but although he felt some surprise did not try to hide his understanding of what she meant  it looks as if you knew something about what happened on his last visit  i do clare answered it was rather a shock  one mustnt exaggerate the importance of these things kenwardine remarked in an indulgent tone its difficult to avoid getting a jar now and then though ive tried to shield you as much as possible fullers young and highspirited and you really mustnt judge his youthful extravagance too severely  but dont you see you are admitting that he shouldnt come clare asked with some color in her face he is young and inexperienced and your friends are men of the world what is safe for them may be dangerous for him  kenwardine pondered fuller was an attractive lad and he would not have been displeased to think that clares wish to protect him might spring from sentimental tenderness but if this were so she would hardly have been so frank and have admitted that he was weak moreover if she found his society congenial she would not insist on keeping him away  you are afraid some of the others might take advantage of his rashness he suggested cant you trust me to see this doesnt happen  it did happen not long ago and you cant go very far one cant be rude to ones guests  well said kenwardine smiling its kind of you to make an excuse for me on the whole of course i like you to be fastidious in your choice of friends but one should temper severity with sense i dont want you to get as exacting as brandon for example  im afraid he was right when he tried to keep fuller away  right in thinking my house was unsafe for the lad and in warning him that you and i were unfit for him to associate with  kenwardine studied the girl she looked distressed and he thought this significant but after a moment or two she answered steadily  after all brandon had some grounds for thinking so i would much sooner you didnt urge me to ask jake fuller  very well said kenwardine i dont want you to do anything thats repugnant but of course if he comes to see me i cant send him off it isnt a matter of much importance anyhow  he left her but she was not deceived by his careless tone she thought he meant to bring fuller back and did not see how she could prevent this although she had refused to help then she thought about the plans that brandon had lost at their house in england they had certainly been stolen for she could not doubt what he had told her but it was painful to admit that her father had taken them she felt dejected and lonely and while she struggled against the depression lucille came to say that jake was waiting below  tell him i am not at home clare replied  lucille went away and clare left the balcony but a few minutes later when she thought jake had gone she went down the stairs and met him coming up he stopped with a twinkle of amusement  i sent word that i was not at home she said haughtily  you did jake agreed in an apologetic tone its your privilege but although i felt rather hurt i dont see why that should prevent my asking if your father was in  clares indignation vanished she liked jake and was moved by his reproachful look she determined to try an appeal  mr fuller she said i would sooner you didnt come to see us it would be better in several ways  he gave her a curious intent look in which she read sympathy i cant pretend i dont understand and youre very brave still im not sure youre quite just to me among others im a bit of a fool but im not so rash as some people think anyhow if i were id still be safe enough in your house sorry but i cant promise to stop away  it would really be much better clare insisted  would it make things any easier for you  no said clare in a sense it could make no difference to me  very well i intend to call on your father now and then of course you neednt see me unless you like though since i am coming your keeping out of the way wouldnt do much good  clare made a gesture of helpless protest why wont you be warned cant you understand do you think it is easy for me to try  i dont said jake i know its very hard i think youre mistaken about the necessity for interfering thats all then he paused and resumed in a different tone you see i imagine that you must feel lonely at times and that you might need a friend i dare say youd find me better than none and id like to know that ill have an opportunity of being around if im wanted  he gave her a quiet respectful glance and clare knew she had never liked him so much he looked trustworthy and it was a relief to note that there was no hint of anything but sympathy in his eyes and voice he asked nothing but permission to protect her if there was need moreover since they had been forced to tread on dangerous ground he had handled the situation with courage she might require a friend and his honest sympathy was refreshing by contrast with the attitude of her fathers companions some were hard and cynical and some were dissipated but all were stamped by a repugnant greediness they sought something money the gratification of base desires success in dark intrigue jake with his chivalrous generosity stood far apart from them but he must be saved from becoming like them  if i knew how i could keep you away i would do so but i can at least see you as seldom as possible she said and left him  jake knitted his brows as he went on to kenwardines room he understood clares motive and admitted that she meant well but he was not going to stop away because she thought this better for him there was however another matter that demanded his attention and he felt awkward when kenwardine opened the door  its some time since you have been to see us the latter remarked  it is said jake perhaps you can understand that i felt rather shy about coming after the way my partner arranged the matter of the check  he arranged it to your advantage and you ought to be satisfied mr brandon is obviously a business man  jack resented the polished sneer hes a very good sort and im grateful to him but it doesnt follow that i adopt his point of view  you mean his views about the payment of ones debts  yes said jake i dont consider the debt wiped out in fact thats why i came i want to make good but it will take time if you will ask your friends to wait  kenwardine looked at him with an ironical smile isnt this a change of attitude i understood you claimed that you were under a disadvantage through being drunk and suspected that the game was not quite straight  i was drunk and still suspect black of crooked play  its rather a grave statement  i quite see that said jake however i deserved to lose for being drunk when i was betting high and dont hold you accountable for black youd take steep chances if you guaranteed all guests  kenwardine laughed youre remarkably frank but theres some truth in what you say although the convention is that i do guarantee them and their honors mine  well keep to business jake replied will you tell your friends ill pay them out in full as soon as i can  certainly since they thought the matter closed it will be a pleasant surprise but well let that go mr brandon obviously didnt consult your wishes but have you any idea what his object was in taking his very unusual line  yes said jake if you press me i have  he thought he would make it awkward for you to come here in fact  something like that  then you mean to run the risk  im coming if youll allow it jake answered with a twinkle the risk isnt very great because if i lose any more money in the next few months the winners will not get paid the old man certainly wont stand for it if i get into debt  kenwardine pushed a box of cigarettes across i congratulate you on your way of making things clear and now we understand each other you can come when you like have a smoke  jake took a cigarette but left soon afterwards to do an errand of bethunes that had given him an excuse for visiting the town then he went back to the dam and after dinner sat outside dicks shack pondering what clare had said she had of course had some ground for warning him but he did not believe yet that kenwardine meant to exploit his recklessness it would not be worth while for one thing since he had never had much money to lose and now had none besides kenwardine was not the man to take a mean advantage of his guest though jake could not say as much for some of his friends anyhow he meant to go to the house because he felt that clare might need his help he did not see how that might be but he had a halfformed suspicion that she might have to suffer on her fathers account and if anything of the kind happened he meant to be about  yet he was not in love with her she attracted him strongly and he admitted that it would be remarkably easy to become infatuated but did not mean to let this happen though often rash he had more sense and selfcontrol than his friends believed and realized that clare was not for him he could not tell how he had arrived at this conclusion but there it was and he knew he was not mistaken sometimes he wondered with a twinge of jealousy what she thought of brandon  by and by he roused himself from his reflections and looked about there was no moon and a thin mist that had stolen out of the jungle drifted past the shack a coffeepot and two cups stood upon a table near his chair and one cup was half empty as dick had left it when he was unexpectedly summoned to the dam where work was going on the veranda lamp had been put out because jake did not want to read and a bright light would have attracted moths and beetles but dick had left a lamp burning in his room and a faint illumination came through the curtain on the open window everything was very quiet except when the ringing of hammers and the rattle of a crane rose from the dam  looking farther round jake thought he distinguished the blurred outline of a human figure in the mist but was not surprised some ironwork that made a comfortable seat lay near the shack and the figure had been there before for all that he imagined the man was wasting his time and keeping an unnecessary watch then his thoughts again centered on clare and kenwardine and some time had passed when he looked up something had disturbed him but he could not tell what it was and on glancing at the spot where he had seen the figure he found it had gone  next moment a board in the house creaked softly as if it had been trodden on but the boards often did so after a change of temperature and jake sat still their colored servant had asked leave to go down to the camp and was perhaps now coming back one had to be careful not to give ones imagination too much rein in these hot countries payne seemed to have done so and had got an attack of nerves which was curious because indulgence in native ca√±a generally led to that kind of thing and payne was sober moreover he was of the type that is commonly called hard  jake took out a cigarette and was lighting it when he heard a swift stealthy step close behind him he dropped the match as he swung round pushing back his canvas chair and found his eyes dazzled by the sudden darkness still he thought he saw a shadow flit across the veranda and vanish into the mist next moment there were heavier footsteps and a crash as a man fell over the projecting legs of the chair the fellow rolled down the shallow stairs dropping a pistol and then hurriedly got up  stop right there pepe he shouted what were you doing in that room  nobody answered and jake turned to the man who was rubbing his leg  whats the trouble payne he asked  hes lit out but i reckon id have got him if youd been more careful how you pushed your chair around  whom did you expect to get  well said payne it wasnt pepe  then why did you call him  i wanted the fellow i was after to think id made a mistake  jake could understand this though the rest was dark pepe was an indian boy who brought water and domestic stores to the shack but would have no excuse for entering it at night  i allow he meant to dope the coffee payne resumed  this was alarming and jake abruptly glanced at the table the intruder must have been close to it and behind him when he heard the step and might have accomplished his purpose and stolen away had he not struck the match  he hadnt time he answered we had better see what he was doing in the house  payne put away his pistol and they entered dicks room nothing seemed to have been touched until jake placed the lamp on a writingtable where dick sometimes worked at night the drawers beneath it were locked but payne indicated a greasy fingerprint on the writingpad  i guess thats a dagos mark mr brandon would wash his hands before he began to write  jake agreed and picking up the pad thought the top sheet had been hurriedly removed because a torn fragment projected from the leather clip the sheet left was covered with faint impressions but it rather looked as if these had been made by the ink running through than by direct contact jake wrote a few words on a scrap of paper and pressing it on the pad noted the difference  this is strange he said i dont get the drift of it  payne looked at him with a dry smile if youll come out and let me talk ill try to put you wise  jake nodded and they went back to the veranda     chapter xx  don sebastian   when they returned to the veranda payne sat down on the steps jake picked up his chair and looked at him thoughtfully  now he said i want to know why you have been prowling about the shack at night you had better begin at the beginning  very well i guess you know i was put off this camp soon before you came  i heard something about it jake admitted  payne grinned as if he appreciated his tact and then resumed in the settlement where i was raised the old fellow who kept the store had a cheatledger when somebody traded stale eggs and gardentruck for good groceries and the storekeeper saw he couldnt make trouble about it without losing a customer he said nothing but scored it down against the man sometimes he had to wait a long while but sooner or later he squared the account now thats my plan with don ramon oliva  i see said jake what have you against him  to begin with he got me fired it was a thing i took my chances of and wouldnt have blamed him for but i reckon now your fathers cement wasnt all he was after he wanted a pull on me  why  i havent got that quite clear but im an american and could do things he couldnt without being suspected  go on said jake in a thoughtful tone  well for a clever man he made a very poor defense when your partner spotted his game seemed to say if they reckoned hed been stealing hed let it go at that then when hed got me and found i wasnt the man he wanted he turned me down left me to live with breeds and niggers  what do you mean by your not being the man he wanted  payne smiled in a deprecatory way i allow that i was willing to make a few dollars on the cement but working against white men in a dago plot is a different thing  then there is a plot  well said payne quietly i dont know much about it but somethings going on  jake lighted a cigarette while he pondered he was not surprised that payne should talk to him with confidential familiarity because the situation warranted it and the american workman is not as a rule deferential to his employer the fellow might be mistaken but he believed that oliva had schemed to get him into his power and work upon his wish for revenge jake could understand olivas error paynes moral code was rudimentary but he had some racial pride and would not act like a treacherous renegade  i begin to see how your account against oliva stands he remarked but is that the only entry in your book  i guess not payne replied mr brandons name is there but the entry is against myself it was a straight fight when he had me fired and he took me back when he found i was down and out  jake nodded you have already warned brandon that he might be in some danger in the town  thats so since then i reckoned that they were getting after him here but we were more likely to hold them up if they didnt know we knew thats why i called out to show i thought it was pepe who was in the shack  very well said jake theres nothing more to be done in the meantime but youd better tell me if you find out anything else  payne went away and when dick came in jake took him into his room and indicated the blotter  have you torn off the top sheet in the last few days  i dont remember doing so but now i come to look it has been torn off  what have you been writing lately  orders for small supplies specifications of material and such things  concrete in short jake remarked well its not an interesting subject to outsiders and sometimes gets very stale to those who have to handle it are you quite sure you havent been writing about anything else  i am sure why do you ask  because as you see somebody thought it worth while to steal the top sheet of your blotter jake replied now perhaps id better tell you something ive just learned  he related what payne had told him and concluded im puzzled about olivas motive after all it could hardly be revenge  no said dick with a thoughtful frown i dont imagine it is  then what does he expect to gain  dick was silent for a few moments with knitted brows and then asked you have a monroe doctrine havent you  we certainly have jake agreed smiling we reaffirmed it not long ago  roughly speaking the doctrine states that no european power can be allowed to set up a naval base or make warlike preparations in any part of america in fact you warn all foreigners to keep their hands off  thats its general purport but while i support it patriotically i cant tell you exactly what it says anyhow i dont see what this has to do with the matter  nor do i but it seems to promise a clue dick answered dryly he frowned at the blotter and then added well leave it at that ive some vague suspicions but nothing to act upon if the thing gets any plainer ill let you know  but what about payne is he to hang around here nights with his gun  no said dick it isnt necessary but thered be no harm in our taking a few precautions  he stretched his arms wearily when jake left him for he had had a tiring day and had now been given ground for anxious thought he had not troubled much about oliva while he imagined that the fellow was actuated by a personal grudge but his antagonism began to look more dangerous suppose the adexe coaling station was intended to be something of the nature of a naval base munitions and other contraband of war might be quietly sent off with fuel to fighting ships richter the german had certainly been associated with kenwardine who had made an opportunity for telling jake that they had disagreed then suppose the owners of the station had learned that they were being spied upon dick admitted that he might not have been as tactful as he thought and he was employed by an influential american the americans might be disposed to insist upon a strict observance of the monroe doctrine granting all this if he was to be dealt with it would be safer to make use of a halfbreed who was known to have some ground for hating him  dick however reflected that he was taking much for granted and his suppositions might well be wrong it was unwise to attach too much importance to a plausible theory then he could not expose kenwardine without involving clare and saw no means of separating them besides kenwardines position was strong the officials were given to graft and he had no doubt made a skilful use of bribes warnings about him would not be listened to particularly as he was carrying on a thriving business and paying large sums in wages in a country that depended on foreign capital  then dick got up with a frown his head ached and he was tired after working since sunrise in enervating heat the puzzle could not be solved now and he must wait until he found out something more  for the next two or three evenings he was kept busy at the dam where work was carried on after dark and jake taking advantage of this went to santa brigida one night when he knew the locomotive would be coming back up the line nothing of importance happened at kenwardines where he did not see clare and on his return he took a short cut through a badlylighted part of the town there was perhaps some risk in this but jake seldom avoided an adventure nothing unusual happened as he made his way through the narrow streets until he reached a corner where a noisy group hung about the end house as the men did not look sober he took the other side of the street where the light of a lamp fell upon him  his closefitting white clothes distinguished him from the picturesque untidiness of the rest and when somebody shouted un gringo one or two moved across as if to stop him jake walked on quickly looking straight in front without seeming to notice the others in the hope of getting past before they got in his way but a man dressed like a respectable citizen came round the corner and the peons ran off since the appearance of a single stranger did not seem to account for this jake wondered what had alarmed them until he saw a rural guard in white uniform behind the other when the man came up the rurale stopped and raised his hand as if he meant to salute but let it fall again and jake imagined that the first had given him a warning glance he knew the thin darkfaced spaniard whom he had met at kenwardines  the man touched jakes shoulder and drew him away and the lad thought it strange that the rurale went on without asking a question  i dont know that the peons meant to make trouble but im glad you came along don sebastian he said  it is an honor to have been of some service but it looks as if you were as rash in other matters as you are at cards the spaniard answered these dark calles are unsafe for foreigners  so it seems but im afraid it will be a long time before im worth robbing jake replied and then remembered with embarrassment that the other was one of the party whose winnings he had not yet paid  don sebastian smiled but said suavely for all that you should not take an unnecessary risk you have been attacked once already i think  yes but it was my partner who got hurt  that is one of the ironies of luck se√±or brandon is sober and cautious but he gets injured when he comes to protect you who are rash  hes what you say but i didnt know you had met him jake replied  i have heard of him you foreigners are talked about in the caf√©s they talk much in santa brigida many have nothing else to do but have you and se√±or brandon only been molested once  jake hesitated for a moment he liked the man and on the whole thought he could be trusted while he imagined that he was not prompted by idle curiosity but knew something besides jake was often impulsive and ready as he said to back his judgment  we were only once actually attacked but something rather curious happened not long ago  ah said don sebastian this is interesting and as i know something of the intrigues that go on in the city it might be to your advantage to tell me about it there is a quiet wineshop not far off  would it be safe to go in jake asked  i think so his companion answered smiling  jake presently followed him into a small dimly lighted room and noted that the landlord came to wait on them with obsequious attention two peons were drinking in a corner but they went out when the landlord made a sign jake thought this curious but don sebastian filled his glass and gave him a cigarette  now he said we have the place to ourselves and you can tell your story  jake related how a stranger had stolen into their shack a few days ago and don sebastian listened attentively  you do not think it was one of the peons employed at the dam he suggested  no said jake anyhow payne seemed satisfied it wasnt  he would probably know them better than you do you keep money in the house  very little we lock up the money for wages in the payoffice safe anyhow im not sure the fellow came to steal  if he did so one would not imagine that he would be satisfied with blottingpaper don sebastian agreed you said there was some coffee on the table  there was payne reckoned the fellow meant to dope it what do you think  it is possible if he had ground for being revengeful some of the indians from the mountains are expert poisoners but why should anybody wish to injure your comrade  i didnt suggest that he wished to injure brandon he might have meant to dope me  don sebastian smiled that is so but on the whole i do not think it probable do you know of anybody whom your friend has harmed  jake decided to tell him about oliva he was now convinced that don sebastian knew more than he admitted and that his interest was not unfriendly besides there was somehow a hint of authority in the fellows thin dark face he showed polite attention as jake narrated the events that had led to olivas dismissal but the lad imagined that he was telling him nothing he had not already heard  the motive may have been revenge but as se√±or brandon was stabbed that ought to satisfy his enemy besides these people are unstable they do not even indulge in hatred long do you know if your comrade has taken any part in political intrigue  its most unlikely he would make a very poor conspirator jake replied  then have you heard of any se√±orita or perhaps a halfbreed girl who has taken his fancy  no said jake dick is not that kind  he thought don sebastian had been clearing the ground eliminating possibilities to which he did not attach much weight and waited with interest for his remarks  well said the spaniard i think you and the man payne should watch over your friend but it might be better if you did not tell him you are doing so or ask him any questions and i would sooner you did not mention this interview if however anything suspicious happens again it might be an advantage if you let me know you can send word to me at the hotel  not at kenwardines  don sebastian gave him a quiet glance but jake thought it was keenly observant and remembered how one night when a messenger entered kenwardines patio richter the german had stood where he obstructed the spaniards view  no he said i should prefer the hotel will you promise  i will jake answered impulsively however you seem to suggest that i should leave my partner to grapple with this thing himself and i dont like that if hes up against any danger i want to butt in dicks no fool but there are respects in which hes not very keen his minds fixed on concrete and when he gets off it his imaginations sometimes rather weak  he stopped feeling that he must not seem to censure his friend and don sebastian nodded with a twinkle of amusement  i think i understand there are however men of simple character and no cunning who are capable of going far and sometimes surprise the friends who do not know them very well i cannot tell if se√±or brandon is one of these but it is not impossible after all it is often the clever man who makes the worst mistakes and on the whole i imagine it would be wiser to leave your comrade alone  he got up and laid his hand on jakes arm with a friendly gesture now i will put you on your way and if you feel puzzled or alarmed in future you can come to me     chapter xxi  dick makes a bold venture   some delicate and important work was being done and stuyvesant had had his lunch sent up to the dam bethune and dick joined him afterwards and sat in the shade of a big traveling crane stuyvesant and dick were hot and dirty for it was not their custom to be content with giving orders when urgent work was going on bethune looked languid and immaculately neat his speciality was mathematics and he said he did not see why the man with mental talents should dissipate his energy by using his hands  its curious about that french liner stuyvesant presently remarked i understand her passengers have been waiting since yesterday and she hasnt arrived  the last boat cut out santa brigida without notice bethune replied my opinion of the french is that theyre a pretty casual lot  on the surface they smile and shrug where we set our teeth but when you get down to bedrock you dont find much difference i thought as you do until i went over there and saw a people that run us close for steady intensive industry their small cultivators are simply great id like to put them on our poorer land in the middle west where were content with sixteen bushels of wheat thats most fit for chicken feed to the acre then what they dont know about civil engineering isnt worth learning  bethune made a gesture of agreement theyre certainly fine engineers and theyre putting up a pretty good fight just now but these latins puzzle me take the iberian branch of the race for example we have spanish peons here wholl stand for as much work and hardship as any anglosaxon ive met then an educated spaniards hard to beat for intellectual subtlety chess is a game thats suited to my turn of mind but ive been badly whipped in santa brigida theyve brains and application and yet they dont progress whats the matter with them anyway  i expect they cant formulate a continuous policy and stick to it and they keep brains and labor too far apart the two should coordinate but i wonder whats holding up the mail boat  do they know when she left the last port dick who had listened impatiently asked with concealed interest  they do its a short run and she ought to have arrived yesterday morning  the germans cant have got her they have no commercedestroyers in these waters bethune remarked with a glance at dick your navy corralled the lot i think  dick wondered why bethune looked at him but he answered carelessly so one understands but its strange the french company cut out the last call there was a big quantity of freight on the mole  it looks as if the agent had suspected something stuyvesant replied however thats not our affair and you want to get busy and have your specifications and costsheets straight when fuller comes  then fuller is coming back dick exclaimed  hell be here tomorrow night i imagined bethune had told you about the cablegram he sent  he didnt i expect he thought his getting a scratch lunch more important dick replied looking at his watch well i must see everythings ready before the boys make a start  he went away with swift decided steps through the scorching heat and stuyvesant smiled  there you have a specimen of the useful anglosaxon type i dont claim that hes a smart man all round but he can concentrate on his work and put over what he takes in hand you wouldnt go to him for a brilliant plan but give him an awkward job and hell make good i expect hell get a lift up when fuller has taken a look round  he deserves it bethune agreed  though the heat was intense and the glare from the white dam dazzling dick found work something of a relief it was his habit to fix his mind upon the task in which he was engaged but of late his thoughts had been occupied by clare and conjectures about the adexe coaling station and the strange blackfunnel boat the delay in the french liners arrival had made the matter look more urgent but he had now an excuse for putting off its consideration his duty to his employer came first there were detailed plans that must be worked out before fuller came and things he would want to know and dick sat up late at night in order to have the answers ready  fuller arrived and after spending a few days at the works came to dicks shack one evening for an hour he examined drawings and calculations asking jake a sharp question now and then and afterwards sent him away  you can put up the papers now he said well go out on the veranda its cooler there  he dropped into a canvas chair for the air was stagnant and enervating and looked down at the clustering lights beside the sea for a time then he said abruptly jake seems to know his business you have taught him well  he learned most himself dick answered modestly  well said fuller with some dryness thats the best plan but you put him on the right track and kept him there i guess i know my son has he made trouble for you in other ways  none worth mentioning  fuller gave him a keen glance and then indicated the lights of the town  thats the dangerspot does he go down there often  no i make it as difficult as possible but cant stop him altogether  fuller nodded i guess you used some tact because he likes you and youd certainly have had trouble if youd snubbed him up too hard anyway im glad to acknowledge that you have put me in your debt you can see how i was fixed bethunes not the man to guide a headstrong lad and stuyvesants his boss if hed used any official pressure jake would have kicked thats why i wanted a steady partner for him who had no actual authority  in a sense you ran some risk in choosing me  i dont know that i chose you to begin with fuller answered with a twinkle i imagine my daughter made me think as i did but im willing to state that her judgment was good well let that go you have seen jake at his work do you think hell make an engineer  yes said dick and then recognizing friendships claim added bluntly but hell make a better artist he has the gift  well said fuller in a thoughtful tone well talk of it again in the meantime hes learning how big jobs are done and dollars are earned and thats a liberal education however ive a proposition here id like your opinion of  dicks heart beat as he read the document his employer handed him it was a formal agreement by which he engaged his services to fuller until the irrigation work was completed in return for a salary that he thought remarkably good  its much more than i had any reason to expect he said with some awkwardness in fact although i dont know that i have been of much help to jake id sooner you didnt take this way of repaying me one would prefer not to mix friendship with business  yours is not a very common view fuller replied smiling however im merely offering to buy your professional skill and want to know if youre satisfied with my terms  theyre generous said dick with emotion for he saw what the change in his position might enable him to do theres only one thing the agreement is to stand until the completion of the dam what will happen afterwards  then if i have no more use for you here i think i can promise to find you as good or better job is that enough  dick gave him a grateful look its difficult to tell you how i feel about it but ill do my best to make good and show that you have not been mistaken  thats all right said fuller getting up sign the document when you can get a witness and let me have it  he went away and dick sat down and studied the agreement with a beating heart he found his work engrossing he liked the men he was associated with and saw his way to making his mark in his profession but there was another cause for the triumphant thrill he felt clare must be separated from kenwardine before she was entangled in his dangerous plots and he had brooded over his inability to come to her rescue now however one obstacle was removed he could offer her some degree of comfort if she could be persuaded to marry him it was obvious that she must be taken out of her fathers hands as soon as possible and he determined to try to gain her consent next morning though he was very doubtful of his success  when he reached the house clare was sitting at a table in the patio with some work in her hand close by the purple creeper spread across the wall and the girls blue eyes and thin lilac dress harmonized with its deeper color her face and halfcovered arms showed pure white against the background but the delicate pink that had once relieved the former was now less distinct the hot humid climate had begun to set its mark on her and dick thought she looked anxious and perplexed  she glanced up when she heard his step and moving quietly forward he stopped on the opposite side of the table with his hand on a chair he knew there was much against him and feared a rebuff but delay might be dangerous and he could not wait standing quietly resolute he fixed his eyes on the girls face  is your father at home miss kenwardine he asked  no said clare he went out some time ago and i cannot tell when he will come back do you want to see him  i dont know yet it depends  he thought she was surprised and curious but she said nothing and nerving himself for the plunge he resumed i came to see you in the first place im afraid youll be astonished clare but i want to know if you will marry me  she moved abruptly turned her head for a moment and then looked up at him while the color gathered in her face her expression puzzled dick but he imagined that she was angry  i am astonished isnt it a rather extraordinary request after what you said on board the launch  no said dick its very natural from my point of view you see i fell in love with you the first time we met but i got into disgrace soon afterwards and have had a bad time since this made it impossible for me to tell you what i felt but things are beginning to improve  he stopped seeing no encouragement in her expression for clare was fighting a hard battle his blunt simplicity made a strong appeal she had liked and trusted him when he had with callow but honest chivalry offered her his protection one night in england and he had developed fast since then hardship had strengthened and in a sense refined him he looked resolute and soldierlike as he waited still for his sake as well as hers she must refuse  then you must be easily moved she said you knew nothing about me  id seen you that was quite enough dick declared and stopped her look was gentler and he might do better if he could lessen the distance between them and take her hand he feared he had been painfully matteroffact perhaps he was right but the table stood in the way and if he moved round it she would take alarm it was exasperating to be baulked by a piece of furniture  besides he resumed when everybody doubted me you showed your confidence you wrote and said  but you told me you tore up the letter clare interrupted  dick got confused i did i was a fool but the way things had been going was too much for me you ought to understand and try to make allowances  i cannot understand why you want to marry a girl you think a thief  pulling himself together dick gave her a steady look i cant let that pass though if i begin to argue im lost in a way im at your mercy because my defense can only make matters worse but i tried to explain on board the launch  the explanation wasnt very convincing clare remarked turning her head do you still believe i took your papers  the plans were in my pocket when i reached your house said dick who saw he must be frank i dont know that you took them and if you did i wouldnt hold you responsible but they were taken  you mean that you blame my father for their loss  dick hesitated he felt that she was giving him a last opportunity but he could not seize it  if i pretended i didnt blame him you would find me out and it would stand between us i wish i could say id dropped the papers somewhere or find some other way but the truth is best  clare turned to him with a hot flush and an angry sparkle in her eyes  then its unthinkable that you should marry the daughter of the man whom you believe ruined you dont you see that you cant separate me from my father we must stand together  no said dick doggedly knowing that he was beaten i dont see that i want you i want to take you away from surroundings and associations that must jar perhaps it was foolish to think you would come but you helped to save my life when i was ill and i believe i was then something more to you than a patient why have you changed  she looked at him with a forced and rather bitter smile need you ask cant you or wont you understand could i marry my victim which is what you are if your suspicions are justified if they are not you have offered me an insult i cannot forgive it is unbearable to be thought the daughter of a thief  dick nerved himself for a last effort what does your fathers character matter i want you you will be safe from everything that could hurt you if you come to me he hesitated and then went on in a hoarse determined voice you must come i cant let you live among those plotters and gamblers its impossible clare when i was ill and you thought me asleep i watched you sitting in the moonlight your face was wonderfully gentle and i thought  she rose and stopped him with a gesture there is no more to be said mr brandon i cannot marry you and if you are generous you will go  dick who had been gripping the chair hard let his hand fall slackly and turned away clare watched him cross the patio and stood tensely still fighting against an impulse to call him back as he neared the door then as he vanished into the shadow of the arch she sat down with sudden limpness and buried her hot face in her hands     chapter xxii  the official mind   on the evening after clares refusal dick entered the principal caf√© at santa brigida the large openfronted room was crowded for owing to the duty newspapers were not generally bought by the citizens who preferred to read them at the caf√©s and the diario had just come in the eagerness to secure a copy indicated that something important had happened and after listening to the readers remarks dick gathered that the french liner had sunk and a number of her passengers were drowned this however did not seem to account for the angry excitement some of the men showed and dick waited until a polite halfbreed handed him the newspaper  a ships lifeboat filled with exhausted passengers had reached a bay some distance along the coast and it appeared from their stories that the liner was steaming across a smooth sea in the dark when a large vessel which carried no lights emerged from a belt of haze and came towards her the french captain steered for the land hoping to reach territorial waters where he would be safe but the stranger was faster and opened fire with a heavy gun the liner held on although she was twice hit but after a time there was an explosion below and her colored firemen ran up on deck then the ship stopped boats were hoisted out and it was believed that several got safely away though only one had so far reached the coast this boat was forced to pass the attacking vessel rather close and an officer declared that she looked like one of the spanish liners and her funnel was black  dick gave the newspaper to the next man and sat still with knitted brows for his suspicions were suddenly confirmed the raider had a black funnel and was no doubt the ship he had seen steering for adexe an enemy commercedestroyer was lurking about the coast and she could not be allowed to continue her deadly work which her resemblance to the spanish vessels would make easier for all that dick saw that anything he might do would cost him much since clare had said that she and kenwardine must stand together this was true in a sense because if kenwardine got into trouble she would share his disgrace and perhaps his punishment moreover she might think he had been unjustly treated and blame dick for helping to persecute him things were getting badly entangled and dick leaning back in his chair vacantly looked about  the men had gathered in groups round the tables their dark faces showing keen excitement as they argued with dramatic gestures about international law for the most part they looked indignant but dick understood that they did not expect much from their government one said the english would send a cruiser and something might be done by the americans another explained the monroe doctrine in a highpitched voice dick however tried not to listen because difficulties he had for some time seen approaching must now be faced  he had been forced to leave england in disgrace and his offense would be remembered if he returned indeed he had come to regard america as his home but patriotic feelings he had thought dead had awakened and would not be denied he might still be able to serve his country and meant to do so though it was plain that this would demand a sacrifice love and duty clashed but he must do his best and leave the rest to luck getting up with sudden resolution he left the caf√© and went to the british consulate  when he stopped outside the building to which the royal arms were fixed he remarked that two peons were lounging near but without troubling about them knocked at the door there was only a viceconsul at santa brigida and the post as sometimes happens was held by a merchant who had so a clerk stated already gone home dick however knew where he lived and determined to seek him at his house he looked round once or twice on his way there without seeing anybody who seemed to be following him but when he reached the iron gate he thought a dark figure stopped in the gloom across the street still it might only be a citizen going into his house and dick rang the bell  he was shown on to a balcony where the viceconsul sat with his spanish wife and daughter at a table laid with wine and fruit he did not look pleased at being disturbed but told dick to sit down when the ladies withdrew  now he said you can state your business but i have an appointment in a quarter of an hour  dick related his suspicions about the coaling company and described what he had seen at adexe and the visit of the blackfunnel boat but before he had gone far realized that he was wasting his time the viceconsuls attitude was politely indulgent  this is a rather extraordinary tale he remarked when dick stopped  i have told you what i saw and what i think it implies dick answered with some heat  just so i do not doubt your honesty but it is difficult to follow your arguments  it oughtnt to be difficult you have heard that the french liner was sunk by a blackfunnel boat  black funnels are common why do you imagine the vessel you saw was an auxiliary cruiser  because her crew looked like navy men they were unusually numerous and were busy at drill  boat or fire drill probably they often exercise them at it on board passenger ships besides i think you stated that it was dark  dick pondered for a few moments he had heard that government officials were hard to move and knew that in hot countries englishmen who marry native wives sometimes grow apathetic and succumb to the climatic lethargy but this was not all he had to contend against the official dislike of anything informal and unusual had he been in the navy his warning would have received attention but as he was a humble civilian he had so to speak no business to know anything about such matters  well he said you can make inquiries and see if my conclusions are right  the viceconsul smiled that is not so you can pry into the coaling companys affairs and if you are caught it would be looked upon as an individual impertinence if i did anything of the kind it would reflect upon the foreign office and compromise our relations with a friendly state the adexe wharf is registered according to the laws of this country as being owned by a native company  then go to the authorities and tell them what you know  the difficulty is that i know nothing except that you have told me a somewhat improbable tale  but you surely dont mean to let the raider do what she likes her next victim may be a british vessel  i imagine the british admiralty will attend to that and i have already sent a cablegram announcing the loss of the french boat  dick saw that he was doubted and feared that argument would be useless but he would not give in  a raider must have coal and its not easy to get upon this coast he resumed you could render her harmless by cutting off supplies  do you know much about international law and how far it prohibits a neutral country from selling coal to a belligerent  i dont know anything about it but if our foreign office is any good they ought to be able to stop the thing dick answered doggedly  then let me try to show you how matters stand we will suppose that your suspicions were correct and i thought fit to make representations to the government of this country what do you think would happen  theyd be forced to investigate your statements  exactly the head of a department would be asked to report you probably know that every official whose business brings him into touch with it is in the coaling companys pay i imagine there is not a foreign trader here who does not get small favors in return for bribes bearing this in mind it is easy to understand what the report would be i should have shown that we suspected the good faith of a friendly country and there would be nothing gained  still you cant let the matter drop dick insisted  although you have given me no proof of your statements which seem to be founded on conjectures i have not said that i intend to let it drop in the meantime i am entitled to ask for some information about yourself you look like an englishman and have not been here long did you leave home after the war broke out  yes said dick who saw where he was leading very shortly afterwards  why men like you are needed for the army  dick colored but looked his questioner steadily in the face  i was in the army they turned me out  the viceconsul made a gesture i have nothing to do with the reason for this but you can see my difficulty you urge me to meddle with things that require very delicate handling and with which my interference would have to be justified no doubt you can imagine the feelings of my superiors when i admitted that i acted upon hints given me by a stranger in the employ of americans who owned to having been dismissed from the british army  dick got up with his face firmly set  very well theres no more to be said i wont trouble you again  leaving the house he walked moodily back to the end of the line the viceconsul was a merchant and thought first of his business which might suffer if he gained the illwill of corrupt officials he would no doubt move if he were forced but he would demand incontestable proof which dick feared he could not find well he had done his best and been rebuffed and now the temptation to let the matter drop was strong to go on would bring him into conflict with kenwardine and perhaps end in his losing clare but he must go on for all that he would leave the viceconsul alone and trust to getting some help from his employers countrymen if it could be shown that the enemy was establishing a secret base for naval operations at adexe he thought the americans would protest the viceconsul however had been of some service by teaching him the weakness of his position he must strengthen it by carefully watching what went on and not interfere until he could do so with effect finding the locomotive waiting he returned to his shack and with an effort fixed his mind upon the plans of some work that he must superintend in the morning  for the next few days he was busily occupied a drum of the traveling crane broke and as it could not be replaced for a time dick put up an iron derrick of bethunes design to lower the concrete blocks into place they were forced to use such material as they could find and the gang of peons who handled the chaintackle made a poor substitute for a steam engine in consequence the work progressed slowly and stuyvesant ordered it to be carried on into the night jake and bethune grumbled but dick found the longer hours and extra strain something of a relief he had now no leisure to indulge in painful thoughts besides while he was busy at the dam he could not watch kenwardine and his duty to his employer justified his putting off an unpleasant task  one hot night he stood soaked with perspiration and dressed in soiled duck clothes some distance beneath the top of the dam which broke down to a lower level at the spot there was no moon but a row of blastlamps that grew dimmer as they receded picked out the tall embankment with jets of pulsating flame glimmering silvery gray in the light it cut against the gloom in long sweeping lines with a molded rib that added a touch of grace where the slope got steeper towards its top this was dicks innovation he had fought hard for it and when jake supported him stuyvesant had written to fuller who sanctioned the extra cost the rib marked the fine contour of the structure and fixed its bold curve upon the eye  where the upper surface broke off two gangs of men stood beside the tackles that trailed away from the foot of the derrick the flame that leaped with a roar from a lamp on a tripod picked out some of the figures with harsh distinctness but left the rest dim and blurred dick stood eight or nine feet below with the end of the line along which the blocks were brought directly above his head a piece of rail had been clamped across the metals to prevent the truck running over the edge jake stood close by on the downward slope of the dam everything was ready for the lowering of the next block but they had a few minutes to wait  that ribs a great idea jake remarked tones up the whole work its curious what you can do with a flowing line but it must be run just right make it the least too flat and you get harshness too full and the effects vulgarly pretty or voluptuous beautys severely chaste and i allow as far as form goes this dams a looker he paused and indicated the indigo sky flaring lights and sweep of pearly stone then if you want color you can revel in silver orange and blue  dick who nodded shared jakes admiration he had helped to build the dam and in a sense had come to love it any defacement or injury to it would hurt him just then a bright blinking spot emerged from the dark at the other end of the line and increased in radiance as it came forward flickering along the slope of stone it was the headlamp of the locomotive that pushed the massive concrete block they waited for the block cut off the light immediately in front of and below it and when the engine snorting harshly approached the edge of the gap somebody shouted and steam was cut off the truck stopped just short of the rail fastened across the line and dick looked up  the blastlamp flung its glare upon the engine and the rays of the powerful headlight drove horizontally into the dark but the space beyond the broken end of the dam was kept in shadow by the block and the glitter above dazzled his eyes  swing the derrickboom and tell the engineer to come on a yard or two he said  there was a patter of feet a rattle of chains and somebody called adelante locomotura  the engine snorted the wheels ground through the fragments of concrete scattered about the line and the big dark mass rolled slowly forward it seemed to dick to be going farther than it ought but he had ascertained that the guardrail was securely fastened as he watched the front of the truck jake who stood a few feet to one side leaned out and seized his shoulder  jump he cried pulling him forward  dick made an awkward leap and alighting on the steep front of the dam fell heavily on his side as he clutched the stones to save himself from sliding down a black mass plunged from the line above and there was a deafening crash as it struck the spot he had left then a shower of fragments fell upon him and he choked amidst a cloud of dust hoarse shouts broke out above and he heard men running about the dam as he got up half dazed  are you all right jake he asked  not a scratch was the answer and dick scrambling up the bank called for a lamp  it was brought by a big mulatto and dick held up the light the lastfitted block of the ribbed course was split in two and the one that had fallen was scattered about in massive broken lumps amidst these lay the guardrail and the front wheels of the truck hung across the gap above there was other damage and dick frowned as he looked about  well be lucky if we get the broken molding out in a day and i expect well have to replace two of the lower blocks he said its going to be an awkward and expensive job now that the cement has set  is that all jake asked with a forced grin  its enough said dick however well be better able to judge in the daylight  then he turned to the engineer who was standing beside the truck surrounded by excited peons how did it happen  i had my hand on the throttle when i got the order to go ahead and let her make a stroke or two reckoning the guardrail would snub up the car i heard the wheels clip and slammed the linkgear over because it looked as if she wasnt going to stop when she reversed the couplings held the car and the block slipped off  are you sure you didnt give her too much steam  no sir ive been doing this job quite a while and know just how smart a push she wants it was the guardrail slipping that made the trouble  i cant understand why it did slip the fastening clamps were firm when i looked at them  well remarked the engineer the guards certainly in the pit and i felt her give as soon as the carwheels bit  dick looked hard at him and thought he spoke the truth he was a steady fellow and a good driver  put your engine in the house and take down the feedpump you were complaining about we wont want her tomorrow he said and dismissing the men returned to his shack where he sat down rather limply on the veranda  i dont understand the thing he said to jake the guardrails heavy and i watched the smith make the clamps we fixed it with one claw went over the rail the other under the flange of the metal that formed the track and sudden pressure would jamb the guard down then not long before the accident i hardened up the clamp  you hit it on the back  of course id have loosened the thing by hitting the front  thats so jake agreed somewhat dryly well look for the clamps in the morning but you didnt seem very anxious to get out of the way  i expect i forgot to thank you for warning me anyhow you know  yes i know said jake you didnt think about it your mind was on your job still i suppose you see that if youd been a moment later youd have been smashed pretty flat  dick gave him a quick glance there was something curious about jakes tone but dick knew he did not mean to emphasize the value of his warning it was plain that he had had a very narrow escape but since one must be prepared for accidents in heavy engineering work he did not see why this should jar his nerves yet they were jarred the danger he had scarcely heeded had now a disturbing effect he could imagine what would have happened had he delayed his leap however he was tired and perhaps rather highly strung and he got up  its late and we had better go to bed he said     chapter xxiii  the clamp   when work began next morning jake asked dick if he should order the peons to search for the clamps that had held the guardrail  i think not said dick it would be better if you looked for the things yourself  very well perhaps youre right  dick wondered how much jake suspected particularly as he did not appear to be searching for anything when he moved up and down among the broken concrete half an hour later when none of the peons were immediately about he came up with his hand in his pocket and indicated a corner beside a block where there was a little shade and they were not likely to be overlooked  ive got one he remarked  when they sat down jake took out a piece of thick iron about six inches long forged into something like the shape of a u though the curve was different and one arm was shorter than the other much depended on the curve for the thing was made on the model of an oldfashioned but efficient clamp that carpenters sometimes use for fastening work to a bench a blow or pressure on one part wedged it fast but a sharp tap on the other enabled it to be lifted off this was convenient because as the work progressed the track along the dam had to be lengthened and the guard fixed across a fresh pair of rails  taking the object from jake dick examined it carefully he thought he recognized the dint where he had struck the iron and then turning it over noted another mark this had been made recently because the surface of the iron was bright where the hammer had fallen and a blow there would loosen the clamp he glanced at jake who nodded  it looks very suspicious but thats all you cant tell how long the mark would take to get dull besides we have moved the guard two or three times in the last few days  thats true said dick still i wedged the thing up shortly before the accident it has stood a number of shocks in fact it cant be loosened by pressure on the back when do you think the last blow was struck  after yours jake answered meaningly  then the probability is that somebody wanted the truck to fall into the hole and smash the block  yes said jake who paused and looked hard at dick but im not sure that was all he wanted you were standing right under the block and if i hadnt been a little to one side where the lights didnt dazzle me the smashing of a lot of concrete wouldnt have been the worst damage  dick said nothing but his face set hard as he braced himself against the unnerving feeling that had troubled him on the previous night the great block had not fallen by accident it looked as if somebody had meant to take his life the cunning of the attempt daunted him the blow had been struck in a manner that left him a very slight chance of escape and his subtle antagonist might strike again  what are you going to do about it jake resumed  nothing said dick  jake looked at him in surprise dont you see what youre up against  its pretty obvious but if i ask questions ill find out nothing and show that im suspicious if we let the thing go as an accident we may catch the fellow off his guard  my notion is that you know more than you mean to tell now you began by taking care of me but it looks as if the matter would end in my taking care of you seems to me you need it and i dont like to see you playing a lone hand  dick gave him a grateful smile if i see how you can help ill let you know in the meantime youll say nothing to imply that im on the watch  well said jake grinning if you can bluff stuyvesant youll be smarter than i thought youre a rather obvious person and hes not a fool  he went away but dick lighted a cigarette and sat still in the shade he was frankly daunted but did not mean to stop for he saw that he was following the right clue his reason for visiting the adexe wharf had been guessed he had been watched when he went to the viceconsul and it was plain that his enemies thought he knew enough to be dangerous the difficulty was that he did not know who they were he hated to think that kenwardine was a party to the plot but this while possible was by no means certain at santa brigida a mans life was not thought of much account and it would no doubt have been enough if kenwardine had intimated that dick might cause trouble but then kenwardine must have known what was likely to follow his hint  after all however this was not very important he must be careful but do nothing to suggest that he understood the risk he ran if his antagonists thought him stupid so much the better he saw the difficulty of playing what jake called a lone hand against men skilled in the intricate game but he could not ask for help until he was sure of his ground besides he must find a way of stopping kenwardine without involving clare in the meantime he had a duty to fuller and throwing away his cigarette resumed his work  two or three days later he met kenwardine in a caf√© where he was waiting for a man who supplied some stores to the camp when kenwardine saw dick he crossed the floor and sat down at his table his spanish dress became him he looked polished and wellbred and it was hard to think him a confederate of halfbreed ruffians who would not hesitate about murder but dick wondered whether clare had told him about his proposal  i suppose i may congratulate you on your recent promotion you certainly deserve it kenwardine remarked with an ironical smile i imagine your conscientiousness and energy are unusual but perhaps at times rather inconvenient  thanks said dick how did you hear about the matter  in santa brigida one hears everything that goes on we have nothing much to do but talk about our neighbors affairs  dick wondered whether kenwardine meant to hint that as his time was largely unoccupied he had only a small part in managing the coaling business but he said we are hardly your neighbors at the camp  i suppose thats true we certainly dont see you often  this seemed to indicate that kenwardine did not know about dicks recent visit he could have no reason for hiding his knowledge and it looked as if clare did not tell her father everything  you have succeeded in keeping your young friend out of our way kenwardine resumed still as he hasnt your love of work and sober character theres some risk of a reaction if you hold him in too hard jakes at an age when its difficult to be satisfied with cement  dick laughed i really did try to keep him but was helped by luck we have been unusually busy at the dam and although i dont know that his love for cement is strong he doesnt often leave a halffinished job  if you work upon his feelings in that way i expect youll beat me but after all im not scheming to entangle the lad hes a bright and amusing youngster but there wouldnt be much profit in exploiting him however you have had some accidents at the dam havent you  dick was immediately on his guard but he answered carelessly we broke a cranedrum which delayed us  and didnt a truck fall down the embankment and do some damage  it did said dick we had a big molded block which cost a good deal to make smashed to pieces and some others split i had something of an escape too because i was standing under the block  he was watching kenwardine and thought his expression changed and his easy pose stiffened his selfcontrol was good but dick imagined he was keenly interested and surprised  then you ran a risk of being killed  yes jake however saw the danger and warned me just before the block fell  that was lucky but you have a curious temperament when we began to talk of the accidents you remembered the damage to fullers property before the risk to your life  well said dick you see i wasnt hurt but the damage still keeps us back  how did the truck run off the line i should have thought youd have taken precautions against anything of the kind  dick pondered he believed kenwardine really was surprised to hear he had nearly been crushed by the block but the fellow was clever and had begun to talk about the accidents he must do nothing to rouse his suspicions and began a painstaking account of the matter explaining that the guardrail had got loose but saying nothing about the clamps being tampered with indeed the trouble he took about the explanation was in harmony with his character and his interest in his work and presently kenwardine looked bored  i quite understand the thing he said and got up as the man dick was waiting for came towards the table  the merchant did not keep dick long and he left the caf√© feeling satisfied kenwardine had probably had him watched and had had something to do with the theft of the sheet from his blotting pad but knew nothing about the attempt upon his life after hearing about it he understood why the accident happened but had no cause to think that dick knew and some of his fellow conspirators were responsible for this part of the plot dick wondered whether he would try to check them now he did know because if they tried again they would do so with kenwardines tacit consent  a few days later he was sitting with bethune and jake one evening when stuyvesant came in and threw a card printed with the flag of a british steamship company on the table  im not going but you might like to do so he said  dick who was nearest picked up the card it was an invitation to a dinner given to celebrate the first call of a large new steamship at santa brigida and he imagined it had been sent to the leading citizens and merchants who imported goods by the companys vessels after glancing at it he passed it on  ill go bethune remarked after the spartan simplicity we practise at the camp it will be a refreshing change to eat a wellserved dinner in a mailboats saloon though ive no great admiration for british cookery  it cant be worse than the dago kind were used to jake broke in whats the matter with it anyhow  its like the british character heavy and unchanging bethune replied a london hotel menu with english beer and whisky in the tropics only people without imagination would offer it to their guests and then theyve printed a list of the ports shes going to at the bottom would any other folk except perhaps the germans couple an invitation with a hint that they were ready to trade if a spaniard comes to see you on business he talks for half an hour about politics or your health and apologizes for mentioning such a thing as commerce when he comes to the point  the british plan has advantages said stuyvesant you know what youre doing when you deal with them  thats so we know for example when this boat will arrive at any particular place and when shell sail while you can reckon on a french liners being three or four days late and on the probability of a spaniards not turning up at all but whether you have revolutions wars or tidal waves the britisher sails on schedule  theres some risk in that just now stuyvesant observed  bethune turned to jake you had better come the card states therell be music and the agent will hire vallejos band which is pretty good guitars mandolins and fiddles on the poop and se√±oritas in gauzy dresses flitting through graceful dances in the after well the entertainment ought to appeal to your artistic taste  im going jake replied  so am i said dick  jake grinned thats rather sudden isnt it however you may be needed to look after bethune  an evening or two later they boarded the launch at the town mole the sea was smooth and glimmered with phosphorescence in the shadow of the land for the moon had not risen far above the mountains outside the harbor mouth the liners long black hull cut against the dusky blue the flowing curve of her sheer picked out by a row of lights over this rose three white tiers of passenger decks pierced by innumerable bright points with larger lights in constellations outside while masts and funnels ran up faintly indicated into the gloom above she scarcely moved to the lift of the languid swell but as the undulations passed there was a palegreen shimmer about her waterline that magnified the height to her topmost deck she looked unsubstantial rather like a floating fairy palace than a ship and as the noisy launch drew nearer jake gave his imagination rein  she was made just right by magic a ship of dreams he said look how she glimmers splashed with cadmium radiance on velvety blue and her formlessness outside the lights wraps her in mystery yet you get a hint of swiftness  you know she has power and speed bethune interrupted  no said jake firmly its not a matter of knowledge she appeals to your imagination you feel that airy fabric must travel like the wind then he turned to dick who was steering theres a boat ahead with a freight of se√±oritas in white and orange gossamer they know something about grace of line in this country are you going to rush past them like a dull barbarian in this kicking snorting launch  ill make for the other side of the ship if you like  you neednt go so far jake answered with a chuckle but you might muzzle your rackety engine  dick who had seen the boat gave her room enough but let the engine run he imagined that jakes motive for slowing down might be misunderstood by the se√±oritas guardian since a touch of moorish influence still colors the spaniards care of his women as the launch swung to starboard her red light shone into the boat and dick recognized don sebastian sitting next a stout lady in a black dress there were three or four girls beside them and then dicks grasp on the tiller stiffened for the ruby beam picked out clares face he thought it wore a tired look but she turned her head as if dazzled and the light passed on and dicks heart beat as the boat dropped back into the gloom since kenwardine had sent clare with don sebastian he could not be going and dick might find an opportunity for speaking to her alone he meant to do so although the interview would not be free from embarrassment then he avoided another boat and stopping the engine steered for the steamers ladder     chapter xxiv  the altered sailing list   when dinner was over dick sat by himself in a quiet spot on the liners quarterdeck there was a tall iron bulwark beside him but close by this was replaced by netted rails through which he caught the pale shimmer of the sea the warm landbreeze had freshened and ripples splashed against the vessels side while every now and then a languid gurgle rose from about her waterline and the foam her plates threw off was filled with phosphorescent flame a string band was playing on the poop and passengers and guests moved through the intricate figures of a spanish dance on the broad deck below their poses were graceful and their dress was picturesque but dick watched them listlessly  he was not in a mood for dancing for he had been working hard at the dam and his thoughts were disturbed clare had refused him and although he did not accept her decision as final he could see no way of taking her out of her fathers hands while he had made no progress towards unraveling the latters plots kenwardine was not on board but dick had only seen clare at some distance off across the table in the saloon moreover he thought she must have taken some trouble to avoid meeting him  then he remembered the speeches made by the visitors at dinner and the steamship officers replies the former colored by french and spanish politeness and american wit eulogized the power of the british navy and the courage of her merchant captains there was war they said but british commerce went on without a check goods shipped beneath the red ensign would be delivered safe in spite of storm and strife britannia with trident poised guarded the seas for this the boldlyannounced sailing list served as text but dick who made allowances for exuberant latin sentiment noted the captains response with some surprise  his speech was flamboyant and did not harmonize with the character of the man who had called at the port before in command of another ship he was grayhaired and generally reserved dick had not expected him to indulge in cheap patriotism but he called the british ensign the meteor flag defied its enemies and declared that no hostile fleets could prevent his employers carrying their engagements out since the man was obviously sober dick supposed he was touting for business and wanted to assure the merchants that the sailings of the companys steamers could be relied upon still this kind of thing was not good british form  by and by don sebastian came down a ladder from the saloon deck with clare behind him dick felt tempted to retire but conquered the impulse and the spaniard came up  i have some business with the purser who is waiting for me but cannot find my se√±ora he explained and dick knowing that local conventions forbade his leaving clare alone understood it as a request that he should take care of her until the others return  i should be glad to stay with miss kenwardine he answered with a bow and when don sebastian went off opened a deckchair and turned to the girl  you see how i was situated he said awkwardly  clare smiled as she sat down yes you are not to blame indeed i do not see why you should apologize  well said dick i hoped that i might meet you though i feared you would sooner i did not when i saw you on the ladder i felt i ought to steal away but must confess that i was glad when i found it was too late somehow things seem to bring us into opposition they have done so from the beginning  youre unnecessarily frank clare answered with a blush since you couldnt steal away wouldnt it have been better not to hint that i was anxious to avoid you after all i could have done so if i had really wanted  i expect thats true of course what happened when we last met couldnt trouble you as it troubled me  are you trying to be tactful now clare asked smiling  no its my misfortune that i havent much tact if i had i might be able to straighten matters out  dont you understand that they cant be straightened out  i dont dick answered stubbornly for all that i wont trouble you again until i find a way out of the tangle  clare gave him a quick disturbed look it would be much better if you took it for granted that we must to some extent be enemies  no im afraid your father and i are enemies but thats not the same  it is you can see that it must be clare insisted and then as if anxious to change the subject went on he was too busy to bring me tonight so i came with don sebastian and his wife it is not very gay in santa brigida and one gets tired of being alone  her voice fell a little as she concluded and dick who understood something of her isolation from friends of her race longed to take her in his arms and comfort her indeed had the quarterdeck been deserted he might have tried for he felt that her refusal had sprung from wounded pride and a sense of duty there was something in her manner that hinted that it had not been easy to send him away yet he saw she could be firm and thought it wise to follow her lead  then your father has been occupied lately he remarked  yes he is often away he goes to adexe and is generally busy in the evenings people come to see him and keep him talking in his room our friends no longer spend the evening in the patio  dick understood her she wanted to convince him that kenwardine was a business man and only gambled when he had nothing else to do indeed her motive was rather pitifully obvious and dick knew that he had not been mistaken about her character clare had no doubt once yielded to her fathers influence but it was impossible that she took any part in his plots she was transparently honest he knew this as he watched her color come and go  after all i dont think you liked many of the people who came he said  i liked jake she answered and stopped with a blush while dick felt half ashamed because he had deprived her of the one companion she could trust  well he said it isnt altogether my fault that jake doesnt come to see you we have had some accidents that delayed the work and he has not been able to leave the dam  he was silent for the next few minutes since clare was eager to defend kenwardine she might be led to tell something about his doings from which a useful hint could be gathered and dick greatly wished to know who visited his house on business still it was impossible that he should make the girl betray her father the fight was between him and kenwardine and clare must be kept outside it with this resolve he began to talk about the dancing and soon afterward jake came up and asked clare for the next waltz she smiled and gave dick a challenging glance  certainly he said with a bow and then turned to jake as miss kenwardine has been put in my charge you must bring her back  jake grinned as he promised and remarked as they went away makes a good due√±a doesnt he you can trust dick to guard anything hes told to take care of in fact if id a sister i wanted to leave in safe hands he paused and laughed but thats the trouble it was my sister who told him to take care of me  dick did not hear clares reply but watched her dance until don sebastians wife came up after that he went away and presently strolled along the highest deck this was narrower than the others but was extended as far as the side of the ship by beams on which the boats were stowed there were no rails for passengers were not allowed up there but dick who was preoccupied and moody wanted to be alone the moon had now risen above the mountains and the sea glittered between the shore and the ship looking down he saw a row of boats rise and fall with the languid swell near her tall side and the flash of the surf that washed the end of the mole then taking out a cigarette he strolled towards the captains room which stood behind the bridge and stopped near it in the shadow of a big lifeboat  the room was lighted and the door and windows were half open because the night was hot carelessly glancing in dick saw don sebastian sitting at the table with the captain and engineer this somewhat surprised him for the purser transacted the ships business and so far as he knew none of the other guests had been taken to the captains room he felt puzzled about don sebastian whom he had met once or twice the fellow had an air of authority and the smaller officials treated him with respect  something in the mens attitude indicated that they were talking confidentially and dick thought he had better go away without attracting their attention but just then the captain turned in his chair and looked out dick decided to wait until he looked round again and next moment don sebastian asked have you plenty coal  i think so the engineer replied the afterbunkers are full but id have taken a few extra bargeloads here only i didnt want any of the shore peons to see how much id already got  dick did not understand this because coal was somewhat cheaper and the facilities for shipping it were better at the boats next port of call to which it was only a twodays run then the captain who turned to don sebastian remarked  making the sailing list prominent was a happy thought and it was lucky your friends backed us up well by their speeches you saw how i took advantage of the lead they gave me but i hope we havent overdone the thing  no said don sebastian thoughtfully i imagine nobody suspects anything yet  perhaps you had better clear the ship soon sir said the engineer steams nearly up and it takes some coal  the room door slipped off its hook and swung wide open as the vessel rolled and dick who could not withdraw unnoticed decided to light his cigarette in order that the others might see that they were not alone as he struck the match the captain got up  whos that he asked  one of the foreign passengers i expect the mates cant keep them off this deck the engineer replied i dont suppose the fellow knows english but shall i send him down  i think not it might look as if we were afraid of being overheard  dick held the match to his cigarette for a moment or two before he threw it away and as he walked past noted that don sebastian had come out on deck indeed he thought the man had seen his face and was satisfied because he turned back into the room dick went down a ladder to the deck below where he stopped and thought over what he had heard it was plain that some precautions had been taken against the risk of capture but he could not understand why don sebastian had been told about them  by and by he thought he would speak to the purser whom he knew and went down the alleyway that led to his office the door was hooked back but the passage was narrow and a fat spanish lady blocked the entrance she was talking to the purser and dick saw that he must wait until she had finished a man stood a few yards behind her unscrewing a flute and as a folded paper that looked like music stuck out of his pocket he appeared to belong to the band  but it is tuesday you arrive at palomas the lady exclaimed  about then the purser answered in awkward castilian we may be a little late  but how much late  i cannot tell perhaps a day or two  at dinner the captain said  just so but he was speaking generally without knowing all the arrangements  dick could not see into the office but heard the purser open a drawer and shuffle some papers as if he wanted to get rid of his questioner  it is necessary that i know when we arrive the lady resumed if it is not tuesday i must send a telegram  the purser shut the drawer noisily but just then a bell rang overhead and the whistle blew to warn the visitors that they must go ashore  then you must be quick said the purser write your message here and give it to me you need not be disturbed we will land you at palomas  the lady entered the office but dick thought her telegram would not be sent and a moment later the captains plan dawned on him the ship would call at the ports named but not in the order stated and this was why she needed so much coal she would probably steam first to the port farthest off and then work backward and the sailing list was meant to put the raider off the track the latters commander warned by spies who would send him the list would think he knew where to find the vessel at any particular date when however she would be somewhere else then dick wondered why the musician was hanging about and went up to him  the sobrecargos busy he said in english youll be taken to sea unless you get up on deck  i no wanta el sobrecargo the man replied in a thick stupid voice the music is thirsty i wanta drink  the secondclass bar was farther down the alleyway and dick indicating it turned back and made his way to the poop as fast as he could for he did not think the man was as drunk as he looked he found the musicians collecting their stands and went up to the bandmaster  theres one of your men below who has been drinking too much ca√±a he said you had better look after him  but they are all here the bandmaster answered glancing round the poop  the man had a flute  but we have no fluteplayer  then he must have been a passenger said dick who hurried to the gangway  after hailing his fireman to bring the launch alongside he threw a quick glance about the shore boatmen were pushing their craft abreast of the ladder and shouting as they got in each others way but one boat had already left the ship and was pulling fast towards the harbor there seemed to be only one man on board besides her crew and dick had no doubt that he was the fluteplayer he must be followed since it was important to find out whom he met and if as dick suspected he meant to send off a telegram but the liners captain must be warned and dick turned hastily around the windlass was rattling and the bridge on which he could see the captains burly figure was some distance off while the passage between the gangway and deckhouse was blocked by the departing guests  the anchor would probably be up before he could push his way through the crowd and if he was not carried off to sea he would certainly lose sight of the spy writing a line or two on the leaf of his pocketbook he tore it out and held it near a creole steward boy  take that to the sobrecargo at once he cried and seeing the boy stoop to pick up the note which fell to the deck ran down the ladder  he had however to wait a minute while the fireman brought the launch alongside between the other boats and when they pushed off don sebastian scrambling across one of the craft jumped on board he smiled when dick looked at him with annoyed surprise  i think my business is yours but there is no time for explanations he said tell your man to go full speed  the launch quivered and leaped ahead with the foam curling at her bows and dick did not look round when he heard an expostulating shout jake and bethune must get ashore as they could his errand was too important to stop for them particularly as he could no longer see the boat in front she had crossed the glittering belt of moonlight and vanished into the shadow near the mole her occupant had had some minutes start and had probably landed but it might be possible to find out where he had gone  screw the valve wide open dick told the fireman  the rattle of the engine quickened a little the launch lifted her bows and her stern sank into the hollow of a following wave when she steamed up the harbor a boat lay near some steps and as the launch slackened speed dick asked her crew which way their passenger had gone  up the mole se√±or one answered breathlessly  it is all you will learn from them don sebastian remarked i think we will try the telegrafia first  there was no time for questions and dick jumped out as the launch ran alongside the steps don sebastian stopped him when he reached the top  in santa brigida nobody runs unless there is an earthquake or a revolution we do not want people to follow us  dick saw the force of this and started for the telegraph office walking as fast as possible when he looked round his companion had vanished but he rejoined him on the steps of the building they went in together and found nobody except a languid clerk leaning on a table don sebastian turned to dick and said in english it will be better if you leave this matter to me  dick noted that the clerk suddenly became alert when he saw his companion but he waited at a few yards distance and don sebastian said a man came in not long since with a telegram he was short and very dark and probably signed the form vinoles  he did se√±or said the clerk  very well i want to see the message before it is sent  it has gone se√±or three or four minutes ago  don sebastian made a gesture of resignation spreading out his hands then bring me the form  dick thought it significant that the clerk at once obeyed but don sebastian who stood still for a moment turned to him  it is as i thought he said in english and ordered the clerk take us into the managers room  the other did so and after shutting the door withdrew don sebastian threw the form on the table  it seems we are too late he said     chapter xxv  the waterpipe   dick sat down and knitted his brows as he studied his companion don sebastian was a peninsular spaniard and in consequence of a finer type than the majority of the inhabitants of santa brigida dick who thought he could confide in him needed help but the matter was delicate in the meantime the other waited with a smile that implied that he guessed his thoughts until dick leaning forward with sudden resolution picked up the telegram which was written in cipher  this is probably a warning to somebody that the vessel will not call at the ports in the advertised order he said  i imagine so you guessed the captains plan from what you heard outside the room  not altogether but it gave me a hint it looks as if you recognized me when i was standing near the lifeboat  i did said don sebastian meaningly i think i showed my confidence in you  dick nodded because it was plain that the other had enabled him to go away without being questioned  very well ill tell you what i know he said and related how he had found the man with the flute loitering about the pursers door as he finished don sebastian got up  you made one mistake you should have given your note to an englishman and not a young creole lad however we must see if the steamer can be stopped  he led the way up a staircase to the flat roof where dick ran to the parapet looking across the town he saw in the distance a dim white light and a long smear of smoke that trailed across the glittering sea he frowned as he watched it for the ship was english and he felt himself responsible for the safety of all on board her he had done his best when there was no time to pause and think but perhaps he had blundered suppose the creole boy had lost his note or sent it to somebody ashore  we are too late again don sebastian remarked as he sat down on the parapet well one must be philosophical things do not always go as one would wish  why didnt you warn the captain that his plan was found out instead of jumping into the launch dick asked angrily  don sebastian smiled because i did not know i saw a man steal down the ladder and thought he might be a spy but could not tell how much he had learned if he had learned nothing it would have been dangerous for the captain to change his plan again and keep to the sailing list  thats true dick agreed shortly his chin was thrust forward and his head slightly tilted back he looked very english and aggressive as he resumed but i want to know what your interest in the matter is  then i must tell you to begin with i am employed by the government and am in the presidents confidence the country is poor and depends for its development on foreign capital while it is important that we should have the support and friendship of great britain and the united states perhaps you know the latters jealousy about european interference in american affairs  dick nodded you feel you have to be careful but how far can a country go in harboring a belligerents agents and supplying her fighting ships without losing its neutrality  that is a difficult question don sebastian replied i imagine the answer depends upon the temper of the interested countrys diplomatic representatives but the president means to run no risks we cannot for example have it claimed that we allowed a foreign power to buy a coaling station and use it as a base for raids on merchant ships  have the germans bought the adexe wharf  don sebastian shrugged qui√©n sabe the principal has not a german name  isnt richter german  richter has gone it is possible that he has done his work his friend however is the head of the coaling company  do you think kenwardine was his partner if so its hard to understand why he let you come to his house hes not a fool  the spaniards dark eyes twinkled se√±or kenwardine is a clever man and it is not always safer to keep your antagonist in the dark when you play an intricate game se√±or kenwardine knew it would have been a mistake to show he thought i suspected him and that he had something to conceal we were both very frank to a point and now and then talked about the complications that might spring from the coaling business because we value our trade with england and wish to attract british capital he knew we would not interfere with him unless we had urgent grounds and wished to learn how far we would let him go it must be owned that in this country official suspicion can often be disarmed  by a bribe i dont think kenwardine is rich dick objected  then it is curious that he is able to spend so much at adexe  dick frowned for he saw what the other implied if kenwardine had to be supplied with money where did it come from it was not his business to defend the man and he must do what he could to protect british shipping but kenwardine was clares father and he was not going to expose him until he was sure of his guilt  but if he was plotting anything that would get your president into trouble he must have known he would be found out  certainly but suppose he imagined he might not be found out until he had done what he came to do it would not matter then  dick said nothing he knew he was no match for the spaniard in subtlety but he would not be forced into helping him he set his lips and don sebastian watched him with amusement  well said the latter you have my sympathy the se√±oritas eyes are bright  i cannot have miss kenwardine mentioned dick rejoined she has nothing to do with the matter  that is agreed don sebastian answered and leaned forward as he added in a meaning tone you are english and your life has been threatened by men who plot against your country i might urge that they may try again and i could protect you but you must see what their thinking you dangerous means now i want your help  dicks face was very resolute as he looked at him if any harm comes to the liner ill do all i can but ill do nothing until i know in the meantime can you warn the captain  don sebastian bowed i must be satisfied with your promise we may find the key to the telegram and must try to get into communication with the steamer  they went down stairs together but the spaniard did not leave the office with dick who went out alone and found bethune and jake waiting at the end of the line they bantered him about his leaving them on board the ship but although he thought jake looked at him curiously he told them nothing  when work stopped on the saturday evening jake and dick went to dine with bethune it was getting dark when they reached a break in the dam where a gap had been left open while a sluice was being built a halffinished tower rose on the other side and a rope ladder hung down for the convenience of anybody who wished to cross a large iron pipe that carried water to a turbine however spanned the chasm and the surefooted peons often used it as a bridge this required some agility and nerve but it saved an awkward scramble across the sluice and up the concrete  theres just light enough jake remarked and balancing himself carefully walked out upon the pipe  dick followed and getting across safely stopped at the foot of the tower and looked down at the rough blocks and unfinished ironwork in the bottom of the gap  the men have been told to use the ladder but as they seldom do so it would be safer to run a wire across for a handrail he said anybody who slipped would get a dangerous fall  they went on to bethunes iron shack where stuyvesant joined them and after dinner sat outside talking and smoking a carafe of spanish wine and some glasses stood on a table close by  ive fired joses and panchos gangs theyve been asking for it for some time stuyvesant remarked in fact id clear out most of the shovel boys if i could replace them theyve been saving money and are getting slack  the others agreed that it might be advisable the halfbreeds from the hills attracted by good wages worked well when first engaged but generally found steady labor irksome and got discontented when they had earned a sum that would enable them to enjoy a change  i dont think youd get boys enough in this neighborhood bethune said  thats so anyhow id rather hire a less sophisticated crowd the halfcivilized meztiso is worse than the other sort but i dont see why we shouldnt look for some further along the coast do you feel like taking the launch brandon and trying what you can do  id enjoy the trip dick answered with some hesitation but id probably have to go beyond coronal and it might take a week  that wont matter stay as long as its necessary stuyvesant said for he had noticed a slackness in dicks movements and his tired look things are going pretty well just now and you have stuck close to your work the change will brace you up anyhow i want fresh boys and bethunes needed here but you can take jake along if you want company  jake declared that he would go but dick agreed with reluctance he felt jaded and depressed for the double strain he had borne was beginning to tell his work carried on in scorching heat demanded continuous effort and when it stopped at night he had private troubles to grapple with though he had been halfprepared for clares refusal it had hit him hard and he could find no means of exposing kenwardines plots without involving her in his ruin it would be a relief to get away but he might be needed at santa brigida  bethune began to talk about the alterations a contractor wished to make and by and by there was a patter of feet and a hum of voices in the dark the voices grew louder and sounded angry as the steps approached the house and stuyvesant pushed back his chair  its joses or panchos breeds come to claim that their time is wrong i suppose one couldnt expect that kind of crowd to understand figures but although fran√ßois accounts are seldom very plain hes not a grafter  then a native servant entered hurriedly  they all come se√±or he announced pig tief say fransoy rob him and he go casser office window he turned and waved his hand threateningly as a big man in ragged white clothes came into the light fuera puerco ladron  the man took off a large palmleaf hat and flourished it with ironical courtesy  here is gran escandolo se√±ores la belle chose verdad me i have trent dollar the grand tief me pay  stuyvesant signed to the servant take them round to the back corral we cant have them on the veranda then he turned to dick you and bethune must convince them that the timesheets are right you know more about the thing than i do havent you been helping fran√ßois fuller  im not a linguist jake answered with a grin when they talk french and spanish at once it knocks me right off my height as fran√ßois sometimes declares  they all went round to the back of the house where bethune and dick argued with the men the latter had been dismissed and while ready to go wanted a grievance though some honestly failed to understand the deductions from their wages they had drawn small sums in advance taken goods out of store and laid off now and then on an unusually hot day but the amount charged against them was larger than they thought for all that bethune using patience and firmness pacified them and after a time they went away satisfied while the others returned to the veranda  arguing in languages you dont know well is thirsty work and wed better have a drink bethune remarked  he pushed the carafe across the table but dick picked up his glass which he had left about half full he was hot and it was a light spanish wine that one could drink freely but when he had tasted it he emptied what was left over the veranda rails  bethune looked surprised but laughed the wine isnt very good but the others seem able to stand for it i once laid out a mine ditch in a neighborhood where youd have wanted some courage to throw away a drink the boys had given you  it was very bad manners dick answered awkwardly still i didnt like the taste  he stopped noticing that jake gave him a keen glance but stuyvesant filled his glass and drank  whats the matter with the wine he asked  dick hesitated he wanted to let the matter drop but he had treated bethune rudely and saw that the others were curious  it didnt taste as it did when i left it of course this may have been imagination  but you dont think so stuyvesant rejoined in fact you suspect the wine was doped after we went out  no said dick with a puzzled frown i imagine any doping stuff would make it sour the curious thing is that it tasted better than usual but stronger  stuyvesant picked up the glass and smelt it for a little of the liquor remained in the bottom  its a pity you threw it out because theres a scent mine hasnt got like bad brandy or what the spaniards call madre de vino and use for bringing light wine up to strength  then bethune took the glass from him and drained the last drops i think it is madre de vino pretty heady stuff and that glass would hold a lot  stuyvesant nodded for it was not a wineglass but a small tumbler  dopings not an unusual trick but i cant see why anybody should want to make brandon drunk  it isnt very plain and i may have made a fuss about nothing dick replied and began to talk about something else with jakes support  the others indulged them and after a time the party broke up the moon had risen when dick and jake walked back along the dam but the latter stopped when they reached the gap  well climb down and cross by the sluice instead of the pipe he said  why dick asked the light is better than when we came  jake gave him a curious look your nerves pretty good but do you want to defy your enemies and show them you have found out their trick  but i havent found it out that is i dont know the object of it yet  well said jake rather grimly what do you think would happen if a drunken man tried to walk along that pipe  then a light dawned on dick and he sat down feeling limp he was abstemious and a large dose of strong spirit would no doubt have unsteadied him his companions would notice this but with the obstinacy that often marks a halfdrunk man he would probably have insisted on trying to cross the pipe then a slip or hesitation would have precipitated him upon the unfinished ironwork below and since an obvious explanation of his fall had been supplied nobodys suspicions would have been aroused the subtlety of the plot was unnerving somebody who knew all about him had chosen the moment well  its so devilishly clever he said with hoarse anger after a moment or two  jake nodded theyre smart they knew the boys were coming to make a row and stuyvesant wouldnt have them on the veranda then the wine was on the table and anybody whod noticed where we sat could tell your glass it would have been easy to creep up to the shack before the moon rose  who are they  if i knew i could tell you what to do about it but i dont its possible there was only one man but if so hes dangerous anyhow its obvious that kenwardine has no part in the matter  hes not in this dick agreed have you a cigarette i think id like a smoke it doesnt follow that id have been killed if i had fallen  then youd certainly have got hurt enough to keep you quiet for some time which would probably satisfy the other fellow but i dont think well stop here talking there may be somebody about  they climbed down by the foot of the tower and crossing the sluice went up the ladder when they reached their shack dick sat down and lighted the cigarette jake had given him but he said nothing and his face was sternly set soon afterwards he went to bed     chapter xxvi  the liners fate   next morning dick reviewed the situation as he ate his breakfast in the fresh coolness before the sun got up he had got a shock but he was young and soon recovered his anger against the unknown plotter remained fierce but this was in a sense a private grievance by which he must not be unduly influenced it was plain that he was thought dangerous which showed that he was following the right clue and he had determined that the raiding of ships belonging to britain or her allies must be stopped since he had gone to the representative of british authority and had been rebuffed he meant to get fuller to see if american suspicions could be easier aroused but he must first make sure of his ground in the meantime don sebastian had asked his help and he had given a conditional promise  dick decided that he had taken the proper course don sebastian held kenwardine accountable and meant to expose him this was painful to contemplate for clares sake but dick admitted that he could not shield kenwardine at his countrys expense still the matter was horribly complicated if kenwardine was ruined or imprisoned a serious obstacle in dicks way would be removed but it was unthinkable that this should be allowed to count when clare must suffer besides she might come to hate him if she learned that he was responsible for her fathers troubles but he would make the liners fate a test if the vessel arrived safe kenwardine should go free until his guilt was certain if she were sunk or chased he would help don sebastian in every way he could  for three or four days he heard nothing about her and then one hot morning when stuyvesant and bethune stood at the foot of the tower by the sluice examining some plans jake crossed the pipe with a newspaper in his hand  the diario has just arrived he said i havent tried to read it yet but the liner has been attacked  dick who was superintending the building of the sluice hastily scrambled up the bank and stuyvesant taking the newspaper sat down in the shade of the tower he knew more castilian than the others who gathered round him as he translated  the liner the account stated had the coast in sight shortly before dark and was steaming along it when a large black funnel steamer appeared from behind a point the captain at once swung his vessel round and the stranger fired a shot of which he took no notice it was blowing fresh the light would soon fade and there was a group of reefs which he knew well not far away the raider gained a little during the next hour and fired several shots two of the shells burst on board killing a seaman and wounding some passengers but the captain held on when it was getting dark the reefs lay close ahead with the sea breaking heavily on their outer edge but he steamed boldly for an intricate unmarked channel between them and the land in altering his course he exposed the vessels broadside to the enemy and a shot smashed the pilothouse but they steered her in with the handgear the pursuer then sheered off but it got very dark and the vessel grounded in a position where the reef gave some shelter  nothing could be done until morning but as day broke the raider reappeared and had fired a shot across the reef when a gunboat belonging to the state in whose territorial waters the steamer lay came upon the scene she steamed towards the raider which made off at full speed then the gunboat took the liners passengers on board and it was hoped that the vessel could be refloated  a clear story told by a french or spanish sailor whod taken a passage on the ship bethune remarked it certainly didnt come from one of the british crew  why jake asked  bethune smiled a seaman who tells the truth about anything startling that happens on board a passenger boat gets fired the convention is to wrap the thing in mystery if it cant be denied besides the ability to take what you might call a quick birdseye view isnt a british gift an englishman would have concentrated on some particular point anyhow i cant see how the boat came to be where she was at the time mentioned he turned to dick and asked do you know brandon  no said dick shortly not altogether  well resumed bethune ive seen the antiquated gunboat that came to the rescue and its amusing to think of her steaming up to the big auxiliary cruiser its doubtful if theyve got ammunition that would go off in their footy little guns though i expect the gang of halfbreed cutthroats would put up a good fight they have pluck enough and the country they belong to can stand upon her dignity  she knows where to look for support stuyvesant remarked if the other party goes much farther shell get a sharp snub up whats your idea of the situation  something like yours we cant allow the black eagle to find an eyrie in this part of the world but just now our western birds talons are blunt she hasnt been rending the innocents like the other but one or two of our former leaders are anxious to put her into fighting trim and i dare say something of the kind will be done however brandon hasnt taken much part in this conversation i guess hes thinking about his work  dick who had been sitting quiet with a thoughtful face got up  id like to talk to you for a few minutes stuyvesant  very well said the other who turned to bethune and jake i dont want to play the domineering boss but were not paid to sit here and fix up international politics  they went away and stuyvesant looked at dick who said i ought to start in the launch tomorrow to get the laborers you want but i cant go  why  dick hesitated the fact is ive something else to do  ah said stuyvesant i think the understanding was that fuller bought all your time  he did im sorry but  but if i insist on your going down the coast youll break your agreement  yes said dick with embarrassment it comes to that  stuyvesant looked hard at him you must recognize that this is a pretty good job and youre not likely to get another without fullers recommendation then i understand you were up against it badly when he first got hold of you youre young and ought to be ambitious and you have your chance to make your mark right here  its all true dick answered doggedly still i cant go  then it must be something very important that makes you willing to throw up your job  dick did not answer and to his surprise stuyvesant smiled as he resumed its england first with you  how did you guess how much do you know dick asked sharply  i dont know very much your throwing out the wine gave me a hint because it was obvious that somebody had been getting after you before and there were other matters but youre rather young and i suspect youre up against a big thing  im afraid i cant tell you about it yet if that is what you mean  very well stay here as usual if you like or if you want a week off take it ill find a suitable reason for not sending you in the launch  thanks said dick with keen gratitude and stuyvesant who nodded pleasantly went away  dick sent a note to don sebastian by a messenger he could trust and soon after dark met him as he appointed at a wineshop on the outskirts of the town where they were shown into a small back room  i imagine you are now satisfied the spaniard said the liner has been chased and people on board her have been killed  im ready to do anything that will prevent another raid to some extent perhaps im responsible for what has happened i might have stopped and seen the mate or captain but then id have lost the man i was after what do you think became of my note  don sebastian looked thoughtful the boy may have lost it or shown it to his comrades they carry a few spanish stewards for the sake of the foreign passengers and we both carelessly took too much for granted we followed the spy we saw without reflecting that there might be another on board however this is not important now  it isnt but what do you mean to do with kenwardine  you have no cause for troubling yourself on his account  thats true in a way dick answered coloring though his tone was resolute he once did me a serious injury but i dont want him hurt i mean to stop his plotting if i can but im going no further whether its my duty or not  the spaniard made a sign of comprehension then we need not quarrel about kenwardine in fact the president does not want to arrest him our policy is to avoid complications and it would satisfy us if he could be forced to leave the country and give up the coaling station  how will you force him  he has been getting letters from kingston ordinary friendly letters from a gentleman whose business seems to be coaling ships for all that there is more in them than meets the uninstructed eye  have you read his replies  don sebastian shrugged what do you expect they do not tell us much but it looks as if se√±or kenwardine means to visit kingston soon  but its in jamaica british territory  just so said the spaniard smiling se√±or kenwardine is a bold and clever man his going to kingston would have thrown us off the scent if we had not known as much as we do but it would have been dangerous had he tried to hide it and we had found it out you see how luck favors us  what is your plan  we will follow kenwardine he will be more or less at our mercy on british soil and if it seems needful there is a charge you can bring against him he stole some army papers  dick started how did you hear of that  clever men are sometimes incautious and he once spoke about it to his daughter don sebastian answered with a shrug our antagonists are not the only people who have capable spies  the intrigue and trickery he had become entangled in inspired dick with disgust but he admitted that one could not be fastidious in a fight with a man like his antagonist  very well he said frowning ill go but it must be understood that when hes beaten you wont decide whats to be done with the man without consulting me  don sebastian bowed it is agreed one can trust you to do nothing that would injure your country but we have some arrangements to make  shortly afterwards dick left the wineshop and returning to the camp went to see stuyvesant  i want to go away in a few days perhaps for a fortnight but id like it understood that id been sent down the coast in the launch he said as a matter of fact i mean to start in her  certainly arrange the thing as you like stuyvesant agreed then he looked at dick with a twinkle you deserve a layoff and i hope youll enjoy it  dick thanked him and went back to his shack where he found jake on the verandah  i may go with the launch after all but not to coronal he remarked  ah said jake with some dryness then you had better take me anyhow im coming  id much sooner you didnt  that doesnt count jake replied youre getting after somebody and if you leave me behind ill give the plot away its easy to send a rumor round the camp  dick reflected he saw that jake meant to come and knew he could be obstinate besides the lad was something of a seaman and would be useful on board the launch because dick did not mean to join the steamer kenwardine traveled by but to catch another at a port some distance off  well he said i suppose i must give in  youve got to jake rejoined and added in a meaning tone you may need a witness if youre after kenwardine and i want to be about to see fair play  then you trust the fellow yet  i dont know jake answered thoughtfully at first i thought kenwardine great and i like him now he certainly has charm and you cant believe much against him when hes with you but its somehow different at a distance still he knew nothing about the attacks on you i saw that when i told him about them  you told him dick exclaimed  i did perhaps it might have been wise  jake stopped for he heard a faint rustle as if a bush had been shaken and dick looked up the moon had not yet risen thin mist drifted out of the jungle and it was very dark there was some brush in front of the building and a belt of tall grass and reeds grew farther back without moving the upper part of his body he put his foot under the table at which they sat and kicked jakes leg  what was that about adexe he asked in a clear voice and listened hard  he heard nothing then for jake took the hint and began to talk about the coaling station but when the lad stopped there was another rustle very faint but nearer  next moment a pistol shot rang out and a puff of acrid smoke drifted into the veranda then the brushwood crackled as if a man had violently plunged through it and jake sprang to his feet  come on and bring the lamp he shouted running down the steps  dick followed but left the lamp alone he did not know who had fired the shot and it might be imprudent to make himself conspicuous jake who was a few yards in front boldly took a narrow path through the brush which rose to their shoulders the darkness was thickened by the mist but after a moment or two they heard somebody coming to meet them it could hardly be an enemy because the man wore boots and his tread was quick and firm dick noted this with some relief but thought it wise to take precautions  hold on jake he said and raised his voice whos that  payne answered the other and they waited until he came up  now said jake rather sharply what was the shooting about  there was a breed hanging round in the bushes and when he tried to creep up to the veranda i plugged him  then where is he  thats what i dont know payne answered apologetically i hit him sure but it looks as if hed got away  it looks as if youd missed where did you shoot from  payne beckoned them to follow and presently stopped beside the heap of ironwork a little to one side of the shack the lighted veranda was in full view of the spot but there was tall brushwood close by and behind this the grass  i was here payne explained heard something move once or twice and at last the fellow showed between me and the light when i saw he was making for the veranda i put up my gun knew i had the bead on him when i pulled her off  then show us where he was  payne led them forward until they reached a spot where the brush was broken and bent and jake stooping down struck a match  i guess hes right look at this he said with shrinking in his voice  the others saw a red stain on the back of his hand and crimson splashes on the grass then dick took the match and put it out  the fellow must be found ill get two or three of the boys i think we can trust and well begin the search at once  he left them and returned presently with the men and two lanterns but before they set off he asked payne could you hear what we said on the veranda  no i could tell you were talking but that was all once you kind of raised your voice and i guess the fellow in front heard something for it was then he got up and tried to crawl close in  just so dick agreed and looked at jake as one of the men lighted a lantern he was nearer us than payne i thought adexe would draw him  they searched the belt of grass and the edge of the jungle since as there were venomous snakes about it did not seem likely that the fugitive would venture far into the thick steamy gloom then they made a circuit of the camp stopping wherever a mound of rubbish offered a hidingplace but the search proved useless until they reached the head of the track then an explanation of the mans escape was supplied for the handcar which had stood there an hour ago had gone a few strokes of the crank would start it after which it would run down the incline  i guess thats how he went said payne  dick nodded the car would travel smoothly if its speed was controlled but it would make some noise and he could not remember having heard anything the peons however frequently used the car when they visited their comrades at the mixing sheds and he supposed the rattle of wheels had grown so familiar that he had not noticed it  send the boys away theres nothing more to be done he said  they turned back towards the shack and after a few minutes jake remarked it will be a relief when this business is over my nerves are getting ragged     chapter xxvii  the silver clasp   it was about eleven oclock on a hot morning and kenwardine who had adopted native customs was leisurely getting his breakfast in the patio two or three letters lay among the fruit and wine but he did not mean to open them yet he was something of a sybarite and the letters might blunt his enjoyment of the wellserved meal clare who had not eaten much sat opposite watching him his pose as he leaned back with a wineglass in his hand was negligently graceful and his white clothes drawn in at the waist by a black silk sash showed his wellknit figure there were touches of gray in his hair and wrinkles round his eyes but in spite of this he had a look of careless youth clare however thought she noticed a hint of preoccupation that she knew and disliked  presently kenwardine picked out an envelope with a british stamp from among the rest and turned it over before inserting a knife behind the flap which yielded easily as if the gum had lost its strength then he took out the letter and smiled with ironical amusement if it had been read by any unauthorized person before it reached him the reader would have been much misled but it told him what he wanted to know there was one word an englishman or american would not have used though a teuton might have done so but kenwardine thought a spaniard would not notice this even if he knew english well the other letters were not important and he glanced at his daughter  clare was not wearing well she had lost her color and got thin the climate was enervating and englishwomen who stayed in the country long felt it more than men but this did not quite account for her jaded look  i am afraid you are feeling the hot weather and perhaps you have been indoors too much he said i must try to take you about more when i come back  then you are going away where to  kenwardine would have preferred to hide his destination but since this would be difficult it seemed safer not to try and there was no reason why his household should not know  to jamaica i have some business in kingston but it wont keep me long  can you take me  i think not said kenwardine who knew his visit would be attended by some risk for one thing ill be occupied all the time and as i must get back as soon as possible may have to travel by uncomfortable boats you will be safe with lucille  oh yes clare agreed with languid resignation still i would have liked a change  kenwardine showed no sign of yielding and she said nothing more she had chosen to live with him and although she had not known all that the choice implied must obey his wishes for all that she longed to get away it had cost her more than she thought to refuse dick and she felt that something mysterious and disturbing was going on kenwardines carelessness had not deceived her she had watched him when he was off his guard and knew that he was anxious  you dont like santa brigida he suggested well if things go as i hope i may soon be able to sell out my business interests and leave the country would that please you  clares eyes sparkled with satisfaction now there was a prospect of its ending she could allow herself to admit how repugnant the life she led had grown she had hated the gambling and although this had stopped the mystery and hidden intrigue that followed it were worse if her father gave it all up they need no longer be outcasts and she could live as an english girl ought to do besides it would be easier to forget dick brandon when she went away  would we go back to england she asked eagerly  i hardly think that would be possible kenwardine replied we might however fix upon one of the quieter cities near the atlantic coast of america i know two or three that are not too big and are rather oldfashioned with something of the charm of the colonial days where i think you might find friends that would suit your fastidious taste  clare tried to look content of late she had longed for the peaceful wellordered life of the english country towns but it seemed there was some reason they could not go home  any place would be better than santa brigida she said but i must leave you to your letters i am going out to buy some things  the sun was hot when she left the patio but there was a strip of shade on one side of the street and she kept close to the wall until turning a corner she entered a blaze of light the glare from the pavement and white houses was dazzling and she stopped awkwardly just in time to avoid collision with a man he stood still and she looked down as she saw that it was dick and noted the satisfaction in his eyes  im afraid i wasnt keeping a very good lookout he said  you seemed to be in a hurry clare rejoined half hoping he would go on but as he did not she resumed however you generally give one the impression of having something important to do  dick laughed thats wrong just now because im killing time ive an hour to wait before the launch is ready to go to sea  then you are sailing somewhere along the coast said clare who moved forward and dick taking her permission for granted turned and walked by her side  yes i left jake at the mole putting provisions on board  it looks as if you would be away some time clare remarked carelessly  dick thought she was not interested and felt relieved it had been announced at the irrigation camp that he was going to coronal to engage workmen in order that the report might reach kenwardine he had now an opportunity of sending the latter misleading news but he could not make use of clare in this way  i expect so but cant tell yet when we will be back he said  well said clare i shall feel that i am left alone my father is going to kingston and doesnt know when he will return then you and mr fuller  she stopped with a touch of embarrassment wondering whether she had said too much but dick looked at her gravely  then you will miss us  yes she admitted with a blush i suppose i shall in a sense after all i really know nobody in santa brigida that is nobody i like of course we havent seen either of you often but then  you liked to feel we were within call if we were wanted well i wish i could put off our trip but im afraid its impossible now  that would be absurd clare answered smiling and they went on in silence for the next few minutes  she felt that she had shown her feelings with raw candor and the worst was that dick was right though he thought she had robbed him and was somehow her fathers enemy she did like to know he was near then there had been something curious in his tone and he had asked her nothing about her fathers voyage indeed it looked as if he meant to avoid the subject although politeness demanded some remark  i am going shopping at the almacen morales she said by and by giving him an excuse to leave her if he wished  then if you dont mind ill come too it will be out of this blazing sun and there are a few things jake told me to get  it was a relief to enter the big cool general store but when clare went to the drygoods counter dick turned aside to make his purchases after this he strolled about examining specimens of native featherwork and was presently seized by an inspiration as he stopped beside some spanish lace clare ought to wear fine lace the intricate gauzy web would harmonize with her delicate beauty but the trouble was that he was no judge of the material a little farther on a case of silver filigree caught his eye and he turned over some of the articles this was work he knew more about and it was almost as light and fine as the lace the design was good and marked by a fantastic eastern grace for it had come from the canaries and the moors had taught the spaniards how to make it long ago after some deliberation dick chose a beltclasp in a box by itself and the girl who had been waiting on him called a clerk  you have a good eye se√±or the man remarked the clasp was meant for a sample and not for sale  making things is my business and i know when theyre made well dick answered modestly anyhow i want the clasp  the clerk said they would let him have it because he sometimes bought supplies for the camp and dick put the case in his pocket then he waited until clare was ready and left the store with her he had bought the clasp on an impulse but now feared that she might not accept his gift after a time he took it out  this caught my eye and i thought you might wear it he said with diffidence  clare took the open case for at first the beauty of the pattern seized her attention then she hesitated and turned to him with some color in her face  it is very pretty but why do you want to give it to me  to begin with the thing has an airy lightness that ought to suit you then you took care of me and we were very good friends when i was ill id like to feel id given you something that might remind you of this besides you see im going away  but you are coming back  yes but things might happen in the meantime  what kind of things clare asked in vague alarm  i dont know dick said awkwardly still disturbing things do happen anyhow wont you take the clasp  clare stood irresolute with the case in her hand it was strange and to some extent embarrassing that dick should insist upon making her the present he had humiliated her and it was impossible that she could marry him but there was an appeal in his eyes that was hard to deny besides the clasp was beautiful and he had shown nice taste in choosing it for her  very well she said gently i will keep it and wear it now and then  dick made a sign of gratitude and they went on but clare stopped at the next corner and held out her hand  i must not take you any farther she said firmly i wish you a good voyage  she went into a shop and dick turned back to the harbor where he boarded the launch the boat was loaded deep with coal the fireman was busy and soon after the provisions dick had bought arrived steam was up he took the helm the engine began to throb and they glided through the cool shadow along the mole when they met the smooth swell at the harbor mouth the sea blazed with reflected light and dick was glad to fix his eyes upon the little compass in the shade of the awning astern the boat lurched away across the long undulations with the foam curling up about her bow and rising aft in a white following wave  i thought of leaving the last few bags of coal jake remarked theres not much life in her and we take some chances of being washed off if she meets a breaking sea  its a long run and well soon burn down the coal particularly as well have to drive her hard to catch the danish boat dick replied if we can do that well get kenwardines steamer at her last port of call its lucky she isnt going direct to kingston  you have cut things rather fine but i suppose you worked it out from the sailing lists the worst is that following the coast like this takes us off our course  dick nodded after making some calculations with don sebastians help he had found it would be possible to catch a small danish steamer that would take them to a port at which kenwardines boat would arrive shortly afterwards but since it had been given out that he was going to coronal he must keep near the coast until he passed adexe this was necessary because kenwardine would not risk a visit to jamaica which was british territory if he thought he was being followed  well make it all right if the weather keeps fine he answered  they passed adexe in the afternoon and boldly turned seawards across a wide bay at sunset the coast showed faintly in the distance obscured by the evening mist and the land breeze began to blow it was hot and filled with strange sour and spicy smells and stirred the sea into short white ripples that rapidly got larger they washed across the boats halfimmersed stern and now and then splashed on board at her waist but dick kept the engine going full speed and sat at the tiller with his eyes fixed upon the compass it was not easy to steer by because the lurching boat was short and the card span in erratic jerks when she began to yaw about swerving off her course as she rose with the seas  the night got very dark for the landbreeze brought off a haze but the engine lamp and glow from the furnace door threw an elusive glimmer about the craft white seacrests chased and caught her up and rolling forward broke between the funnel and the bows water splashed on board the engine hissed as the spray fell on it and the floorings got wet one could see the foam on deck wash about the headledge forward as the bows went up with a sluggishness that was the consequence of carrying an extra load of coal  the fireman could not steer by compass and after a time jake took the helm from his tired companion dick lay down under the side deck from which showers of brine poured close beside his head but did not go to sleep he was thinking of clare and what he must do when he met her father it was important that they should catch kenwardines boat since he must not be allowed to land and finish his business before they arrived in the meanwhile he listened to the measured clank of the engine which quickened when the top blade of the screw swung out so long as she did not lift the others she would travel well but by and by he heard a splash in the crankpit and called to the fireman who started the pump  day broke in a blaze of fiery splendor and the dripping launch dried the coast was near the sea got smooth and the tired men were glad of the heat of the red sun by and by the breeze died away and the long swell heaved in a glassy calm glittering with silver and vivid blue when their clothes were dry they loosed and spread the awning and a pungent smell of olive oil and coffee floated about the boat as the fireman cooked breakfast after they had eaten dick moved a bag or two of coal to trim the craft and sounded the tank because a highpressure engine uses a large quantity of fresh water then he unrolled a chart and measured the distance to their port while jake looked over his shoulder  we ought to be in time he said the advertisement merely stated that the boat would sail today but as she didnt leave the last port until yesterday and shed have some cargo to ship its unlikely that shell clear before noon  it might have been safer to telegraph booking two berths these little boats dont often miss a chance of picking up a few dollars and the skipper would have waited  i thought about that but the telegram would have shown what we were after if kenwardine has bribed somebody in the office which is possible  you seem convinced he has had an important part in these attacks on merchant ships jake said thoughtfully  its hard to doubt  the mans by way of being a friend of mine and took you into his house when you were in some danger of bleeding to death im not sure that hes guilty and now ive come with you am going to see he gets fair play but if you can prove your charge you may do what you like with him i think well let it go at that  dick nodded in the first place we must make our port and its lucky well have smooth water until the sea breeze gets up  telling the fireman he could go to sleep he moved about the engine with an oilcan and afterwards cleaned the fire then he lay on the counter with his hand on the helm while the launch sped across the glassy sea leaving a long wake astern the high coast ahead got clearer but after a time darkblue lines began to streak the glistening water and puffs of wind fanned the mens faces the puffs were gratefully fresh and the heat felt intolerable when they passed but by and by they settled into a steady draught and the dark lines joined until the sea was all a glowing ultramarine then small ripples splashed about the launch and dick glanced ahead  shes steaming well he said as he listened to the steady snort of the exhaust and humming of the cranks its lucky because theres some weight in the wind  some hours later when the sea was flecked with white they closed with a strip of graygreen forest that seemed to run out into the water the launch rolled and lurched as the foamtipped combers hove her up and the awning flapped savagely in the whistling breeze away on the horizon there was a dingy trail of smoke presently jake stood up on deck and watched the masts that rose above the fringe of trees  theres a blacktop funnel like the danish boats and a flag with red and white on it but its hanging limp they dont feel the breeze inside  he jumped down as dick changed his course and they passed a spit of surfwashed sand rounded the last clump of trees and opened up the harbor mouth the sunshine fell upon a glaring white and yellow town and oily water glittered between the wharf and the dark hulls of anchored vessels but dick suddenly set his lips he knew the danish boat and she was not there  shes gone said jake with a hint of relief in his voice that was her smoke on the skyline     chapter xxviii  rough water   as soon as they entered port dick and jake went to the office of a spanish shipbroker who offered them his polite sympathy  we had very little cargo here and when he heard there was some dyewood at san ignacio the captain steamed off again he explained  what sort of a port is san ignacio and how far is it dick asked  it is an aldea on the shore of a lagoon with a wharf that small boats can reach about forty miles from here  then they take the dyewood off in boats if there is much of the stuff it would be a long job  that is so se√±or the boats can only reach the wharf when the tide is high at other times the cargo must be carried down through the mud  have you a large chart of this coast  the broker brought a chart and dick studied it for some minutes making notes in his pocketbook then he looked up  where can i get fresh water  the broker asked how much he wanted and after taking some paper money gave him a ticket  there is a pipe on the wharf and when the peon sees the receipt he will fill your tanks  dick thanked him and going out with jake found their fireman asleep in a wineshop they had some trouble in wakening the man and after sending him off to get the water ordered some wine the room was dirty and filled with flies but the lattice shutters kept out the heat and they found the shadow pleasant after the glare outside jake dropped into a cane chair with a sigh of content he felt cramped and stiff after the long journey in the narrow cockpit of the plunging launch and was sensible of an enjoyable lassitude it would be delightful to lounge about in the shade after refreshing himself with two or three cool drinks but he had misgivings that this was not what dick meant to do when he had drained a large glass of light sweet wine he felt peacefully at ease and resting his head on the chairback closed his eyes after this he was conscious of nothing until dick said its not worth while to go to sleep  not worth while jake grumbled drowsily i was awake all last night its quiet and cool here and i cant stand for being broiled outside  im afraid youll have to we start as soon as maccario has filled the tank  jake roused himself with a jerk dick leaned forward wearily with his elbow on the table but he looked resolute  then you havent let up yet youre going on to the lagoon  certainly said dick the danish boat has an hours start but she only steams eight or nine knots and it will take some time to load her cargo  but we cant drive the launch hard the breeze is knocking up the sea  well try dick answered and jake growled in protest his dream of rest and sleep and perhaps some mildly exciting adventure when the citizens came out in the cool of the evening had been rudely banished moreover he had had another reason for being philosophical when he thought his comrade baulked  its a fool trick she wont make it if the sea gets bad  dick smiled dryly we can turn back if we find her getting swamped it looks as if you were not very anxious to overtake kenwardine  im not jake admitted if youre determined to go im coming but id be glad of a good excuse for letting the matter drop  somewhat to his surprise dick gave him a sympathetic nod i know ive felt like that but the thing cant be dropped its a hateful job but it must be finished now  very well jake answered getting up if we must go the sooner we start the better  the launch looked very small and dirty when they looked down on her from the wharf and jake noted how the surf broke upon the end of the sheltering point its deep throbbing roar warned him what they might expect when they reached open water but he went down the steps and helped dick to tighten some bearing brasses after which a peon threw down their ropes and the screw began to rattle with a few puffs of steam from her funnel the launch moved away and presently met the broken swell at the harbor mouth then her easy motion changed to a drunken lurch and jake gazed with misgivings at the whitetopped seas ahead  she went through the first combers crest with her forefoot in the air and the foam washing deep along the tilted deck while the counter vanished in a white upheaval then it swung up in turn and frames and planking shook as the engine ran away this happened at short intervals as she fought her way to windward in erratic jerks while showers of spray and cinders blew aft into the face of her crew  dick drove her out until the sea got longer and more regular when he turned and followed the coast but the flashing blue and white rollers were now on her beam and flung her to lee as they passed sometimes one washed across her low counter and sometimes her forward half was buried in a tumultuous rush of foam the pump was soon started and they kept it going but the water gathered in the crankpit where it was churned into lather and jake and maccario relieved each other at helping the pump with a bucket they were drenched and half blinded by the spray but it was obvious that their labor was needed and they persevered  stopping for breath now and then with his back to the wind jake glanced at the coast as the boat swung up with a sea it made a hazy blur against the brilliant sky but his eyes were smarting and dazzled there was a confusing glitter all around him and even the blue hollows they plunged into were filled with a luminous glow still he thought they made progress though the launch was drifting to leeward fast and he told dick who headed her out a point or two  this is not the usual sea breeze its blowing really fresh he said do you think it will drop at sundown  im not sure dick replied shading his eyes as he glanced at the windward horizon  then suppose it doesnt drop  if the sea gets dangerous well put the helm up and run for shelter  where do you expect to find it  i dont know dick admitted there are reefs and shoals along the coast that we might get in behind  jake laughed well i guess this is a pretty rash adventure you wont turn back while you can see and there are safer things than running for a shoal you dont know in the dark however theres a point one might get a bearing from abeam and ill try to fix our position it might be useful later  stooping beside the compass he gazed at the hazy land across its card and then crept under the narrow foredeck with a chart he felt the bows sweep upwards pause for a moment and suddenly lurch down but now the sea was long and regular the motion was rhythmic besides the thud and gurgle of water outside the boats thin planks were soothing and harmonized with the measured beat of the screw jake got drowsy and although he had meant to take another bearing when he thought he could double the angle presently fell asleep  it was getting dark when he awoke and crept into the cockpit there was a change in the motion for the launch did not roll so much and the combers no longer broke in showers of spray against her side she swung up with a swift but easy lift the foam boiling high about her rail and then gently slid down into the trough it was plain that she was running before the wind but jake felt that he must pull himself together when he looked aft for there is something strangely daunting in a big following sea a high whitetopped ridge rolled up behind the craft roaring as it chased her while a stream of spray blew from its curling crest it hid the rollers that came behind there was nothing to be seen but a hill of water and jake found it a relief to fix his eyes ahead the backs of the seas were smoother and less disturbing to watch as they faded into the gathering dark when the comber passed he turned to dick who stood alert and highly strung at the helm  youre heading for the land he said what are you steering by  i got the bearing of a point i thought i recognized on the chart before i lost sight of the coast theres a long reef outshore of it with a break near the point if we can get through we might find shelter  suppose theres something wrong with your bearing or you cant make good your course  then therell be trouble dick answered grimly well have the reef to lee and she wont steam out again  jake put a kettle on the cylindertop and took some provisions from a locker he was hungry and thought he might need all the strength he had while he did not want to look at the sea the pump was clanking hard but he could hear the water wash about under the floorings and the launch was very wet darkness fell as he prepared a meal with the firemans help and they ate by the dim light of the enginelamp while dick to whom they handed portions crouched at the helm gazing close into the illuminated compass sometimes he missed the food they held out and it dropped and was washed into the pumpwell but he ate what he could without moving his eyes  since he must find the opening in the reef much depended on his steering an accurate course but this was difficult because he had to bear away before the largest combers moreover the erratic motion of a short boat in broken water keeps the compasscard rocking to and fro and long practise is needed to hit the mean of its oscillations as a matter of fact dick knew he was leaving much to luck  after a time they heard a hoarse roar since the sound would not carry far to windward they knew the reef was close ahead but where the opening lay was another matter dick had no guide except the compass and as the launch would probably swamp if he tried to bring her round head to sea he must run on and take the risk by and by jake straining his eyes to pierce the gloom called out as he saw a ghostly white glimmer to starboard this was the surf spouting on the reef and if it marked the edge of the channel they would be safe in going to port if not the launch would very shortly be hurled upon the barrier  dick stood up and gazed ahead the white patch was getting plainer but he could see nothing else there was however a difference in the motion and the sea was confused he ordered the engine to be slowed and they ran on until the belt of foam bore abeam they must be almost upon the reef now or else in the channel and for the next minute or two nobody spoke if they had missed the gap the first warning would be a shock and then the combers that rolled up behind them would destroy the stranded craft  she did not strike the surf was level with her quarter and jake thrusting down a long boathook found no bottom in another minute or two the water suddenly got smooth and he threw down the boathook  were through he said in a strained voice the reefs astern  try the handlead dick ordered him as he changed his course since he was apparently heading for the beach  jake got four fathoms and soon afterwards eighteen feet when dick stopped the engine and the launch rolled upon the broken swell a dark streak that looked like forest indicated the land and a line of foam that glimmered with phosphorescent light ran outshore of them now they were to lee of the reef the hoarse clamor of the surf rang about the boat unfolding the chart they studied it by the enginelamp it was on too small a scale to give many details but they saw that the reef ran roughly level with the coast and ended in a nest of shoals near a point  we could ride out a gale here jake remarked  we could if we wanted dick replied  jake looked at him rather hard and then made a sign of resignation well i guess ive had enough but if youre going on how do you reckon youll get through the shoals ahead  i imagine some of them are mangrove islands and if so therell be a channel of a sort between them in fact the chart the broker showed me indicated something of the kind with good luck we may find it  very well said jake im glad to think it will be a soft bottom if we run aground  they went on keeping so far as they could judge midway between reef and beach but after a time the lead showed shoaling water and jake used the boathook instead then the sky cleared and a halfmoon came out and they saw haze and the loom of trees outshore of them slowing the engine they moved on cautiously while the water gradually got shallower until glistening banks of mud began to break the surface then they stopped the engine but found the launch still moved forward  i imagine its about four hours flood dick remarked that means the water will rise for some time yet and although the currents with us now i think we cant be far off the meeting of the tides  jake nodded in places of the kind the stream often runs in from both ends until it joins and flows in one direction from the shoalest spot  then we ought to find a channel leading out on the other side  they let the engine run for a few minutes until the boat touched bottom and stuck fast in the mud the wind seemed to be falling and the roar of the surf had got fainter thin haze dimmed the moonlight and there were strange splashings in the water that gently lapped about the belts of mud the stream stopped running but seeing no passage they waited and smoked  if we can get out on the other side we oughtnt to be very far from the lagoon jake suggested  presently there was a faint rippling against the bows and the launch began to swing round  the tides coming through from the other end said dick we may find a channel if we can push her across the mud  for half an hour they laboriously poled her with a long oar and the boathook between the banks of mire sometimes she touched and stuck until the rising water floated her off and sometimes she scraped along the bottom but still made progress they were breathless and soaked with perspiration while the foul scum that ran off the oar stained their damp clothes then jakes boathook sank a foot or two deeper and finding the depth as good after a few vigorous pushes they started the engine  sour exhalations rose from the wake of the churning screw and there was a curious dragging feel in the boats motion as if she were pulling a body of water after her but this was less marked when jake found three or four feet and by and by he threw down the pole and they went halfspeed ahead after a time the mangroves outshore got farther off the air smelt fresher and small ripples broke the surface of the widening channel they went fullspeed the trees faded and a swell that set her rocking met the boat although there still seemed to be a barrier of sand or mud between her and open sea  giving jake the helm dick crawled under the foredeck where the floorings were drier than anywhere else and lay smoking and thinking until day broke the light which grew brighter rapidly showed a glistening line of surf to seaward and mangrove forest on a point ahead beyond this there seemed to be an inlet and then the shore curved out again as they passed the point dick stood up on deck and presently saw two tall spars rise above the mist a few minutes later the top of a funnel appeared and then a sharp metallic rattle rang through the haze  were in the lagoon he said thats the danish boat and she hasnt finished heaving cargo on board     chapter xxix  kenwardine takes a risk   shortly after the launch entered the lagoon the danish boat hove her anchor and steamed out to sea dick who had engaged a halfbreed pilot to take the launch home lounged in a canvas chair under the poop awning his eyes were half closed for the white boats and deckhouses flashed dazzlingly in the strong light as the steamer lurched across the vivid swell of the caribbean the cigarette he languidly held had gone out and his pose was slack  he was physically tired and his brain was dull but he was conscious of lethargic satisfaction for a long time he had been torn between his love for clare and his duty to his country his difficulties were further complicated by doubts of kenwardines guilt but recent events had cleared these up it was on the whole a relief to feel that he must now go forward and there need be no more hesitation and balancing of probabilities the time for that had gone and his course was plain he must confront kenwardine with a concise statement of his share in the plot and force from him an undertaking that he would abandon his traitorous work  this might be difficult but dick did not think he would fail don sebastian who perhaps knew more than he did was to meet him at a cuban port and the spaniard could be trusted to handle the matter with skill there was no direct communication between santa brigida and kingston but steamers touched at the latter place when making a round of other ports which would enable dick and his ally to join kenwardines boat at her last call if either of them had gone on board at santa brigida kenwardine would have left the ship at the next port  since he had sailed on an english steamer bound for british territory he would be subject to british law when they met and they could if needful have him arrested dick admitted that this ought to be done to begin with but had not decided about it yet he would wait and be guided by events the british officials might doubt his story and decline to interfere but kenwardine could not count on that because don sebastian was armed with credentials from the president of a friendly state  dick however dismissed the matter he was tired in mind and body and did not mean to think of anything important until he met kenwardine by and by his head grew heavy and resting it on the back of his chair he closed his eyes when jake came up followed by a steward carrying two tall glasses of frothing liquor he saw that his comrade was fast asleep  you can put them down he told the steward im thirsty enough to empty both but you can bring some more along when my partner wakes  after this he took a black seaman who was making some noise as he swept the poop by the arm and firmly led him to the other side of the deck then he drained the glasses with a sigh of satisfaction and lighting a cigarette sat down near dicks feet he did not mean to sleep but when he got up with a jerk as the lunch bell rang he saw dick smiling  have i been sitting there all this time he asked  no said dick you were lying flat on deck when i woke up an hour ago then he indicated the two glasses which had rolled into the scupper channel i shouldnt be surprised if those accounted for it  perhaps they did jake owned grinning anyhow well have some more with a lump of ice in it before we go down to lunch  the danish boat met fine weather as she leisurely made her way across the caribbean and after an uneventful voyage dick and jake landed at a port in cuba the british steamer from santa brigida had not arrived but the agent expected her in the evening and they found don sebastian waiting them at a hotel he had named when it was getting dark they walked to the end of the harbor mole and sat down to watch for the vessel  rows of the lights began to twinkle one behind the other at the head of the bay and music drifted across the water a bright glow marked the plaza where a band was playing but the harbor was dark except for the glimmer of anchorlights on the oily swell the occasional rattle of a winch jarring harshly on the music told that the danish boat was working cargo a faint warm breeze blew off the land and there was a flicker of green and blue phosphorescence as the sea washed about the end of the mole  i wonder how youll feel if kenwardine doesnt come jake said presently looking at dick who did not answer  he will come don sebastian rejoined with quiet confidence  well i guess he must know hes doing a dangerous thing  se√±or kenwardine does know but he plays for high stakes and takes the risks of the game if it had not been necessary he would not have ventured on british soil but since he was forced to go he thought the boldest plan the safest this is what one would expect because the man is brave he could not tell how far my suspicions went and how much se√±or brandon knew but saw that he was watched and if he tried to hide his movements he would betray himself it was wiser to act as if he had nothing to fear  as he was forced to go his business must be important dick said thoughtfully this means he must be dealt with before he lands at kingston if we allowed him to meet his confederates there the mischief would be done and it might be too late afterwards to stop them carrying out their plans  don sebastian gave him a quiet smile one might learn who his confederates are if he met them it looks as if you would sooner deal with our friend on board  i would dick said steadily his plotting must be stopped but im inclined to think id be content with that  and you the spaniard asked turning to jake  i dont know that kenwardine is in the worst of the plot he was a friend of mine and its your business to prove him guilty i mean to reserve my opinion until you make your charges good  very well said don sebastian well be guided by what happens when we see him  they let the matter drop and half an hour later a white light and a green light crept out of the dark to seawards and a faint throbbing grew into the measured beat of a steamers screw then a low shadowy hull outlined by a glimmer of phosphorescence came on towards the harbor mouth and a rocket swept up in a fiery curve and burst dropping colored lights a harsh rattle of running chain broke out the screw splashed noisily for a few moments and stopped and a launch came swiftly down the harbor  the port doctor said dick theres some cargo ready and she wont sail for three or four hours we had better wait until near the last moment before we go on board if our man saw us hed take alarm and land  don sebastian agreed and they went back to the hotel and stayed there until word was sent that the last boat was ready to leave the mole they took their places with one or two more passengers and as they drew near the steamer dick looked carefully about several shore boats were hanging on to the warp alongside and a cargo barge lay beside her quarter it was obvious that she would not sail immediately and if kenwardine saw them come on board he would have no trouble in leaving the vessel if he landed he would be in neutral territory and their hold on him would be gone to make things worse a big electric lamp had been hung over the gangway so as to light the ladder  dick could not see kenwardine among the passengers on deck and getting on board as quietly as possible they went down the nearest companion stairs and along an alleyway to the pursers office a number of rooms opened on to the passage and dick had an uncomfortable feeling that chance might bring him face to face with kenwardine nobody met them however and they found the purser disengaged  if you have a passenger list handy you might let me see it dick said as he took the tickets  the purser gave him a list and he noted kenwardines name near the bottom  we may as well be comfortable although were not going far he resumed what berths have you left  you can pick your place said the purser we havent many passengers this trip and theres nobody on the starboard alleyway however if you want a hot bath in the morning you had better sleep to port theyve broken a pipe on the other side  a bath is a luxury in the caribbean but white men who have lived any time in the tropics prefer it warm and dick saw why the passengers had chosen the port alleyway he decided to take the other since kenwardine would then be on the opposite side of the ship  well have the starboard rooms he said one can go without a bath for once and youll no doubt reach kingston tomorrow night  i expect so agreed the purser still we maynt be allowed to steam in until the next morning theyre taking rather troublesome precautions in the british ports since the commerceraider got to work  dick signed to the others and crossed the after well towards the poop in a curiously grim mood he hated the subterfuge he had practised and there was something very repugnant in this stealthy tracking down of his man but the chase was nearly over and he meant to finish it defenseless merchant seamen could not be allowed to suffer for his squeamishness  don sebastian and i will wait in the secondclass smokingroom until she starts he said to jake i want you to lounge about the poop deck and watch the gangway let us know at once if you see kenwardine and it looks as if he means to go ashore  he disappeared with his companion and jake went up a ladder and sat down on the poop where he was some distance from the saloon passengers kenwardine was less likely to be alarmed at seeing him but he did not like his part the man had welcomed him to his house and although he had lost some money there jake did not believe his host had meant to plunder him after all dick and don sebastian might be mistaken and he felt mean as he watched the gangway a hint from him would enable kenwardine to escape and it was galling to feel that it must not be given indeed as time went on jake began to wish that kenwardine would learn that they were on board and take alarm he was not sure he would warn dick if the fellow tried to steal away  in the meanwhile the pumps on board a waterboat had stopped clanking and she was towed towards the harbor the steamers winches rattled as they hove up cargo from the barge but jake had seen that there was not much left and she would sail as soon as the last load was hoisted in lighting a cigarette he ran his eye along the saloondeck a few passengers in white clothes walked up and down and he studied their faces as they passed the lights but kenwardine was not among them a group leaned upon the rails in the shadow of a boat and jake felt angry because he could not see them well the suspense was getting keen and he wished kenwardine would steal down the ladder and jump into a boat before he could give the alarm  there was however no suspicious movement on the saloondeck and jake walking to the rail saw the peons putting the last of the barges cargo into the sling it came up with a rattle of chain and the barge sheered off somebody gave an order and there was a bustle on deck in another few minutes kenwardines last chance of escape would be gone because a british ship is british territory and her captain can enforce his countrys laws  jake threw away his cigarette and took out another when the whistle blew and the windlass began to clank although the anchor was coming up two boats hung on to the foot of the ladder and he could not be expected to see what was going on while he lighted his cigarette kenwardine was clever and might have waited until the last moment before making his escape with the object of leaving his pursuers on board but if he did not go now it would be too late the clank of the windlass stopped and jake dropping the match when the flame touched his fingers looked up a group of dark figures were busy on the forecastle and he saw the captain on the bridge  all clear forward sir a hoarse voice cried and somebody shouted cast off the boats  then there was a rattle of blocks as the ladder was hoisted in and the deck quivered as the engines began to throb jake heard the screw slowly flounder round and the wash beneath the poop as the steamer moved out to sea but there was nobody except their colored crews on board the boats that dropped astern kenwardine had had his chance and lost it he had been too bold and now must confront his enemies  jake went down the ladder and found dick waiting at the door of the secondclass saloon  hes on board he said im sorry he is in fact im not sure id have told you if hed tried to light out at the last moment  dick gave him a dry smile i suspect that don sebastian didnt trust you altogether he left me and i shouldnt be surprised to learn that he had found a place where he could watch the gangway without being seen  a few minutes later the spaniard crossed the after well now he said we must decide when we ought to have our interview with se√±or kenwardine and i think we should put it off until just before we land  why jake asked it would be much pleasanter to get it over and have done with it  i think not don sebastian answered quietly we do not know how se√±or kenwardine will meet the situation he is a bold man and it is possible that he will defy us  how can he defy you when he knows you can hand him over to the british authorities  that might be necessary but i am not sure it is the british authorities he fears the most  then who is he afraid of  his employers i imagine don sebastian answered with a curious smile it is understood that they trust nobody and are not very gentle to those who do not serve them well se√±or kenwardine knows enough about their plans to be dangerous and it looks as if he might fail to carry their orders out if we give him too long a warning he may escape us after all  i dont see how he could escape you have him corralled when hes under the british flag  don sebastian shrugged as he indicated the steamers low iron rail and the glimmer of foam in the dark below  there is one way if he takes it we shall learn no more than we know now  he left them and jake looked at dick its unthinkable i cant stand for it  no said dick very quietly he mustnt be pushed too far for all that his friends cant be allowed to go on sinking british ships     chapter xxx  the last encounter   dick awoke next morning with a feeling of nervous strain that got worse as the day wore on by going down to the saloon immediately the breakfastbell rang and making a hurried meal he and his companions avoided meeting kenwardine and after bribing a steward were given lunch with the secondclass passengers two difficulties were thus got over but the time passed heavily while they kept out of sight in quiet corners of the after well and dick found it a relief when a friendly engineer invited him below here he spent some hours smoking and watching the machinery while the fingers of the clock on the bulkhead crawled with painful slowness round the dial  when he went up on deck the bold ridge of the blue mountains rose above the dazzling sea but the lower slopes were veiled in haze and he could not tell how far the land was off a mate informed him that they would have the coast close aboard at dusk but did not think anybody would be allowed to land until the morning struck by a thought dick asked if any passenger boats were likely to be in port and the mate replied that a spanish liner would leave for brazil soon after they arrived but he knew of no vessel going north for the next few days then after giving dick some advice about the choice of a hotel he went away  towards sunset the seabreeze dropped and the mist gathered thicker about the hills faint puffs of hot wind began to blow off the land which faded suddenly as darkness rolled down a thin haze drifted out across the water and the speed slackened as the vessel closed with the shore then dim lights blinked out ahead the engines stopped and a detonating rocket burst high up in the sky soon afterwards a steam launch came off and the purser stopped near dick on his way to his room  we are going in but will have to wait until the agent gets formal permission from the guardships commander who must see our papers first he said as this may take some time perhaps you had better dine on board  when the bell rang dick and his companions went to the saloon there were not many passengers and the room was nearly empty but as they entered dick saw kenwardine at the bottom of a table he glanced up as he heard their footsteps and with an abrupt movement turned his revolving chair partly round next moment however he looked at dick coolly and after a nod of recognition went on with his dinner don sebastian indicated a table between kenwardine and the door and they sat down  jake played with his food and dick had not much appetite although he partook of the dishes set before him because he wanted an excuse for occupying the table until kenwardine had finished the latter showed no anxiety to get away and now and then kept the steward waiting while he studied the menu dick who envied his coolness thought it indicated one of two things kenwardine knew he was beaten and was philosophically resigned or had some plan by which he hoped to baffle his pursuers now and then dick looked at don sebastian inquiringly but the spaniard answered with an enigmatic smile  in the meantime the passengers went away to pack or get ready for a run ashore and at last the saloon was empty except for dicks party and kenwardine then don sebastian crossed the floor and bowed to the latter  it would be a favor if you will take a glass of wine with us he said  certainly said kenwardine getting up and don sebastian who gave an order to a steward led the way to a corner table where they would not be disturbed  you were perhaps surprised to see us se√±or he resumed when the others joined them  i was kenwardine admitted still i suppose i ought to have been prepared for something of the kind  don sebastian bowed one may understand that as a compliment  perhaps it is in a sense but i certainly did not expect to meet mr fuller we are told that his people mean to preserve a strict neutrality  jake colored id have stood out if you had kept your dago friends off my partner thats what brought me in but im still trying to be as neutral as i can  se√±or fuller has informed us that he means to see you get fair play don sebastian interposed  well he has my thanks for that and my sympathy which i think he needs kenwardine rejoined with a twinkle theres no doubt that he owes mr brandon something and i flatter myself that he rather liked me it must have been embarrassing to find that he couldnt be friends with both however you had better tell me what you want my clothes are not packed and i must land as soon as possible because i have some business to transact tonight  i am afraid you will be unable to do so don sebastian said politely  why  the explanation is rather long but to begin with you no doubt know i was ordered to watch you  i must admit that i suspected something very like it  the president imagined you might become dangerous to the neutrality of the state and i learned enough to show that he was right  what did you learn  don sebastian smiled i will be frank and put down my cards i would not do so se√±or if i thought you could beat them  he began a concise account of the discoveries he had made showing kenwardines association with the german richter and giving particulars about the purchase of the adexe coaling wharf jake leaned forward with his elbows on the table listening eagerly while dick sat motionless part of what he heard was new to him but the spaniards statements could not be doubted and he envied kenwardines nerve the latters face was for the most part inscrutable but now and then he made a sign of languid agreement as if to admit that his antagonist had scored a point  well he said when the other finished it is a story that might do me harm and there are parts i cannot deny but it is not complete one finds awkward breaks in it for example you do not show how the raider got coal and information from the adexe company  i think se√±or brandon can do so said don sebastian who turned to dick  taking his cue from the spaniard dick related what he had noted at the coaling wharf and learned about the movements of the tug when the auxiliary cruiser was in the neighborhood his account to some extent filled the gaps that don sebastians narrative had left but now he came to put the different points together and consider them as a whole their significance seemed less he began to see how a hostile critic would look at the thing much of his evidence was based upon conjecture that might be denied yet while it was not convincing it carried weight  there was a pause when he finished and jake was conscious of a strong revulsion of feeling as he studied his companions in a way the thin darkfaced spaniard and tranquil englishman were alike both wore the stamp of breeding and were generally marked by an easy good humor and polished wit that won mens confidence and made them pleasant companions but this was on the surface beneath lay a character as hard and cold as a diamond they were cunning unscrupulous intriguers who would stick at nothing that promised to serve their ends jake knew kenwardine now and felt angry as he remembered the infatuation that had prevented his understanding the man  then he glanced at dick who sat waiting with a quietly resolute look dick was different from the others he rang true one could not doubt his rather na√Øve honesty but in spite of this there was something about him that made him a match for his scheming opponent kenwardine of course had courage but dick was armed with a stern tenacity that made him careless of the hurt he received now though he had nothing to gain and much to lose he would hold on because duty demanded it the contrast between them threw a lurid light upon kenwardines treachery  then the latter said you have stated things clearly brandon but after all what you offer is rather plausible argument than proof in fact you must see that your evidence isnt strong enough  its enough to justify our handing you to the military officers in kingston who would no doubt detain you while they made inquiries  which you dont want to do  no said dick shortly but i may be forced  very well this brings us back to the point we started from kenwardine replied and turned to don sebastian what is it you want  to know where richter is and who supplied him with the money he paid for the coaling business  then im sorry i cannot tell you and you certainly wouldnt get the information by having me locked up but perhaps i can meet you in another way now its obvious that you know enough to make it awkward for me to carry on the adexe wharf and my help is necessary for the part of the business you object to if i retire from it altogether you ought to be satisfied  the spaniard did not answer and while he pondered the beat of a launchs engine came in through the open ports kenwardine lighted a cigarette spending some time over it and as he finished the launch ran alongside there were footsteps on deck and a few moments later a steward entered the saloon  we are going in he announced will you have your luggage put on deck  you can take ours up said don sebastian who indicated kenwardine leave this gentlemans for the present  kenwardine did not object but jake who was watching him thought he saw for the first time a hint of uneasiness in his look then don sebastian got up  i must think over se√±or kenwardines suggestion and you may want to talk to him he said and went out  when he had gone kenwardine turned to dick theres a matter i would like to clear up i had nothing to do with the attempts that seem to have been made upon your life in fact i suspected nothing of the kind until you told me about the accident at the dam but fuller afterwards showed me that it was time to interfere  thats true said jake anyhow i gave him a plain hint but as he didnt seem able to stop the accidents i put don sebastian on the track  you cant with any fairness make me accountable for the actions of halfbreeds who hold life very cheap and meant to keep a paying job kenwardine resumed addressing dick you knew what kind of men you had to deal with and took the risk  its hard to see how a white man could make use of such poisonous colored trash jake remarked but i expect you dont want me and ill see what don sebastian is doing  he left them and there was silence for a few moments until the screw began to throb and they heard the wash of water along the steamers side then kenwardine said quietly fuller has tact theres a matter that concerns us both that has not been mentioned yet ill clear the ground by stating that although our spanish friend has not decided what he means to do i shall not go back to santa brigida i imagine this will remove an obstacle from your way  thanks for the lead dick answered i resolved some time ago to marry clare if she would have me though i saw that it would mean separating her from you  and yet you believed she stole your papers  i thought she did dick answered doggedly still i didnt blame her  you blamed me but you ought to be satisfied in one respect because clare and i are separated and ill own that im anxious about her future had things gone well i would have tried to keep her away from you in fact i did try because i frankly think she might have made a better marriage for all that if you are determined and she is willing you have my consent you will probably never be very rich but i could trust clare to you  i am determined  very well i can tell you something you may be glad to hear clare did not rob you nor did i  dick looked at him with keen relief then who took the plans  your cousin the pocket they were in was unbuttoned when he took hold of you and hurried you out of the house he brought them to me afterwards but i saw they were not valuable and destroyed them  it was impossible to doubt the statement and dick flushed with shame and anger as he realized that his absurd and unjust suspicion of clare had prevented his seeing who the real culprit was clare had accidentally torn his pocket loose the bulky envelope must have been sticking out and lance had noticed it as he hustled him across the hall  yes lance took the plans he exclaimed hoarsely but why  it looks as if you hadnt heard from home your cousin has stepped into your place i imagine he had always envied it and didnt hesitate when he saw an opportunity of getting rid of you  dick was silent for a few moments and his face was very hard he heard the crew hurrying about the deck and a winch rattle as the hatches were lifted the vessel would soon be in port and kenwardines fate must be decided before they went ashore but the man looked very cool as he leaned back in his chair languidly waiting  why didnt you tell me this earlier dick asked sternly  i should have thought my object was plain enough kenwardine replied i didnt want clare to marry a badly paid engineer things are different now and i admit that you have stood a rather severe test ill give you two letters one to clare advising her to marry you and the other stating how your cousin stole the plans which you can use in any way you like before writing them id like to see fuller for a minute or two you neednt hesitate about it because i dont mean to victimize him in any way in fact i want to tell him something to his advantage  dick went out and when he had sent jake down leaned upon the steamers rail lost in thought it had been a shock to learn of his cousins treachery but this was balanced by the relief of knowing that clare was innocent indeed he grew hot with shame as he wondered how he had suspected her he felt angry with kenwardine for keeping him in the dark so long but his indignation was tempered by a touch of grim amusement since the fellow was ambitious for clare he must have regretted having destroyed the plans when he learned that dicks father was rich but after conniving at the theft he could not put matters right now when his career was ended he was willing for his daughters sake to clear dicks name and help him to regain the station he had lost but dick was not sure he wished to regain it just yet he had been turned out of the army his father who had never shown much love for him had been quick to believe the worst and he was bound for a time to a man who had befriended him  presently he looked about lights were opening out in twinkling lines as the steamer moved shoreward and a splash of oars came out of the gloom dick vacantly noted that several boats were approaching and then a winch rattled and don sebastian who had come up quietly touched his arm a chain sling swung past beneath a moving derrick and as they crossed the deck to get out of the way he saw a steamer close by her windlass was clanking as she shortened her cable and he supposed she was the spanish boat the mate had spoken of but he followed his companion and listened to what he had to say then as the anchor was let go he thought jake ought to have come back and went to look for him he found the lad leaning against the deckhouse smoking a cigarette  wheres kenwardine he asked  i left him in the saloon he gave me two letters for you and a useful hint about some debts of mine  never mind that how long is it since you left him  quite five minutes jake answered coolly  struck by something in his tone dick ran below and found no luggage in kenwardines room none of the stewards whom he asked had seen him for some time and a hasty search showed that he was not on deck dick went back to jake  do you know where the fellow is he asked sharply as don sebastian came up  if you insist i imagine hes on board the spanish boat jake answered with a chuckle as she seems to have her anchor up i guess its too late for us to interfere  a sharp rattle of chain that had rung across the water suddenly stopped and dick saw one of the steamers colored sidelights slowly move it was plain that she was going to sea  since we had been passed by the doctor there was nothing to prevent the shore boats coming alongside and i believe one or two did so before we quite stopped jake resumed they were no doubt looking for a job and the ladder was already lowered  then you knew kenwardine meant to steal away  i didnt know but thought it likely jake replied with some dryness on the whole it was perhaps the best thing he could do whats your opinion don sebastian  the spaniard smiled i think the president will be satisfied that it was the simplest way out of the difficulty  well said jake here are your letters dick perhaps we had better see about getting ashore  they moved towards the gangway past the hatch where some heavy cases were being hoisted up and dick carefully put the letters in his pocket this distracted his attention from what was going on and when he heard a warning shout he stepped back a moment too late a big case swung forward beneath a derrickboom and struck his shoulder staggering with the blow he lost his balance and plunged down the hatch he was conscious of a heavy shock a sudden stinging pain and then remembered nothing more     chapter xxxi  richters message   it was a hot evening and clare sat at a table in the patio trying to read the light was bad for buzzing insects hovered about the lamp but the house had not cooled down yet and she wanted to distract her troubled thoughts footsteps and voices rose from the street outside where the citizens were passing on their way to the plaza but the sounds were faint and muffled by the high walls the house had been built in times when women were jealously guarded and a dwelling was something of a fort now with the iron gate in the narrow arched entrance barred the girl was securely cut off from the exotic life of the city  this isolation was sometimes a comfort but it sometimes jarred clare was young and fond of cheerful society and the iron gate had its counterpart in another barrier invisible but strong that shut her out from much she would have enjoyed she often stood so to speak gazing wistfully between the bars at innocent pleasures in which she could not join kenwardine in spite of his polished manners was tactfully avoided by english and americans of the better class and their wives and daughters openly showed their disapproval  at length clare gave up the attempt to read she felt lonely and depressed nobody had been to the house since kenwardine left and dick and jake were away she did not see dick often and he was of course nothing to her for one thing he was in some mysterious way her fathers enemy still she missed him he was honest and perhaps if things had been different  then she turned her head sharply as she heard the click of a bolt this was strange because lucille had locked the gate she could not see it in the gloom of the arch but it had certainly opened then as she waited with somewhat excited curiosity a dark figure appeared on the edge of the light and she put down her book as richter came forward he made very little noise and stopped near the table  how did you get in she asked  richter smiled you have forgotten that herr kenwardine gave me a key  i didnt know he had clare answered but wont you sit down  he moved a chair to a spot where his white clothes were less conspicuous though clare noted that he did so carelessly and not as if he wished to hide himself then he put a small linen bag on the table  this is some money that belongs to herr kenwardine you may find it useful it is not good to be without money in a foreign town  clare looked at him with alarm he was fat and generally placid but his philosophical good humor was not so marked as usual  then you have heard from my father  yes i have a cablegram it was sent in a roundabout way through other peoples hands and took some time to reach me herr kenwardine left kingston last night  but there is no boat yet  richter nodded he is not coming to santa brigida i do not think that he will come back at all  for a moment or two clare felt unnerved but she pulled herself together she realized now that she had long had a vague fear that something of this kind would happen  then where has he gone why didnt he write to me she asked  he has gone to brazil and will no doubt write when he arrives in the meantime you must wait and tell people he is away on business this is important you have some money and the house is yours for a month or two  but why has he gone will you show me the cablegram  you could not understand it and it might be better that you should not know richter answered then he paused and his manner which had been friendly and sympathetic changed his short hair seemed to bristle and his eyes sparkled under his shaggy brows as he resumed herr kenwardine was forced to go at the moment he was needed most your father fr√§ulein is a bold and clever man but he was beaten by a blundering fool we had confidence in him but the luck was with his enemies  who are his enemies  the englishman brandon is the worst richter answered with keen bitterness we knew he was against us but thought this something of a joke well it seems we were mistaken these english are obstinate often without imagination or forethought they blunder on and chance that favors simpletons is sometimes with them but remember that if your father meets with misfortunes you have brandon to thank  the color left clares face but she tried to brace herself  what misfortunes has my father to fear  richter hesitated and then said deprecatingly i cannot be as frank as i wish herr kenwardines work was most important but he failed in it i know this was not his fault and would trust him again but there are others of higher rank who may take a different view besides it will be remembered that he is an englishman if he stays in brazil i think he will be left alone but he will get no money and some he has earned will not be sent indeed if it were known fr√§ulein i might be blamed for paying you this small sum but i expect you will need it  he got up as if to go but clare stopped him  you will come back as soon as you know something more and tell me what to do  richter made an apologetic gesture that will be impossible i ran some risk in coming now and leave santa brigida tonight in a fishing boat you will stay in this house as if you expect your father back until you hear from him he will send you instructions when he lands  then the kitchen door across the patio opened and a bucket clinked richter stepped back into the shadow and clare looked round as an indistinct figure crossed the tiles when she looked back richter had gone and she heard the splash of water she sat still until the servant went away and then sank down limply in her chair she was left alone and unprotected except for old lucille in a foreign town where morals were lax and license was the rule the few english and americans whose help she might have asked regarded her with suspicion and it looked as if her father would be unable to send for her  this was daunting but it was not the worst richter had vaguely hinted at kenwardines business which was obviously mysterious she saw where his hints led but she would not follow up the clue her father had been ruined by brandon and her heart was filled with anger in which she found it some relief to indulge dick had long been their enemy and thought her a thief while the possibility that he was justified in the line he had taken made matters worse if she was the daughter of a man dishonored by some treason against his country she could not marry dick she had already refused to do so but she did not want to be logical it was simpler to hate him as the cause of her fathers downfall the latter had always indulged her and now she understood that he would land in brazil penniless or at least impoverished since he was accustomed to extravagance it was painful to think of what he might suffer  then she began to speculate about richters visit he had come at some risk and seemed sorry for her but he had urged her to stay in the house as if she expected her father to return this could be of no advantage to the latter and she wondered whether the man had meant to make use of her to divert suspicion from himself and his friends it seemed uncharitable to think so but she was very bitter and could trust nobody  after a time she got calm and remembering that she had her own situation to consider counted the money in the bag it was not a large sum but with economy might last for a few weeks after which she must make some plans she was incapable of grappling with any fresh difficulty yet but she must brace her courage and not break down and getting up with a resolute movement she went into the house  on the morning after his fall dick came to his senses in a shaded room he heard a shutter rattle as the warm breeze flowed in and noted a flickering patch of light on the wall but found with some annoyance that he could not see it well his head was throbbing and a bandage covered part of his face his side was painful too and he groaned when he tried to move  where am i he asked a strange man who appeared beside his bed and added in an injured tone it looks as if id got into trouble again  you had a narrow escape the other answered soothingly you cut your head badly and broke two of your ribs when you fell down the steamers hold now youre in hospital but youre not to talk  ill get worse if you keep me quiet dick grumbled how can you find out things that bother you unless you talk  dont bother about them said the doctor have a drink instead  dick looked at the glass with dull suspicion i dont know though im thirsty you see ive been in a doctors hands before in fact i seem to have a gift for getting hurt  its cool and tastes nice the other urged you didnt rest much last night and if you go to sleep now well try to satisfy your curiosity afterwards  dick hesitated but took the glass and went to sleep soon after he drained it when he awoke the light had vanished from the wall and the room was shadowy but he saw jake sitting by the bed a nurse who put a thermometer in his mouth and felt his pulse nodded to the lad as if satisfied before she went away dicks head was clearer and although the movement hurt him he resolutely fixed his uncovered eye on his companion  now he said dont tell me not to talk do you know why theyve fixed this bandage so that it half blinds me  jake looked embarrassed theres a pretty deep cut on your forehead  do you suppose i cant feel it but i want to know why theyre not satisfied with tying my forehead up you may as well tell me because im not going to sleep again it looks as if id slept all day  the cut runs through your eyelid and the doctor thinks it wiser to be careful  about my eye  its just a precaution jake declared theres really nothing the matter but he thought it would be better to keep out the strong light  ah said dick who was not deceived and was silent for the next few moments then he resumed in a rather strained voice well lets talk about something else wheres don sebastian  i havent seen him since lunch but he spent the morning interviewing the british authorities  do you think he told them to send after kenwardine  no said jake with a twinkle i rather think hes put them off the track and although he had to give them a hint out of politeness doesnt want them to know too much then theres only an oldfashioned cruiser here and i understand she has to stop for a guardship in fact don sebastian seems to imagine that kenwardine is safe so long as he keeps off british soil however an official gentleman with a refined taste in clothes and charming manners called at our hotel and is coming to see you as soon as the doctor will let him  next morning dick saw the gentleman who stated his rank and then asked a number of questions which dick did not answer clearly he was glad that his bandaged head gave him an excuse for seeming stupid he had done his part and now kenwardine could do no further harm it would be better for everybody if he got away after a time his visitor observed  well you seem to have rendered your country a service and i expect you will find things made smooth for you at home after our report upon the matter has been received  ah said dick it looks as if you knew why i left  the gentleman made a sign of assent your spanish friend was discreet but he told us something besides there are army lists and london gazettes in kingston  dick was silent for a few moments and then said as a matter of fact i am not anxious to go home just yet  are you not the other asked with a hint of polite surprise i do not think there would be much difficulty about a new commission and officers are wanted  theyre not likely to want a man with one eye and i expect it will come to that dick said grimly  his visitor was sympathetic but left soon afterwards and dick thought he was not much wiser about kenwardines escape than when he came two or three weeks later he was allowed to get up although he was tightly strapped with bandages and made to wear a shade over his eyes when he lay in the open air one morning jake joined him  we must get back to santa brigida as soon as we can he said theyre planning an extension of the irrigation scheme and the old man and ida are coming out the doctor seems to think you might go by the next boat if we take care of you but id better give you kenwardines letters we took them out of your pocket the night you got hurt and ive been wondering why you havent asked for them  thanks dick answered dully i dont know that ill use them now ill be glad to get back and dare say i can do my work with one eye  youll soon have both jake declared  its doubtful said dick i dont think the doctors very sanguine  on the whole he was relieved when jake left because he found it an effort to talk but the thoughts he afterwards indulged in were gloomy his broken ribs did not trouble him much but there was some risk of his losing his eye he had helped to expose and banish kenwardine and could not ask clare to marry him after that even if he were not half blind and disfigured besides it was doubtful if he would be able to resume his profession or do any useful work again the sight of the uninjured eye might go as a matter of fact the strain he had borne for some time had told upon his health and the shock of the accident had made things worse he had sunk into a dejected lethargic mood from which he had not the vigor to rouse himself  a week later he was helped on board a small french boat and sailed for santa brigida he did not improve with the sea air as jake had hoped and for the most part avoided the few passengers and sat alone in the darkest corner he could find now and then he moodily read kenwardines letters he had at first expected much from them they might have removed the stain upon his name and the greatest obstacle between himself and clare but he no longer cared much about the former and the letters were useless now for all that he put them carefully away in a leather case which he carried in an inside pocket     chapter xxxii  ida interferes   on his return to santa brigida dick went to see a spanish oculist who took a more hopeful view than the kingston doctor although he admitted that there was some danger of the injury proving permanent dick felt slightly comforted when he learned that the oculist was a clever man who had been well known in barcelona until he was forced to leave the city after taking part in some revolutionary plot he was however unable to resume his work and while he brooded over his misfortunes a touch of the malaria he had already suffered from hindered his recovery one of the effects of malaria is a feeling of black depression he was feebly struggling against the weakness and despondence when fuller arrived and soon afterwards came to see him dick who was sitting in the darkest corner of the veranda had got rid of his bandage but an ugly livid mark crossed his forehead to the shade above his eyes and his face looked worn fuller talked about the dam for a time and then stopped and looked hard at his silent companion  i imagined all this would interest you but you dont say much  no said dick you see its galling to listen to plans you cant take part in in fact i feel i ought to resign  why  it looks as if it may be a long time before i can get to work and i may never be of much use again  well i suppose its natural that you should feel badly humped but you dont know that youll lose your eye and if you did youd do your work all right with the other however since you started the subject ive something to say about our contract if the new scheme were negotiating goes through as i think it will ill have to increase my staff should i do so youll get a move up and of course better pay for a more important job  dick who was touched by this mark of confidence thanked him awkwardly and although he felt bound to object that he might be unable to fill the new post fuller stopped him  all you have to do is to lie off and take it easy until you get well i know a useful man when i see him and it wont pay me to let you go when ive fixed things with the president ill make you an offer now stuyvesants waiting for me and i understand my daughter is coming to see you  he went away and soon afterwards ida fuller came in dick rather awkwardly got her a chair for his shade which was closely pulled down embarrassed him but she noticed this and his clumsiness made a strong appeal she liked dick and had some ground for being grateful to him for half an hour she talked in a cheerful strain and dick did his best to respond but she saw what the effort cost and went away in a thoughtful mood  ida fuller had both sympathy and selfconfidence and when things went wrong with her friends seldom felt diffident about trying to put them right in consequence she took jake away from the others whom her father had asked to dinner that evening  whats the matter with dick brandon she asked  its pretty obvious his trouble began with broken ribs and may end with the loss of his eye but if you want a list of his symptoms  i dont said ida does his trouble end with the injury to his eye  jake gave her a sharp glance if you insist on knowing i admit that i have my doubts but you must remember that dick has a touch of malaria which makes one morbid  but this doesnt account for everything  no said jake who lighted a cigarette i dont think it does in fact as i know your capabilities and begin to see what youre getting after theres not much use in my trying to put you off the track  ida sat down in a canvas chair and pondered for a minute or two  you know miss kenwardine if i recollect you were rather enthusiastic about her what is she like  jakes eyes twinkled you meanis she good enough for dick hell be a lucky man if he gets her and i dont mind confessing that i thought of marrying her myself only she made it clear that she had no use for me she was quite right id have made a very poor match for a girl like that  ida was not deceived by his halfhumorous manner for she remarked something that it was meant to hide still jake had had numerous love affairs that seldom lasted long  have you been to see her since you came back she asked  yes said jake after helping to drive her father out of the country i knew it would be an awkward meeting but i felt i ought to go because she might be in difficulties and i went twice on the whole it was a relief when i was told she was not at home  i wonder whether she would see me  youre pretty smart but i suspect this is too delicate a matter for you to meddle with  ill be better able to judge if you tell me what you know about it  jake did so with some hesitation he knew his sisters talents and that her object was good but he shrank from betraying his comrades secrets  i think ive put you wise but i feel rather mean he concluded  what you feel is not important but you really think he hasnt sent her kenwardines letter  jake made a sign of agreement and ida resumed  the other letter stating that his cousin stole the plans is equally valuable and his making no use of it is significant your partners a white man jake but hes foolish and needs the help of a judicious friend i want both letters  ive warned you that its a dangerous game you may muss up things  then ill be responsible can you get the letters  i think so jake replied with an embarrassed grin in a way its a shabby trick but if he will keep papers in his pocket after getting one lot stolen he must take the consequences  very well said ida calmly now we had better go in before the others wonder why we left them  next morning clare sat in the patio in very low spirits no word had come from kenwardine and her money was nearly exhausted she had heard of dicks return but not that he was injured and he had kept away this was not surprising and she did not want to meet him but it was strange that he had not come to see her and make some excuse for what he had done he could of course make none that would appease her but he ought to have tried and it looked as if he did not care what she thought of his treachery  then she glanced up as ida came in clare had seen ida in the street and knew who she was but she studied her with keen curiosity as she advanced her dress was tasteful she was pretty and had a certain stamp of refinement and composure that clare knew came from social training but she felt antagonistic for all that she indicated a chair and waited until her visitor sat down then she asked with a level glance why have you come to see me  i expect you meanwhy did i come without getting your servant to announce me ida rejoined with a disarming smile well the gate was open and i wanted to see you very much but was half afraid you wouldnt let me in i owe you some apology but understand that my brother is a friend of yours  he was clare said coldly  then he has lost your friendship by taking dick brandons part  clare colored but her voice was firm as she answered  to some extent that is true mr brandon has cruelly injured us  he was forced dick brandon is not the man to shirk his duty because it was painful and clashed with his wishes  was it his duty to ruin my father  he must have thought so but we are getting on dangerous ground i dont know much about the matter do you  clare lowered her eyes since richters visit she had had disturbing doubts about the nature of kenwardines business but after a few moments she asked in a hard suspicious voice how do you know so much about mr brandon  well said ida calmly its plain that im not in love with him because if i were i should not have tried to make his peace with you as a matter of fact im going to marry somebody else before very long however now i think ive cleared away a possible mistake ill own that i like dick brandon very much and am grateful to him for the care he has taken of my brother  he stopped jake from coming here clare rejoined with a blush  that is so ida agreed he has done a number of other things that got him into difficulties because he thought it right thats the kind of man he is then i understand he was out of work and feeling desperate when my father engaged him he got promotion in his employment and i asked him to see that jake came to no harm i dont know if he kept his promise too conscientiously and you can judge better than me but i think you ought to read the letters your father gave him  she first put down kenwardines statement about the theft of the plans and clare was conscious of overwhelming relief as she read it dick knew now that she was not the thief then ida said if you will read the next you will see that your father doesnt feel much of a grievance against brandon  the note was short but kenwardine stated clearly that if clare wished to marry brandon he would be satisfied and advised her to do so the girls face flushed as she read and her hands trembled kenwardine certainly seemed to bear dick no ill will but since the latter had his formal consent why had he not used it  did mr brandon send you with these letters she asked as calmly as she could  no i brought them without telling him because it seemed the best thing to do  you knew what they said  i did ida admitted they were open  clare noted her confession but she must deal with matters of much greater importance  then do you know why he kept the letters back  ida hesitated if clare were not the girl she thought she might by appealing to her compassion supply her with a reason for giving dick up but if this happened it would be to his advantage in the end still she did not think she was mistaken and she must take the risk  yes she said i feel that you ought to understand his reasons that is really why i came it looks as if you had not heard that shortly after he met your father dick fell down the steamers hold  clare made an abrupt movement and her face got anxious was he hurt  very badly he broke two ribs and the fever he got soon afterwards stopped his getting better but that is not the worst one of his eyes was injured and there is some danger that he may lose his sight  it was plain that clare had got a shock for she sat in a tense attitude and the color left her face but ida saw that she had read her character right and taken the proper course indeed she wondered whether she had not unnecessarily harrowed the girls feelings  now she resumed you understand why dick brandon kept back the letters it is obvious that he loves you but he is disfigured and may have to give up his profession  she stopped for clares face changed and her eyes shone with a gentle light  but what does that matter she exclaimed he cant think it would daunt me  ida rose for she saw that she had said enough then perhaps you had better show him that you are not afraid if you will dine with us this evening at the dam you will see him jake will come for you and bring you back  when she left a few minutes later she had arranged for the visit and clare sat still overwhelmed with compassionate gentleness and relief her father did not blame dick and there was no reason she should harden her heart against him he knew that she was innocent but he was tied by honorable scruples well since he would not come to her she must go to him but she would do so with pride and not false shame it was clear that he loved her unselfishly by and by however she roused herself as she was going to him there were matters to think about and entering the house she spent some time studying her wardrobe and wondering what she would wear  that evening dick sat on the veranda of his shack with a shaded lamp which he had turned low on the table close by his comrades were dining at fullers tent and he had been asked but had made excuses although he was well enough to go for one thing it hurt him to sit in a strong light though the oculist whom he had seen in the morning spoke encouragingly about his eye indeed dick had begun to think that there was now no real danger of its having received a permanent injury for all that he was listless and depressed because he had not got rid of the fever and malaria is generally worse at night he had been cautioned not to read and his cigarette had a bitter taste there was nothing to do but wait until jake came home now he thought of it jake had accepted his excuses rather easily  by and by he heard the lads voice and footsteps on the path jake was returning early and there was somebody with him but dick wished they had left him alone he rose however as ida came up the steps and into the light which did not carry far dick imagined there was another person as well as jake in the shadow behind  jake brought me over to see his last sketches and im going in to criticize them she said as you couldnt come to us ive brought you a visitor whom you know  dick felt his heart beat as he saw clare she was dressed in white and the silver clasp gleamed against a lavender band at her waist it was significant that she wore it but he could not see her face clearly then ida beckoned jake  come along i want to look at the drawings  they went into the house and dick made an effort to preserve his selfcontrol clare moved into the light and he saw her color rise though her eyes were very soft  why didnt you tell me you were ill she asked with gentle reproach  he hesitated trying to strengthen his resolution which he knew was breaking down and clare resumed  besides i dont think you should have kept that letter back  dick instinctively pulled out the leather case and started as he saw there was nothing inside  its gone you have seen it he stammered  ive seen them both clare answered with a smile doesnt this remind you of something im afraid youre careless dick  the color rushed into his face if you have seen those letters you know what a suspicious fool ive been  that doesnt matter youre convinced at last clare rejoined with a hint of pride  in a sense i always was convinced if id seen you take the wretched plans i wouldnt have held you accountable because you took them it couldnt have been wrong  clare blushed but looked at him with shining eyes i wanted to hear you say it again but it wasnt that letteri mean the one about the plansthat brought me  then the last of dicks selfcontrol vanished and with a half conscious movement he held out his hands clare came forward and next moment she was in his arms  some time later he felt he must be practical and said in a deprecatory tone but you must try to understand what you are doing dear and the sacrifices you must make things arent quite as bad as they looked but i cant go home just yet and may always be a poor engineer he indicated the galvanizediron shack you will have to live in a place like this and though i think my eye will get better theres the scar on my face  clare gave him a quiet smiling glance that doesnt matter dick and i never really had a home she paused and added gently but i shall have one now
