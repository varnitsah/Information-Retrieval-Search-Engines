22206720	fifth series plays of galsworthy   windows   by john galsworthy      persons of the play    geoffrey march freelance in literature   joan march his wife   mary march their daughter   johnny march their son   cook their cook   mr bly their window cleaner   faith bly his daughter   blunter a strange young man   mr barnadas in plain clothes      the action passes in geofrey marchs house highgatespringtime    act   i  thursday morning  the diningroomafter breakfast    act  ii  thursday a fortnight later  the diningroom after lunch    act iii  the same day  the diningroomafter dinner     act i       the marchs diningroom opens through french windows on one of those      gardens which seem infinite till they are seen to be coterminous      with the side walls of the house and finite at the far end because      only the thick screen of acacias and sumachs prevents another house      from being seen  the french and other windows form practically all      the outer wall of that diningroom and between them and the screen      of trees lies the difference between the characters of mr and mrs      march with dots and dashes of mary and johnny thrown in  for      instance it has been formalised by mrs march but the grass has not      been cut by mr march and daffodils have sprung up there which mrs      march desires for the diningroom but of which mr march says for      gods sake joan let them grow  about half therefore are now in a      bowl on the breakfast table and the other half still in the grass      in the compromise essential to lasting domesticity  a hammock under      the acacias shows that mary lies there sometimes with her eyes on      the gleam of sunlight that comes through and a trail in the longish      grass bordered with cigarette ends proves that johnny tramps there      with his eyes on the ground or the stars according  but all this      is by the way because except for a yard or two of gravel terrace      outside the windows it is all painted on the backcloth  the      marches have been at breakfast and the round table covered with      blue linen is thick with remains seven baskets full  the room is      gifted with old oak furniture there is a door stage left forward      a hearth where a fire is burning and a high fender on which one      can sit stage right middle  and in the wall below the fireplace      a service hatch covered with a sliding shutter for the passage of      dishes into the adjoining pantry  against the wall stage left is      an old oak dresser and a small writing table across the left back      corner  mrs march still sits behind the coffee pot making up her      daily list on tablets with a little gold pencil fastened to her      wrist  she is personable fortyeight trim welldressed and more      matteroffact than seems plausible  mr march is sitting in an      armchair sideways to the windows smoking his pipe and reading his      newspaper with little explosions to which no one pays any      attention because it is his daily habit  he is a finelooking man      of fifty odd with redgrey moustaches and hair both of which      stiver partly by nature and partly because his hands often push them      up  mary and johnny are close to the fireplace stage right      johnny sits on the fender smoking a cigarette and warming his back      he is a commonplace looking young man with a decided jaw tall      neat soulful who has been in the war and writes poetry  mary is      less ordinary you cannot tell exactly what is the matter with her      she too is tall a little absent fair and welllooking  she has a      small china dog in her hand taken from the mantelpiece and faces      the audience  as the curtain rises she is saying in her soft and      pleasant voice  well what is the matter with us all johnny  johnny  stuck as we were in the trencheslike china dogs  he points to the ornament in her hand  mr march  into his newspaper  damn these people  mary  if there isnt an ideal left johnny its no good pretending one  johnny  thats what im saying bankrupt  mary  what do you want  mrs march  to herself  mutton cutlets  johnny will you be in to lunch  johnny shakes his head mary  mary nods  geof  mr march  into his paper swine  mrs march  thatll be three  to herself  spinach  johnny  if youd just missed being killed for three blooming years for no spiritual result

that if ever there were a moment when it would pay us to take risks and be generousmy hat he ought to beknighted  resumes his paper  johnny  muttering  you see even dad cant suggest chivalry without talking of payment for it  that shows how weve sunk  mary  contemptuously  chivalry  pouf  chivalry was off even before the war johnny  who wants chivalry  johnny  of all shallowpated humbugthat sneering at chivalrys the worst  civilisationsuch as weve gotis built on it  mary  airily  then its built on sand  she sits beside him on the fender  johnny  sneering and smartness  pah  mary  roused  ill tell you what johnny its mucking about with chivalry that makes your poetry rotten  johnny seizes her arm and twists it  shut upthat hurts  johnny twists it more you brute johnny lets her arm go

idiots  thinking we can do without chivalry  mrs march  im doing my best to get a parlourmaid today mary but these breakfast things wont clear themselves  mary  ill clear them mother  mrs march  good  she gets up  at the door  knitting silk       she goes out  johnny  mother hasnt an ounce of idealism  you might make her see stars but never in the singular  mr march  to his paper if god doesnt open

slews the armchair towards the fire  mary  ill get your things then       she goes out  johnny  still on the fender  what do you say dad  is civilisation built on chivalry or on selfinterest  mr march  the question is considerable johnny  i should say it was built on contract and jerrybuilt at that  johnny  yes but why do we keep contracts when we can break them with advantage and impunity  mr march  but do we keep them  johnny  wellsay we do otherwise youll admit there isnt such a thing as civilisation at all  but why do we keep them  for instance why dont we make mary and mother work for us like kafir women  we could lick them into it  why did we give women the vote  why free slaves why anything decent for the little and weak  mr march  well you might say it was convenient for people living in communities  johnny  i dont think its convenient at all  i should like to make mary sweat  why not jungle law if theres nothing in chivalry  mr march  chivalry is altruism johnny  of course its quite a question whether altruism isnt enlightened selfinterest  johnny  oh  damn       the lank and shirtsleeved figure of mr bly with a pail of water      and cloths has entered and stands near the window left  bly  beg pardon mr march dyou mind me cleanin the winders here  mr march  not a bit  johnny  bankrupt of ideals  thats it       mr bly stares at him and puts his pail down by the window       mary has entered with her fathers writing materials which she puts      on a stool beside him  mary  here you are dad  ive filled up the ink pot  do be careful come on johnny       she looks curiously at mr bly who has begun operations at the      bottom of the lefthand window and goes followed by johnny  mr march  relighting his pipe and preparing his materials  what do you think of things mr bly  bly  not much sir  mr march  ah  he looks up at mr bly struck by his large philosophical eyes and motheaten moustache nor i  bly  i rather thought that sir from your writins  mr

and the other get off with a pain in his stomach  mr march  youve seen a lot i expect  bly  ah  ive been on the beach in my day  he sponges at the window its given me a way o lookin at things that i dont find in other people  look at the ome office  they got no philosophy  mr  march  pricking his ears what  have you had dealings with them  bly  over the reprieve that was got up for my daughter  but im keepin you       he swabs at the window but always at the same pane so that he does      not advance at all  mr march  reprieve  bly  ah  she was famous at eighteen  the sunday mercury was full of her when she was in prison  mr march  delicately  dear me  id no idea  bly  shes out now been out a fortnight  i always say that fames ephemereal  but shell never settle to that weavin  her head

reduced it to life  mr march  life  sweet heaven  bly  thats what i said so they give her two years  i dont hold with the sunday mercury but it put that over  its a misfortune to a girl to be goodlookin  mr march  rumpling his hair  no no  dash it all  beautys the only thing left worth living for  bly  well i like to see green grass and a blue sky but its a mistake in a uman bein  look at any young chap thats goodlookines doomed to the screen or hairdressin  same with the girls  my girl went into an airdressers at seventeen and in six months she was in trouble  when i saw er with a rope round her neck as you might say i said to meself bly i said youre responsible for this  if she adnt been goodlookinitd never eve appened       during this speech mary has come in with a tray to clear the      breakfast and stands unnoticed at the diningtable arrested by      the curious words of mr bly  mr march  your wife might not have thought that you were wholly the cause mr bly  bly  ah  my  wife  shes  passed  on  but faiththats my girls nameshe never was like er mother theres no eredity in er on that side  mr march  what sort of girl is she  bly  one for colourlikes a bit o musiclikes a dance and a flower  mary  interrupting softly  dad i was going to clear but ill come back later  mr march  come here and listen to this  heres a story to get your blood up  how old was the baby mr bly  bly  two daysardly worth mentionin  they say she ad the ighstrikes afteran when she comes to she says ive saved my babys life  an thats true enough when you come to think what that sort o baby goes through as a rule dragged up by somebody elses hand or took away by the law  what can a workin girl do with a baby born under the rose as they call it  wonderful the difference money makes when it comes to bein outside the law  mr march  right you are mr bly  gods on the side of the big battalions  bly  ah  religion  his eyes roll philosophically  did you ever read aigel  mr march  hegel or haekel  bly  yes with an aitch  theres a balance abart im that i like theres no doubt the christian religion went too far  turn the other cheek  what oh  an this antichrist neesha what came in with the warhe went too far in the other direction  neither of em practical men  youve got to strike a balance and foller it  mr march  balance  not much balance about us  we just run about and jump jim crow  bly  with a perfunctory wipe thats right we avent got a faith these days  but whats the use of tellin the englishman to act like an angel  he aint either an angel or a blond beast  hes between the two an ermumphradite  take my daughterif i was a blond beast id turn er out to starve if i was an angel id starve meself to learn her the piano  i dont do either  why  becos my instincts tells me not  mr march  yes but my doubt is whether our instincts at this moment of the worlds history are leading us up or down  bly  what is up and what is down  can you answer me that  is it up or down to get so soft that you cant take care of yourself  mr march  down  bly  well is it up or down to get so ard that you cant take care of others  mr march  down  bly  well there you are  march  then our instincts are taking us down  bly  nao  theyre strikin a balance unbeknownst all the time  mr march  youre a philosopher mr bly  bly  modestly  well i do a bit in that line too  in my opinion nature made the individual believe hes goin to live afteres dead just to keep im livin while es aliveotherwise hed a died out  mr march  quite a thoughtquite a thought  bly  but i go one better than nature  follow your instincts is my motto  mr march  excuse me mr bly i think nature got hold of that before you  bly  slightly chilled  well im keepin you  mr march  not at all  youre a believer in conscience or the little voice within  when my son was very small his mother asked him once if he didnt hear a little voice within telling him what was right  mr march touches his diaphragm  and he said i often hear little voices in here but they never say anything  mr bly cannot laugh but he smiles mary johnny must have been awfully like the government  bly  as a matter of fact ive got my daughter herein obeyance  mr march  where  i didnt catch  bly  in the kitchen  your cook told me you couldnt get hold of an ouse parlourmaid  so i thought it was just a chanceyou bein broadminded  mr

hair  observing the smile exchanged between mr march and mary  and shes quite handy with a plate  mr march  tentatively im a little afraid my wife would feel  bly  you see in this weavin shopall the girls ave ad to be in trouble otherwise they wouldnt take em  apologetically towards mary its a kind of a disorderly ouse without the disorders  excusin the young ladys presence  mary  oh  you neednt mind me mr bly  mr march  and so you want her to come here  hm  bly  well i remember when she was a little bit of a thingno higher than my kneehe holds out his hand  mr march  suddenly moved  my god

something thatll make people sit up  thats the way to send youth      to hell  how can a child whos had a rope round her neck  bly  who has been fumbling in his pocket produces some yellow papercuttings clipped together heres her referencesthe whole literature of the case  and heres a letter from the chaplain in one of the prisons sayin she took a lot of interest in him a nice young man i believe he suddenly brushes a tear out of his eye with the back of his hand i never thought i could a felt like i did over her bein in prison seemed a crool senseless thingthat pretty girl o mine  all over a baby that hadnt got used to bein alive  taint as if shed been follerin her instincts why she missed that baby something crool  mr march  of course human lifeeven an infants  bly  i know youve got to ave a close time for it  but when you come to think how they take uman life in injia and ireland and all those other places it seems ard to come down like a cartload o bricks on a bit of a girl thats been carried away by a moments abiration  mr march  who is reading the cuttings hm  what hypocrites we are  bly  ah  and oo can tell oos the father  she never give us his name  i think the better of er for that  mr march  shake hands mr bly  so do i  bly wipes his hand and mr march shakes it  loyaltys loyaltyespecially when we men benefit by it  bly  thats right sir       mary has returned with faith bly who stands demure and pretty on      the far side of the table her face an embodiment of the pathetic      watchful prison faculty of adapting itself to whatever may be best      for its owner at the moment  at this moment it is obviously best      for her to look at the ground and yet to take in the faces of mr      march and mary without their taking her face in  a moment for all      of considerable embarrassment  mr march  suddenly  well here we are       the remark attracts faith  she raises her eyes to his softly with a      little smile and drops them again  so you want to be our parlourmaid  faith  yes please  mr march  well faith can remove mountains buteri dont know if she can clear tables  bly  ive been tellin mr march and the young lady what youre capable of  show em what you can do with a plate       faith takes the tray from the sideboard and begins to clear the      table mainly by the light of nature  after a glance mr march      looks out of the window and drums his fingers on the uncleaned pane      mr bly goes on with his cleaning  mary after watching from the      hearth goes up and touches her fathers arm  mary  between him and mr bly who is bending over his bucket softly youre not watching dad  mr march  its too pointed  mary  weve got to satisfy mother  mr march  i can satisfy her better if i dont look  mary  youre right

placing of      the decanters as johnny enters by the window and comes down to his      father by the hearth  johnny  privately  if you havent begun your morning dad you might just tell me what you

dismay oh  oh  i wonder                                  curtain     act ii       a fortnight later in the marchs diningroom  a day of violent      april showers  lunch is over and the table littered

 mr march  with difficulty  erin her work i believe coming on well but the question is mr bly doerany of us ever really give satisfaction except to ourselves  bly  taking it as an invitation to his philosophical vein ah thats one as goes to the roots of uman nature  theres a lot of disposition in all of us  and what i always say is one mans disposition is another mans indisposition  mr march  by george  just hits the mark  bly  filling his sponge  question is how far are you to give rein to your disposition  when i was in durban natal i knew a man who had the biggest disposition i ever come across  e struck is wife e smoked opium e was a liar e gave all the rein e could and yet withal one of the pleasantest men i ever met  mr march  perhaps in giving rein he didnt strike you  bly  with a big wipe following his thought  he said to me once joe he said if i was to hold meself in i should be a devil theres where you get it  policemen priests prisoners  cabnet ministers any one who leads an unnatural life see how it twists em you cant suppress a thing without it swellin you up in another place  mr march  and the moral of that is  bly  follow your instincts  you seeif im not keepin younow that we aint got no faith as we were sayin the other day no ten commandments in black an whiteweve just got to be uman beins raisin cain and havin feelin hearts  whats the use of all these lofty ideas that you cant live up to  liberty fraternity equality democracysee what comes o fightin for em  ere we arewipin out the lot  we thought they was fixed stars they was only cometshot air no trust uman nature i say and follow your instincts  mr march  we were talking of your daughterii  bly  theres a case in point  her instincts was starved goin on for three years because mind you they kept her hangin about in prison months before they tried her  i read your article and i thought to meself after id finished which would i feel smallestif i wasthe judge the jury or the ome secretary  it was a treat that article they ought to abolish that inuman to be hanged by the neck until she is dead  its my belief they only keep it because its poetry that and the wigstheyre hard up for a bit of beauty in the courts of law excuse my and sir i do thank you for that article       he extends his wiped hand which mr march shakes with the feeling      that he is always shaking mr blys hand  mr march  but apropos of your daughter mr bly  i suppose none of us ever change our natures  bly  again responding to the appeal that he senses to his philosophical vein ah  but oo can see what our natures are  why ive known people that could see nothin but theirselves and their own families unless they was drunk  at my daughters trial i see right into the lawyers judge and all  there she was hub of the whole thing and all they could see of her was ow far she affected em personallyone tryin to get er guilty the other tryin to get er off and the judge summin er up coldblooded  mr march  but thats what theyre paid for mr bly  bly  ah  but which of em was thinkin eres a little bit o warm life on its own  eres a little dancin creature  whats she feelin wots er complaintimpersonallike  i like to see a man do a bit of speculatin with his mind off of imself for once  mr march  the man that hath not speculation in his soul  bly  thats right sir  when i see a mangy cat or a dog thats lost or a fellowcreature down on his luck i always try to put meself in his place  its a weakness ive got  mr march  warmly  a deuced good one  shake       he checks himself but mr bly has wiped his hand and extended it       while the shake is in progress mary returns and having seen it to      a safe conclusion speaks  mary  coming dad  mr march  excuse me mr bly i must away       he goes towards the door and bly dips his sponge  mary  in a low voice  well  mr march  mr bly is like all the greater men i knowhe cant listen  mary  but you were shaking  mr march  yes its a weakness we haveevery three minutes  mary  bubbling  dadsilly  mr march  very       as they go out mr bly pauses in his labours to catch as it were      a philosophical reflection  he resumes the wiping of a pane while      quietly behind him faith comes in with a tray  she is dressed now      in lilaccoloured linen without a cap and looks prettier than      ever  she puts the tray down on the sideboard with a clap that      attracts her fathers attention and stands contemplating the debris      on the table  bly  winders  there they are  clean dirty  all sortsall round yer winders  faith  with disgust  food  bly  ah

flower      twirls round with it held to her nose and looks at herself in the      glass over the hearth  she is still looking at herself when she      sees in the mirror a reflection of johnny who has come in  her      face grows just a little scared as if she had caught the eye of a      warder peering through the peephole of her cell door then brazens      and slowly sweetens as she turns round to him  johnny  sorry  he has a pipe in his hand and wears a norfolk jacket fond of flowers  faith  yes  she puts back the flower  ever so  johnny  stick to it  put it in your hair itll look jolly  how do you like it here  faith  its quiet  johnny  ha  i wonder if youve got the feeling i have  weve both had hell you know  i had three years of it out there and youve had three years of it

her baby from her  and after she was gone igot all worked up  she hesitates then goes swiftly on  and i looked at mine it was asleep just here quite close  i just put out my arm like that over its facequite soft i didnt hurt it  i didnt really  she suddenly swallows and her lips quiver i didnt feel anything under my arm  andand a beast of a nurse came on me and said youve smothered your baby you wretched girl  i didnt want to kill iti only wanted to save it from living  and when i looked at it i went off screaming  johnny  i nearly screamed when i saved my first german from living  i never felt the same again  they say the human race has got to go on but i say theyve first got to prove that the human race wants to  would you rather be alive or dead  faith  alive  johnny  but would

johnny utters a deep grunt  its awful the feeling you get hereso tight and chokey  people who are free dont know what its like to be shut up  if id had a proper window evenwhen you can see things

unconsciously but faith is instantly conscious of the      implication  faith  hed rather have had pennies though  its all earning working and earning  i wish i were like the flowers  she twirls the dower in her hand  flowers dont work and they dont get put in prison  johnny  putting his arm round her  never mind  cheer up  youre only a kid  youll have a good time yet       faith leans against him as it were indifferently clearly expecting      him to kiss her but he doesnt  faith  when i was a little girl i had a cake covered with sugar  i ate the sugar all off and then i didnt want the

   they stand dose together unaware that cook has thrown up the      service shutter to see  why the clearing takes so long  her      astounded head and shoulders pass into view just as faith suddenly      puts up her face  johnnys lips hesitate then move towards her      forehead  but her face shifts and they find themselves upon her      lips  once there the emphasis cannot help but be considerable      cooks mouth falls open  cook  oh       she closes the shutter vanishing  faith  what was that  johnny  nothing  breaking away look here  i didnt meani oughtnt to haveplease forget it

wrenches it open and goes out       faith still with that little halfmocking halfcontented smile      resumes the clearing of the table  she is interrupted by the      entrance through the french windows of mr march and mary struggling      with one small wet umbrella  mary  feeling his sleeve go and change dad  mr march  womens shoes  we could have made the tube but for your shoes  mary  it was your cold feet not mine dear  looking at faith and nudging him  now       she goes towards the door turns to look at faith still clearing the      table and goes out  mr march  in front of the hearth  nasty spring weather faith  faith  still in the mood of the kiss  yes sir  mr march  sotto voce in the spring a young mans fancy  ii wanted to say something to you in a friendly way

when she hears the door and quickly resumes her work  it is      mrs march who comes in and goes to the writing table left back      without looking at faith  she sits there writing a cheque while

lunatic over his paper every morning  mary  father must have opinions of his own  mrs march  he has only one whatever is is wrong  mary  he cant help being intellectual mother  mrs march  if he would only learn that the value of a sentiment is the amount of sacrifice you are prepared to make for it  mary  yes  i read that in the times yesterday  fathers much safer than johnny  johnny isnt safe at all he might make a sacrifice any day  what were they doing  mrs march  cook caught them kissing  mary  how truly horrible       as she speaks mr march comes in  mr march  i met johnny using the most poetic language  whats happened  mrs march  he and that girl  johnnys talking nonsense about wanting to save her  ive told her to pack up  mr march  isnt that rather coercive joan  mrs march  do you approve of johnny getting entangled with this girl  mr march  no  i was only saying to mary  mrs march  oh  you were  mr march  but i can quite see why johnny  mrs march  the government i suppose  mr

march  if she doesnt go johnny must  are you going to turn him out  mr march  of course not  we must reason with him  mrs march  reason with young people whose lips were glued together half an hour ago  why ever did you force me to take this girl  mr march  ruefully  one cant always resist a kindly impulse joan what does mr bly say to it  mrs march  mr bly  follow your instincts and then complains of his daughter for following them  mr march  the mans a philosopher  mrs march  before we know where we are we shall be having johnny married to that girl  mr march  nonsense  mrs march  oh geof  whenever youre faced with reality you say nonsense  you know johnnys got chivalry on the brain       mary comes in  mary  hes at the top of the servants staircase outside her room hes sitting in an armchair with its back to her door  mr march  good lord  direct action  mary  hes got his pipe a pound of chocolate three volumes of monte cristo and his old concertina  he says its better than the trenches  mr march  my hat  johnnys made a joke  this is serious  mary  nobody can get up and she cant get down  he says hell stay there till alls blue and its no use either of you coming unless mother caves in  mr march  i wonder if cook could do anything with him  mary  shes tried  he told her to go to hell  mr march  i say  and what did cook  mary  shes gone  mr march  tt  tt  this is very awkward       cook enters through the door which mary has left open  mr march  ah  cook  youre  back then  whats to be done  mrs march  with a laugh  we must devise means  cook  oh maam it does remind me so of the tantrums he used to get into dear little feller  smiles with recollection  mrs march  sharply  youre not to take him up anything to eat cook  cook  oh  but master johnny does get so hungry  itll drive him wild maam  just a snack now and then  mrs march  no cook  mindthats flat  cook  arent i to feed faith maam  mr march  gad  it wants it  mrs march  johnny must come down to earth  cook  ah  i remember how he used to fall down when he was littlehe would go about with his head in the air  but he always picked himself up like a little man  mary  listen       they all listen  the distant sounds of a concertina being played      with fury drift in through the open door  cook  dont it sound eavenly  the concertina utters a long wail                                 curtain     act iii  the marchs diningroom on the same evening at the end of a perfunctory dinner  mrs march sits at the diningtable with her back to the windows mary opposite the hearth and mr march with his back to it  johnny is not present  silence and gloom  mr march  we always seem to be eating  mrs march  youve eaten nothing  mr march  pouring himself out a liqueur glass of brandy but not drinking it  its humiliating to think we cant exist without relapses into gloom  mrs march  mary pass him the walnuts  mary  i was thinking of taking them up to johnny  mr march  looking at his watch  hes been there six hours even he cant live on faith  mrs march  if johnny wants to make a martyr of himself i cant help it  mary  how many days are you going to let him sit up there mother  mr march  glancing at mrs march  i never in my life knew anything so ridiculous  mrs march  give me a little glass of brandy geof  mr march  good  thats the first step towards seeing reason       he pours brandy into a liqueur glass from the decanter which stands      between them  mrs march puts the brandy to her lips and makes a      little face then swallows it down manfully  mary gets up with the      walnuts and goes  silence  gloom  mrs march  horrid stuff  mr march  havent you begun to see that your policys hopeless joan come  tell the girl she can stay  if we make johnny feel victoriouswe can deal with him  its just personal pridethe curse of this world both you and johnny are as stubborn as mules  mrs march  human nature is stubborn geof  thats what you easygoing people never see       mr march gets up vexed and goes to the fireplace  mr march  turning  well  this goes further than you think  it involves johnnys affection and respect for you       mrs march nervously refills the little brandy glass and again      empties it with a grimacing shudder  mr march  noticing  thats better  youll begin to see things presently       mary reenters  mary  hes been digging himself in  hes put a screen across the head of the stairs and got cooks blankets  hes going to sleep there  mrs march  did he take the walnuts  mary  no he passed them in to her  he says hes on hunger strike  but hes eaten all the chocolate and smoked himself sick  hes having the time of his life mother  mr march  there you are  mrs march  wait till this time tomorrow  mary  cooks been up again  he wouldnt let her pass  shell have to sleep in the spare room  mr march  i say  mary  and hes got the books out of her room  mrs march  dyou know what they are  the scarlet pimpernel the wide wide world and the bible  mary  johnny likes romance       she crosses to the fire  mr march  in a low voice are you going to leave him up there with the girl and that inflammatory literature all night  wheres your common sense joan       mrs march starts up presses her hand over her brow and sits down      again  she is stumped  with consideration for her defeat  have another tot  he pours it out let mary go up with a flag of truce and ask them both to come down for a thorough discussion of the whole thing on condition that they can go up again if we dont come to terms  mrs march  very well  im quite willing to meet him  i hate quarrelling with johnny  mr march  good  ill go myself  he goes out  mary  mother this isnt a coal strike dont discuss it for three hours and then at the end ask johnny and the girl to do precisely what youre asking them to do now  mrs march  why should i  mary  because its so usual  do fix on halfway at once  mrs march  there is no halfway  mary  well for goodness sake think of a plan which will make you both look victorious  thats always done in the end  why not let her stay and make johnny promise only to see her in the presence of a third party  mrs march  because shed see him every day while he was looking for the third party  shed help him look for it  mary  with a gurgle  mother id no idea you were sofrench  mrs march  it seems to me you none of you have any idea what i am  mary  well do remember that therell be no publicity to make either of you look small  you can have peace with honour whatever you decide listening  there they are  now mother dont be logical  its so feminine       as the door opens mrs march nervously fortifies herself with the      third little glass of brandy  she remains seated  mary is on her      right       mr march leads into the room and stands next his daughter then      faith in hat and coat to the left of the table and johnny pale but      determined last  assembled thus in a half fan of which mrs march      is the apex so to speak they are all extremely embarrassed and no      wonder       suddenly mary gives a little gurgle  johnny  youd think it funnier if youd just come out of prison and were going to be chucked out of your job on to the world again  faith  i didnt want to come down here  if im to go i want to go at once  and if im not its my evening out please       she moves towards the door  johnny
